 &HT;    Experts doubt a libel lawsuit would succeed

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Much of the media coverage of JonBenet Ramsey's murder
has focused on the girl's parents, who have maintained their
innocence while authorities said John and Patsy Ramsey were under
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Now that a Boulder, Colo., grand jury has declined to indict
anyone in the 6-year-old beauty queen's killing, could the Ramseys
pursue defamation suits against news organizations?
</P>
<P>
   It would be difficult, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Most states, including Colorado, have a one-year statute of
limitations on libel claims, said Tom Kelley, an attorney for The
Denver Post and other newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's death three years ago drew worldwide attention, and
the Ramseys quickly became public figures after investigators said
they were under suspicion, Kelley said.

 &HT;    Ramsey grand jury ends its probe with no charges
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ District Attorney Alex Hunter announced
Wednesday that after a year of grand jury investigation of the
killing of JonBenet Ramsey, their work is done and no one has been
indicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``No charges have been filed,'' Hunter said during a brief press
conference outside the Boulder Justice Center. ``I and my
prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence
to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been
investigated at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision may effectively end the official inquiry into the
3-year old mystery that has attracted widespread attention. Even if
police decide to continue their investigations, many believe the
grand jury was the best chance of finding justice for the slaying
of the 6-year-old beauty queen.
</P>
<P>
   One person not willing to call it quits was Colorado Gov. Bill
Owens. He vowed Wednesday to review the case and decide whether to
appoint a special prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am not presently in a position to comment on the work
of this grand jury, I do know one fact: A little girl was brutally
murdered in Boulder, Colorado, and the killer or killers remain
free today,'' Owens said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Ramsey family and their supporters, Wednesday's
announcement was received as vindication for JonBenet's parents,
John and Patsy Ramsey, who now live in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys issued a statement Wednesday night, saying ``the
Ramsey family lives in a nightmare'' and asking that the
investigation continue. ``We take no satisfaction in this result
because a child killer remains free and undetected,'' the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda McLean, a longtime family friend, said she spoke to
JonBenet's mother after the grand jury's decision. She said Patsy
Ramsey told her: ``We're thankful to God. We were on our knees
praying to God when the decision was announced. Now let's get on
with finding out who did this.''
</P>
<P>
   McLean, 65, who lives in Patsy Ramsey's hometown of Parkersburg,
Pa., said even if police stop searching for the killer, the Ramseys
have vowed to look ``until their last dollar, until their last
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision brings to a head three years of trying to
find the killer of the vivacious girl. From the start, Boulder
police and other authorities came under scrutiny and criticism, and
some believe the grand jury's decision not to indict anyone is the
culmination of bad police work and misguided efforts by the
district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's preposterous to think an intruder did all those things in
that house,'' said Craig Silverman, a former chief deputy district
attorney in Boulder. Silverman left the district attorney's office
before JonBenet was killed and has had no official standing in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman thrust blame at the present district attorney, saying,
``We haven't had many murders in Boulder, but Alex Hunter has
consistently failed to be able to put a person behind bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Other critics say police are to blame for not sealing off the
crime scene. Instead, police allowed John Ramsey to search the
home, and he found the girl's body in a basement and brought it
upstairs, compromising the crime scene and evidence, some charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a flawed case from the start. The evidence at
the crime scene was contaminated and the body was moved,'' said
William Pizzi, a law professor at the University of Colorado and a
former federal prosecutor in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The case was handed over to a grand jury after the investigation
stalled amid infighting between the police and the district
attorney's office, much of which was played out publicly through
press leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But for the past year, the grand jury of 12 Boulder residents
have met in secret, hearing from witnesses and reviewing more than
30,000 pages in the case file.
</P>
<P>
   ``The grand jurors have done their work extraordinarily well,
bringing to bear all of their legal powers and life experiences and
shrewdness,'' Hunter said during his brief remarks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Hunter's comments left several unanswered questions, which
may be addressed during an afternoon news conference today. For
instance, under state law a grand jury can vote to bring an
indictment but a district attorney can chose not to follow their
recommendation. It is unknown exactly what action was taken
Wednesday by the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet, with her pretty face and cascading blond curls, was a
rising star in child beauty pageants when she was found strangled
and beaten in the basement of her family's upscale Boulder home the
morning after Christmas Day in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey said he found her body about eight hours after his
wife found a ransom note demanding $118,000 for the girl's safe
return.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset the case stirred controversy. No crime since the
O.J. Simpson case held such a sustained fascination both for the
tabloids and the mainstream media. When Hunter made his
announcement Wednesday, it was to a throng of nearly 200
journalists from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery has created a stream of books, documentary films,
headlines and nightly news segments. There was Patsy Ramsey
speaking on CNN just days after the slaying, warning Boulder
residents a killer was on the loose. There was the autopsy
information released in February 1997, revealing indications that
JonBenet may have been sexually assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   The media attention has become a whole separate tragedy for the
family, said Patsy Ramsey's sister, Pam Paugh of suburban Atlanta.
In one moment of angst she told a reporter, ``If Geraldo Rivera
calls my sister a murderer one more time, I will probably lose my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation swirled when police experts eliminated John Ramsey
as the possible author of the 2 1/2-page ransom note, but they
would neither clear nor accuse Patsy Ramsey of writing it.
</P>
<P>
   When the Ramseys hired separate lawyers and a press relations
representative, and held off formal interviews with law enforcement
authorities, criticism and suspicion mounted.
</P>
<P>
   John Ramsey eventually came to brand the police ``a lynch mob
hiding behind the authority of police badges.'' He accused them of
failing to investigate the possibility that an intruder killed his
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1997, Hunter declared that the homicide would be
solved, charges filed and the killer vigorously prosecuted. ``We
will see that justice is served in this case,'' the district
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1997, then-Police Chief Tom Koby promised, ``Our guy
won't walk.''
</P>
<P>
   But it became apparent that the investigation was bogged down in
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, two investigators quit, having opposing opinions on
who could have killed the girl. In August 1998, detective Steve
Thomas resigned, saying the district attorney had all but joined
sides with the Ramseys and undermined attempts to investigate the
family.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Lou Smit, a retired homicide detective brought in
to work on the case, submitted his resignation, saying had
unduly persecuted the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   For all the criticism leveled at the investigation, some people
saw the grand jury announcement as the proper ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that the grand jury system works,'' said James
Peters, 50, of Boulder. ``The grand jury had access to evidence
that we never saw. I think it's right to honor the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for many people, the announcement of no indictment came
as a hollow end to a case they've been following for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is going to be disappointed. We were hoping
the grand jury would point to someone,'' said Gary Devine, 61, a
computer specialist in Boulder.

 &HT;    Video of calf shootings forces changes at dairies
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Video footage of an Okeechobee dairy
worker shooting newborn calves has led to an outcry over the way
some unwanted calves are disposed of in the dairy industry.
</P>
<P>
   Already the footage, made public this week, has led to the
drafting of new rules governing how ``cull'' animals, the name
given to unwanted or unmarketable calves, are disposed of, a
practice now completely unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Since the footage was obtained, industry codes on the unwanted
calves have been drafted, said Orlando attorney Peter Latham, who
represents Southeast Milk Inc., an association that includes nearly
all of Florida's dairy farmers. A final hearing on the rules, which
would be enforced by the state Department of Agriculture, is set
for November, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the calves' suffering in the video _ taken in
January at McArthur Farms in Okeechobee by an undercover Humane
Society investigator _ is the subject of debate, but reaction to it
has led the state attorney's office to force the dairy to tighten
its policies on how the cull animals are killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Okeechobee footage could change the way dairies across
Florida and the nation kill sick and injured calves and calves that
are birthed for the sole purpose of allowing milk-bearing cows to
continue to produce milk.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the Humane Society of the United States based on
information from the dairy industry, says that 2 million or more
such calves are killed every year, said the society's David
Kuemmerle, who works on agricultural issues.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights advocates and dairy farmers agree that's not
likely to change soon. In dairy farming, some of the calves born
each year are kept to become milk-bearing, and others are killed
later for veal. But most male calves are killed usually within a
day or two of birth. Unlike cows slaughtered for meat, there are no
rules governing how the unwanted calves are killed.
</P>
<P>
   The Humane Society dispatched investigators after getting a tip
about the calves' slaughter from a McArthur Farms worker, Kuemmerle
said. He said he didn't know how they managed to get onto the
private farms and document calf-killings, something nearly
impossible to do.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators were out of the country on another assignment
Wednesday and not available for comment, said a spokeswoman, who
added, ``I can definitely assure you that it was obtained
legally.'' Kuemmerle said the society has never obtained footage
like that from McArthur Farms.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, a worker carries live black and white calves by
their legs from a cart to a makeshift mass grave about 5 feet deep.
After either flinging or dropping the day-old calves into the
ditch, some of them try to wobble their way out of the hole on
still-shaky legs. When three or four are in the ditch, the worker
shoots them in the head one by one, then repeats the process until
about 15 lie in a heap in about a foot of rainwater. Many of the
calves' legs writhe after the shooting, prompting the worker to
shoot them again.
</P>
<P>
   Kuemmerle said he fears that many of the unwanted calves suffer
during execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the animals were obviously still alive after being
shot,'' Kuemmerle said. ``The animals seemed to be left unattended.
Many of them are struggling to keep their heads above the water.
This is after they had been shot. So certainly it is conceivable
that some of these animals were buried alive.''
</P>
<P>
   But McArthur Farms attorney, T. Charles Shafer of Fort Pierce,
said that the movement of the animals after the shootings is
``neurological function,'' according to large animal veterinarians
he has consulted. The Humane Society is trying to shock people to
try to make a point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the shock value wears off ... it's not what it appears to
be at first glance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the dairy acknowledged that the worker violated its
policy at the time, which was simply to shoot the calves
point-blank in the center of the forehead. He said the dairy agreed
to enter into a pretrial intervention agreement _ a disciplinary
measure in lieu of criminal prosecution _ ``to put it behind
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're a corporate entity, you have to take
responsibility for the negligence of your employees and that's what
McArthur Farms did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the dairy to ``support and actively
assist in the passage of legislation designed to provide for the
human euthanasia of sick and cull animals,'' and to host and
participate in a training program on the matter. Until statewide
rules are enacted, the dairy has to adopt policies for humane
treatment, including where to hold the weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant State Attorney Nikki Robinson, who worked the case,
said the agreement was preferable to prosecution because it will
probably yield results more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Kuemmerle said he hopes rules are on the books soon as a result
of the footage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that this is what the public needs to see,'' he said.
``We refer to this as one of the industry's dirty little secrets.
We want people to know where the food they purchase comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   Latham, who said even he was shocked at first by the McArthur
Farms footage but said the calves probably didn't suffer much,
acknowledged a ``void'' in the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an initial shock value that everyone needs from time
to time _ that everything we do has consequences.''

 &HT;    R. Martinez regroups
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A season that began with his audition for a set of
suspicious scouts in the Dominican Republic, that continued with
minor-league sentences to City of Palms (Fla.), Sarasota, Lowell
(Mass.) and Pawtucket, comes full circle tonight for Ramon
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months after his right rotator cuff was surgically
repaired, Martinez starts in Game 2 of the ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``(There's) a difference in my velocity maybe, but everything
else, it is there,'' Martinez said. ``I can throw all my pitches. I
don't have any kind of problem with my arm. And I feel better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In four September starts, Martinez went 2-1 with a 3.05 ERA,
allowing 14 hits while striking out 15 in 20 2/3 innings. He has
never faced the New York Yankees, but pitched effectively in Game 3
of the Division Series with Cleveland (two runs, five hits, six
strikeouts in 5 2/3 innings) and was an easy choice for manager
Jimy Williams to start tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got progessively better with each of his starts,'' Williams
said. ``I think he has got his trunks under him, got good legs. And
even though he pitched seven innings a couple times, I didn't think
he was tired. So experience-wise, you go with the man, you know?
Believe in him.''
</P>
<P>
   LEYRITZ ODD MAN OUT
</P>
<P>
   October rolls on without one of its former heroes. Jim Leyritz
was left off the Yankees' ALCS roster.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill started in right field Wednesday night, but because
he has a broken rib, Yankees manager Joe Torre, faced with a
potential outfielder shortage, dropped Leyritz, kept rookie
outfielder Clay Bellinger and added Shane Spencer. Leyritz was
0-for-2 in the Division Series and hit .185 in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult,'' said Torre. ``I mean, even though
Jimmy struggled toward the end of the season, that didn't keep me
from going to him in Games 1 and 2 against Texas in situations. So
I just felt with O'Neill's possible condition, that if we happen to
lose him _ which I don't even want to think about _ I needed
another outfielder.''
</P>
<P>
   MERCK PLAYS FALL BALL
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 starter Kent Mercker is back in October after a
three-year absence. He appeared in both the 1991 and 1995 World
Series for the Braves and the following year pitched for two
playoff teams (Baltimore and Cleveland) but was left off the
Indians' postseason roster. He joined the Red Sox on Aug. 24 in a
trade with St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a part of it,'' Mercker said of his short stint in New
England. ``Baseball is a fraternity. I have been here a short time,
but they welcomed me. I have pitched decent for them down the
stretch. I'm not going to say they needed me to win those games.
They were in a good position when I got here, but I definitely feel
a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker and outfielder Darren Lewis are the only Red Sox on the
roster with LCS experience.

DEVILS DEFEAT MIGHTY DUCKS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Devils fans who found the Yankees and
Mets more entertaining on Wednesday than the Anaheim Mighty Ducks
missed a victory but little else.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils played their second consecutive game without
inspiration _ barring the overtime in the tie at Ottawa three days
ago _ but managed a 3-2 victory over Anaheim thanks to Lyle
Odelein's game-winning goal with 7 minutes 26 seconds left, and
three spectacular saves by Martin Brodeur in the waning moments of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Odelein's first goal of the season, on a shot from the right
point, found its way over Guy Hebert's glove after it deflected off
the skate of Anaheim's Steve Rucchin, who was part of a crowd in
front of Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to put it on net and hope for a deflection or a
rebound, hoping that something would happen,'' Odelein said. ``We
didn't play too well at times, but Marty made the big saves as
usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur allowed Paul Kariya's first goal of the season in the
first period, and a soft goal to Rucchin early in the second.
Brodeur had an average game, but he got stronger as the game
progressed. It reached its zenith in the waning moments when he
denied Kariya and Teemu Selanne with spectacular saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to make a few big saves at the end,'' said Brodeur, who
made a total of 28 saves, 6 of them on Selanne and 4 on Kariya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little lucky at the end when the guy could get it
up,'' Brodeur said about his save on Kariya with 65 seconds left in
the game. ``I was looking down for my lenses and it came to me. We
were fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Holik and Sergei Brylin scored the first two goals for the
Devils (3-1-1).
</P>
<P>
   Kariya, who has 39 goals last season, and Selanne are two of the
most dangerous scorers in the National Hockey League, but the
Devils kept them at bay for the most part thanks primarily to
effective play by the defensive pairing of Odelein and Scott
Niedermayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun playing against their best players,'' Odelein said.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was announced at 11,109, but it seemed much smaller at
a rather quiet Continental Arena, where the Devils also played
before about 5,000 empty seats in their previous home game, the 1-0
victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning last Saturday night. &QL;

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATLANTA _ You scan his statistics, going back to rookie league in
1986. Under the ``SV'' column, you find nothing but zeros.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz had never saved a game in his professional career
before Wednesday. Secretly, he had always wanted to, it turns out,
but nobody had ever given him the chance to try.
</P>
<P>
   That changed against the Mets. He got the word to manager Bobby
Cox he had an inning in him, if it was needed. And Cox decided to
give him one _ the ninth, with the Braves clinging somewhat
precariously to a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different feeling,'' Smoltz said, admitting the
experience of preserving Kevin Millwood's victory for a 2-0 Atlanta
lead with the National League Champ Series heading to New
York had left him ``numb.''
</P>
<P>
   Nauseous also. He joked about looking for a place to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to build momentum as a starting pitcher,'' said
Smoltz, who has started 356 major-league games for the Braves,
winning 157 of them and going the full nine innings 47 times. ``You
try to go nine. In relief, it's all or nothing. You come out
throwing as hard as you can. There is no room for error. I've
gained a far greater appreciation for what those guys (in the
bullpen) go through.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I ran out there, I really wasn't sure what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans were in a frenzy, and Smoltz's heart was caught in his
throat. He found the extreme intensity of the situation startling,
but he calmed himself down, once he made pinch hitter Shawon
Dunston pop out leading off. He is John Smoltz, after all, a former
Cy Young Award winner with a 12-3 record in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I knew,'' he said, ``is how important it was to get the
first man out.''
</P>
<P>
   The second and third followed in short order. Roger Cedeno
grounded to short, and Bobby Bonilla, pinch hitting for Rey
Ordonez, struck out without ever taking the bat off his shoulder.
As much as Bonilla hates Mets manager Bobby Valentine, you'd almost
suspect collusion, except two of the three called strikes
definitely appeared to miss the outside corner.
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly where Smoltz wanted them. If he caught a break
from umpire Jeff Kellogg, then he caught a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to give him (Bonilla) anything over the
plate,'' he said. ``If he hit the outside pitch for a single, then
he hit a single. I didn't want him hitting a pitch over the plate
for a double.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the portly Bonilla simply stood there, looking like a
Buddha-esque statue.
</P>
<P>
   Has Smoltz been reincarnated as a fireman? Will he be the second
coming of Dennis Eckersley, a successful starter who reinvented
himself as the game's premier reliever?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he replied. ``I still prefer to start. But everything in
my career from here on out is gravy. I'll do whatever I can to
contribute, whatever it takes to help us keep winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end, he resumes his normal role Saturday. He starts
Game 4 at Shea, as scheduled. If Tom Glavine can best Al Leiter on
Friday, Smoltz will be trying to pitch the Braves to a sweep and
their first appearance in the World Series since they lost to the
Yankees in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gravy? Three months ago, Smoltz said, ``I wasn't sure I'd throw
again this season.''
</P>
<P>
   He had to go on the disabled list twice _ May 17-June 1 and July
5-24 _ with elbow pain. He ultimately returned to the rotation with
a new three-quarter-arm delivery but was still throwing in the
mid-90s. He hit 96 mph on the radar gun against Dunston, proof of
the adrenaline streaming through his wired body.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the bullpen in the fifth inning, but it didn't occur
to him he would be asked to pitch the ninth until he was actually
summoned. Cox, for his part, admitted he wouldn't have risked
wasting Smoltz under any other circumstances, such as a tie game.
Special circumstances dictated a special role.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's regular closer, John Rocker, had worked a demanding 1
innings in Game 1, then come on in relief of Millwood in the
eighth, striking out his personal pigeon, John Olerud, and Robin
Ventura to again hold the Mets at bay.
</P>
<P>
   Asking one more inning of Rocker, however, would have been
pressing his luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``John has been pitching an awful lot,'' Smoltz observed. ``He
deserved the save today, not me. I was glad just to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz appeared to feel self-conscious about taking a
front-and-center role in the pen. Afterward, he repeatedly heaped
praise on Atlanta's regular relievers, saying: ``They've had an MVP
year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But if you are Bobby Cox and you have a John Smoltz available to
you under such circumstances, you don't worry about hurting
anyone's feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, he had called upon Millwood and Greg Maddux to relieve
in Game 3 against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pitch for our club,'' Smoltz noted, ``you have to check
your ego at the door. We have so many great pitchers on this
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Versatile ones, too, apparently.

SPORTS COLUMN: DUQUETTE HAS THE RED SOX IN HIS BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 3rd graf for updating)  (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most baseball general managers are strangers in town.
Most are hired to assemble a team for a franchise they know only
from the standings. To them, one city is not that much different
from any other. They sit at their office desk or in the ballpark.
It's their job, but no fan emotion is involved, no attachment to
the franchise history. No blood, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette is different.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees won Wednesday night's opener of the
American League Championship Series, 4-3, the Red Sox's general
manager watched what he had hoped to see since he was growing up in
the Berkshires near Pittsfield, Mass., where the Red Sox had a farm
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to play the Yankees for the pennant ever since I
was 10,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, he remembered going to Fenway Park with his father and
his older brother Dennis in 1967, the year the Red Sox lost the
World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. He remembered players he
had seen in Wahconah Park in Pittsfield who went on to play for the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Scott was the first,'' he said. ``Billy Conigliaro,
Sparky Lyle, Carlton Fisk.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1978, while an English literature major at Amherst, where
he caught Jeff Reardon, he was in Fenway Park when Bucky Dent hit
the home run that will always haunt Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting behind home plate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when it appeared that the Red Sox were about to win the
World Series against the Mets at Shea Stadium, he was the Milwaukee
Brewers' scouting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother called late that Saturday night,'' he remembered,
``and told me, `All we need is two more outs from Schiraldi.'''
</P>
<P>
   To him and his brother, ``we'' meant the Red Sox, but Calvin
Schiraldi never got those two outs. Mookie Wilson's grounder rolled
through first baseman Bill Buckner's legs; the Mets won that sixth
game and the seventh game. Another haunting memory for the Red Sox
and Dan Duquette, but he continued to climb baseball's front-office
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he was hired as the Montreal Expos' general manager, the
major leagues' youngest at the time. Early in 1994 he moved to the
Red Sox in the job he had always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   His autocratic style could be alienating. He kicked the Red Sox
icon and longtime coach Johnny Pesky upstairs. He talked to beat
writers only in a weekly conference call. After the 1996 season, he
described Roger Clemens as being ``in the twilight of his career.''
Clemens departed as a free agent to Toronto, where he earned two Cy
Young Awards. Before the 1997 season, Duquette hired Jimy Williams,
who has now managed the Red Sox to their first consecutive
postseason appearances since 1914-1915 when Babe Ruth was a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jimy from when he was Bobby Cox's first lieutenant with
the Braves, who shared a spring training facility with the Expos,''
he said. ``He knows how to bring young players along. When we lost
our closer, Tom Gordon, he did a great job of stabilizing this
team. And he had been a good manager in Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season, Duquette startled baseball by signing
free agent Pedro Martinez to a six-year, $75 million contract. He
knew all about the Dominican right-hander. As the Expos' boss, he
had obtained Martinez from Los Angeles in a trade for second
baseman Delino DeShields after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 Pedro had a Cy Young year with the Expos that was
almost unparalleled,'' Duquette said. ``He was the first
right-hander since Walter Johnson in 1912 to have an ERA under two
and to strike out over 300.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 19-7 record, Martinez led the Red Sox to the 1998 wild
card, but after they lost to Cleveland in the division series, Mo
Vaughn, their popular slugger, departed as a free agent to the
Anaheim Angels. Without him, the Red Sox were not considered a
contender this season. But they earned the wild card, then stunned
the Indians in the division series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for the Red Sox,'' Duquette said, ``is not
whether we can put a good team out there, but whether the team can
withstand the movement of star players. We can do it. We've done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anybody else, Pedro Martinez has helped them do it.
With a 23-4 record, a 2.40 ERA and 313 strikeouts, he will be voted
another Cy Young Award, if not the most valuable player award.
Monday night in Cleveland, his six no-hit innings in relief put the
Red Sox into this best-of-7 showdown with the Yankees for the AL
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since Dan Duquette was 10, that's all he has wanted.

 &HT;    Williams homer gives Yankees extra boost
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams homered off Boston's Rod Beck leading
off the bottom of the 10th inning Wednesday night to give the New
York Yankees a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox in Game 1 of the
American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The win, on a rainy night in the Bronx, extended the Yankees'
postseason winning streak to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Scott Brosius had a homer, a triple and a single in
his first four at-bats but the Yankees, highly favored against the
wild-card Red Sox, never led through the first nine.
</P>
<P>
   New York finally caught up in the seventh, when Red Sox reliever
Derek Lowe inherited a 3-2 lead from Rich Garces after he had
thrown two hitless innings. But Brosius, the first man Lowe faced,
singled and was advanced to second on a Chuck Knoblauch sacrifice
bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter next sent a soft single into right field, which
rookie Trot Nixon sent back to the plate on one hop and in plenty
of time to catch Brosius. But catcher Jason Varitek never gloved
the throw off the rain-slicked grass and was then wiped out by
Brosius' slide, tying it 3-3. Lowe let two more runners reach
scoring position before striking out Chili Davis to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Former Brave Kent Mercker, in the first ALCS start of his
career, was used up after four innings. He threw 83 pitches to 20
hitters, allowing six hits, including a two-run Brosius homer, but
Boston still held a 3-2 lead when he was pulled for Garces.
</P>
<P>
   New York starter Orlando Hernandez, after allowing seven of the
first 10 men he faced to reach base, settled down to permit just
three hits from the third through the eighth, when he was removed
for Mariano Rivera. He faced the minimum over his last four
innings, and two of the three runs he allowed were earned.
</P>
<P>
   The most dominant force on the field early was Boston shortstop
Nomar Garciaparra, who twice took away New York runs with his
glove. He made a leaping catch of a Davis liner with two men on to
end the first inning before following it up with a running leap to
take down Tino Martinez's liner with two men on to end the third.
</P>
<P>
   The first two innings took 55 minutes to complete, proving only
that both teams were tight, if not sloppy. Jeter took advantage of
the first ALCS grounder hit to him at shortstop by throwing down
the right field line on an attempted force-out at second.
</P>
<P>
   That led to an unearned run, with Jose Offerman scoring from
first on the play. One batter later, the lead became 2-0 following
Brian Daubach's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's advantage stretched to 3-0 the next inning when, with
Darren Lewis on third, Offerman bounced a soft grounder to the
right of the mound. Hernandez made a weak pass at it, third baseman
Brosius could not cut it off and by the time Jeter caught up with
in on the edge of the grass, Lewis had scored and Offerman was
standing on first.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees cut it to 3-2 in the bottom of the second. After
Shane Spencer sent a two-out single to left. Brosius, the World
Series MVP last fall, worked a full count against Mercker before
launching a two-run homer to left field. The homer was Brosius'
first of this postseason but his fifth in 16 career postseason
games.

 &HT;    Cox outfoxes 'em
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The postseason was supposed to give the Mets a clean
slate in their quest to unseat the Braves. Somebody forgot to tell
the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were bemoaning the same tired story by the end of their
4-3 loss at Turner Field on Wednesday. Atlanta now leads the
National League Championship Series two games to none as the teams
head to New York for Game 3 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the sixth inning, the Mets had a 2-0 lead on Kevin
Millwood. Their starter, Kenny Rogers, was coasting. And their lead
had temporarily stalled the Braves' foam tomahawk-chopping fans.
</P>
<P>
   But it wouldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Managerial moves on both sides changed the flow of the game
beginning in the sixth. The decision of Mets manager Bobby
Valentine to leave Rogers in led to a four-run inning for the
Braves, while Braves manager Bobby Cox used John Rocker and John
Smoltz in relief to secure the team's first 2-0 lead in an NLCS
since 1995, when they swept the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to go out and try to kick them when they're down,''
said Brian Jordan, whose two-run homer tied the score 2-2. ``We
know the Mets are not going to quit. They're going to come at us
hard, and we have to be prepared to go at them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' sixth started with a Chipper Jones walk to end his
nine-pitch standoff with Rogers. It ended with Valentine beating
himself up for leaving Rogers in long enough to give up a single to
Andruw Jones and a home run to Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no reason to keep him in,'' Valentine said. ``It was ...
absolutely the wrong move.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets' lead evaporated, so did the quiet that had fallen
over the crowd of 44,624, considerably less than capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden Brian Jordan hits a ball out and everybody
gets invigorated,'' Chipper Jones said. ``Then Eddie gets his
homer. Man. This place was loud.''
</P>
<P>
   It fell silent again in the eighth. An error by Chipper Jones
and a double by Edgardo Alfonzo cut the lead to 4-3. But the Braves
called on Rocker, who came up large for the fourth consecutive
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, 0-for-9 in his career against Rocker, struck out
flinging as he lost his grip swinging at a slider. After an
intentional walk to Mike Piazza, Rocker struck out Robin Ventura to
end the eighth with the tying run at second.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz, making his first relief appearance after 379
major-league starts, retired the Mets in the ninth for the save.

HOECHST EXPECTED TO ANNOUNCE FATE OF 1,650 JOBS IN KC AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH and MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ An announcement about the future of Hoechst
Marion Roussel in Kansas City is imminent, coming perhaps by the
weekend, and the news may not be good.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are the jobs of about 1,650 area employees of Hoechst
Marion, the pharmaceutical arm of German chemical giant Hoechst AG.
Hoechst AG and Rhone-Poulenc SA of France are merging their
pharmaceutical units to form Aventis SA, which will be the world's
largest drug company.
</P>
<P>
   One of the unanswered questions raised by the merger is the
effect on Kansas City, where Hoechst Marion has roughly 1,000
employees at its North American headquarters and extensive
manufacturing operations that employ about 700 others.
</P>
<P>
   The merger could result in the Kansas City headquarters moving
to Bridgewater, N.J., where Hoechst and other major drug companies
have major operations, or to Collegeville, Pa., the North American
headquarters of the Rhone-Poulenc Rorer pharmaceutical unit.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Roos, president of the Somerset County Chamber of
Commerce in New Jersey, said company officials tentatively had
scheduled a news conference there Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not heard anything officially,'' Roos said. ``But they
have spent a tremendous amount of resources here. Many of us
anticipate that the company would like to be near other companies
in its industry. We have not heard anything official. There is
gossip, and they have unofficially scheduled a news conference.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rouse, a Hoechst Marion spokesman in Kansas City, said
Hoechst was working on many decisions related to the merger, which
is expected to be completed in December. He said an announcement on
the North American headquarters could come any time. He would not
elaborate on plans for a Friday news conference in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia a television news report this week indicated
that 900 Hoechst Marion jobs might be moving from Kansas City to
Collegeville, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not accurate,'' Rouse said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Kansas City Area Development Council and at the
office of Mayor Kay Barnes said they had not been notified of an
impending announcement. The city established a tax-increment
financing district to assist development of the south Kansas City
complex.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant's report conducted before the merger announcement
last year estimated that the combination could result in job cuts
totaling about 11,000 worldwide and the closing of more than half
of the combined company's production facilities. In 1997 the two
companies had about 95,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   In February a state delegation went to Bridgewater in hopes of
retaining at least part of the local Hoechst Marion operation,
which is the remaining corporate legacy of the late Ewing Marion
Kauffman, former Royals owner, philanthropist and founder of Marion
Laboratories Inc.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to move Hoechst Marion jobs from Kansas City would
follow closely upon the recent news that MCI WorldCom plans to buy
Sprint Corp., the area's biggest private employer. An MCI-Sprint
merger, if approved, raises questions about possible job cuts and
the future of Sprint's new campus under construction in Overland
Park, Kan.

 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The underdog Boston Red Sox, who might need a little
bit of luck to beat the New York Yankees in the American League
Championship Series, were victimized by an umpire's call in the top
of the 10th inning. Then Bernie Williams finished them off in the
bottom of the 10th, just a few ticks past midnight early Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams crushed a leadoff home run against Rod Beck, snapping a
3-3 tie in Game 1 at Yankee Stadium. Orlando Hernandez allowed all
the Red Sox runs in the first two innings, then shut out Boston
over his last six innings of work, before Mariano Rivera pitched
the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone will pitch the second game of the four-of-seven-game
series on Thursday night at the Stadium, against Boston's Ramon
Martinez. Cone has had 11 days of rest since his last start. The
last time he had that much rest, he pitched a perfect game, against
the Montreal Expos July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman opened the Boston 10th with a line single to
right. John Valentin followed with a grounder to third, a possible
double-play ball; Scott Brosius fielded and threw to second, where
Chuck Knoblauch set himself to pivot, with Offerman bearing down on
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Brosius' throw went in and out of the webbing of Knoblauch's
glove, and the 57,181 fans umpiring from the stands groaned
together at the apparent mistake. The one umpire who counted,
however, Rick Reed, called Offerman out, ruling that Knoblauch had
dropped the ball as he got it from his glove. Jimy Williams, the
Boston manager, argued with Reed, without luck. Instead of having
first and second and nobody out, the Red Sox had one out and a
runner at first, and the next batter rolled into an inning-ending
double play.
</P>
<P>
   Beck relieved for the Red Sox in the bottom of the 10th, and
Williams, leading off, crushed his second pitch to straightaway
center field, where Boston's Darren Lewis turned, stopped and
watched. When the ball disappeared over the wall, Williams thrust
his fist into the air, and the crowd exploded simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The calm demeanor of Hernandez instills confidence in his
teammates, in his manager. Hernandez passed Joe Torre in the
clubhouse the other day, smiled and waved, and Torre wished
Hernandez a happy birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't care how old you are,'' Torre said, referring to
Hernandez's publicly fluid age, and Hernandez laughed.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque strolled confidently across the field before the game,
stopping to pluck a piece of grass and toss it to see which way the
wind was blowing, as relaxed as chipping on the 10th hole on a
Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox changed all that quickly. Right after
Hernandez's first pitch, Boston's Offerman glared toward Hernandez.
It appeared words were exchanged, and the home-plate umpire, Tim
McClelland, stepped in. Four pitches later, Offerman lined a single
through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin pulled a grounder toward the shortstop hole, where
Derek Jeter ranged to his right, backhanded the ball _ a
spectacular play, to that point _ jumped, twisted, threw toward
second, and into right field. Offerman wheeled around the bases as
Paul O'Neill chased down the ball along the right-field line, and
Valentin reached third.
</P>
<P>
   Then Brian Daubach dumped Hernandez's next pitch into right
field, a single, Valentin scored. Seven pitches into the game,
Hernandez already had allowed more runs than he had in three
previous post-season starts combined, and the Red Sox had scored
more runs than the Texas Rangers had against the Yankees in the
first round of the playoffs. Right away, Boston marked its
presence.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked the leadoff batter, Lewis, in the second
inning, to deep-throated, concerned murmurs from the crowd. Lewis
stole second and stopped at third when Trot Nixon singled sharply.
When Offerman hit a slow roller past the mound, third baseman
Brosius closed on the ball _ then let the grounder pass, thinking
Jeter would be in a better position to field it. Except that Jeter
thought Brosius would make the play.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis scored, the Red Sox led, 3-0, they had runners at first
and second and nobody out, and the Yankees looked flat.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin failed to advance the runners with nobody out and
Hernandez, as he often does, escaped further trouble and went on to
pinch off the Red Sox offense. It was a just a question of whether
the Yankees could rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Manager Jimy Williams is not a schmoozer. He doesn't like
talking about himself. He doesn't feel obligated to explain his
choices _ ``Managerial decision,'' he says, with the tone of a
security guard. He is as uncomplicated as a doorjamb, with one
simple purpose: to win baseball games. By whatever means necessary,
Williams directed the Red Sox to a division series victory over the
Cleveland Indians, using two of his starters, Bret Saberhagen and
Pedro Martinez, to win the decisive game. Ramon Martinez, who
pitched last Saturday and is coming back from shoulder surgery,
could not have pitched Wednesday night's game on shortened rest.
</P>
<P>
   So Williams turned to Kent Mercker, a left-hander only three
days removed from his last start. But Williams wasn't expecting
Mercker to throw a complete game; he just wanted Mercker to get the
Red Sox into the middle innings, preferably with a lead.
</P>
<P>
   In Mercker's time on the mound, the Yankees hit 21 foul balls,
swinging and missing just twice. But Nomar Garciaparra was playing
behind him. The Yankees had runners at second and third and two out
in the first and Chili Davis stretched to reach a changeup and hit
a hump liner over short, where Garciaparra snatched the ball with a
leap. Two runs saved.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius crushed a two-run homer off Mercker in the second
inning, and Jeter doubled leading off the third. Garciaparra nearly
picked off Jeter at second after intercepting Williams grounder in
the shortstop hole _ Jeter was far off the bag, thinking the hit
would roll through to left _ and when the throw from the Boston
shortstop got away, Jeter took third.
</P>
<P>
   But then, again with two outs, Garciaparra again soared high to
catch Tino Martinez's line drive, falling on his back. Twice
Garciaparra had prevented Jeter from scoring in the inning, first
by keeping Williams's hit in the infield, and then when he caught
Martinez's shot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox manager went to his bullpen in the fifth, Rich
Garces assuming the 3-2 lead, shutting out the Yankees for two
innings before giving way to Derek Lowe, at the start of the
seventh. Brosius greeted Lowe with a single to left and moved to
second on Knoblauch's bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter then laced a single to right, Nixon rushing the ball and
gloving it on one hop; Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third-base
coach, waved Brosius around third, a blunder, it appeared, for
Nixon's throw reached the catcher ahead of the runner.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston catcher Jason Varitek was unable to hold Nixon's
throw, the ball rolling away as Brosius _ late arriving _ crashed
into the catcher and slapped his hand on home plate. Tie game.

FEW ANSWERS IN ABDUCTION OF 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STACY DOWNS and RICHARD ESPINOZA  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ While more than 100 FBI agents and police
officers searched Wednesday for 10-year-old Pamela Butler, all
Cherri West could do was wait and hope for news about her abducted
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day _ in fact, from Tuesday evening when Pamela
was abducted in Kansas City, Kan. _ facts kept trickling to West:
</P>
<P>
   The pickup truck in which the girl was last seen was found
abandoned in Kansas City, Mo.; police fruitlessly searched an area
in Grain Valley where the truck was seen; near 10th Street and
Central Avenue in Kansas City, Kan., police spotted a man whom they
wanted to question about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite helicopters, police dogs and door-to-door searches,
there were no definitive answers about Pamela on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on, police still were looking for Keith D.
Nelson, 24, of Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's employer said later Wednesday that Nelson had access to
the company truck that police believe was used in the abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is a white man, 5 feet 7 inches tall, 200 pounds with
blue eyes. West said she did not know Nelson and had never heard of
him.
</P>
<P>
   Pamela, who was abducted about 5:45 p.m. Tuesday while skating
near her house, is a white girl, 4 feet 5 inches tall, 65 pounds,
with blond hair and blue eyes. She was wearing a white Everlast
sports bra, tan pants and in-line skates with pink straps.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hectic,'' said West, 33. ``I haven't slept, and my eyes
feel like they're 10,000 pounds. People I've never even seen before
keep coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   Strangers stopped their cars on the street in front of West's
house in the 500 block of South 11th Street and asked for news. It
was the same area where Pamela was last seen.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday evening 11-year-old Penny Butler was sitting on the
front porch of their home watching her younger sister, Pamela,
skating on their street while holding a soft drink and cookies. A
man in a white pickup stopped a few feet from Pamela, got out,
grabbed her around her waist and threw her across the driver's seat
and into the passenger seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started screaming, and so did she,'' said Penny, who yelled
for an older sister to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   Another driver wrote down the pickup's license-plate number and
chased the truck as it sped west on Kansas Avenue but lost it near
Mill Street and Southwest Boulevard. The driver said the man he was
chasing was driving with one hand and holding something down with
his other hand, although he did not see anyone else in the truck,
FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Ford pickup belongs to the foundation-repair business
where Nelson works.
</P>
<P>
   David Cunningham, Nelson's employer at DynaTech, said he was
surprised to hear that police were looking for Nelson, who has
worked at DynaTech for the last year-and-a-half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something like this is totally, totally uncharacteristic,''
Cunningham said. He said he thought it was possible that someone
stole the company truck from Nelson and abducted the girl. Nelson
might be hiding from police, Cunningham said, because he had been
in trouble with the law before.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McCormick, agent in charge of the FBI in Kansas City, said
authorities were seeking Nelson on a felony warrant from Butler,
Mo., for obstruction and assault on an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Kniest, a Missouri Department of Corrections spokesman, said
Nelson went to prison for second-degree burglary on April 23, 1996,
and was paroled on Feb. 18, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Several people called police Tuesday night after hearing about
the abduction. A maintenance worker at Grain Valley Christian
Church reported seeing a truck matching the description parked in
the church parking lot between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. He wrote down the
truck's license-plate number because he did not recognize the
vehicle, which appeared empty.
</P>
<P>
   A tracking dog and a team of divers searched a field and a pond
behind the church Wednesday but found nothing. An FBI agent brought
clothes from Pamela's room to help a dog lock onto her scent.
</P>
<P>
   The dog also tried to track the suspect from the truck, which
was dropped near 14th Street and Bales Avenue in Kansas City.
Police said it was the truck used in the abduction. Police planned
to tow the truck to an unspecified place for evidence processing.
</P>
<P>
   Police traced Nelson's whereabouts Tuesday night and found that
about 8:30 p.m. he was at his mother's house, about 10 blocks from
where the truck was found.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nelson, who identified herself as Nelson's mother, called
The Star Wednesday evening and said she did not believe her son
abducted Pamela.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never hurt nobody,'' Nancy Nelson, 43, said. ``I would
expect him to break into a place. But I would never expect him to
hurt anyone, especially a kid.'
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nelson said she saw her son after the abduction. ``He was
right here last night and the truck was out in front,'' she said.
``I know he was here until about 10:30 or 11:30. I left then and
went to my brother's because I don't have an alarm clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Wednesday, people stopped at West's home to pick up
fliers. Many cars and businesses in the neighborhood had Pamela's
picture and her description plastered on them.
</P>
<P>
   Children at Fiske Elementary School, where Pamela is a
fifth-grader, made the family cards and a multicolored
construction-paper chain.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Yadrich, Pamela's teacher, said she had a picture of
pumpkins that Pamela recently colored for her on her desk Wednesday
morning. ``It was the first thing I saw,'' Yadrich said, wiping her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   She and the school principal visited West and the family at
their two-story white frame house. Many television crews were
parked in a gravel lot next to the house in the mostly industrial
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Family members spent their time standing in front of the house,
wiping their eyes with tissues, smoking cigarettes and being
interviewed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping and praying for the best,'' said Pamela's
father, Paul Butler of Kansas City, Kan. ``My main concern is that
she's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler and West were never married and do not live together now,
Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve McBride, executive director of the local branch of the
National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said more than
3,000 children were reported missing nationally every day. An
average of 150 a year nationally are classified as stranger
abductions, he said.

SPORTS COLUMN: BERNIE WILLIAMS A SYMBOL OF THE RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 2nd and 3rd grafs for updating, rewriting)  (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would have been entirely appropriate, if
completely out of character, for Bernie Williams to have taken a
moment before the first pitch of the latest Yankee-Red Sox hoedown
Wednesday night by doffing his cap and saluting Jimy Williams and
the entire Boston bench.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to you, your well-intentioned offer and your delusions of
luring an authentic Yankee center fielder to that charming little
dump you call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only the best things to say about the Red Sox
organization,'' Williams said before thanking it by winning Game 1
of the American League Championship Series, 4-3, with a 10th-inning
home run off Rod Beck. ``We had a very nice, productive
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was one, this was a unilateral summation of what
had been a joint endeavor. Williams got $87.5 million. The Red Sox
wound up with a .240 hitter, Darren Lewis, in center field as
opposed to Wednesday night's hero.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was talking about a sit-down with Jimy Williams, the
Red Sox manager, in Atlanta last November, which preceded a $91
million offer to the free-agent center fielder when the Yankees, at
the time, were asking him to survive on $30 million less.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after the Yankees experienced a bout of temporary
insanity and unsuccessfully pursued Albert Belle, they upped the
ante for their placid, homegrown star, who was practically pleading
with them to not make him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the rivalry and the fans, that would have been
something I would've had to deal with had I gone,'' Bernie Williams
said. ``But you start to think about playing for an organization,
how it works, and that makes it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Williams knew the Yankees were truly the better fit,
the more fashionable locale. George Steinbrenner realized his
hard-line bluff was called. The Red Sox recognized they had lost to
the Yankees one more time.
</P>
<P>
   They have always been an American League afterthought, one
crucial little detail that too often gets overlooked when people
begin to rhapsodize Yankees-Red Sox as the best rivalry in sports.
The Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, that
was a rivalry. The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys at
least took turns beating each other in important postseason games.
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier battered each other silly. When
Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert played in the final of a Grand
Slam, you didn't sleep easily after betting the mortgage on the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Russians won a couple of Olympic basketball gold medals
by directly beating the United States. When the World Series
tabulation in the last 81 years is Yankees 24, Red Sox 0, what we
are talking about is less a definitive rivalry and more a case of
one invading army occupying the territory of another.
</P>
<P>
   Passions run deep, even if the results are one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn about the Yankees and the Red Sox the first time you
come in here,'' Bernie Williams said. ``I remember one year, I
think it was '93, we opened here against Boston and Roger Clemens
was their starter. It was amazing to see the fans, the
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Clemens is emotionally unplugged from New
England, having defected to the Yankees, by way of Toronto. He
believed he had to put his money on the Yankees to finally get him
a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys in here, they expect to win,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, after all their disappointments, it would
surely be sweeter for Red Sox fans if they could somehow win at the
expense of Clemens. John Valentin is the only player left from when
Clemens was in Boston, but he's a friend. That is another angle
that gets distorted in the rush to create the event of the decade
every other month. This is not personal. It's all about uniforms
and history.
</P>
<P>
   Their overall pitching is typically shallow. Their payroll isn't
as large. But it would be a wonderful boost to the propagandists if
the Red Sox could finally beat the Yankees, deprive Clemens of a
World Series, and the Yankees of the chance to stamp the century
with their 25th World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have much to lose, so the pressure's on them. If the
Red Sox can claw their way to Game 7, they would likely have Pedro
Martinez and the indisputable edge.
</P>
<P>
   They've had their feel-good years, the Red Sox have. Four World
Series since 1918. A couple of ACLS appearances in the late 1980s
when the Yankees were Cleveland, an All-Star lineup with a 10-cent
staff. But the World Series tally is what it is. The one-game
playoff in 1978 stands as a nine-inning synopsis of Boston's
endless pursuit of the Yankees, like the Road Runner cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now they finally meet in the postseason. It's time for the Red
Sox to stand up and win. The so-called best rivalry in sports can't
be a rout.
</P>

CROSS-TRAINING BOXER NOW TEAM'S TOP RUNNER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DONALD EMMONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Running long distances is necessary
training for boxing but not necessarily an enjoyable part of the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   However, Agustin Molina, a two-time defending area Golden Gloves
champion, always has enjoyed running as an aspect of training for
boxing.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Molina's fondness for running has led him to
running miles at a time as the No. 1 runner on the Grand Prairie
High School cross country team this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked running, and I've become more dedicated over
the years,'' Molina said.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Prairie junior isn't the best distance runner in the
area. Nonetheless, the dual-sport competitor consistently has
crossed the finish line as the Gophers' top runner this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that if I'm going to train (for boxing), I might as
well have fun, so I decided to run cross country,'' Molina said.
``It's kept my legs in shape, and they don't get weary when I'm
boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand Prairie cross country coach Kelley Turley isn't surprised
about Molina running in the No. 1 spot this season. Considering he
was a key member of the Gophers' regional-qualifying team as a
freshman, she saw early on how the 119-pound Molina was light on
his feet and showed exceptional stamina.
</P>
<P>
   However, after missing nearly half the Gophers' meets last
season because of conflicts with his boxing schedule, Turley wasn't
sure Molina was committed to cross country other than using the
sport as a training tool for boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ran well as a freshman, but last year as a sophomore he was
kind of off because he missed several meets and that included the
district meet,'' Turley said. ``This year he's turned it on. He's
much more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina, who fights in the 119-pound United States amateur boxing
open division, recently posted a top-10 finish in cross country at
the Country Day Invitational and a top-20 showing at the Martin
Invitational in Arlington. Molina admits he has increased his
intensity for cross country from last season.
</P>
<P>
   The change was a result of a simple conversation with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad told me if I'm going to compete in cross country I
might as well go all the way and not just half way,'' Molina said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since then, Molina has approached cross country the same
way he approaches boxing. He runs every morning and has missed only
one meet this season because of boxing.
</P>
<P>
   No one has appreciated Molina's dedication to running this fall
more than Turley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of concerned about him, but it's been working out
well this year,'' Turley said. ``He is very focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina will lead the Gophers into the Lewisville Invitational
this weekend. The meet gives him an opportunity to run against
several of his District 5-5A opponents. The event also serves as a
gauge for the Gophers' top runner in terms of reaching his main
goal this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making regionals is my goal,'' Molina said. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday rejected a treaty banning
all underground nuclear testing in a 48-51 vote that crushed one of
President Clinton's major foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, largely along
party lines, failed to gain a simple majority, let alone the
two-thirds vote needed for ratification. It gave conservative
Republicans a victory after a weeklong power play among Senate
Republicans, Democrats and the White House over a proposal to
forestall the defeat of the treaty by delaying action until after
President Clinton left office.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, Clinton called the
Republican leader, Trent Lott, two hours before the vote and asked
that he delay action for national security reasons. In a blunt
rebuff, Lott said the president had offered too little, too late,
and he pushed ahead with an action that he knew would humiliate
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the Senate had defeated a major
international security pact since the Treaty of Versailles,
creating the League of Nations, failed to win Senate approval in
1920. While the Senate and White House often joust on legislation
governing domestic issues, senators of both parties usually defer
to the president in matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Clinton, speaking on the White House lawn,
denounced the rejection by the Senate as a ``reckless'' and
``partisan'' act, and said that he would continue to pursue a ban
on testing. ``I assure you the fight is far from over,'' he said.
``When all is said and done, the United States will ratify the
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No constitutional obligation has been treated so cavalierly,
so casually, as this treaty,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, the
Democratic leader.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the treaty to clear the Senate raised serious
questions about its survival. Supporters in Washington and abroad
had contended that if it was not adopted by the United States,
other nations with nuclear capability, ranging from Pakistan and
India to Russia and China, would follow suit, denying the 1996
treaty the 44 ratifications it needs to go into force. The leaders
of Britain, France and Germany had urged the Senate to postpone the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the treaty's demise dealt the United States a
diplomatic embarrassment that sends a perilous signal to nations
with emerging nuclear programs, like Pakistan and India, that more
testing is acceptable. ``This is a significant step backward in the
effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons,'' said Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   But to its critics, the ban would freeze an accord-abiding
United States dangerously in place while states like North Korea
and Iran, or even China and Russia, cheated and conducted
clandestine tests that eroded America's nuclear deterrent. ``This
won't make any difference to countries who are determined to be
part of the nuclear club,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who is
a staunch arms control advocate.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Lott declared that the Senate and the president
were ``coequal partners'' in the treaty-making process. ``The fact
that the Senate has rejected several significant treaties this
century underscores the important quality control function that was
intended by the framers of the Constitution,'' he said. ``The
Founding Fathers never envisioned that the Senate would be a rubber
stamp for a flawed treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters vowed to bring it up again, although Senate
and administration aides said that was unlikely this year or next.
In a telephone interview, the president's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, said, ``Our job now is to reassure the world
that the United States continues to ascribe to the principles in
the treaty and the testing moratorium.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty was signed by the United States in 1996 and sent to
the Senate a year later. So far, 26 of the 44 nations considered to
have nuclear capability have approved the pact, including Britain,
France and Japan. But Russia and China have yet to ratify it,
signaling that they would take their lead from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed a moratorium on underground nuclear
tests in 1992, complementing a treaty banning atmospheric tests
adopted in 1963. To maintain the safety and reliability of the
aging arsenal now, the government employs a $4.5 billion annual
program of sophisticated computer models and non-nuclear explosive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the treaty had been stalled in the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman, Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., was locked in a fight with the administration over two
other treaties that he wanted to kill before taking up the test
ban.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when Senate Democrats threatened to tie up the Senate floor
unless Republicans held hearings and a vote on the treaty, Lott
abruptly called their bluff and scheduled a vote. Very quickly, it
became clear that supporters did not have the votes to pass the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Clinton and Senate Democrats focused all their
efforts on getting Lott to pull the treaty from the Senate
calendar. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, all urged the Senate to delay action on the vote
for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton refused to meet Republicans' demand that he give an
ironclad promise not to bring up the treaty for the rest of his
presidency. He said this would jeopardize his administration's
efforts to curb the spread of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Senators said on Wednesday that the high-stakes brinkmanship
forced Lott and Daschle into inescapable procedural corners. On
Tuesday night, the two leaders reached a tentative deal to postpone
any floor action on the treaty until the next Congress took office
in 2001. Committees would hold hearings on the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle agreed to those terms except in ``extraordinary
circumstances,'' as defined by the two leaders, effectively giving
Lott veto power over when the treaty could be brought up.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican hard-liners, including Helms, Jon Kyl of Arizona
and Paul Coverdell of Georgia, objected, contending that Democrats
could use that ``loophole,'' in Kyl's words, against Republicans as
a campaign issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the talks collapsed and the two leaders hardened
their stances on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a run at it yesterday, but we just couldn't get
there,'' Lott said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put my best offer forward, and we're prepared to have the
vote,'' Daschle told reporters on Wednesday morning. ``We expect
that this should be and will be a national issue next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the decision to go forward with the treaty rested
squarely with Lott, who, as majority leader, controls the Senate
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the treaty to a vote on Wednesday, Lott first moved the
Senate from its regular legislative business to what is called the
executive calendar, where treaties and nominations are placed. This
procedural move requires a simple majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Such votes are typically tests of party loyalty, and Wednesday
was no different. Senators voted 55 to 45 in a partisan vote to
move to the executive calendar.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott had not made such a motion, the treaty would have been
bottled up indefinitely and effectively killed. Even so, Lott had
the power to free individual Republicans who opposed the treaty but
sought to delay action on it to vote against him without
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Republican, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, who
supported postponing action, said he would have voted against the
procedural motion if Lott had given his blessing. But Lott said in
the hallway interview that he refused to grant any such privileges.
</P>
<P>
   A letter urging Mr. Lott and Daschle to postpone a vote on the
treaty ultimately gained 62 signatures, including those of 24
Republicans. But all those Republicans put a higher priority on
supporting their leader.
</P>
<P>
   The party line vote largely extended to the the treaty itself.
Only four Republicans _ Smith of Oregon, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, James Jeffords of Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode
Island _ joined 44 Democrats in favor of the pact. Sen. Robert
Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, voted present.

USC DEFENSE MEETS TO HEAD OFF TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC's defense held a players-only meeting after
practice Wednesday to make sure it erased any lingering frustration
over the offensive problems last weekend against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's waiting for 'SC to fall apart and that's why we
called the meeting,'' said free safety David Gibson, who is also a
team captain. ``We just talked about how when you are 3-2, you can
have animosity. There would have been some blame but never any
finger-pointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said about 10 players spoke, and the main theme was that
the season is far from over with seven regular-season games left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to rededicate ourselves to having a great defense,''
Gibson said. ``As a defense, we have to pull together. The offense
has been injured and sputtering, it's not their fault. We have so
much talent, to let Arizona score 31 points is a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Soward update: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward spoke to USC coach
Paul Hackett after practice. One would assume that Soward was
discussing the concussion he suffered against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Hackett filled him in on the team meeting that he
missed Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't find a place to park,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Soward underwent a magnetic-resonance imaging test Monday and
the results were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Soward said he empathizes with Florida State wide receiver Peter
Warrick, who was charged with felony grand theft after he and
teammate Laveranues Coles were videotaped buying more than $400
worth of merchandise for $21.40 last month, with the aide of a
store clerk.
</P>
<P>
   The pair got to know each other last summer, while spending a
few days in Arizona as members of Playboy's All-American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never expected it to happen to him,'' Soward said. ``I say
it's the (clerk's) fault. Anybody in America who could buy that
much clothing for that price would do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for him because he's the Heisman front-runner. If
everything goes good, we'll both be in the NFL next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Big bet: Hackett said he called Joe Montana on Wednesday to
renew his annual bet over the outcome of the Notre Dame-USC game.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are a case of wine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him there are a couple extra seats on the plane, he
could come, and he said, `I don't think so,''' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said the bet didn't always take place during the Irish's
13-year unbeaten streak from 1983-95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of ducked out of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Left tackle Brent McCaffrey (ankle) and left
guard Donta Kendrick (ankle) each practiced for one period
Wednesday and Hackett thought they would be OK for the game. He did
not know if they would be able to start.
</P>
<P>
   New wide receiver? Hackett said true freshman safety Sandy
Fletcher has been so impressive playing wide receiver on the scout
team that he might play the position full-time next season.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Miguel Fletcher of Alemany High has officially moved
back to tailback after playing defensive back last season.

YANKEES WIN ON WILLIAMS' 10TH-INNING HOME RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortstop Johnny Pesky held the ball in the 1946
World Series and first baseman Bill Buckner let the ball go through
his legs in the 1986 Series. Those are two plays that live in
infamy in Boston Red Sox baseball lore.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the club, Jason Varitek and Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox catcher and relief pitcher were part of the two
plays that Boston fans will long remember when they look back at
the New York Yankees' 4-3 victory in Game 1 of the American League
Championship Series at Yankee Stadium Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Beck gave up the big one, a leadoff home run to Bernie Williams
in the 10th inning. Williams also won Game 1 of the 1996 American
League Championship Series against the Baltimore Orioles with an
11th-inning home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie does big things for us,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``He comes up so large, so often.''
</P>
<P>
   But Varitek's failure to hold a one-hop throw from right fielder
Trot Nixon on a play at the plate in the seventh was just as
crucial. This allowed the tying run to score in a game the Red Sox
led, 3-0, in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius had a two-run home run in the second off Red Sox
starter Kent Mercker and also had the leadoff single in the seventh
against reliever Derek Lowe that led to the crucial play at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch bunted Brosius to second and Derek Jeter
followed with a line-drive single to right. Nixon charged the ball
hard and made a strong, accurate throw to the plate. But Varitek
couldn't control it as Brosius came barrelling in for a collision.
Instead, Varitek dropped it, allowing Brosius to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky to score there,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good execution but bad results,'' Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams said. ``I couldn't tell about the hop, if it was a bad
hop. But the ball was there before the runner. If he holds onto the
ball ...''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius said, ``I didn't know if he was expecting me to hit him
or what. I had nowhere to go. My only chance to get to the plate
was to go over him.''
</P>
<P>
   There was much in this game that keep Red Sox fans talking well
into the next millennium. But the 10th inning was painful in two
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman led off the Red Sox's 10th with a single and John
Valentin followed with a double-play grounder to third. Knoblauch
dropped the ball on the exchange, but umpire Rick Reed ruled he was
taking it out of glove and Offerman was out. Replays showed
Knoblauch never had it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that rule ... if it hits his glove, he's out,''
Williams said. ``But it didn't look like he had possession.''
</P>
<P>
   The inning died and Williams then invited second-guessing by
taking out left-hander Rheal Cormier and bringing in Beck, a
right-hander, to face the heart of the Yankees order. The Yankees
have been much tougher on right-handers this year and Williams
proved that by hitting Beck's second pitch for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to have a good at-bat and hit the ball
hard,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox needed only three batters to score more runs against
the Yankees than the Rangers did in three games in the Division
Series. They jumped on Orlando Hernandez with two runs in the
first, a rally that started with Offerman's single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin then hit a grounder to the left side, where Jeter made
a backhanded stop, then pirouetted in mid-air and threw to second.
It looked nice, but the throw to second was wild, allowing Offerman
to score and Valentin to reach third. Valentin scored on Brian
Daubach's single to right.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox made it 3-0 in the second when Darren Lewis led off
with a walk, stole second, went to third on Nixon's bloop single
into right-center and scored on Offerman's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   That left the Red Sox with runners at first and second, but
Hernandez came back, getting Valentin on a fly to right, Daubach on
a pop to third and Nomar Garciaparra on a fly to right.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed seven of the first 10 batters he faced to
reach base before retiring 20 of the next 23. nn

CLASSIC RIVALRY PRODUCES CLASSIC POSTSEASON GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ We're told that if we ignore history, we are doomed
to repeat it. When it comes to the Yankees and Red Sox, that's a
good thing.
</P>
<P>
   History just keeps getting better and better when these two
teams come to dance.
</P>
<P>
   At the very stroke of midnight, Bernie Williams, leading off the
bottom of the 10th, waved his magic wand and sent a pitch from Rod
Beck over the center-field fence for a game-winning home run as the
Yankees clipped the Red Sox, 4-3, in a dramatic opening game of the
American League Championship Series on Wednesday night at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was Beck's second pitch of the game, a high fastball, and
Williams drove it high and deep into the New York night. The ball
cleared the fence just to the left of the 408-foot sign as Red Sox
center fielder Darren Lewis watched helplessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure the ball was out until I looked at Darren,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``When he turned on it, I knew it
was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surprise to me was that he hit the first pitch, home run,
bang, the game's over. The way the game was going, I thought it was
going to be one of those 14- or 15-inning games. I was talking to
(pitching coach) Mel (Stottlemyre) about who was going to pitch the
next inning.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, for Yankees fans at least, the perfect ending to the
perfect game, the beginning of the first-ever playoff series
between these two storied rivals.
</P>
<P>
   If they're all like Wednesday night's game, which was played
through sporadic rain showers over the final five innings, it might
go down as one of the most entertaining playoff series of all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Their pasts are as intertwined as an old Afghan comforter,
knitted together in a colorful tapestry of triumphs and tragedies,
from the Curse of the Bambino, to the dramatic Bucky Dent playoff
home run; from the controversial writers' vote that made the
popular Joe DiMaggio the 1941 MVP over the irascible Ted Williams,
to the heated and animosity-filled rivalry between Thurman Munson
and Carlton Fisk.
</P>
<P>
   This is no ordinary ALCS, and so we should have expected a
less-than-ordinary opening game Wednesday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The track record of events when these two teams clash is so well
established, we should never have been lulled into some pedestrian
notion that the defending world champion Yankees were an automatic
shoo-in the first game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, that was the early story line in the New York tabloids
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   There the Yankees were, fresh and cheeky after their annual
sweep of the Rangers in the Divisional Series while the frazzled
Red Sox had to rally from two games down to win three straight
against dangerous Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the Yankees were able to set their thoroughly rested
pitching rotation to manager Joe Torre's exact specifications,
while Jimy Williams, his Boston counterpart, was shrugging and
saying, ``We'll find somebody to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   He did. Several somebodies.
</P>
<P>
   Williams started with left-hander Kent Mercker, beaten up by the
Indians and working on just two days' rest. He was opposed by the
Yankees' mesmerizing Cuban, Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez, who had
combined with two Yankees relievers to shut out the Rangers on a
two-hitter eight days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What started as a mismatch became, instead, another chapter in
the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   It was like watching two fighters schooled by the same trainer,
mirror-images, each familiar with the other's style and moves.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter, the two All-Star shortstops
and the centerpieces of their respective teams, were almost
identical in their play, even down to out-of-character matching
wild throws to second base.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the beginning that this was not the same
Yankees team that so casually and confidently dismissed the Rangers
just last weekend. And those weren't the cowed and psyche-whipped
Rangers in the other dugout.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who had painted the corners like Rembrandt against
the Rangers, was more like your average sloppy house painter in the
first inning, and the Red Sox nicked him for two early runs, one of
them unearned thanks to Jeter's one-hop throw from deep short that
skipped into right field. Brian Daubach's single to right scored
another.
</P>
<P>
   In just one inning, in which the Yankees looked extremely
mortal, the Red Sox had doubled the Rangers' run production in
three futile games.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's speed produced another run in the second when Darren
Lewis walked, stole second and scored on back-to-back singles by
Trot Nixon and Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   That's triple what the Rangers ... oh, never mind.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Yankees were still the Yankees. Bernie Williams?
Well, the Rangers know all about him, now don't they?
</P>
<P>
   What makes good history is a rivalry. It takes two for that
dance, and history tells us there's no better match than the
Yankees and the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   They proved it again Wednesday night. nn

STARS HOLD TEAM MEETING AFTER SHUTOUT LOSS TO SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars held a welcome back party for Mike Modano and
Darryl Sydor on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody forgot to bring the goals.
</P>
<P>
   So, the Stars were left scrambling for one in the final 1:17.
They came up with five shots on goal, two close enough to be goals,
but no goals. The party ended with San Jose walking away from
Reunion Arena on Wednesday night with a 2-0 victory and the Stars
players having a 25-minute, closed-door meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been shut out twice in our first six games,'' Stars
defenseman Richard Matvichuk said, ``and we had to address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The players decided the problem was a simple failure to finish
the chances they had. Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said the problem
was the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think that was about as uncommitted as I've seen our
group in a long time, especially in gritty, physical areas we
needed to have to win the hockey game,'' Hitchcock said. ``When
your best players are your most casual players, you're in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars didn't exactly play a strong game, but they weren't
without their chances. They outshot the Sharks, 20-6, in the third
period.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of finish can be attributed to a little bit of
tentativeness and a lot of Sharks goalie Steve Shields. He stopped
all 35 Stars shots he faced, including two good chances by forwards
Jamie Langenbrunner and Joe Nieuwendyk with 2:45 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   There was also Blake Sloan, Derian Hatcher and Brett Hull and on
and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' Modano said. ``The shot thing always comes into
play.'' Modano and Sydor returned after a 10-day, injury-induced
layoff, and both said aside from a few nerves they felt fine.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor suffered a hairline fracture to his left eye socket after
being punched repeatedly in the back of the head by Anaheim winger
Jim McKenzie on Oct. 2. Modano suffered a broken nose, ligament
damage in his neck and a mild concussion after crashing awkwardly
into the boards when Mighty Ducks defenseman Ruslan Salei pushed
him from behind in that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they wouldn't be up to speed so it was up to everybody
else to pick up the slack,'' Hitchcock said, ``and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks first goal came at 3:49 of first period when forward
Mike Ricci threaded a pass through Matvichuk to Niklas Sundstrom
for an easy, tap-in goal. Sundstrom had beaten Stars defenseman
Brad Lukowich. Sharks forward Jeff Friesen got an empty-net goal
with 24 seconds remaining in the game to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They score that one goal and we just deflated,'' Sydor said.
``That's not our team.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what the meeting was mainly about, not so much the
score or loss but the way they played. Stars forward Guy Carbonneau
said the 2-on-1 breaks, the lack of goals, the loss were only
symptoms of the problem. The team, he said, was slowly but surely
getting away from the defensive-style of game that won them a
Stanley Cup last season.
</P>
<P>
   The players reminded themselves of that fact in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to get things on the table before problems
occur,'' Carbonneau said. ``I think we're searching for our game
from last year.''
</P>
<P>
   And a few goals. nn

TEXAS TECH HOPES FOR BETTER BOUNCES
</HEADLINE>
 TECH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Colorado coach Gary Barnett is taking a predictable approach to
Saturday's game at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched them play Texas A&AMP;M and was totally impressed,''
Barnett said, taking note of the Red Raiders' impressive 21-19
upset of then-No. 5 A&AMP;M. ``That's the team I'm going to prepare
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett, as would Tech's players if they could, chose to dismiss
the Red Raiders' 41-21 loss at Oklahoma State. Not only was Tech
suddenly inept on offense, its defense was befuddled by a
never-before-seen OSU offensive scheme. The Red Raiders' special
teams were victimized by Terance Richardson's punt returns (5 for
90 yards). But the defensive failings were the most notable. After
allowing only five offensive touchdowns in four games, Tech's
defense was stunned by the Cowboys' four touchdown drives _ in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes a Colorado attack ranked 10th nationally (455.6 yards
per game), directed by quarterback Mike Moschetti, who is third in
the Big 12 and 12th nationally in individual total offense (287.6
yards) and who in Marcus Stiggers has one of the nation's top
big-play receivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Buffaloes (3-2, 2-0 Big 12) are coming off a 46-39 overtime
victory at Missouri; Tech off what coach Spike Dykes said was his
team's worst defensive performance this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really,'' Dykes protested, ``we've played pretty doggoned good
defense this year. We've just given up a few big plays. Those are
the things that have killed our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Not giving up big plays has been a hallmark of Tech defenses
throughout the 1990s. Big plays, however, were instrumental in
losses at Arizona State and to the University of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus has always been to stop the run and not give up big
plays,'' defensive coordinator John Goodner said. ``This year, we
haven't done a very good job (of the latter).''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders traditionally have also ranked high nationally
in turnover margin. This year, however, Tech is minus-6 in turnover
ratio, last in the Big 12 and 104th nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Against A&AMP;M, things bounced our way. Against Oklahoma State,
they didn't,'' said senior defensive end Taurus Rucker, who has
been Tech's steadiest defender this season. ``Some things just
haven't gone our way this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the wrong bounces, Rucker pointed out, was the play
on which two Tech defenders tipped an OSU pass that Cowboys
fullback Kevin Brown eventually caught for a 4-yard touchdown and a
21-0 lead early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've dropped a lot of balls this year,'' said sophomore Kevin
Curtis, one of those players who had a shot at the pass Brown
caught. ``Sometimes getting things to bounce your way takes a lot
of luck. But we just haven't been able to create a lot of turnovers
this year and from now on, when we get our hands on a ball we've
got to grasp it.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU used a variety of offensive schemes _ running reverses, fake
reverses, using a no-huddle offense and sending five receivers out
of the shotgun offense _ to neutralize Tech's famed pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give Oklahoma State credit,'' Goodner said. ``They ran some
stuff we were not prepared for. We got back on our heels and never
recovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Rucker said, however, the Red Raiders defense will be
rejuvenated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the Swarm defense has been one of the best in
the country the last four or five years,'' Rucker said. ``Against
A&AMP;M, our defense was about the best you'll see. Last week, we
didn't play the way we're capable of playing. But we'll adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tied (in the loss column) with four other teams in the
Big 12 South and we know those teams aren't going to quit. We're
not either.'' nn

   LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles schools Superintendent Ruben Zacarias

   While Mayor Richard Riordan praised the organizational shake-up,
one of Zacarias' strongest supporters on the school board said the
board president should step down for pushing the move through.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one superintendent in charge of this district,
and you are looking at him,'' Zacarias said, emerging from his
half-hour discussion with Miller at district headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely want to work this all out,'' Zacarias said later
in the day. ``I can always use an extra pair of hands. Mr. Miller
does report to me. He takes direction from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zacarias said he believed he and Miller could have a positive
relationship and argued they would have to clarify Miller's role.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who will serve in the new post through June 2000,
acknowledged that the superintendent can veto any of his decisions.
But he said there is nothing to clarify when it comes to the
district's new chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that I do report to the superintendent,''
Miller said. ``But the board resolution is clear on the reporting
relationship between all the departments. As chief executive
officer, I will be involved in every aspect of the district's work
and manage all the departments.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan said the school board, which he helped elect, did not
inform him of the move to appoint Miller in advance. He agreed with
the board, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a key move that will benefit the children of Los
Angeles,'' he said. ``This action will liberate Ruben Zacarias to
focus on a vision of creating an education system so every child in
the city has the tools to compete in a global society.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the hallways of the Los Angeles Unified School
District's downtown headquarters, the surprise installation of
Miller was perceived by many as an administrative coup. The move
has temporarily flung the administrative offices into chaos and
apparently isolated board member Victoria Castro, an ardent
supporter of the superintendent, from the rest of the Board of
Education.
</P>
<P>
   Castro urged board President Genethia Hayes to step down as the
leader of the seven-member panel. She said the board president, who
took office in July, has repeatedly skirted the intent of state
laws in place to ensure that the public is properly notified of the
board's agenda for closed and open meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is appropriate for her to step down to assure the
public that all Brown Act (the open public meetings act)
requirements will be complied with,'' Castro said. ``With only
three months on the job, the intricacies of these rules are easy to
misinterpret and fumble, and this was a major fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Castro pointed out the board president repeatedly changed the
posted agenda for Tuesday's closed meeting during which Miller was
appointed.
</P>
<P>
   A review by the Daily News confirmed the agenda had been altered
at least four times. The final version, which was scrawled in
freehand, not typed, was distributed to board members as they
entered the meeting, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   State law requires a final, clearly defined agenda to be posted
at least 24 hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
   The board approved the motion by a 4-2 vote behind closed doors.
Hayes, Caprice Young, Mike Lansing and Valerie Fields voted in
favor of hiring Miller. Castro and David Tokofsky dissented. Julie
Korenstein abstained. There was no public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Castro, who served as board president last year, said she would
not take steps to remove Hayes if she refused to abdicate her post.
</P>
<P>
   While Hayes did not respond to repeated requests for comment, it
appeared unlikely Castro would see the appointment of a new board
president any time soon. Every other board member told the Daily
News they would not support a call for Hayes to step down as
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Hayes has a lot of energy and a purpose that can be good
for the system,'' Tokofsky said. ``I don't think this was handled
as precisely as it could have been handled. But Ms. Castro's
request is not going to find me supporting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other school board members praised Hayes' tough management style
and vowed to back her.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: vowed to back her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Genethia is a strong president, and she's got my vote,'' said
Caprice Young, who was elected with Hayes this spring.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, a frequent critic of the
district, called Miller's appointment a clear move to undercut
Zacarias. If a majority of board members wants to get rid of the
superintendent, he said, they should simply do so and not take such
``humiliating'' partial steps.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting of the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association, Hayden argued that Miller's appointment was another
attempt to fix a broken system by adding more bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crisis management and crisis management only,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The idea to appoint Miller to the powerful post was brought to
the board by LAUSD legal consultant Barry Groveman. Groveman, who
is running for district attorney, has been instrumental during the
last year in efforts to expose toxic problems at the Belmont
Learning Center and combat incompetence in the school district.
</P>
<P>
   Miller has been given until Oct. 22 to assemble a crisis
management team and bring recommendations to the board on the
appropriate discipline for administrators who allowed Belmont to be
built atop an oil field without adequate environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   Miller and Groveman said they met only two weeks ago when Miller
joined the district as the head of facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, D-Glendale, perhaps the most vocal
critic of the school district throughout the Belmont debacle, met
Miller's appointment with optimism and caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, I'm pleased Mr. Miller will be in charge of
reorganizing the district,'' Wildman said. ``I'm confused about the
scope of Mr. Miller's responsibilities, as many people are. But my
understanding is Ruben Zacarias is still in charge as
superintendent. It's now up to him to rise to the occasion.''

BRUINS FALTER AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Bruins' nightmarish start continued
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night when they dropped a 2-1 decision to the Colorado
Avalanche at the new Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   The loss marked the first time since the 1964-65 season that the
Bruins have started the season winless in their first six games.
The club is 0-4-2 and the trip, which is just beginning, continues
Friday night in Dallas against the Stanley Cup champion Stars. It
doesn't get any easier and it's quite likely only to get harder.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Drury, behind the net, feathered a pass through the legs
of Kyle McLaren, setting up defenseman Adam Foote's winning goal at
the 15:16 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' offense, which was so promising in Monday's 3-3 tie
with Colorado at the FleetCenter, was spotty and inopportunistic,
and there were too many holes in the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Pat Burns was particularly uspset with the lack of
production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our big guys have got to score goals for us,'' said Burns.
``Their big guys set up points, and our big guys have got to get
some goals for us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns singled out Sergei Samsonov, whom he spoke to at the end
of the first period, and Steve Heinze.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Samsonov) wants to make the play all the time,'' Burns said.
``Sometimes you have to sacrifice yourself. He's got to be better,
and he knows that. I'm not going to put up with it all year long.
But he's not the only one. Steve Heinze has got to get involved.
He's not getting involved. He's waiting for the puck to end up on
his stick.''
</P>
<P>
   The first two periods played out rather oddly in terms of how
defensively loose each team was. However, both goalies, John
Grahame of the Bruins and Colorado's Patrick Roy, held the fort
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Bruins looked similar to their
performance Monday. They hit posts and gunned the puck at the net.
Unlike the Monday game, though, the Bruins didn't finish as well
and missed several chances during odd-man rushes.
</P>
<P>
   One of Boston's best chances in the period was a two-on-one with
Dave Andreychuk and Samsonov. Andreychuk got off a shot, but Roy
gloved it with 5:29 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Drury, the former Boston University standout who was the Calder
Trophy winner as NHL Rookie of the Year last season, had several
chances. At 18:33, Drury practically skated through the entire
Bruins' team on the way to the net. Drury managed a shot but was
hooked down by defenseman Hal Gill, leading to a power play. The
Avalanche couldn't convert, however, and it was nullified with 5.3
seconds left when center Joe Sakic was whistled for hooking P.J.
Axelsson.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle period, the teams continued to trade chances with
the netminders coming up big.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame stopped Sakic's bid at the right post as the big forward
tried to jam the puck in.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruin Dave Reid, who only recently signed with Colorado,
took a pass from Stephane Yelle and was denied by Grahame in tight
at 7:34.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche had a great opportunity at 8:48 during a
two-on-one break with both teams skating four a side. Sakic passed
the puck to Foote, and Grahame came out to challenge. Foote, who
was nearly behind the goalie, tried to force the pass back to
Sakic, and it was broken up by the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame made a remarkable save on Drury at the right post when
he threw his body across the crease and used his stick to block the
bid at the 11:55 mark. But in an effort to relieve the pressure on
his teammates, Grahame fired the puck into the stands and was
called for delay of game.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche got on the board at 17:40, only three seconds
after their power play expired. Right wing Milan Hejduk, who scored
a pair of goals against the Bruins Monday, tallied again when his
shot pinballed off a Bruin and past Grahame for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't last long, as the Bruins rallied to tie with 35.5
seconds remaining. Defenseman Jonathan Girard, positioned just
inside the blue line along the right-wing boards, fired the puck at
the net. Roy made the save but left wing Mikko Eloranta, with
defenseman Aaron Miller draped on his back, beat Roy on the rebound
at 19:24.
</P>
<P>
   Grahame got himself into a pickle again with another delay of
game penalty at 12:57. The Bruins fended it off but the Avalanche
delivered the death blow minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Burns said he might make some changes. ``We'll go with guys who
are going to show grit,'' he said. ``There are definitely some guys
who have got to bring it up. If they don't, we're going to stay in
this slump a long time.''

 12 REPORT-TEX 
ATTENTION! LiSTEN TO THIS AND WIN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven weeks down, seven weeks remaining in the Big 12 football
season.
</P>
<P>
   This seems an ideal time to take stock of where we've been and
determine the levels of inspiration and perspiration needed by
contenders to reach the league title game, Dec. 4 in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   To assist in our efforts, we've expanded a concept originated by
Colorado coach Gary Barnett. To inspire his players before the
Kansas game, Barnett dressed in camouflage gear and showed excerpts
from the movie Patton, with Kansas-specific references dubbed into
George C. Scott's famous monologue.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado won, 51-17.
</P>
<P>
   So, we're one-upping Barnett. With help from buddies with
psychic connections (verified through infommericals on late-night
TV), we've summoned the spirit of the real Gen. George S. Patton to
provide a surprise, midseason inspection of Big 12 football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Patton, the troops are assembled, in descending order of
conference record, for your inspection. What follows are Patton's
words of inspiration (expletives deleted, of course):
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska (6-0, 3-0): Ground troops ... solid! Defense systems
... superior! Air-strike capabilities ... dubious! Keep working on
that, men. I've seen progress. But not enough to subdue the
ultimate foe.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (5-0, 3-0): Fifteen takeaways, seven giveaways. I
like that, men! Make the enemy bow to your will. But don't get
cocky, Bill Snyder. And wipe those cupcake crumbs off your lips!
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (3-2, 2-0): Get tough, huh? That was your plan, wasn't
it, Barnett? Then why are you still passing for twice as many yards
(308.8) every week as you get by pounding it on the ground (146.8)?
Enough of this mamby-pamby stuff! More trench warfare, soldier! Or
do I need to get you a sweater vest to match Rick Neuheisel's?
</P>
<P>
   Texas (5-2, 2-1): I believe the game is called FOOT-ball, isn't
it, Mack Brown? Then why, in tarnation, can't your guys kick it
past the line of scrimmage with regularity? Seven blocked kicks!
Those are self-inflicted wounds, soldier! You'll never win a war
that way.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M (4-1, 1-1): Great marching band, men. I love their
choice of tunes. But enough about that. I see your offense is off
the MIA list. That's good. But dadgummit, R.C. Slocum, you can't
keep misplacing that thing! Wars have been lost on lesser tactical
errors.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma (3-2, 1-1): I can't lie to you, men. You entertain me
greatly. But where in the world have you stashed the ground troops,
Bob Stoops? You can't force a surrender by just lofting grenades
all day.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (3-2, 1-1): Soldiers, you've fought the good
fight without your triggerman. You control your destiny. You can
win the South Division if quarterback Tony Lindsay comes back Oct.
23 with a healthy knee. Personally, I think you'll need more than
that to get the job done. But if he inspires you to greater things,
good luck and Godspeed.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech (2-3, 1-1): For heaven's sake, Spike Dykes, you're
running a football team, not a charity ward! Look at this: 13
giveaways, seven takeaways. Worst turnover ratio in the conference!
Men, you'd better clean this up before your coach gets
court-martialed.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (3-2, 0-2): Men, I admire your spunk. You've got no
air support, so just keep smashing them with those tanks! Focus on
that Davis model. It seems to work best.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri (3-2, 0-2): Good grief, men, your net punting average
ranks below Texas (27.3 yards, 112th in Division I-A). Only two
teams in America are worse! Unless we start seeing something
special from those special teams, this could be a loooooooong
season.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (2-4, 0-2): Remember this, soldiers. When the going gets
tough ... the tough play basketball! Now, quit wasting time and
report to Roy Williams with your best jump shots. On the double!
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (1-5, 0-3): This message is for your coach, men. As a
general, I learned long ago that when the enemy raises the
surrender flag, you stop shooting and accept his offer. There's a
lesson in there for you, Kevin Steele.
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA, IOWA STATE DREAM OF BOWL BERTHS
</P>
<P>
   At the halfway mark of the season, nine of 12 league schools are
on pace to qualify for bowl berths. That number will dwindle in the
coming weeks as losses mount for also-rans during conference play.
</P>
<P>
   But it is appears likely that the Big 12, for a second
consecutive year, will produce more bowl-eligible teams than its
guaranteed allotment of six postseason berths. For that, league
administrators can thank a first-year NCAA rule that could propel
Oklahoma and Iowa State into the bowl mix with 6-5 records that
would not have been acceptable in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners (3-2) and Cyclones (3-2) opened their respective
seasons with victories over Indiana State, a Division I-AA school.
In past years, triumphs over I-AA opponents did not count toward
bowl eligibility. This year, a new NCAA statute allows teams to
count one victory within a four-year span over a I-AA foe as part
of a school's six-victory minimum to accept a bowl bid.
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 officials confirmed yesterday that the Sooners and
Cyclones need to finish only 6-5 to qualify for postseason
consideration. Under similar circumstances last season, the minimum
would have been 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   The key for the Sooners, said first-year coach Bob Stoops, is
maximizing opportunities for victories during a rebuilding season.
Oklahoma last posted a winning record in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't waste any opportunities and get to a bowl game,''
Stoops said. ``And I don't believe we have, to this point. We're
getting better and more familiar with what we're doing each week.
If we get some things polished in this off week, we can finish
strong in the second half of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   IQ TEST
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State will play the Big 12's final nonconference game of
the regular season Saturday against Utah State. The contest is
sandwiched between matchups against archrival Kansas (a 50-9
victory) and an Oct. 23 game at Oklahoma State. Snyder said the
timing of the game ``is a concern'' for him in motivating his
ninth-ranked Wildcats, but he's found a remedy: videotape
highlights of the Aggies' 34-31 overtime loss to No. 21 Brigham
Young as well as the team's 400-yard offensive performance in a
season-opening, 38-7 loss to No. 14 Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's still a concern after they watch those tapes, then I'm
concerned about the IQ level of people on our team,'' Snyder said.
``Utah State is one of those teams that seems to play up, or down,
to the level of their competition.''
</P>
<P>
   NO SECOND THOUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Because of his baseball background, Texas A&AMP;M quarterback Mark
Farris found it difficult to bypass Monday's telecast of the
deciding game in the Boston-Cleveland playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Farris, a 24-year-old freshman, spent five seasons in the
Pittsburgh Pirates' minor-league system before enrolling at A&AMP;M in
January. As he watched Monday, Farris said he felt no desire to be
part of the action. His feelings were much different while watching
college football telecasts during September road trips as a
minor-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That reinforced to me that I don't miss baseball,'' said
Farris, who shares the backup role with fellow freshman Vance
Smith, a Fort Worth Christian graduate. ``I didn't really watch
during the regular season and I didn't get excited (Monday) about a
big playoff game. But I really, really missed football when I was
playing baseball. I'm done second-guessing myself. I know I'm where
I need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   AFTER THE UPSET
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said he was not surprised to see
Texas Tech fall to Oklahoma State, 41-21, the week after the Red
Raiders upset the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that's their pattern every year,'' Slocum said.
``They put everything into our game and they've had difficulties in
games the next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics support Slocum's conclusion. In 13 seasons under
coach Spike Dykes, Tech has a 6-7 mark against A&AMP;M. But the Red
Raiders are 3-10 in games the next week, including 1-5 after
victories over the Aggies.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the Red Raiders prosper after games against Texas in
the Dykes era. Dykes is 6-6 against the Longhorns and 10-2 in games
the next week, including a 5-1 mark following Tech victories.
</P>
<P>
   Dykes discounts any significance to the statistics, saying his
team's up-and-down efforts are ``the part of the game that makes it
mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   PICK A VENUE
</P>
<P>
   Big 12 officials said yesterday that a decision on the site of
the league's football championship game in 2000 will not be reached
until Oct. 20, at the earliest. That is the next scheduled meeting
of the league's chief executive officers. Cities bidding to host
the game include Kansas City, Dallas, St. Louis and San Antonio.
During the league's spring meetings, Big 12 officials agreed to
consider open-air stadiums as potential venues rather than
continuing the game's four-year rotation between the TWA Dome in
St. Louis and the Alamodome in San Antonio. nn

BRUINS HIT BY ILLNESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An upper respiratory infection is doing what Oregon tailback
Reuben Droughns could not _ running through UCLA's defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   End Kenyon Coleman and tackle Ken Kocher were two of six Bruins
who didn't practice Wednesday because of infection. End Rusty
Williams and reserve tackle Steve Morgan are also sick, but they
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 21 Bruins have symptoms ranging from sinus congestion to
sore throats, coughing and fever. But so far, only reserve guard Ed
Anderson (pneumonia) has been ruled out of Saturday's game against
Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a virus going through the community at large,'' Bruins
athletic trainer Geoff Schaadt said.
</P>
<P>
   It hit UCLA late last week. According to coach Bob Toledo, 12
players were sick before the Oregon game, some with high fevers,
but everyone played.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a flu epidemic, and it's not flu season _ that's
what worries me,'' Toledo said. ``We told them to be careful about
sucking on bottles and (to) isolate themselves from people who have
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster update: Although tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained ankle)
hasn't been ruled out for the Oct.23 game at Oregon State, it's
unlikely he'll risk extensive damage on OSU's AstroTurf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's new turf, and it looks good, but it's still turf,''
Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who won't play this week, could return for the Oct.30
showdown with Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Secondary switch: Reserve cornerback Lovell Houston has switched
to safety to better suit his skills and UCLA's needs.
</P>
<P>
   A redshirt freshman, Houston has been hurt for most of his 14
months on campus and needs to learn the defense and add strength
before he becomes a full-time player. He was unable to participate
in the weight program last year because of operations on both
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Catching up with: Former UCLA center Shawn Stuart is teaching at
a private school in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-guard Andy Meyers was cut by the Buffalo Bills and is selling
real estate in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Former kicker Chris Sailer is finishing his degree and working
for the football office and Fox Sports West.
</P>
<P>
   Former quarterback Cade McNown makes the first start of his NFL
career Sunday when his Chicago Bears play Philadelphia. (Bears
starter Shane Matthews is hurt.)
</P>
<P>
   Ex-coach Terry Donahue, currently assisting Bill Walsh with the
San Francisco 49ers, became a grandfather Tuesday. His oldest
daughter, Nicole, gave birth to Brooke Alexandra at 2 a.m. in
Newport Beach.

INDONESIAN PRESIDENT ASKS GENERAL TO BE RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ In an attempt to strengthen his hand with
the politically powerful military, President B.J. Habibie on
Wednesday selected Indonesia's military chief, Gen. Wiranto, as his
vice presidential running mate in an electoral assembly that is due
to vote in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto made no comment. Under his command, the military, with
its potentially crucial bloc of votes, remained publicly
uncommitted on its presidential choice.
</P>
<P>
   But the selection of a fellow member of the inner circle of
former President Suharto sharpened the divide between Habibie's
old-guard candidacy and that of his chief rival, Megawati
Sukarnoputri, who has become a symbol for change.
</P>
<P>
   A possible Habibie-Wiranto leadership, in direct defiance of
those calling for a break with the past, could energize the
opposition into a new eruption of unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people and the students will not accept Habibie and
Wiranto,'' said Ridwan, an English teacher, as he marched in
central Jakarta on Wednesday with students who support Mrs.
Megawati. ``Both Habibie and Wiranto are followers of Suharto. If
they win, nothing will change.''
</P>
<P>
   A 700-member electoral assembly is to vote Oct. 20 to choose
Indonesia's next president and the following day to choose the vice
president. Candidates for the posts do not run on party slates;
electors who vote for Habibie will not be bound to choose his vice
presidential selection.
</P>
<P>
   But Habibie's choice, with its overture to the influential
military, is part of a vigorous lobbying effort in what has become
a tight presidential race. Abdurrahman Wahid, who heads the leading
Islamic movement here in the world's largest Moslem nation, has
emerged as a third presidential possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie's announcement came just hours after the hotly debated
decision by his party, Golkar, to retain him as its candidate
despite his slipping popularity.
</P>
<P>
   He said, in part: ``We need good cooperation with the military;
that is why I want to have a military man as my running mate. A
vice president has to help the president handle threats faced by
the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   The two appear to have worked well together during a transition
that has seen continuing instability both on the streets and within
the corridors of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie was vice president 17 months ago when he moved into the
vacancy left by his mentor, Suharto, who was forced to resign.
Habibie reappointed Wiranto and gave him free rein to reorganize
the military.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto, 52, also owes his career to Suharto, who made him his
personal adjutant and then head of the armed forces. Together with
Habibie, he has pledged to protect Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   A four-star general, he holds the two top military posts in
Indonesia: chief of the armed forces and defense minister. Both
posts were conferred by Habibie. The general is a career soldier
who is seen as professional, moderate and supportive of reforms in
which the military would withdraw from its pervasive political role
in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he was engineering events or, as he asserts, lost
control of his ground forces, Wiranto holds command responsibility
for the violence and chaos that has consumed the territory of East
Timor since it voted for independence from Indonesia on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Under him, the military also has engaged in brutal tactics in
the province of Aceh and the island of Ambon, and has cracked down
violently on some, but not all, protests in Jakarta.

LAKERS' FOX DOES BALANCING ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rick Fox, ever the forward-thinking forward, spent
his summer busily planning for life after basketball, even as he
prepared for potentially the best years of his Lakers career as a
vital cog in new coach Phil Jackson's system.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the eight-year veteran's offseason work could
fill the average resume.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ``professional basketball'' heading, he added a
long-term contract, for six years and $24 million.
</P>
<P>
   Under ``personal/family,'' he added a wife, singer-actress
Vanessa Williams, and her three children.
</P>
<P>
   And under ``education,'' Fox needed a ream of paper to chronicle
his studies, which included introductory work in the triangle
offense and film production 101.
</P>
<P>
   It was no easy balancing act.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for Jackson's offense, Fox spent weeks working
with Lakers assistant coaches and teammates at a health club in
Manhattan Beach and with strength coach Jim Cotta on his
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   But when he wasn't strengthening his body, Fox was flexing his
brain and planning for his post-NBA future.
</P>
<P>
   In August, he spent two weeks on the set of ``Four Faces of
God,'' a 20-minute film. Not in his role as a promising part-time
actor but as executive producer. It's the latest step in Fox's
steady transition from basketball player to Hollywood player.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-hour days on the set, which followed three-hour workouts,
were almost as grueling as a postseason tilt with the San Antonio
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough two weeks,''' he said. ``There's no way you can
be a basketball player and a fulltime producer. One is going to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox couldn't pass up the opportunity, though. His roles in the
HBO drama ``Oz'' and parts in movies like ``He Got Game'' have
fueled a passion for film that nearly rivals his love of
basketball. When friends Anthony and Dallas Hartman presented Fox
with the script for ``Faces of God,'' he jumped at the chance to
fund it. It's since been submitted to the Sundance Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   So Fox created ``17 Productions'' (named for his jersey number),
partnered with Galilay Entertainment and producer Greg Palumbo and
hired another friend, Jack Gilardi Jr. (a producer on current
release ``Mystery, Alaska'') to direct. Thus began his education
for a post-NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approached the project in two ways: one, helping my friends,
and two, gaining experience, kind of like going to school,'' Fox
said. ``I don't have time to go to film school, but this was an
opportunity to be behind the scenes as opposed to in front of the
camera, and get a greater understanding of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   As producer, Fox provided the funds and the budget. As a
celebrity in his own right, Fox also opened some doors in obtaining
talent and resources. But after that, his primary role was that of
student, and he was hands-off on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been an incredible student. He gets an A-plus,''
Gilardi said. ``He's a perfectionist.... He never claims to know;
he's here for a learning process and has been very supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   It's really no different an approach than Fox has taken on the
court, whether adapting to a new role, from starter to reserve, or
learning the triangle offense. His aptitude for Jackson's system
has earned him high marks from Lakers coaches, and he'll probably
play starter's minutes as a reserve at both big guard and small
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has brought a similar intensity to both areas of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this much _ I feel the stress of this in a
different way but as I would in basketball,'' Fox said in August on
the set at Lacy Street studios.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well this year, Fox could parlay one passion into a
championship ring, his other into an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you shoot for, whether you're a rookie or a
10-time All-Star, you still want to win a championship,'' he said.
``It's about being part of a team, it's putting together and
creating a project and seeing it come to life. There's a lot of
gratification and hard work and at the end of the day, the end of
the month or three months, or in the case of basketball nine
months, having your work reflect in something like a championship.
And looking back and saying, wow, that was a year of my life, and
look at what I have to look back on.''

SEATTLE _ Nurse, where am I?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pass the smelling salts.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds crazy, but I think I just saw the Rockets run.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was a dream. I might be having flashbacks from watching
too much ESPN Classic in the aftermath of Wilt's passing.
</P>
<P>
   It could even have been from all the garlic that was on my
chicken dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But I thought I saw ...
</P>
<P>
   I swear I saw ...
</P>
<P>
   Hakeem Olajuwon wrapping his mitts around a defensive rebound
and very quickly turning to fire an outlet pass to a racing Walt
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I saw ...
</P>
<P>
   I swear I saw ...
</P>
<P>
   The live-wire rookie Steve Francis pushing the ball up the
court, weaving through traffic and sending a laser-beam pass to an
elevating Shandon Anderson along the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   I thought I saw ...
</P>
<P>
   I swear I saw ...
</P>
<P>
   Even Charles Barkley hustling from end to end, keeping up with
the suddenly fast-moving basketball in the new-look, fuel-injected
offense.
</P>
<P>
   I know it was only the first exhibition game of a very long
season, but it was as welcome a sight as the first halter top of
spring.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets can keep this up, then there is hope that someday
a plowhorse might throw off his yoke and win the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team I ever played on or coached, from high school to
college to the NBA to any playground out there anywhere, every
single player always said that he wanted to run,'' said head coach
Rudy Tomjanovich. ``That includes our old `water buffalo' team with
Billy Paultz. But you know what they say about talk being cheap.
The thing is, you have to make the commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing is, you've got to have the horses and the legs.
</P>
<P>
   While it is far too early and way too wildly premature to
project the Rockets into the forefront of the race for the Western
Conference title after a 101-88 loss to the SuperSonics, at the
very least you can say they have the talent and the speed and at
least an inclination to not make you nod off to sleep in your
high-priced seat.
</P>
<P>
   It's like catching Queen Elizabeth smoking a cigar. Or spotting
Calista Flockhart with a full plate at an all-you-can-eat buffet.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for the striped clown suits, you almost wouldn't
recognize them. Come to think of it, you might still need a program
just to match up all of the new faces with the new names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I've been reborn in a way,'' Olajuwon said. ``I
cannot believe that I left the team that lost in the first round of
the playoffs in May and came back to this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deep. It's exciting. It's a team that I think is going to
surprise a lot of the old Rocket fans, because it has a lot of
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Mainly for three reasons:
</P>
<P>
   No poutin' Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   An upbeat style that feels as if much of the game is being
played with somebody's finger pressed on the fast-forward button.
</P>
<P>
   And Francis.
</P>
<P>
   He is the equivalent of a live wire sparking and jumping in the
middle of a crowded street, both breathtaking and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   There is Francis taking the whip to the offense, getting the
ball over the midcourt line in a heartbeat, feeding the ball into
Olajuwon and getting a fast return pass to bury a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   There is Francis backpedaling at full speed to guard Seattle
All-Star Gary Payton on a fast break and then leaping as if off a
springboard to make a spectacular fingertip block on what appeared
to be a sure layup.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was shocked. Francis was jubilant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got that ...! I got that ...!'' Francis shrieked with glee.
And that sent Cuttino Mobley and others on the Rockets bench into
convulsions of laughter.
</P>
<P>
   There is Francis receiving a sideline inbounds pass from fellow
rookie Kenny Thomas, darting around defenders like a skier through
an obstacle course and throwing down a two-handed slam dunk and
chinning himself on the rim to draw a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   No, that is not your father's Oldsmobile. And these are not the
Rockets that you have so often wanted to light a fuse under in
recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that most people don't want to believe it, because
they've watched me dribble down in the box so much lately,'' said
Barkley. ``But this is gonna be easier for me and for Hakeem. And
it's gonna be fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, more than six minutes had passed in the game
before the first post-up play to Barkley was called, and there was
not a steady diet.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of sprinting and hustling and trying to beat
the defense down the floor in the transition game.
</P>
<P>
   There was Anderson finishing on the break, showing why the
Rockets courted him for so long.
</P>
<P>
   There was Williams going inside, going outside, doing a little
of this and a little of that.
</P>
<P>
   There was Kelvin Cato, perhaps an underappreciated part of the
Scottie Pippen deal, with a monster seven blocked shots in 22
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   There was Carlos Rogers hitting turnarounds on the baseline and
pursuing hard on defense, showing why a 6-11 jumping jack who now
with his fourth NBA team in six seasons has been one of the
surprises of camp.
</P>
<P>
   When Brent Barry tried to go inside in the second quarter,
Rogers swooped in like a hungry hawk and plucked the shot from
midair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Brent!'' yelled Barkley, from a seat along the baseline.
``Haven't you ever heard of Carlos Rogers? He's a household name
... in his own house.''
</P>
<P>
   It was fast. It was open. It was entertaining. It was a start.
The Rockets were running.
</P>
<P>
   Nurse, am I dreaming?

NEW TCU WOMEN'S BASKETBALL COACH KEEPING A HECTIC PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Picture a guy running full-speed up an
escalator that's headed down almost as fast.
</P>
<P>
   This was Jeff Mittie in his first month as the new TCU women's
basketball coach. No matter how fast Mittie settled into a new
town, new university and new job, there were a thousand more steps
getting ready for the Frogs' season, which opens with their first
practice on Saturday. That explains why Mittie, who was hired Aug.
19, has yet to hang a picture in his office at Daniel-Meyer
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   An empty desk and bare walls, he said, will have to stay that
way for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plaques and pictures are still in my vehicle,'' Mittie
said. ``That's the least of my concerns, a nicely decorated office.
We found out right away that there aren't enough hours in a day.
Maybe I'll look back in April or May and take a deep breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittie and TCU jumped on the escalator a little late this
season, thanks to the vacancy created when former coach Mike
Petersen resigned in August to take a job as an assistant men's
coach at Minnesota. Petersen guided the Frogs to a school-record 16victories last season.
</P>
<P>
   TCU quickly moved to hire Mittie, 33, the head coach at Arkansas
State the past four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first met him, I'm sure we had our defenses up,'' TCU
junior guard Jill Sutton said. ``He made a good impression. He made
us feel comfortable. That helped make this transition a lot
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittie said the basketball stuff _ recruiting and preseason
conditioning drills _ has been easy compared with all the normal
headaches associated with moving, and quickly hiring a staff and
helping them adjust to a new job. He hired a staff that includes
Larry Tidwell, a former Baylor assistant coach, and Lonnette Hall,
one of his assistants at Arkansas State.
</P>
<P>
   He met with current players and told them not to worry about
wholesale changes or losing their scholarship after this year. The
biggest change, he told them, would be more freedom on offense. He
wants to run an offense that uses the 3-point shot more and a
defense that presses. In Mittie's four years at ASU, the Indians
were among the nation's leaders in 3-pointers made per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unknown is scary,'' Mittie said. ``What I did was reassure
them that the reasons I came to TCU were the same reasons they came
to TCU. We would try to build on what has already been in place and
help them reach their goals. That will not change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mittie and Tidwell, the recruiting coordinator, then compiled a
list of possible recruits. Some of the athletes on Mittie's list
from Arkansas State were carried over to his new list at TCU. Some
local talent was added because of Tidwell's knowledge of the Fort
Worth-Dallas area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is full of adjustments, and these kids have adjusted
well,'' Tidwell said. ``It's a very unique and special group. They
have made this a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the getting-acquainted period, Mittie was trying to
get his wife and three children settled in Fort Worth. They sold
their house in Jonesboro, Ark., in six days and closed on a house
in Fort Worth on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Mittie says he will always remember that day because he closed
on the house at 9 a.m., the moving truck arrived at 9:30 a.m., and
he was on a plane to Houston by 2 p.m. to visit with a potential
recruit. In addition to days like that, there was the four-hour
orientation that all TCU employees have to attend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't stop thinking about what I needed to be doing while
they were going over things like fire safety,'' Mittie said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two weeks, Mittie said things have started to fall
into place, and TCU feels like his team.
</P>
<P>
   Players have learned the preseason drills and followed the
off-season workout programs. Frogs senior forward Diamond Jackson
said TCU is ready for practice to start on Saturday. The first
exhibition game is scheduled Nov. 10. The season opener is
scheduled Nov. 15 in the Preseason Women's National Invitation
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was barely a bump in the road,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing still unfinished is Mittie's bare office. nn

SHOWDOWN BUILDUP BEGINS FOR TCU, RICE
</HEADLINE>
 INSIDERS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is belaboring a point, of course, to suggest that nothing
seems to last very long in the Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it is a rule of thumb that if you intend to inflict
praise, do it fast.
</P>
<P>
   So, we wish to present a quick reminder that TCU and Rice were
the kings of WAC World last week. Alas, each must play again
Saturday, and both could end up living out the life saga of your
average fruit fly. After all, these are two teams with a combined
5-6 record.
</P>
<P>
   But since an 18-13 loss to Texas, the Owls have won three in a
row and stand 2-0 in WAC play. Last week they made the Killer Road
Trip to Hawaii and convincingly whipped what had become the WAC's
surprise team.
</P>
<P>
   Reverting to form after some early-season turnover problems,
Rice ran 66 times for 354 yards (adding 28 yards in the air), held
the ball for more than 38 minutes, and smothered the Rainbow
Warriors and their four-game winning streak, 38-19.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, meanwhile, is coming off its biggest blowout victory in
years, a 42-0 wipeout of the league's ``other'' surprise team, San
Jose State. The Spartans had won three in a row and were averaging
34 points a game, but they were overwhelmed by TCU's defense and
gave up 300 rushing yards to LaDainian Tomlinson, who incidentally
is the WAC offensive player of the week and the nation's leading
rusher (176.4 yards a game).
</P>
<P>
   In the WAC, it is normally risky to look beyond the next down
marker, but it is reasonable to assume that the Horned Frogs and
Owls can dispose of this weekend's obstacles and create an
interesting collision in Houston on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   Rice's guest this week is San Jose State, reeling from a
shattering loss and forced to make a second consecutive long road
trip to Texas. The Spartans allowed the Frogs 418 yards on the
ground and the Owls are, let's see _ the 11th best rushing team in
the country (TCU is 15th).
</P>
<P>
   TCU will entertain Tulsa (1-4), which has at least had an off
week for extra preparation. But the Golden Hurricane is not only
staggering, it is bandaged from head to foot in keeping with a
recent tradition of suffering several key injuries at once.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Dennis Franchione is making no promises about Tulsa,
but he is hardly surprised at the Owls' resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said from the beginning they have a good shot at winning
it all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, after what they did to San Jose, that'll just get those
guys fighting mad for us,'' Rice coach Ken Hatfield said. ``I'm
just glad we got out of Hawaii.'' AROUND THE LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   _ Banished to the far side of the island because their hotel
rooms were eaten up by a convention of 30,000 dentists, the Owls _
who arrived on Tuesday _ used the episode to their advantage.
Fearing spies after 300 people showed up at their first practice,
they worked out in privacy the rest of the week on the abandoned
10th hole of a remote golf course. Finally starting to jell, the
Owls have rushed for 663 yards in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   _ In TCU's victory against San Jose State, defensive end Aaron
Schobel had 10 tackles, including a sack and a rushing loss, broke
up two passes, and caused a fumble.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not only is Tomlinson the nation's top rusher but Fresno
State's Billy Volek is fourth in passing efficiency (151.9), and
Hawaii's Dan Robinson is sixth in total offense (315.3 yards a
game). Hawaii's Dwight Carter is fifth in receiving yards (117.2)
and San Jose State's Deonce Whitaker is fifth in scoring (12.4).
Whitaker (180) and Tomlinson (179) are sixth and seventh in
all-purpose yards per game. TCU's Reggie Hunt (33.9 yards per
return) and Cedric James (28.2) are the WAC's top two kickoff
returners, with Hunt ranking sixth nationally and James 17th. nn

CONVENTION UNDERSCORES CHANGING FACE OF LABOR MOVEMENT

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Southland union leaders declared victory even
before the last delegate left the floor of the Los Angeles
Convention Center at the 23rd biennial convention of the country's
largest labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's groundbreaking inclusion of community
activists, religious groups and younger unionists _ something that
Los Angeles union leaders say is vital for organizing success _
reflected the new face of the union movement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention ``has become really what the trade union movement
has to become in the next millennium,'' said Tyrone Freeman, deputy
general manager of Service Employees International Union Local
434B.

<P>
   ``What I was looking for at the convention is truly what I have
seen,'' Freeman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The main order of business was a three-day convention that
decided policy matters and the presidential endorsement for the
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial
Organizations _ an umbrella organization for 68 international and
national unions that represent about 13 million U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   But AFL-CIO organizers used three days of preconvention events
to underscore the changing face of the labor movement, including
meetings that brought unionists together with religious
organizations, civil rights leaders and students.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among those was a Saturday rally that drew 9,000
workers and supporters to the Convention Center. The event, which
was held to draw attention to issues affecting working families,
was simultaneously translated into Spanish, Tagalog, Korean,
Vietnamese and Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   SEIU Local 434B, which organized 74,000 Los Angeles County home
care workers this year, was one of scores of area unions that
supported the event. Other participants included Rep. Brad Sherman,
D-Woodland Hills; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Los Angeles; and Gov. Gray
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   By holding the convention in Los Angeles _ an area with huge
populations of immigrant, non-White and low-wage workers _ the
AFL-CIO gave center stage to the growing importance of organizing a
diverse range of workers, union leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The venue also highlighted the community-based organizing that
has added about 90,000 area workers to the rolls of about 350
AFL-CIO-affiliated unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will make all the unions look at Los Angeles as a place
where they should be organizing,'' said Neal Sacharow, spokesman
for the Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, the
county's union umbrella group. ``There could potentially be a huge
increase in union activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention may boost existing union activity as well, said
Richard Slawson, executive secretary of the Los Angeles/Orange
Counties Building and Construction Trades Council, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as any corporation that is advertising its wares, unions
are trying to get their message out,'' Slawson said.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of religion, union and immigrant communities _ a
focal point during the convention _ is familiar ground for the
labor movement, according to Sanford M. Jacoby, a professor at the
Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the tactics remind one of what the labor movement did
90 years ago, back in a period when we were experiencing large
waves of immigration,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the union has hard work ahead, Jacoby warned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolism and public relations are several steps removed from
the tough work of getting people to join a union and convincing
employers to recognize employees' wishes,'' Jacoby said. ``It's
going to be a tough road for labor to expand beyond those sectors
where they've traditionally shown strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles union leaders say the wide gap between rich and poor
in Los Angeles will work to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the disparity between those who have and those who
have not has become so great it has seeped into the churches, the
community, and onto the shop floors where people work,'' said
Freeman, the SEIU official. ``Now people have said we've had
enough.''

TONY AYALA LIKELY TO FACE TAYLOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CALVIN WATKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The comeback of boxer Tony Ayala Jr. apparently will move up to
the next level.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala, who is 2-0 in a comeback that started this summer after
he served 16 years in a New Jersey prison for aggravated sexual
assault, is expected to face former two-time world champion
Meldrick Taylor on Dec. 11, promoter Lester Bedford said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not prepared for an announcement yet,'' Bedford said.
``I think we can make it official in the next four or five days.
Right now, we're working on contracts, and it looks good we will
fight Meldrick Taylor.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed junior middleweight bout between Ayala and Taylor
would take place in San Antonio, Ayala's hometown, and be televised
on pay-per-view.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good fight for Tony,'' said Ayala's father, Tony
Ayala Sr. ``He's improved a lot in this comeback. I'm following the
pattern of George Foreman. What we want to do is stick with
defense, because Tony is thick up the middle, to move along.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ayala's last fight, Sept. 25, he knocked out Robert Koon in
the fourth round in Corpus Christi. Ayala hurt his hand in the
victory, butAyala Sr. said his son will be healthy for the December
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 32, is well past his prime. He is known for winning a
gold medal in the 1984 Summer Olympics and for his disputed loss to
Julio Cesar Chavez in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala Sr. said he thinks his son, one of the top boxing
prospects in the country before his legal problems, is still
championship caliber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is only 36 years old, and I really feel we can fight
for a title in a year,'' Ayala Sr. said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, if we lose badly in this fight, I might tell him to hang
them up,'' Ayala Sr. said. ``But I expect him to win. If we lose in
a close decision and that sort of thing, we can go on. In 22
fights, Tony has never been beaten up,
</P>
<P>
   and after prison he came back and beat two guys.'' nn

PAUS, UCLA RECRUITED EACH OTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA receives hundreds of highlight tapes of
prospective recruits each year. They come from high school coaches,
recruiting analysts and recruits themselves. One such tape arrived
in the football office in January '97, in a Federal Express package
from New Lenox, Ill., sent by a junior quarterback named Cory Paus.
</P>
<P>
   The tape soon joined 99 others in a pile in offensive
coordinator Al Borges' office. A few weeks later, Borges evaluated
the tapes, which contained highlights of the next round of UCLA's
quarterback recruits. He discarded 90 and showed the survivors,
including the New Lenox tape, to head coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we saw reminded us a little of Cade McNown,'' Borges
said. ``We were impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, the Bruins offered Paus a scholarship
without seeing him play in person _ a common event for most
positions but rare for quarterbacks. By then, the most unusual
aspect of Paus' recruitment had become clear: He was pursuing UCLA
as doggedly as UCLA was pursuing him.
</P>
<P>
   That tape was their first date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They started it,'' said Paus, a redshirt freshman who will
start his fourth game Saturday against Cal. ``They sent me
recruiting letters, and I thought, `What they hell are they doing?
They must be interested.' I was honored. Then I started recruiting
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins recruit players from across the country, but their
selectivity increases with distance. Because it's harder to pull a
top prospect out of Dallas than Phoenix, and because recruiting
time is so valuable, they don't pursue players on talent alone.
They have to detect interest, as well, and Paus was very
interested.
</P>
<P>
   After his junior season at Lincoln Way High, Paus mailed a copy
of his highlight tape to schools that had written letters. (UCLA,
seeing Paus' name on every major recruiting list, sent several
letters during his junior season.)
</P>
<P>
   Paus also spent weeks examining each team's style and personnel.
He wanted a pass-oriented system, of course, and he wanted the
chance to compete for the starting job in his second year. Teams
with senior quarterbacks in 1998 _ what would be his first year _
were ideal.
</P>
<P>
   Using every football magazine he could find, he made mock
quarterback depth charts of each school. How many freshmen and
sophomores were on the roster? Which teams were recruiting other
quarterbacks from his class? He didn't fear competition, but he
wasn't interested in sitting for three years, either.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA fit each criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a dynamic passing attack, ideal for Paus'
mobility and accuracy. McNown would be a senior in 1998, so Paus
could learn for a year, then compete for the job. And because
McNown was a four-year starter who never got hurt, the Bruins
hadn't developed a proven backup. Paus realized his competition
would be an untested junior, Drew Bennett, an inexperienced
sophomore, Scott McEwan, and another freshman, who turned out to be
Ryan McCann.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I started learning more about UCLA, I got really
interested,'' Paus said. ``I never dreamed about going to UCLA,
never even thought about it, until they sent me the letters. Then I
saw the players they'd had in the past, and that they were an
offensive power. I saw they had a lot of NFL guys, and I knew that
in a worst-case scenario, which my parents told me to plan for,
since you never know, that I'd have a degree from UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in the football office, Borges and Toledo were
evaluating Paus' highlight tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like Cade,'' Toledo said. ``He could run, he could
throw. He played safety and made an interception in one of the
games I saw. My thought was if he didn't play quarterback for us,
he could always play safety. We really liked him.''
</P>
<P>
   On the field, it was a perfect match. But what about Paus'
psyche? Would he leave the Midwest? New Lenox is a community of
12,000, located 35 miles south of Chicago in the heart of Big-Ten
country. It has Midwestern weather and Midwestern values. Would
Paus commit to spending five years in L.A.?
</P>
<P>
   It was time for the Bruins to do some research of their own.
They dispatched offensive line coach Mark Weber, who recruits
Chicago, to investigate. Weber visited Lincoln Way, watched more
highlight tapes and talked to Paus' coaches and counselors. He also
brought back tape for Borges and Toledo to examine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you go recruit in another part of the country, there
has to be a reason,'' Weber said. ``And in Cory's case, it was
obvious. There was a definite attraction. He was an L.A. kind of
kid. He wanted to be the starting quarterback at UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Extroverted and adventurous, Paus is happiest with a full
schedule and new experiences. He took tae kwon do when he was 3. He
loves ice hockey. He never met a road trip he didn't like. He'll
try any food, go anywhere, play any sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing surprises us about Cory,'' said his mother, Nancy, who
teaches at Lincoln Way. ``He has to be doing something all the
time. At UCLA, there were a lot of opportunities to explore outside
football.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 months on campus, Paus has waterskied on Lake Havasu and
snowboarded on Mammoth Mountain. He's explored San Francisco, San
Diego and Las Vegas (several times). Homesick? He doesn't have time
to be homesick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tend to get in trouble when I have nothing to do,'' Paus
said with a mischievous grin. ``Out here, there's nothing you can't
do on any given day at any time of the year. The only time you
aren't doing something is because you don't want to. I don't know
that I want to spend my life here, but it's a great place for a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced of his talent and his interest, the Bruins offered
Paus a scholarship in the late spring of '97 _ long after he was
hooked on UCLA. One issue remained: the campus.
</P>
<P>
   In July, he and Nancy hit the road for unofficial (unpaid)
visits to Arizona, Arizona State and UCLA. This was nothing new.
During Easter-vacation road trips to Florida, Nancy and Rick Paus
often stopped at colleges to give Cory, brother Casey and sister
Caitlyn a feel for campus life.
</P>
<P>
   They toured Vanderbilt and Tennessee one year, Georgia Tech and
Florida State another. Paus also attended summer camps at Colorado
and Texas, and he'd seen the Midwest schools _ Northwestern,
Michigan, Illinois, Iowa and Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he arrived in Westwood, Paus knew exactly what he
wanted _ and UCLA had it. He called the football office and
accepted the scholarship. Two years later, he's UCLA's first
starting quarterback since Tommy Maddox in 1991 who isn't from the
West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seeing this place was the icing,'' Paus said. ``I knew for
sure I was coming here. I wanted to see something different. I
wanted to try something new.''

CONVENTION UNDERSCORES CHANGING FACE OF LABOR MOVEMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Southland union leaders declared victory even
before the last delegate left the floor of the Los Angeles
Convention Center at the 23rd biennial convention of the country's
largest labor organization.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's groundbreaking inclusion of community
activists, religious groups and younger unionists _ something that
Los Angeles union leaders say is vital for organizing success _
reflected the new face of the union movement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention ``has become really what the trade union movement
has to become in the next millennium,'' said Tyrone Freeman, deputy
general manager of Service Employees International Union Local
434B.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I was looking for at the convention is truly what I have
seen,'' Freeman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The main order of business was a three-day convention that
decided policy matters and the presidential endorsement for the
American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial

WORLD EXPANDING FOR OUTLAWS SEVEN MONTHS AFTER BRAINSTORM
</HEADLINE>
 OF OUTLAWS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Saturday morning after the Pennzoil World of Outlaws played
to a packed grandstand at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, new track
general manager Chris Powell had a visit from Lowe's Motor Speedway
president Humpy Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said he could almost see Wheeler thinking. And when
Wheeler conceives of new promotions, things start happening _
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that when Humpy came to Las Vegas in March that
he came out thinking about the World of Outlaws,'' Powell said.
``But Saturday morning when he walked into my office, he just shook
his head and said that is a great event.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Wheeler was on the phone with Pennzoil World
of Outlaws president and founder Ted Johnson, talking about
building dirt tracks at Speedway Motorsports, Inc. venues. A little
more than seven months later, plans are in place for the Outlaws to
have a 2000 schedule filled with new events at SMI tracks. Dirt
tracks are under construction at Lowe's Motor Speedway and Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, Texas, with plans underway to put
dirt on the high banks at Bristol Motor Speedway. LMS and TMS will
each play host to two World of Outlaws events next season.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, the nomadic Sprint Car series has been
packing grandstands from New York to California. At last, the
larger motorsports community is finding out about the Sprint Car
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is happening out there with the racing public, and
they seem to want to go back a little bit. This is almost retro
racing,'' Wheeler said. ``This was the kind of racing that was
popular in the '40s and '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditional Outlaws venues such as Devil's Bowl Speedway in
Mesquite, Texas, and Knoxville Raceway in Iowa will continue to
have events, but the Outlaws' hectic schedule could change next
season. Johnson said there will be fewer midweek events, and more
events will be on television. Much like it did for Winston Cup
racing in the 1980s, television is helping propel a grassroots
organization into the limelight.
</P>
<P>
   The Nashville Network owns a portion of the Outlaws and had 12
live telecasts this season. But next season, many more events will
be televised, including most of the events at SMI tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only venues that were making money in Las Vegas was the
Winston Cup race and our race,'' Johnson said. ``And one thing
about Bruton Smith is that if you are making money, he likes you.
He bought that track and opened up all these other venues.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does this leave the smaller facilities that have
supported the series since its inception?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is going to be a better deal for the World of
Outlaws,'' said Devil's Bowl owner Lanny Edwards, who promoted the
first Outlaws race in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler said he sees some similarities between the Outlaws and
Winston Cup. He said he remembers the days when Winston Cup venues
were far different from the speed palaces of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid to late '70s there were plenty of places to run,
but the tracks were pretty run down,'' Wheeler said. ``Winston Cup
racing started growing when the facilities started to improve. Dirt
tracks by nature are dirty, but what Ted Johnson is trying to do is
put them in a first-class facility and have no dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the right place and right event, it could be of a
major caliber.''

DAYTONA, TV AUDIENCE TREATED TO GREAT RACE, `THE FIGHT'
</HEADLINE>
 GREATEST-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
EDITORS: This is No. 79 in a series looking at the 100 most
memorable moments in the century of sports. 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As hard as it may seem in these days of ``RPM 2Night'' and
NASCAR videos for all occasions, there was a time when not every
Winston Cup race was shown live on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   CBS executives took a huge gamble when they decided to carry the
season-opening Daytona 500 live in February 1979. The telecast
introduced the terms ``The Great American Race'' and ``flag-to-flag
coverage'' to the motorsports lexicon _ and gave a curious and
mostly snowbound nation an extended inside look at what was still a
Southern sport.
</P>
<P>
   The race produced the sixth of Richard Petty's seven Daytona 500
victories, a fast fact that became a footnote in the wake of ``The
Fight'' between Cale Yarborough and brothers Bobby and Donny
Allison after the checkered flag.
</P>
<P>
   Yarborough and Donnie Allison were chasing victory on the last
lap in their Oldsmobile Cutlasses when Yarborough _ who was in
second _ tried to put one of his trademark slingshot passes on
Allison halfway down the backstretch of the 2.5-mile Daytona
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In this era of Cup racing, nine years before introduction of
carburetor restrictor plates at the Daytona and Talladega (Ala.)
superspeedways, second place on the last lap was the preferred
position. A skilled driver like Yarborough would use the draft
created by the lead car to tuck up close and then pass into the
lead at the last possible moment.
</P>
<P>
   But Allison, well-versed on Yarborough's bag of aerodynamic
tricks, closed off the inside lane. The two engaged in a series of
body slams, which eventually drove Yarborough onto the infield
grass. In his attempt to recover, Yarborough made a hard right turn
_ and hammered into Allison again. The impact sent both cars up the
31-degree banking in Turn 3, where they hit the outside wall and
slid down to the infield.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Petty outraced Darrell Waltrip and A.J. Foyt past the
wreckage and into Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Bobby Allison stopped at the crash scene, where
Donnie and Yarborough had exited their battered machines. Donnie
Allison said that Yarborough walked over to Bobby _ still seated
inside his car _ and said something to him. Yarborough then hit
Bobby Allison with his helmet through the car's window netting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what was going to happen next,'' Donnie Allison said.
``I'd seen that look on Bobby's face before.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison clambered out of his car _ as CBS commentator Ken Squier
probably said that day _ and scored a unanimous decision against
Yarborough.
</P>
<P>
   The day's dose of testosterone captivated a crowd of 120,000 and
the TV audience. A series of storms had kept people already
suffering from cabin fever inside that Sunday afternoon, helping
CBS rack up an impressive 10.5 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The Daytona 500 since has become a staple of CBS' NASCAR
coverage. Combined with ``The Fight,'' it paved the way for the
wall-to-wall racing shows that we take for granted 20 years later.

GORE TAKES CAMPAIGN TO NORTHWEST; CRITICIZES GOP, BRADLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ With a freshly minted AFL-CIO endorsement under his
belt, Vice President Al Gore flew here yesterday to excoriate
Senate Republicans, take on a vexing Northwest issue, and taunt his
rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in a fundraising speech at Benaroya Hall Wednesday night,
decried as ``breathtakingly irresponsible'' Senate Republicans'
rejection of a landmark treaty banning nuclear testing. ``It was
one of the most reckless votes ever cast in Congress,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier appearance, to cheers from a crowd of about 600
Boeing Aerospace Machinists, Gore pledged: ``With your support, my
first act as president of the United States will be to resubmit
this treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, speaking of some Republican senators, said: ``I think they
have a hatred of President Clinton that eats them up.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Bradley to the machinists as ``a good man, and I'm
not going to run him down.'' A few moments later, however, he was
calling the former New York Knicks forward a quitter.
</P>
<P>
   In an obvious reference to Bradley's decision to leave the
Senate in 1996, after Republicans had taken control of Congress,
Gore declared: ``Some people decided at that moment to walk away,
but I chose to stay and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also was working behind the scenes to mollify Northwest
environmentalists over a promise he made last year, but which the
Clinton administration failed to keep.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Gore said in an interview that the Clinton
administration was moving toward resolving conservation groups'
calls for a tug escorts for oil-laden tankers plying the Strait of
Juan de Fuca west of Port Angeles, Wash. He promised that the
process would ``be completed before the rough seas of winter drive
up the risk factors again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, as Gore flew to Seattle, the White House worked to
come up with money to station a rescue tug at Neah Bay this winter.
The U.S. Department of Transportation said it would commit $250,000
toward the estimated $1.2 million pricetag of stationing a rescue
tug at Neah Bay this winter. Other sources of federal funding were
being sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a downpayment. ... I am confident we're going to get the
money,'' said Gov. Gary Locke, who was traveling with Gore last
night. Locke said he has committed $100,000 in money from the
governor's emergency fund to help pay for the tug.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview as he drove between Seattle appearances
Wednesday night, Gore said: ``We will get this solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also faces pressure from Bradley in Washington state. The
former New Jersey senator has been a frequent low-key campaigner in
Washington, his activities ranging from cerebral speeches on race
relations to basketball games with teenagers at Central Area youth
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing many people into first-time political giving, Bradley
raised an estimated $300,000 at a Seattle dinner in April. Mayor
Paul Schell became the first major urban politician in America to
endorse Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Gore also raised about $300,000 at his Benaroya
Hall fundraiser. A crowd of about 350 supporters were on hand. With
Bradley making gains, they were given a full dose of reassurance
that Gore is ready to fight for and win the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to tell all our neighbors, friends and family about
the real Al Gore,'' Locke told the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The governor then introduced Jim Frush, an attorney-mountaineer
who guided Gore and his son, Albert Gore III, to the summit of
Mount Rainier in July. Frush presented the vice president with the
ice axe he used on the climb, which saw repeated hail and lightning
storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This man is not a quitter: This man was our sparkplug,'' said
Frush, who has summited Mount Everest and climbed around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Gore recalled the climb in vivid detail later in the evening,
from howling winds when the party camped at Ingraham Flat to the
horizontal blowing snow.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to energize his campaign, and liberate it from the
confines of Washington, D.C.'s lobbyist-laden streets, Gore has
sought to bring out the Tennessee part of his upbringing. The vice
president lives in an official residence on Massachusetts Avenue,
the same street where he grew up and went to St. Alban's School as
the son of Sen. Albert Gore, Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, however, Gore talked of the small home where his
family lived summers in Carthage, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   He described his mother as ``a poor girl from west Tennessee,''
who worked at an all-night coffee shop to pay her way through
college, and later became the first woman to graduate from
Vanderbilt University law school.
</P>
<P>
   While his father, Sen. Albert Gore, Sr., prospered as a
corporate director in his later years, the vice president yesterday
depicted him as a courageous populist and talked about his father's
service as Tennessee's labor commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He presided over the first minimum wage, 25 cents an hour,''
said Gore. ``Sounds like the Republican platform. Only they were
against 25 cents an hour then.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was against the poll tax in the 40's, for civil rights
in the 50's, for the Voting Rights Act in the 60's and against the
Vietnam War,'' said the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore talked about how he was disillusioned with politics after
his father was defeated for reelection in 1970. An anti-war
activist at Harvard, the younger Gore eventually enlisted in the
military and served as an Army journalist in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was interesting to come home in uniform with short hair,''
he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used his Seattle trip to unveil a remodeled presidential
campaign, shedding his formal reputation for a down-home
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's speech to Boeing machinists was full of
references to his childhood ``buddies and guys I went to school
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from an acceptance speech at the AFL-CIO convention in Los
Angeles _ the 13 million-member labor federation's endorsement
resolution was approved on voice vote that was not unanimous _ Gore
defended labor's right to organize. ``We need to get rid of striker
replacement,'' he argued. He decried what he called ``fancy
union-busting law firms.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday marked Gore's 11th visit to the Puget Sound area since
the 1996 election.
</P>
<P>
   One visit _ the Mount Rainier climb _ was private. On other
occasions, Gore has gone mainly to Seattle institutions, from
Recreational Equipment, Inc., to technology firms such as Real
Networks. He has ventured outside the city limits only as far as
Everett, where he addressed Boeing workers.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, GOP frontrunner Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is
blanketing the state. The Texas governor visited Spokane in July,
and has scheduled a photo opportunity with Hispanic schoolchildren
in Yakima Thursday before heading for appearances in Seattle. GOP
candidates Elizabeth Dole and Steve Forbes will also speak this
weekend to the National Federation of Republican Women.

BIFFLE TRUCKING TO SUPERSTAR STATUS WITH ROUSH RACING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The people who work on his race truck already are convinced that
Greg Biffle is Roush Racing's next certifiable superstar.
</P>
<P>
   Like any NASCAR fan, Biffle can rattle off their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell ya, Mark Martin, Jeff Burton and Matt Kenseth have
definitely set some standards in the Winston Cup and Busch
series,'' said Biffle, a nine-time winner and points runner-up in
the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series. ``I hope that I'm the next
superstar in the Jack Roush group. But there's a lot of folks that
still don't know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ranks began thinning, however, just as the summer began
heating up. And following the outcomes of the past two races,
Biffle has become headline news as the series rolls into Texas
Motor Speedway in Fort Worth for the O'Reilly 300K on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle's 14th-place finish in the crash-marred Kroger 225 at
Louisville (Ky.) Motor Speedway on Friday night knocked him out of
a points lead he had held since Aug. 5, a span of five races.
Biffle trails nemesis Jack Sprague by 24 points (3,437-3,413)
heading into the series' second visit this year to the 1.5-mile,
high-banked quadoval in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle suffered through a miserable weekend in Kentucky, where
he crashed his primary No. 50 Grainger Ford during practice. He
scrambled to qualify his backup road-course truck ninth, but was
reduced to an also-ran in a battered vehicle. That result was
compounded by a star-crossed outing at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on
Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle won The Orleans 250 night race, capping a dizzying
stretch during which he had captured eight of 12 starts over four
months. Combined with his first career truck victory in May at
Memphis, Tenn., Biffle's nine victories established a series
single-season record. The victory in Vegas also clinched Ford's
first manufacturer's title in the truck series and moved team owner
Jack Roush closer to his first NASCAR championship.
</P>
<P>
   But the celebration was short-lived. During a postrace
inspection of Biffle's truck, NASCAR deemed the engine intake
manifold as an ``unapproved part.'' Crew chief Randy Goss
subsequently was fined $46,800, and 120 points were lopped off
Biffle's lead, leaving him with a 10-point advantage over Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   Roush Racing, contending that the manifold in question had been
run on eight occasions this season, appealed NASCAR's penalty. But
the National Stock Car Commission sided with the sanctioning body
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing, but I have nothing to do with what parts
we run on the truck,'' said Biffle, 29, of Vancouver, Wash. ``I was
surprised by the severity of the penalty, but the fact is that I
can't do anything about it now. I'm just going to _ and so is the
Grainger team _ focus on winning these races. We have so much
confidence and so much momentum right now that we like our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprague's fifth-place finish in a Chevrolet at Louisville
allowed him to outscore Biffle, 155-121. The 1997 Craftsman Truck
champion, Sprague has a 24-point lead over Biffle, the closest
differential in series history with two races remaining. And
third-place Dennis Setzer, winner of the Pronto Auto Parts 400K at
TMS on June 11 in a Dodge Ram, has pulled to within 44 points.
</P>
<P>
   Biffle did everything but win a race en route to
rookie-of-the-year honors in 1998. He finished second twice, led
five of the last seven races and captured a rookie-record four
poles, including three in succession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we were there. We just never led the right laps,''
said Biffle, who won a series rookie-record $359,782 in 1998.
``We've fine-tuned our program, been more consistent at the end of
the races, been making way better pit decisions. I mean, we lost
probably three races _ just flat lost 'em _ in the pits (in 1998).
And I probably gave away three races as far as driving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we're at right now, we've really got it figured out.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe it wasn't the Curse of the Bambino that
finished off the Boston Red Sox on Wednesday night, a few ticks
before midnight. Maybe it was the Hex of Jeffrey Maier.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Umpire Rich Garcia's blown call on the
interference by Maier, a fan, in Game 1 of the American League
Championship Series, propelled the Yankees to victory over the
Baltimore Orioles. Similarly, a botched call in the 10th inning on
Wednesday night contributed generously to a 4-3 Yankee victory over
Boston in Game 1 of the ALCS at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After the umpire's mistake, Bernie Williams led off the bottom
of the 10th inning with a home run off Rod Beck, snapping the 3-3
tie in a game played in intermittent showers. In 1996, after
Maier's catch, Williams homered leading off the 11th inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we feel very fortunate to have won this game,''
said Derek Jeter, the Yankee shortstop. ``You get to this point,
you don't care how you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez allowed all the Red Sox runs in the first two
innings, then shut out Boston over his last six innings of work,
before Mariano Rivera pitched the final two innings. David Cone
will pitch the second game of the four-of-seven-game series on
Thursday night at Yankee Stadium, against Boston's Ramon Martinez.
Cone has had 11 days of rest since his last start. The last time he
had that much rest, he pitched a perfect game, against the Montreal
Expos July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's Jose Offerman opened the Boston 10th with a line single
to right. John Valentin followed with a grounder to third, a
possible double-play ball; Scott Brosius fielded and threw to
second, where Chuck Knoblauch set himself to pivot, with Offerman
bearing down on him. But Brosius' throw went in and out of the
webbing of Knoblauch's glove, and many of the 57,181 fans umpiring
in the stands groaned at the apparent error. But the one umpire who
counted _ Rick Reed _ called Offerman out, ruling that Knoblauch
had dropped the ball as he got it from his glove and that the
putout stood.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams, the Boston manager, argued with Reed. ``In my
mind, he didn't have any possession at all,'' Williams said later,
evenly. ``You've got to have some kind of possession of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of having first and second and nobody out, the Red Sox
had one out and a runner at first, and the next batter, Brian
Daubach, rolled into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Reed viewed a videotape of the call, and just as Garcia
did after his mistake in 1996, Reed acknowledged that he had blown
the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had possession before he dropped the ball,'' Reed
said. ``After we went in and looked at the tape, we decided that
wasn't the case. As an umpire, it was my job to get it right. I
didn't. You feel bad about it. I feel awful.''
</P>
<P>
   When Beck relieved for the Red Sox in the 10th, Williams watched
him warm up. Before Williams had stepped out of the dugout and into
the on-deck circle, he had talked briefly with Chris Chambliss, the
Yankees' batting coach, and Williams recalled his at-bat against
Beck last month. The right-hander had beaten him with an outside
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss agreed with Williams that the best way to hit against
Beck was to not try to pull the ball; just try to go to the
opposite field, or up the middle. Williams thought about this as he
went through his usual routine of drawing a line across the face of
the batter's box, to set his feet.
</P>
<P>
   Beck threw a strike. Williams stepped out. Beck fired a
fastball, and Williams swung.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' teammates in the dugout saw the ball in flight toward
center field and rushed out of the dugout, some screaming, others
silent; Ricky Ledee watched Darren Lewis, the Boston center
fielder, and when Lewis turned his back, Ledee was sure he was
preparing to field the carom of the center field wall.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis, the back of his jersey to home plate, had stopped
only because there was nothing he could do to stop what happened
next. The ball disappeared over the wall, and when Williams thrust
his fist into the air, the crowd exploded simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   The calm demeanor of Hernandez instills confidence in his
teammates, in his manager. On Wednesday night, El Duque strolled
confidently across the field before the game, stopping to pluck a
piece of grass and toss it to see which way the wind was blowing,
as relaxed as chipping on the 10th hole on a Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox changed all that quickly. Right after
Hernandez's first pitch, Boston's Offerman glared toward Hernandez.
It appeared words were exchanged, and the home-plate umpire, Tim
McClelland, stepped in. Four pitches later, Offerman lined a single
through the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin pulled a grounder toward the shortstop hole, where
Jeter ranged to his right, backhanded the ball _ a spectacular
play, to that point _ jumped, twisted, threw toward second, and
into right field. Offerman wheeled around the bases as O'Neill
chased down the ball along the right-field line, and Valentin
reached third.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then Daubach dumped Hernandez's next pitch into right field, a
single, Valentin scored. Seven pitches into the game, Hernandez
already had allowed more runs than he had in three previous
post-season starts combined, and the Red Sox had scored more runs
than the Texas Rangers had against the Yankees in the first round
of the playoffs. Right away, Boston marked its presence.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked the leadoff batter, Lewis, in the second
inning, generating concerned murmurs from the crowd. Lewis stole
second and stopped at third when Trot Nixon singled sharply. When
Offerman hit a slow roller past the mound, third baseman Brosius
closed on the ball _ then let the grounder pass, thinking Jeter
would be in a better position to field it. Except that Jeter
thought Brosius would make the play.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis scored, the Red Sox led, 3-0, they had runners at first
and second and nobody out, and the Yankees looked flat.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin failed to advance the runners with nobody out and
Hernandez, as he often does, escaped further trouble and went on to
pinch off the Red Sox offense. It was a just a question of whether
the Yankees could rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's manager, Williams, is not a schmoozer. He doesn't like
talking about himself. He doesn't feel obligated to explain his
choices _ ``Managerial decision,'' he says, with the tone of a
security guard. He is as uncomplicated as a doorjamb, with one
simple purpose: to win baseball games. By whatever means necessary,
Williams directed the Red Sox to a division series victory over the
Cleveland Indians, using two of his starters, Bret Saberhagen and
Pedro Martinez, to win the decisive game. Ramon Martinez, who
pitched last Saturday and is coming back from shoulder surgery,
could not have pitched Wednesday night's game on shortened rest.
</P>
<P>
   So Williams turned to Kent Mercker, a left-hander only three
days removed from his last start. But Williams wasn't expecting
Mercker to throw a complete game; he just wanted Mercker to get the
Red Sox into the middle innings, preferably with a lead.
</P>
<P>
   In Mercker's time on the mound, the Yankees hit 21 foul balls,
swinging and missing just twice. But Nomar Garciaparra was playing
behind him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had runners at second and third and two out in the
first and Chili Davis stretched to reach a changeup and hit a hump
liner over short, where Garciaparra snatched the ball with a leap.
Two runs saved.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius crushed a two-run homer off Mercker in the second
inning, and Jeter doubled leading off the third. Garciaparra nearly
picked off Jeter at second after intercepting Williams grounder in
the shortstop hole _ Jeter was far off the bag, thinking the hit
would roll through to left _ and when the throw from the Boston
shortstop got away, Jeter took third.
</P>
<P>
   But then, again with two outs, Garciaparra again soared high to
catch Tino Martinez's line drive, falling on his back. Twice
Garciaparra had prevented Jeter from scoring in the inning, first
by keeping Williams' hit in the infield, and then when he caught
Martinez's shot. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another run saved.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox manager went to his bullpen in the fifth, Rich
Garces assuming the 3-2 lead, shutting out the Yankees for two
innings before giving way to Derek Lowe, at the start of the
seventh. Brosius greeted Lowe with a single to left and moved to
second on Knoblauch's bunt.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter then laced a single to right, Nixon rushing the ball and
gloving it on one hop; Willie Randolph, the Yankees' third-base
coach, waved Brosius around third, a blunder, it appeared, for
Nixon's throw reached the catcher ahead of the runner.
</P>
<P>
   But Boston catcher Jason Varitek was unable to hold Nixon's
throw, the ball rolling away as Brosius _ late arriving _ crashed
into the catcher and slapped his hand on home plate. Tie game.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter reached second on Nixon's throw and held there when
Garciaparra bobbled Paul O'Neill's grounder. First and second, only
one out. Lowe recovered, though, getting Williams to ground into a
forceout at second before striking out Davis with a slider spinning
toward the slugger's feet.
</P>
<P>
   Late innings, the outcome completely in doubt, Red Sox and
Yankees. The way it's supposed to be.

HARPER COULD SECURE ROLE WITH COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Former Cowboys receiver Alvin Harper's brief
cameo at the Cowboys' headquarters last week could soon turn into
something substantive.
</P>
<P>
   With receiver Michael Irvin and his bruised spine sidelined for
at least the next month, the Cowboys are considering adding a
veteran receiver to bolster their attack. And Harper, who left the
Cowboys after the 1994 season and played with Tampa Bay, Washington
and New Orleans, is at the top of the list. His workout last week
got a good review from coaches and scouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to look at that very closely over the next few
days,'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey said. ``I don't feel we are in
dire straits. But if we find something and it's a good fit, we
always want to improve our football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper has the size (6 feet, 3 inches) to fill in at Irvin's
outside receiver spot and the speed to make big plays down the
field. Other veterans on the market are Michael Jackson and Randall
Hill.
</P>
<P>
   If the Cowboys add another player, they will have to release a
player. Receiver Chris Brazzell, who has been inactive the past
three games, is the likely choice. SANDERS HAPPY AT CORNERBACK
</P>
<P>
   The search for a big-play receiver will not include
multitalented star cornerback Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who started at receiver and cornerback for the Cowboys
in 1996 and has played receiver part time the past two seasons,
said he's comfortable in his role as a punt returner and cornerback
and is not looking to increase his load.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys never looked at Sanders as option because his
lengthy absence and rehabilitation from April toe surgery prevented
him from working with the offense. STRAHAN READY FOR MATCHUP
</P>
<P>
   Facing the Cowboys is like preparing for a pro wrestling match
for New York Giants defensive tackle Michael Strahan, who says
Cowboys tackle Erik Williams is deserving of his reputation as one
of the league's dirtiest players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get hit in the face, kicked, (and) your face mask
grabbed,'' Strahan said. ``He is a crafty veteran. And he is nasty
every play he goes against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Strahan said he looks forward to facing Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' Strahan said. ``But you can't take a play off. You
have to be ready every down.'' TURNOVERS CONCERN GAILEY
</P>
<P>
   With 12 turnovers in four games, the Cowboys are well on their
way to surpassing the 15 they amassed in 16 games last season.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of quarterback Troy Aikman's seven interceptions can be
excused as tipped balls, but coach Chan Gailey said the Cowboys
must start taking better care of the ball. NO IMPACT ON COWBOYS
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel ended the quarterback suspense
Wednesday, choosing Kent Graham to start Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said Graham, the starter since last season, gives them a
better chance to win because of his familiarity with the offense.
Kerry Collins, who played for an injured Graham in last week's loss
to ARizona, was a high-priced, free-agent signee in the off-season.
</P>

HIGH SIERRA: GREAT OUTDOORS IS GREAT EQUALIZER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ Under lodgepole and Jeffrey pine, white and
Douglas fir, aspen and cedar, a team of horses and riders
crisscrossed the lonely landscape. Not far behind, a pack train
hauled freight and the hired hands.
</P>
<P>
   Missing were the cattle, or the scene would have been
reminiscent of the Old West. Instead, lassos were traded in for fly
rods, and the goal was to leave civilization far behind, not to
bring the herd into town.
</P>
<P>
   The characters were as contrasting as the times. City-folk
fishermen with unblemished fleece pullovers and swank sneakers
catered to by a cook and a packer whose Western shirts and Carhartt
vests were stained by the dust and sweat of a thousand trail miles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet up here in the High Sierra, the great outdoors is the great
equalizer, marrying the centuries and all those who pass through
it, no matter how different the visitors might appear. On this
particular journey, the cast realized a better appreciation for one
another; it became much more than a fly-fishing trip: a chance to
embrace varying social, cultural and economic backgrounds and
commingle them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who work in the outdoors enjoy the outdoors. People who
visit the outdoors come to enjoy the outdoors. One group doesn't
love the outdoors more than the other, so they find common ground.
And as long as there is a common denominator, everybody seems to
have a good time,'' our Mammoth Lakes fishing guide, David Moss,
explained at Second Crossing on the banks of Fish Creek in the
Sierra Nevada's stunning John Muir Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was, anglers discovering the ins and outs of a
packer's life, and a cook asking about the subtleties of selecting
a fly pattern when not preparing savory meals for a party of nine.
The learning experience is one that won't soon escape me. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I rode atop Andy, a tall workhorse, the 16 miles from Red's
Meadow Pack Station to aptly named Cascade Valley in Sierra
National Forest. With seven hours in the saddle (but none in the 20
years prior), I was sore at day's end. But it wasn't my, er, end or
even my back that was the problem; more than anything in horseback
riding, the knees take a battering.
</P>
<P>
   But I wasn't about to complain. I was used to toting a 50-pound
pack on my back and breaking out the white-gas burner for
freeze-dried meals. The comforts of having an animal deliver me to
a wooded outpost and someone else cook my meals _ everything from
waffles and hash browns to barbecued chicken and peach cobbler _
for four days was an utterly foreign concept. And check this out: A
pit toilet was even dug, complete with a wooden seat and a tarp for
privacy. Talk about plush. Having a guide to define the nuances of
targeting trout in a freestone stream using 3- and 4-weight rods,
5X leader and size Nos.14 to 18 dry flies was absolutely
outlandish.
</P>
<P>
   While tackling brookies, goldens, rainbows and a remarkable
range of ``goldenbow'' hybrids was the object of our travels, my
interests soon turned to the relationship between the anglers _
also known as clients or guests _ and the cook and packer. Besides,
in the unpressured waters of the High Sierra, fishing is too
complicated a term. ``Catching'' is more like it. If you can get a
fly on the water, you will hook fish, lots and lots of fish. I
landed and released more than 150 myself in well less than three
days; the largest was 11{ inches. There were bigger fish to fry in
the personalities of our ``hosts.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cook, Laura Storm of Exeter in Tulare County, a 10-year
veteran in the business, wondered aloud about the assortment of
fishing flies: ``Do any of the flies really make a difference?''
</P>
<P>
   To which Irvine fisherman Rich Amerian, a North Hollywood
native, replied: ``It only makes a difference if you're not
catching fish with the fly you have on; then it makes a tremendous
amount of difference. But if you're catching fish with the fly you
have on, then it doesn't matter at all.'' The point of ``matching
the hatch'' become apparent.
</P>
<P>
   And our packer, Jim Macey, an ol' hand from Keeler in the Owens
Valley, later chimed in with his admiration of the anglers' skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish that I'd gotten out more on the stream because I know
fly-fishing is an art form, a refinement that people are constantly
seeking and I can respect that,'' he said. ``It seems that you guys
are more focused on doing what you do in the stream than getting
drunk or gorging out or overindulging. Some groups, they want to be
pampered, they want services.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our concerns, you have your focus on the river. It all
works. Plus there is no attitude,'' Macey said.
</P>
<P>
   How's that for copacetic?
</P>
<P>
   Amerian argued the real skill lies with packers. (The cook joins
the fraternity of packers and their duties on the trail.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot knowledge, but there is a lot of art to what
the packers do,'' he said. ``The art is being able to read the
animals; the personality of the animals are as varied as people.
That includes looking at animals' behavior on the trail and knowing
instinctively what that animal is doing, if its load is
off-balance, for example. It's the subtleties that most people
wouldn't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, from my perspective _ a would-be city slicker in the
eyes of the pack-station crew _ I too was most impressed with the
people who do this sort of thing for a living.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow angler Ernie Lopez of Placentia, a saltwater fanatic who
reeled in his first ever fly-caught prize at Fish Creek, agreed:
``It's interesting to hear the packers' stories. They are very
knowledgeable in the scene. If you think they are a bunch of
country bumpkins, they are not.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Storm is the one with the sun-wrinkled face and the pretty
smile.
</P>
<P>
   She's seen horses beat up by bears and cougars ... and so many
in-house romances that she's gotten to calling pack stations the
Peyton Places of the wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Among her duties: ``Get the menu ready ahead of time, pack up,
cook, gather wood if you can, get the water in, do all the dishes
and just try to keep everybody happy. Occasionally you have to work
out a domestic issue or be a baby-sitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the backcountry, women do the cooking on pack-train
trips. And it's the cook who chases off the bears.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the meanest ones,'' Macey said.
</P>
<P>
   With a last name like Storm, she won't deny it.
``!ital!Lean!off! and mean,'' she clarified.
</P>
<P>
   Macey is the packer with the black felt hat and something to say
about politics and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a packer is like being a taxicab driver; you're
delivering goods or a client to a place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But be sure to call him a packer, not a wrangler or a cowboy;
interchanging the terms is offensive to all parties involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, I had seven mules packed with freight and
nine horses to deal with,'' he said of his responsibilities in
camp. ``I've got to unpack the mules _ that is our dinner, our
camp, and the camp has to be set up immediately. Wrap up lash
ropes, the tarps, the pack gear, unsaddle all the animals, put the
saddles somewhere _ under tarps if it's going to rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then it's almost dark and (Storm) is making dinner, and I've
got to tie the lead ropes of every horse to the neck of another
animal and lead them off to some place they've never been before
and put them out on a meadow that turns out to be a bog.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, the list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   But for all their arduous labor, little glory and less pay, it's
the great outdoors that draws these packers again and again, like
moths to the flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't like it here, there is no way on Earth anybody
could hit me with a sledgehammer hard enough to do this (stuff),
because it's hard work. But I like the animals and I like being out
here.'' &QL;

TANNER IS AN ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ ``He's one of the good old boys, an original.''
</P>
<P>
   Spend as little as five minutes with pack-station operator Bob
Tanner and you realize the comment from an admirer can't be far off
the mark.
</P>
<P>
   From his Western shirt and white cowboy hat to the fashion faux
pas that is his red suspenders !ital!and!off! belt to his ``bum
wheel'' _ an old football injury from his Navy days, Tanner fairly
defines horse packing, stock animals, freight and the West itself.
Heck, the dictionary even suggests his last name means ``one that
tans hides.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner is the proprietor of Red's Meadow Pack Station and
Resort, nestled in its namesake meadow in Madera County on the
slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. He owns and operate the
cabins, store and restaurant here and at neighboring Agnew Meadows,
and also manages the area's campgrounds for the U.S. Forest
Service. The resort _ situated just west of Mammoth Lakes and
adjacent to Devils Postpile National Monument _ opened in 1934;
Tanner took charge in 1960, and has been a fixture in the Eastern
Sierra every since.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of those endearing, unassuming, amiable characters who
makes it tough to believe he has any enemies. Certainly there must
be detractors, but good luck finding them; nobody should have to
work that hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a true, loyal friend to all his packers, and he tries to
get along with all of them. He tries to appease them all,'' said
Laura Storm, a backcountry cook in Tanner's employ.
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to get to know Tanner, sit with him in the
back room of his cafe, when the morning coffee and work assignments
are being doled out to the pack crew. ``That's where it's all
about,'' said Stacy Corless, an associate curator for the Mammoth
Museum who recently interviewed Tanner for the museum and a local
newspaper. She was promised a photo for her archives of him fishing
in Red's Meadow as a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The image of Tanner connotes a link to the recent past, as
evidenced by the very nature of his facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red's Meadow is a place that does not change,'' Corless said.
``It's rustic and traditional and gives you a sense of life in one
of the earliest summer resorts in the area. There are no condos
down and there never will be. He works to preserve that feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no easy thing, no inexpensive endeavor trying to salvage
the past while making it viable _ and profitable _ in the present.
Tanner believes packers worth their weight in freight must have a
mighty passion for the backcountry, because, as much as any
recreational business _ and probably more so _ this is a labor of
love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody gets rich, including the owner,'' Tanner said. ``It's a
challenge. It's a throwback in life to hundreds of years ago. Same
system, you can't make it any different. Maybe you have a different
material for rope or a pack cover, but the system of putting stuff
on the animal is still very much the same as it was. They've
changed the pack saddles a little bit. They packed heavier in the
1800s, when they were freighting with animals. But it's still the
same system. We know what they did and we know how they did it, and
we could duplicate it if that's really what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But to ensure the health and longevity of the stock, their loads
now are lighter for recreational purposes than back in the days
when ``freighting'' by animal was big money and operators were paid
by the pound.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's still a business, but the job is to provide fun for
customers. And Tanner is king when it comes to packing clients into
the backcountry.
</P>
<P>
   Though he'll be ``70 at the end of this packing season,'' little
escapes him when coordinating trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he keeps it all straight,'' Storm said. ``You
can get there in the morning and he can have 10 pack trips going
out. He knows when he gets in the coffee shop that morning where
every person is going, and what every person is doing. Not only
that, he knows the name of each horse and where each horse is
going.'' All 85 head.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some great ones,'' Tanner said of his stable,
many or which have appeared in the Rose Parade. ``Spider. He was
really quick, an Appaloosa. Very athletic. He kept you awake. He
was really alert. And Butch. He took blind people on pack trips
back in the '60s. He wouldn't do anything wrong; he took care of
the rider. He was foolproof.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's the stock that is the stable commodity here. ``Good
help is the biggest challenge,'' Tanner explained. ``You can buy
good horses; good help is just hard to come by.''
</P>
<P>
   And if there's no one to shoe a horse, Tanner does the chore
himself. The old man has a sharp eye and can tell from 50 paces the
breed of a horse. ``You can tell what bloodline it is to a certain
extent,'' said Tanner, a 1951 graduate of Redlands University who
resides in Bishop during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   One outsider who understands Tanner and his love affair with the
High Sierra is Bill Bramlette, deputy supervisor of the Inyo
National Forest, the agency that issues use permits for Tanner's
pack station and resort. The two have been working acquaintances
for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very easy guy to get to know. Very civil,'' Bramlette
said. ``Even though we often may not see the issue the same, the
important thing is that we've always maintained a good, healthy,
respectful relationship, and that says a lot for the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tanner may be obsessed with the outdoors but he is not blind to
it. ``The country is big and you always think that somehow you are
capable of overcoming these mountains, but eventually they win,''
he said. ``They're bigger than you are.''

<P>
   MAMMOTH LAKES _ Can't we all just get along?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not in the backcountry _ a place where one would
assume everything is just peachy.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be tension between pack-station operators and
those who do away with the trampling hooves, grazing and unseemly
manure of their stock animals.
</P>
<P>
   The argument _ heated at times, though not widely known _
revolves around the use of packhorses to carry freight and riders
into the Sierra Nevada mountain range and the impacts on its
terrain and other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have concerns about pack stock in the wilderness, and
this issue is the big issue,'' said Bill Bramlette, deputy
supervisor of the Inyo National Forest, the eastern gateway to the
High Sierra. ``A lot of the packers do feel under pressure about
the amount of use they have in certain places.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the feud is mostly finger-pointing. Though it has
been taken to the trail _ where packers say they have been hassled
by hikers, and even have had rocks tossed at their animals _ and to
the table _ where the interests of both sides have been hashed out
more amicably. Bramlette is unaware of any legal or legislative
wranglings involving the issue to date.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among the concerns of stock detractors, Bramlette said, is
the notion that the Sierra is being damaged by horseshoes and
overgrazing, that the wilderness should not be commercialized and
that professional horse packers are not regulated in the same
manner as other visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impacts of stock use in fragile alpine and subalpine areas
has been well documented,'' Tom Suk, spokesman for the High Sierra
Hikers Association, told the San Diego Union-Tribune last year.
``Some of the commercial packers show a lot of care for the land
back there, but some of them don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Suk, whose nonprofit affiliation of 700 members was initiated in
1991, on Tuesday declined to discuss much about his group's
concerns for fear he would be misrepresented in print. But the
South Lake Tahoe trekker did offer this statement: ``There is
absolutely a place for stock use on public lands. We have never
been against stock use on public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   So what, exactly, is the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Suk balked at providing any further comment _ even about whether
his association is interested in the possibility of curtailing the
number of commercial stock allowed into the Sierra _ instead
referring to the group's Web site, highsierrahikers.org, for the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, it may all seem confusing.
</P>
<P>
   To packers, the thought of removing packhorses and mules from
the backcountry is a bunch of, well, manure _ which happens to be
at the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able today to live in the modern age in a huge urban
environment and pooh-pooh manure, complain about it, I mean that's
really hypocritical and inconsiderate and it's putting on airs,''
said Eastern Sierra horse packer Jim Macey of Keeler in Inyo
County. ``Because these animals are what have brought you to your
urban environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses, cattle and animals have offered their lives to sustain
humans since the beginning of time. And to suddenly look back and
go, `Eww, I can't stand that manure,' I mean come on, give me a
break.''
</P>
<P>
   Packers note that horses originally blazed the Sierra's trails
and should be more revered. Horses provide backcountry access to
those who can't walk in, they argue. To allow their stock to ruin
the environment would be a slap in the face of their own love of
outdoors, they claim. And, they wonder, what's next? If commercial
stock is done away with, will the animals of recreational
equestrians then be prohibited, followed by a ban on hiking?
</P>
<P>
   Some answers may be provided in the spring, when the second
draft of a management plan for four Sierra wilderness areas is
expected to be released by the U.S. Forest Service. A key element
within it is the use of stock animals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to deal with the issues,'' Bramlette said. ``The
problem is there aren't simple answers.''

FOYT TAKING THE ROAD TO ANYWHERE BUT RETIREMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He always has been an opinionated man. And because he is Anthony
Joseph Foyt Jr., in most instances, A.J.'s darneon is the
only one that counts.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask Arie Luyendyk about who still has the original winner's
trophy from the inaugural True Value 500 Indy Racing League event
at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. will turn 65 on Jan. 16, 2000, and he certainly cuts a
bigger figure than in the days when he used to slide into a Sprint
Car or prototype sports car or an Indy-car _ preferably one of his
trademark ``Poppy Red'' Coyotes built down in Houston. But at a
time when folks A.J.'s age are content to plan their day around the
next episode of ``Wheel of Fortune'', Foyt is doing everything he
can to remain forever young.
</P>
<P>
   For that we should be thankful. Because anyone involved with
motorsports is going to regret the day when this colorful and
complex Texan parks it for the final time.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, that moment is not yet marked on one of Foyt's
Snap-On Tools calendars. Already a championship car-owner in the
Pep Boys IRL, Foyt is moving full bore into the NASCAR Winston Cup
Series in 2000. Cup is racing's toughest arena, tougher now than
when A.J. won the 1972 Daytona 500 in the famed No. 21 Wood
Brothers Mercury. It may be 10 times tougher than the last time
Foyt competed at Daytona in 1992, in his No. 14 Oldsmobile.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Foyt, who dropped his bombshell announcement in the
heart of NASCARland at Darlington (S.C.) Raceway last month,
disclosed on Monday that his Cup car of choice is the Pontiac.
Financial giant Conseco, one of Foyt's former IRL backers, will be
primary sponsor of the No. 14 Grand Prix. Foyt's Mooresville,
N.C.-based NASCAR operation will be set up by Tommy LaMance, who
learned about racing by working next to his famous uncle on
Indy-cars. NASCAR veteran Waddell Wilson is the general manager and
Terry Wooten the crew chief. Gregg Wilson is the engine-builder and
Bobby Watson the fabricator.
</P>
<P>
   As the roster fills up, the identity everyone wants Foyt to
disclose is that of his first Cup driver. Series regular Johnny
Benson is said to be a candidate. And the names of Billy Boat, one
of Foyt's current IRL drivers, and Scott Sharp, an IRL championship
contender and former Foyt employee, have topped recent reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say at the present time, both of them are rumors,''
said Foyt, referring to Boat and Sharp. ``We're evaluating what's
out there and trying to decide if we want to bring in a complete
rookie or someone seasoned. Ninety percent of the great drivers
over there are tied up, and they're successful. We're still
evaluating which way we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Foyt could be searching for three drivers once the IRL
season ends with the Mall.com 500 at Texas Motor Speedway on
Sunday. Foyt prodigy Kenny Brack, the reigning IRL champion and
winner of the 1999 Indianapolis 500, reportedly has signed a
contract to drive for Bobby Rahal in the rival Championship Auto
Racing Teams FedEx Series in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both my drivers' contracts are up at the end of the year,''
Foyt said. ``They're free agents at the end of the race. If they
want to go somewhere else, I wouldn't stop 'em. Some drivers like
to go and try different things. I know Kenny likes road racing.
He's focused right now, but he might want to move on. We've talked
two or three times and I told him if he wanted to do something else
he's free to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when I hired Kenny, everybody laughed. But they're
not laughing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Foyt's tutelage, Brack, of Sweden, has developed into a
top-notch oval-track racer. And following a second-place finish to
Sam Schmidt in the most recent IRL event at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway, Brack is within sight of a second consecutive Pep Boys
Million bonus. Brack trails series leader and Plano resident Greg
Ray _ who drove for Foyt briefly last year in place of an injured
Boat _ by 13 points with 208 laps of racing to go in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   That will be it for A.J. this year. But same time next year,
Foyt will be 65 and staring down the nearest runway at another four
Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be easier just to plop down into the sofa, and turn
on ``Wheel of Fortune''?
</P>
<P>
   ``I work 24 hours a day, have all my life,'' Foyt said. ``I've
always wanted to do this, and that's the reason I'm doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   As we have come to expect and enjoy, A.J.'s darned opinion is
the only one that counts.
SPOTLIGHT ON...
COMPTON'S POLE PROWESS EARNS PRIZED POWERPLANT
</P>
<P>
   Dodge Ram driver Stacy Compton cashed in on a bet _ and won a
new ``crate'' Hemi V-8 _ when he bagged his sixth pole position of
the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series season at Las Vegas Motor
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Compton already had won Bud Poles at California Speedway and
I-70 Speedway in Kansas City when he saw a flyer announcing
Chrysler's latest line of 426- cubic-inch and 528-cubic-inch Hemi
engines. He approached Ted Flack, manager of prototype
service/engineer, and told him he would like to drop one of the
powerplants into a 1969 Plymouth Barracuda he was having restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He laughed and told me, `OK, no problem. You give me six poles
and I'll get you one,''' said Compton, driver of the No. 86 Royal
Crown Dodge. ``I already had two poles, and the next weekend we
went to Michigan (July 24) and sat on the pole. The next weekend we
went to New Hampshire (Aug. 1) and sat on the pole, so he was
starting to get a little bit worried. Then we went to St. Louis
(Aug. 20) and sat on the pole, and he came up to me and said, `I
guess I need to be getting your shipping address.'''
</P>
<P>
   Compton locked up the pole and his new engine by touring the
1.5-mile LVMS trioval at a series-record 161.803 mph. Flack wasn't
present when Compton won pole No. 6. But during the award ceremony,
longtime Dodge engine-builder Joey Arrington handed Compton an IOU
from Flack.
</P>
<P>
   Compton, who started second and finished ninth in the Pronto
Auto Parts 400 at Texas Motor Speedway in June, estimated the value
of the engine at $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's wholesale price,'' said Compton, who is
expected to be one of the pole favorites during qualifying for the
O'Reilly 300 at Texas Motor Speedway at 5:30 p.m. today.
``Basically, everything's got to be hand-done. I forget how many
man-hours are involved in building one of those engines, but it's a
whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton, whose family owns a garage and salvage yard in Hurt,
Va., said the restoration he started should be completed during the
racing off-season this winter. Compton is leaning toward a paint
selection that will delight true Mopar fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is that color called? Plum Crazy?'' Compton said. ``It
may be.''
QUICK HITS WELCOME BACK, DODGE BOYS
</P>
<P>
   Dodge Division is expected to announce its return to ``a major
auto racing series'' _ NASCAR Winston Cup _ in 2000 during a news
conference in New York City today.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation is likely to include Ray Evernham, who plans to
start a Cup team after resigning as crew chief for three-time and
reigning Cup champion Jeff Gordon two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rumored car of choice? Industry sources indicate Dodge will
go the Ford Taurus route and race a version of its four-door
Intrepid.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler's Dodge and Plymouth brands were consistent winners in
NASCAR's Grand National division in the 1960s and 1970s before the
manufacturer pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's too bad that Dodge or Chrysler Corporation hasn't
been there since they made such a good showing in the '60s,'' said
Jack Roush, who owns a five-car Taurus team. ``It's a shame that
they backed away. I think they were misguided when their companies'
prospects improved and they didn't get back in. They've apparently
made the decision to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great decision for them. I think they'll get
good value for their investment and all NASCAR fans, the spectrum
of the NASCAR show, will be improved by their participation. I
welcome them and I wish them well.'' PRO STOCK TRUCKS TO RUN
</P>
<P>
   The National Hot Rod Association's Pro Stock Trucks are
scheduled to return to Texas Raceway in Kennedale for a two-day
event this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks will run through three qualifying rounds tomorrow,
with the top eight advancing into Saturday's eliminations. Racing
will start at 7 p.m. Saturday, with admission $15 each day.
</P>
<P>
   Also, fans attending tomorrow night's races will receive a
coupon good for $20 for each carload on the spectator side. For
more information call (817) 483-8410.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks will move to the Texas Motorplex in Ennis next week
to compete in the 14th annual O'Reilly Fall Nationals. To order
tickets for that event, call (800) 668-6775, or visit the track's
Web site (www.texasmotorplex.com). PENSKE OPTS FOR HONDA
</P>
<P>
   How serious is Roger Penske about re-establishing his team as a
CART front-runner?
</P>
<P>
   Serious enough to reach agreement with American Honda to supply
Marlboro Team Penske with Honda V-8 engines in the cars driven by
Gil de Ferran and Greg Moore starting with the 2000 Championship
Auto Racing Teams FedEx Series season.
</P>
<P>
   Honda replaces Mercedes-Benz in the camp of car owner Penske,
who will be competing against his own product next season. Penske
is a joint venture partner with Mercedes-Benz in Ilmor Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Penske's drivers have won 99 Champ Car races, including 86 in
CART, but only one since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Honda powered-drivers at Target/Chip Ganassi Racing have won the
PPG Cup Driver's Championship for the past three years, and Honda's
Juan Montoya, Dario Franchitti and Paul Tracy lead the current
points standings.
LAST LAPS
</P>
<P>
   _ Adam Petty, nephew of Richard Petty and son of Kyle, has been
entered in the O'Reilly 300 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series race at
TMS tomorrow night. It will be Petty's second appearance in the No.
34 Sprint Prepaid PhoneCard Dodge fielded by Petty Enterprises.
</P>
<P>

VIOLENCE IN `FIGHT CLUB' GRABS ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A fight over ``Fight Club'' ended before
developing into a big-time brawl within Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox apparently threatened to withdraw all film
advertising from The Hollywood Reporter after the trade journal's
editor wrote a scathing commentary about the ultraviolent Brad Pitt
movie opening Friday. But after a day of ``no comments,'' the
studio backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship with The Hollywood Reporter has not changed
or been impacted by this article,'' studio spokeswoman Florence
Grace said late Wednesday. She declined to elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   The article in question appeared in Tuesday's edition. ``In
scene after blood-soaked scene, it preaches personal growth through
acts of calculated violence,'' Editor Anita M. Busch wrote. ``
`Fight Club,' no doubt, will become Washington's poster child for
what's wrong with Hollywood. And Washington, for once, will be
right. The film is exactly the kind of product that lawmakers
should target for being socially irresponsible in a nation that has
deteriorated to the point of Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox had originally planned to release the movie this summer but
delayed it until the fall, following April's massacre at Columbine
High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, a veteran entertainment journalist who became editor
earlier this year, also wrote, ``The ultragraphic violence of Fox
2000's `Fight Club' has drawn more gut anger from the industry than
I've ever heard. And for good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Fox to stop advertising was reported in
Wednesday's editions of The New York Times with an unnamed studio
executive saying, ``At this point the film studio is not
advertising in The Hollywood Reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Fox followed through, the ad boycott could have cost the
Reporter hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue. Studios are
about to launch their Academy Awards campaigns, which are
advertised extensively in the Reporter and its larger competitor,
Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ``for your consideration'' ads are purchased not so
much with the intent of promoting the film for an Oscar as they are
for maintaining cordial relations between the studios and their
top-drawer talent. Costs of ads vary based on day of the week and
placement but the basic full-page color rate is more than $9,000
for the Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The paper had no comment Wednesday on the dispute, which
reflects the ongoing battle between Hollywood and the ``trades,''
as the Reporter and Variety are known. But taking the step of
pulling the plug on all advertising would have been extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's decision may have also been sparked by a story in Friday's
Reporter, which described the ``angry and agitated'' reaction of
the audience at a prerelease screening in Westwood. ``It's
loathsome to use the medium this way,'' an unnamed producer told
the publication. Another unnamed spectator said, ``It's the most
horrible movie I've ever seen!''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which also stars Edward Norton and Helena Bonham
Carter, is expected to dominate the weekend box office when it
opens at between 1,900 and 2,000 theaters. ``Fight Club,'' based on
a 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk and costing a reported $65 million,
follows a fictional group of men in an underground society that
evolves from no-holds-barred fights to assaulting strangers to
committing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bagdikian, a prominent media industry observer and former
dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Fox's threat of an ad ban proves it is
``going to protect the high level of violence (it produces) because
it's cheap and repeatable and makes them a whole lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Network pioneered such ``reality-based'' shows as
``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Cops.'' ``I hope Fox's response
attracts attention to the issue of compulsive broadcasting of
violence,'' said Bagdikian, a former editor at The Washington Post.
``I earnestly hope it backfires on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton and Pitt have defended the film, directed by David
Fincher, and portrayed it as a satire on issues that needs
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't make art that was critical of what's unhealthy
in this society, then you've got a society that's in denial,''
Norton told the Daily News in a recent interview. ``This film,
whatever you want to take out of it, it's a very substantive and
provocative critique of the dynamics that create certain kinds of
feelings in people in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch's column also criticized the ratings board of the Motion
Picture Association of America for assigning ``Fight Club'' an R
rating, which allows children under 17 to attend if accompanied by
an adult. She contended it should have been assigned an NC-17,
which would bar anyone under 17.
</P>
<P>
   MPAA President Jack Valenti said Wednesday he could not comment
on the rating because he has not seen the film and noted that it's
difficult to establish that acts of violence can be inspired by
films. ``The answer is that no one knows if that's true,'' he said.
``I'm not equipped to say and neither is anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Box office tracker Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source service, said ``Fight Club'' will probably take in $18
million during its Friday-Sunday opening weekend and could hit $75
million by the end of its run. He said it was unlikely that the
movie will provoke violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the film was anti-violence,'' he said. ``Sometimes
you have to be brutal in your message to get the theme across. I
don't think anyone is going to take this and go out and start
bombing buildings.''

BRAVES HIRE WREN TO BE ASSISTANT GM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Braves hired former Orioles general manager Frank
Wren yesterday as their assistant general manager.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles fired Wren seven days ago, hours after the franchise
announced that it would not exercise the option on the contract of
manager Ray Miller for the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles dismissed Wren after a ``seasonlong series of
incidents involving a variety of personnel matters, both with
front-office staff and players,'' said Joe Foss, the Orioles' vice
chairman and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the incidents included Wren's order that the Orioles'
charter flight to Anaheim, Calif., on Sept. 17 leave without third
baseman Cal Ripken Jr., who telephoned traveling secretary Phil
Iztoe from his car to explain that a traffic delay would make him a
few minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves also signed left-hander Mike Remlinger to a two-year
contract extension. Remlinger went 10-1 with a 2.37 earned-run
average in 73 appearances and recorded 81 strikeouts in 83 2/3
innings. Opponents hit only .215 against Remlinger.
YOSHII ACHING
</P>
<P>
   Mets right-hander Masato Yoshii, who left Game 1 in the fifth
inning after spraining his left ankle, is questionable for his
scheduled start Sunday should Game 5 be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoshii's ankle is sore,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said.
``He has been in the training room. It doesn't feel that bad, but
there's definitely something there that hopefully treatment will
cure.''
GALARRAGA TO INCREASE WORK
</P>
<P>
   Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga has received clearance to
begin the next step in his rehabilitation from lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga, who missed all of the 1999 season, underwent a CT
scan Tuesday, and the examination revealed that the bone in his
lower back _ once stricken with cancer _ continues to grow
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's rehabilitation will progress from walking on a
treadmill and stair-climbing to jogging and lifting light weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'll be able to swing \Ra bat\S and lift the
heavy stuff until December, but it's good news,'' Galarraga said.
``This will give me some time to go step-by-step and be ready for
spring training.'' No problem with fans Mets left-hander John
Franco praised the behavior of those seated near the Mets' bullpen
during Game 1 at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no problems with them \RTuesday\S night,'' Franco said.
``The last time we were here, it was a handful of people in the
bullpen that were nasty to myself and Dennis Cook and all the guys
down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They start drinking and get sauced up, and that's what
happens. Most of it was all in fun \RTuesday\S night, but the last
series we were here _ in the 16 years coming here _ was probably
the worst I've seen.''
WEISS MAKES MOST OF START
</P>
<P>
   Reserve infielder Walt Weiss, one of the Braves' heroes from
Game 1 of this NLCS, made his second consecutive start at
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss replaced shortstop Jose Hernandez in the lineup for Game 1
and went 3-for-4 with a run batted in and scored what proved to be
the game-winning run after his fifth-inning double.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had thought a couple of days ago that I'd probably play
Hernandez against \RKenny\S Rogers and with \RKevin\S Millwood
pitching, but the fact is Walt had a great night,'' Braves manager
Bobby Cox said. ``He looked good at short, and he swung the bat
well. He's swinging the bat a little better from the right side
than he is the left side, so we're going to go ahead and go with
the hot hand right now.''
HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the highlight film, and time and again you don't know how
he gets to the ball or make the plays, but he makes them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mets left-hander John Franco, on shortstop/defensive wizard

</P>
<P>
   _ Mets left fielder Rickey Henderson left the game during the
second inning after experiencing nausea and light-headedness.
Reserve Melvin Mora replaced Henderson and became the seventh
player to hit a home run in his first NLCS at-bat. Joe Morgan, Bob
Dernier, Rick Sutcliffe, Glenn Davis, Mark Grace and Orlando Merced
also accomplished that feat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Right-hander John Smoltz, the Braves' scheduled starter for
Game 4, earned the save yesterday with a scoreless ninth in the
first relief appearance of his career. The 11-pitch appearance will
not prevent Smoltz from starting Game 4 on Saturday, manager Bobby
Cox said. nn

VIOLENCE IN `FIGHT CLUB' GRABS ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A fight over ``Fight Club'' ended before
developing into a big-time brawl within Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox apparently threatened to withdraw all film
advertising from The Hollywood Reporter after the trade journal's
editor wrote a scathing commentary about the ultraviolent Brad Pitt
movie opening Friday. But after a day of ``no comments,'' the
studio backed off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship with The Hollywood Reporter has not changed
or been impacted by this article,'' studio spokeswoman Florence
Grace said late Wednesday. She declined to elaborate further.
</P>
<P>
   The article in question appeared in Tuesday's edition. ``In
scene after blood-soaked scene, it preaches personal growth through
acts of calculated violence,'' Editor Anita M. Busch wrote. ``
`Fight Club,' no doubt, will become Washington's poster child for
what's wrong with Hollywood. And Washington, for once, will be
right. The film is exactly the kind of product that lawmakers
should target for being socially irresponsible in a nation that has
deteriorated to the point of Columbine.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox had originally planned to release the movie this summer but
delayed it until the fall, following April's massacre at Columbine
High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Busch, a veteran entertainment journalist who became editor
earlier this year, also wrote, ``The ultragraphic violence of Fox
2000's `Fight Club' has drawn more gut anger from the industry than
I've ever heard. And for good reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Fox to stop advertising was reported in
Wednesday's editions of The New York Times with an unnamed studio
executive saying, ``At this point the film studio is not
advertising in The Hollywood Reporter.''
</P>
<P>
   Had Fox followed through, the ad boycott could have cost the
Reporter hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue. Studios are
about to launch their Academy Awards campaigns, which are
advertised extensively in the Reporter and its larger competitor,
Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ``for your consideration'' ads are purchased not so
much with the intent of promoting the film for an Oscar as they are
for maintaining cordial relations between the studios and their
top-drawer talent. Costs of ads vary based on day of the week and
placement but the basic full-page color rate is more than $9,000
for the Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   The paper had no comment Wednesday on the dispute, which
reflects the ongoing battle between Hollywood and the ``trades,''
as the Reporter and Variety are known. But taking the step of
pulling the plug on all advertising would have been extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's decision may have also been sparked by a story in Friday's
Reporter, which described the ``angry and agitated'' reaction of
the audience at a prerelease screening in Westwood. ``It's
loathsome to use the medium this way,'' an unnamed producer told
the publication. Another unnamed spectator said, ``It's the most
horrible movie I've ever seen!''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which also stars Edward Norton and Helena Bonham
Carter, is expected to dominate the weekend box office when it
opens at between 1,900 and 2,000 theaters. ``Fight Club,'' based on
a 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk and costing a reported $65 million,
follows a fictional group of men in an underground society that
evolves from no-holds-barred fights to assaulting strangers to
committing terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Bagdikian, a prominent media industry observer and former
dean of the graduate school of journalism at the University of
California at Berkeley, said Fox's threat of an ad ban proves it is
``going to protect the high level of violence (it produces) because
it's cheap and repeatable and makes them a whole lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Network pioneered such ``reality-based'' shows as
``America's Most Wanted'' and ``Cops.'' ``I hope Fox's response
attracts attention to the issue of compulsive broadcasting of
violence,'' said Bagdikian, a former editor at The Washington Post.
``I earnestly hope it backfires on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Norton and Pitt have defended the film, directed by David
Fincher, and portrayed it as a satire on issues that needs
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't make art that was critical of what's unhealthy
in this society, then you've got a society that's in denial,''
Norton told the Daily News in a recent interview. ``This film,
whatever you want to take out of it, it's a very substantive and
provocative critique of the dynamics that create certain kinds of
feelings in people in the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch's column also criticized the ratings board of the Motion
Picture Association of America for assigning ``Fight Club'' an R
rating, which allows children under 17 to attend if accompanied by
an adult. She contended it should have been assigned an NC-17,
which would bar anyone under 17.
</P>
<P>
   MPAA President Jack Valenti said Wednesday he could not comment
on the rating because he has not seen the film and noted that it's
difficult to establish that acts of violence can be inspired by
films. ``The answer is that no one knows if that's true,'' he said.
``I'm not equipped to say and neither is anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Box office tracker Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source service, said ``Fight Club'' will probably take in $18
million during its Friday-Sunday opening weekend and could hit $75
million by the end of its run. He said it was unlikely that the
movie will provoke violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the film was anti-violence,'' he said. ``Sometimes
you have to be brutal in your message to get the theme across. I
don't think anyone is going to take this and go out and start
bombing buildings.''

JUST SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE SHOW AT SHORTSTOP 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nomar leaped to steal a hit from the Yankees, then
Derek leaped to swipe one back from the Red Sox, so Nomar leaped
even higher to pilfer another. Derek made a sweet play in the
shortstop hole, but then bounced the throw to second base for an
error. Then Nomar made an even sweeter play in shallow left field,
but unintentionally mimicked Derek by bouncing his throw to second.
</P>
<P>
   The game was only three innings old, but the intense matchup
between the Yankees and the Red Sox already featured a marvelous
duel between the dazzling shortstops whose surnames are not
necessary. Derek versus Nomar, Nomar against Derek. Who really
needed the Yankees and the Red Sox with the way Garciaparra and
Jeter were flying through the air like Keyshawn Johnson in a
baseball cap?
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the game eventually overtook the story of the two
shortstops. Nomar and Jeter are terrific, but neither wound up
being involved in the final run in the 10th inning because Bernie
Williams ripped a homer off Rod Beck that soared over the
center-field fence and catapulted the Yankees to a dramatic 4-3
victory over the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' Jeter said. ``It's almost like we stole the
ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   But any of the 57,181 fans who were not studying the two most
provocative players at Yankee Stadium when Game 1 of the American
League Championship Series began on Wednesday night were gawking at
every move Jeter and Garciaparra made by the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Which one would rob some runs from the other team next? It was
intriguing to watch the shortstops play a game within the game and
exciting to watch them fuel the debate about who is better. After
the gorgeous plays that Jeter and Garciaparra made, the question
should be answered with another question. Who is better? Who cares?
Just enjoy the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are mvp-type players who play shortstop, which is
normally a defensive position,'' David Cone said. ``I don't know
how that's going to impact our future generations, but I know
there's a lot of kids who are playing shortstop because of those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and Garciaparra are talented, respectful, team-oriented
players who symbolize their teams, the businesslike Yankees and the
resilient Red Sox, and, therefore, the two shortstops symbolize
this rivalry. It is a different rivalry now, not built as much on
hatred anymore. That could change during this century-concluding
ALCS.
</P>
<P>
   As Roger Clemens said, ``This might rekindle it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It should. The rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox will
always be intense because they have a legendary history, because
they are in the American League East, because they are so close
geographically and because, for the next decade, it should continue
to be enhanced by Jeter and Garciaparra. Just as it was Wednesday
night when Jeter and Garciaparra combined for three errors and
still managed to put on a terrific defensive display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I hear my name in the same sentence as his, I think
that's an honor,'' Garciaparra said. ``I think he's absolutely
tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who also had two hits and one run batted in to
Garciaparra's 0 for 4 night, countered by saying, ``He's a good guy
and he plays hard.''
</P>
<P>
   After Jeter made a nice play in the shortstop hole in the first,
he tossed the ball past second base to allow Jose Offerman to score
Boston's first run, then punched his glove with his fist. In the
bottom of the inning, there were men on first and third when Chili
Davis' looping shot toward left center looked like it might somehow
drop in for a single. But Garciaparra, who was perched where the
grass and dirt meet, leaped to corral it and preserve a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Jeter, who imitated Garciaparra's toe-tapping
batting stance after replacing him in the All-Star Game at Fenway
Park, imitated him on defense. Jeter helped Orlando Hernandez
strand a runner in the third by jumping to snag Mike Stanley's
liner.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom of the third featured more of Garciaparra's
athleticism. With Jeter on second, Williams slashed a grounder off
third baseman John Valentin's glove. Garciaparra was rushing to the
right, but when the ball deflected off of Valentin, he amazingly
reached to his left to snatch it. But he then tarnished the play by
throwing by Offerman while trying to nail Jeter straying off
second.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's error helped the Yankees put runners on first and
third with one out, but, after Davis lined out to second, the
shortstop rescued the Red Sox and himself again. Tino Martinez
lashed a ball that, off the bat, seemed like it might roll into the
left-center-field gap. Instead, Garciaparra was a human pogo stick
one more time, jumping out of his cleats for the liner. All Jeter
could do was shake his head from third, a sign of admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like that,'' said Jeter, when asked if he and
Garciaparra had a personal duel going on. ``He mentioned something
to me when I was on second base. He's a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way Yankees-Red Sox should be. Fans still argue
about whether Ted Williams or Joe DiMaggio was the better hitter.
Thurman Munson hated Carlton Fisk and vice versa. Don Mattingly was
perturbed when Wade Boggs did not play in the last three games of
1986 because of a phantom hamstring injury and secured a batting
title over Mattingly by 5 points. Now the prolonged debates focus
on Jeter and Garciaparra. Who is better? Who cares? Just enjoy the
show.

A BIG WEEK FOR HACKETT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREW BAGGARLY  
 San Bernardino County Sun  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Here's a classic college football scenario:
</P>
<P>
   Coach of underachieving team pilots his weary squad into the den
of his team's greatest rival, with his job security so delicately
placed on the cliff's edge.
</P>
<P>
   A low rumble builds in the distance. The words ``intersectional
rivalry'' echo above the racket.
</P>
<P>
   This must be Notre Dame week.
</P>
<P>
   John Robinson knew this week. He embraced it. Relished it.
</P>
<P>
   It was his own personal life preserver. When USC was awash in a
mediocre season, already eliminated from the Rose Bowl and looking
up at the Washingtons and Arizona States in the standings, when
their fans were calling for Robinson's head and their alumni were
calling athletic director John Garrett's office, Robinson went and
beat the Irish. He saved his job.
</P>
<P>
   On more than one occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now, Robinson is rolling dice in Las Vegas. A nice,
friendly, bespectacled man named Paul Hackett is in his second
season coaching the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   And Garrett's secretary already has begun to field calls.
</P>
<P>
   USC is again drowning in mediocrity halfway through Hackett's
second season. They're 3-2, with losses to Oregon and Arizona. They
beat San Diego State by a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl? Not this year.
</P>
<P>
   If they finish strong, maybe a return trip to the Sun Bowl.
Alumni can tour all the El Paso sights that time restrictions
prevented them from seeing the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   Many aren't thrilled with that prospect, and, as a result, they
aren't thrilled with Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early in his tenure to begin questioning his job
security, but Hackett isn't recoiling from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I love every bit of it,'' Hackett said at his
weekly news conference Tuesday. ``USC fans expect to win every
game. That's why I came here. That's why I love this place.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett conducts his weekly conference in the Varsity Lounge, a
maroon-and-gold-splashed banquet room located just off Heritage
Hall's trophy-crowded foyer.
</P>
<P>
   He brings highlighted notes _ in more than one shade of neon. He
always wears a crisply ironed shirt, a woven tie and a sharp
sportcoat.
</P>
<P>
   He is orderly. Neat. Under control.
</P>
<P>
   But he challenges that image as he begins to make one passionate
point after another. He punctuates each sentence by thumping his
heavy arms against the unsturdy banquet table.
</P>
<P>
   The air in the Varsity Lounge is jarred by the constant
thumping. Stat sheets and notepads play hopscotch a quarter-inch
off the table's reverberating surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the team is playing hard and playing to the end, I
cannot expect anything more,'' he said, his open-handed slaps
landing in combinations on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a point when we will nose ahead of the rest of
the conference. There will be a point when we will be a contender
year after year. Whether we reach that status this year, well ...
we'll play the games and find out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' two losses have come to conference favorite Arizona
by a touchdown and to Oregon in triple-overtime. Both on the road.
</P>
<P>
   But their three victories were over limp opponents, and except
for the season-opening victory over Hawaii, their performances have
been listless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am aware of the criticism,'' Hackett said, ``but my own
internal criticism is tougher than any outside hits I have taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is a tall man, but hardly threatening. His cheeks appear
rouged and his eyes blink nervously behind wire-rimmed glasses.
</P>
<P>
   When he grins, laugh lines crinkle along his temples.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early for this nice, well-meaning, respectful man to
face harsh criticism. Too early for Notre Dame to be his life
preserver.
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett seems to know that the hourglass exists. That by
this time next year, if the Sun Bowl looms again, beating the Irish
might take on a greater significance.
</P>
<P>
   It might save his job.
</P>

BROSIUS STILL MAN OF HOUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The magical 1998 season for the Yankees ended with
the world champs gathered in their clubhouse, chanting, ``Scot-ty
Bro-sius, Scot-ty Bro-sius.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, the World Series MVP, had just put the finishing
touches on the season of his life. After coming to the Yankees from
Oakland in a trade for Kenny Rogers after the 1997 season, he
exploded out of obscurity, batting .300 with 19 homers and 98 RBIs,
anchoring himself at third base on one of the greatest teams in
history.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius's follow-up this year has been a struggle, personally
and professionally, but he reemerged as a postseason force
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night in Game 1 of the American League Championship
Series between the Red Sox and Yankees. He helped provide the
Yankees with three runs before Bernie Williams won the game, 4-3,
with a homer in the 10th inning off Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brosius has had some big hits for us,'' said Yankee manager
Joe Torre. ``We didn't know a year ago what kind of player we were
getting.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit a single, a triple, and a two-run homer, missing his
chance to hit for the cycle when he struck out in the ninth. In the
seventh inning, he scored the tying run from second on Derek
Jeter's single, barreling into catcher Jason Varitek and jarring
the ball loose before slapping the plate with his gloved hand.
</P>
<P>
   Some believed Brosius's 1998 season was a fluke. Although he had
one decent year with the A's, hitting .304 with 22 homers in 1996,
he was hardly a star. He had spent the better part of seven seasons
in the minors and was plagued by injuries even after he made it to
the majors.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to be a perfect fit with the Yankees, though, hitting
ninth and playing steadily alongside shortstop Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The World Series was Brosius's coming-out party: He hit .471 and
slammed two home runs in Game 5 against the San Diego Padres,
including a three-run shot off closer Trevor Hoffman with the
Yankees trailing, 3-2, in the eighth inning. He finished the
postseason with 15 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   This season didn't go nearly as smooth. His father, Maury,
suffered from colon cancer and Brosius left the club to be with him
in McMinnville, Ore., in late August. Maury Brosius died Sept. 12,
and Brosius left the club again to attend to the funeral.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned, the Yankees had all but clinched the AL East
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's going to affect me or not,'' Brosius said
when asked if it was difficult to concentrate because of his
father. ``Certainly when all of this is said and done, once I get
home it will affect me. But at this time of year I'm supposed to be
away. I'm supposed to be playing baseball, so I can kind of keep
some of these things where they're supposed to be until I get
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night was his first sparkling moment in a while. He
seemed to come up big in all the right moments. In the second, with
the Yankees down, 3-0, Kent Mercker threw a low 3-and-2 fastball
with a runner on base, and Brosius hammered it over the left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stranded Brosius in the fourth when he hit a two-out
triple. The ball looped near the right-field line, skipped past a
diving Trot Nixon, and rolled into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Then he led off the seventh with a single. After he moved to
second on Chuck Knoblauch's sacrifice, Jeter belted a single to
right and Nixon came up throwing as Brosius headed toward the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   The throw was slightly up the line, and the ball arrived just
before Brosius, who barrelled into Varitek. The ball ended up
behind him the catcher as Brosius tagged the plate with his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he was expecting me to hit him,'' said
Brosius. ``I really had nowhere else to go. I knew I wouldn't be
able to slide around him, and that the only place to go was over
him or through him. It was my only chance to get to the plate.''

COOPER NEARS DEAL WITH SPARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Former Lakers guard Michael Cooper is
expected to be named head coach of the Los Angeles Sparks, if
contract terms can be worked out, a team source said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A deal could be reached by the end of the week that would make
Cooper the Sparks' fourth coach in four WNBA seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, an assistant with the Sparks last season, is expected to
replace Orlando Woolridge, whose one-year contract was not renewed.
Cooper immediately became a front-runner for the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still meeting, so hopefully we'll know something by the
end of the week,'' said Marni Colbert, Cooper's agent.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was credited with installing an effective defensive
system for the Sparks, who completed their first winning season
(20-12) in August and made their first WNBA playoff appearance in
the league's three-year history. They took eventual three-time
champion Houston to a decisive third game in the Western Conference
finals.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper was rumored to be a candidate as the franchise's first
coach, but other obligations prevented him from pursuing the job.
He was hired as the Sparks assistant May 3.
</P>
<P>
   A third-round draft pick out of New Mexico in 1978, Cooper, a
native of Pasadena, was known for his defensive prowess with the
Lakers, helping them win five NBA titles in the 1980s. He retired
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper worked the previous four years as an NBA, college and
high school commentator with Fox Sports.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ Bernie Williams wondered what the chances were of
delivering in an almost identical situation to his heroic Game 1
homer in the 1996 American League Championship Series.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Boston Red Sox have learned over the years, anything can
happen. And it mostly happens to them.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit a leadoff home run in the 10th inning Wednesday as
the Yankees survived a scare with a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox in
Game 1 of the ALCS at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind by three runs in the second inning, the
Yankees got a strong outing from starter Orlando Hernandez, rallied
to tie in the seventh and won on Williams' dramatic home run in the
10th.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius shared offensive honors for the Yankees, going
3-for-4 and coming within a double of hitting for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 3, Williams opened the 10th by sending an
0-1 pitch from Boston reliever Rod Beck _ an inside fastball _ to
straightaway center field.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Lewis thought he had a chance to make a play, but the
ball sailed over the 408-foot sign, setting off a wild celebration
by a rain-soaked crowd of 57,181 who came to see the first
postseason meeting between the traditional rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was due,'' Williams said. ``I was just able to get a good
pitch and turn on it. I was looking for a pitch out over the plate.
I definitely didn't want to pull out on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the 10th, the Yankees caught a break when
second-base umpire Rick Reed ruled the Yankees' Chuck Knoblauch had
possession of the ball before dropping it on a force play.
Television replays indicated he did not, and Reed _ after viewing a
replay following the game _ admitted he had blown the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an umpire, it was my job to get it right. I didn't,'' Reed
said. ``You feel bad about it. I feel awful.''
</P>
<P>
   With the go-ahead run at first and one out, Brian Daubach hit
into an inning-ending double play. Moments later, Williams
delivered the parting shot.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was reminiscent of the 1996 ALCS when Williams hit
a game-winning homer off Baltimore's Randy Myers in the 11th inning
to beat Baltimore 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was all I was thinking about the inning before,'' said
Williams. ``It was kind of a setup for the same situation I had in
1996. I tried to keep it off my mind because it is a different
pitcher, different team, but the setup was sort of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what are the chances of that happening twice?''
</P>
<P>
   Boston, which lost its ninth consecutive ALCS game, has to be
wondering the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox blew a three-run lead and wasted a solid effort by
starter Kent Mercker and a strong performance by three relievers,
who combined to hold the Yankees to three runs over nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any questions whether they had anything left after
an emotional first-round series with Cleveland, the Red Sox erased
them in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman led off the game with a single and scored from
first base when New York shortstop Derek Jeter threw into right
field on John Valentin's grounder. Valentin scored on a single by
Daubach as Boston scored two runs in the first inning for the third
consecutive game.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Lewis walked, stole second and took third on Trot
Nixon's single before Offerman's second hit made it 3-0. But
Hernandez drew the line right there, setting down Valentin, Daubach
and Nomar Garciaparra in order.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox rarely threatened over the final eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, the hero in last year's World Series sweep of San
Diego, hit a two-run homer off Mercker in the bottom of the second
to cut the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   He tripled in the fourth and singled in the seventh. With a
chance to become the first Yankee to hit for the cycle in a
postseason game, Brosius struck out looking against Derek Lowe in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brosius has had big hits for us,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``We didn't know a year ago what kind of player we were
getting. He showed us a year ago that he was pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, which dominated the Texas Rangers in a first-round
sweep, had trouble cashing in on scoring chances early against the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had two runners in scoring position in the first
inning but were robbed by a leaping catch by Garciaparra, who later
committed two errors. In the third, the Yankees had two runners on
base but came up empty as Mercker worked out of the jam with a pair
of infield popouts. They stranded another runner at third in the
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hernandez overcame a rocky start and held the Red Sox
to three hits after the second inning. He allowed two earned runs
and seven hits over eight innings. Reliever Mariano Rivera pitched
two scoreless innings to earn the victory.
</P>
<P>
   New York drew even in the seventh when Brosius led off with a
single, moved to second on a sacrifice by Knoblauch and scored on a
single by Jeter off Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's one-hop throw from right field was on time, but catcher
Jason Varitek couldn't cleanly field the ball.

TWO-HERO SHORT STORY A THRILLER 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Is this Yankee Stadium or is this Lamade Field in
Williamsport, Pa.? Is this the American League Championship Series
or is this the Little League World Series?
</P>
<P>
   We all know how it works in Little League. A manager identifies
his two best athletes as quickly as possible, and a vast percentage
of the time they turn out to be his primary shortstop and his
primary pitcher. Either that, or his shortstop is his primary
pitcher. You can bet your autographed picture of Cal Ripken (a
classic RHP/SS in high school) that the vast percentage of superior
Little League teams feature a shortstop as their clean-up hitters.
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of power-hitting shortstops have only occasionally
turned up in baseball history (Honus Wagner, Vern Stephens, Ernie
Banks, Ripken, etc.), and all too often the ball-bashing shortstop
in question was something of a mediocrity in the field. Not so in
the 1999 American League Championship Series. In this series we
have on display two-thirds of baseball's Holy Trinity of
shortstops, each that classic Little League model in full
professional flower.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Seattle's magnificent Alex Rodriguez, and these three
shortstops are clearly 1, 1A, and 1B in the contemporary baseball
shortstop pecking order. Rodriguez aside, the Nomar
Garciaparra-Derek Jeter debate represents the ALCS answer to Wilt
vs. Russell. It will be the most watched and commented upon
play-within-a-play aspect of this unique postseason confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In regulation play, neither man claimed an advantage.
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night the Yankee shortstop did make a first-inning error
in the middle of the two-run Boston first, but it was the direct
result of his tremendous range, as he roamed far to his right to
snare a John Valentin shot, only to throw the ball wild in an
attempt to get Jose Offerman at second. The ball rolled to the
right- field foul line, allowing Offerman to score.
</P>
<P>
   But Jeter made amends, first by doubling in the third, then by
tying the game at 3-3 with an RBI single off Derek Lowe in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nomar, his at-bats were uniformly gruesome. He flied out
three times, basically getting himself out by swinging at the first
pitch. His fourth at-bat, in the eighth inning, produced a foul out
to the catcher. And in the field he was wildly erratic. He had one
error on a throw quite similar to Jeter's, and he muffed a ground
ball. He also made two spectacular leaping snatches of line drives,
the first on a Chili Davis shot headed for left and the second an
even more acrobatic, Jordanesque aerial robbery on Tino Martinez
with two on and two out in the third. That one saved a run.
</P>
<P>
   Each shortstop is coming off a huge season. Jeter had career
highs in batting average (.349), hits (219), home runs (24), runs
batted in (102), doubles (37), triples (9), and walks (91). His
.349 average made him the runner-up in the batting race. And guess
who was No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries restricted Nomar to 135 games, but his final numbers
would have made him the envy of about 99 percent of shortstops who
have ever played. He augmented his .357 average with 27 homers. He
knocked in 104 runs and scored 103. He had 42 doubles. And here's
one: He fanned only 39 times, or once every 13.6 times at bat. In
modern baseball, this figure for a man who makes an offensive
living by slugging the ball, and who does not acknowledge the
existence of what you might call a ``defensive'' swing, is
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   It harkens back to another era, calling to mind men such as
Johnny Mize, Joe DiMaggio, and Yogi Berra. If you're bored and
think thumbing through the Baseball Encyclopedia for an hour or so
is a pleasureable exercise, check out how many men in baseball
history with 500 or more at-bats have slugged in excess of .600
while striking out fewer than 40 times. Nomar did; his slugging
percentage was .603. (For the record, Jeter slugged .550 while
striking out 116 times.)
</P>
<P>
   The three errors between them Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night belie the fact
that each is a superior defensive player, if not necessarily on the
Rey Ordonez-Omar Vizquel level. Nomar originally was billed as a
defensive whiz; this slugging business is a bonus born out of
assiduous work in the weight room. Jeter was thought to be a dream
offensive-defensive combo from the day he was signed. Nomar is as
capable as Jeter of making the spectacular play. Jeter is a hair
more consistent on the routine play, and he has a more reliable
arm. Again, we are talking about a matter of degrees, and precious
few of those.
</P>
<P>
   People in baseball love dissecting their games, and it is very
rare that anyone arrives at the conclusion that there is a
significant difference, one way or the other. ``I don't think I've
seen anything better at the position,'' says Ernie Harwell, the
venerable announcer who called his first big league game in 1948.
``Their steadiness, their offensive ability, their defensive
ability, their capacity to make the big play _ they're just
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   They are similar as players, but less so as people. The
25-year-old Jeter is a New York gossip columnist's dream. He is a
good-looking marquee athlete who had a well-publicized romance with
Mariah Carey and is hardly unfamiliar with the Gotham night scene.
Nomar, 11 months older, is Mr. Private, a classic no-frills guy.
The idea of being a celebrity, as opposed to being a high-profile
athlete, is repugnant to him.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar is notoriously obsessed with one thing: winning. He will
not allow even friends, let alone members of the media, to discuss
stats with him. It would not be a surprise if commissioner Bud
Selig were to open his mail one day soon and discover a letter from
the shortstop of the Boston Red Sox in which he formally rejects
the batting title as irrelevant. ``What does this have to do with
winning?'' Nomar might inquire.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, though a looser personality, likes to win, too, and with
two championship rings in three years as a Yankee, he obviously
knows how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night was Chapter One in a baseball novella of
indeterminate length. Reserve your copy at your favorite baseball
reading establishment immediately.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ According to Yankee records, Orlando Hernandez turned
30 last Sunday. But a recently translated birth certificate
revealed that the Cuban defector is actually 34.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by not only the age discrepancy but also his performance
in Game 1 Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at Yankee Stadium, ``El Duque'' has a
penchant for deception.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox started the game with great success against the
righthander. At first, it seemed he would be lucky to last three
innings. But poor starts are not out of character for the Yankee
righthander. Many attribute his ability to escape from sticky
situations to the hardships he faced in Cuba and his difficulty of
fleeing his homeland. His personal history leads those who assess
Hernandez's talent to assume that nothing bothers the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may look easy (to pitch out of jams), but I can tell you
it's not as easy as it looks,'' said Hernandez. ``It's difficult.
But I enjoy those kind of situations. I like the toughest
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez got off to his not-so-unusual shaky start against the
bulk of the Red Sox order. In the first, he faced seven batters and
allowed two runs before escaping the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff hitter Jose Offerman singled to center, and John
Valentin hit a grounder to short that Derek Jeter threw away,
allowing Offerman to score and Valentin to move to third. Brian
Daubach batted next and drove in Valentin with a single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez didn't get his first out until Nomar Garciaparra flied
to left. Garciaparra had trouble hitting against Hernandez, getting
just three fly balls (two to left, one to center) and a foul tip
caught by the catcher for the first out of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Hernandez allowed the Sox third and final
run of the night. Darren Lewis drew a leadoff walk, stole second,
and came around to score on Trot Nixon's single to center and
Offerman's infield hit to short.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who was more effective as the game wore on, worked
eight innings, allowing seven hits, three runs (two earned), and
two walks (one each in the first two innings). He threw 112 pitches
(70 for strikes) and had four strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's been what, seven days since he pitched?'' said
Yankee manager Joe Torre, addressing the subject of Hernandez's
struggles at the start of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the same thing, really, he did against Texas (in
Game 1 of the Division Seres for a win). First couple of innings,
he had men on base in that game, then settled in. It looked like a
carbon copy of that game, except he escaped in that game without
giving up any runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here they hit some balls hard, other balls they found a
hole, but the thing about it, that's what Boston does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the key inning in the game was the second inning,
when he only came away giving up one more run. I think that was
huge _ to get out of there with only one more.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez entered the game with a perfect postseason record of
3-0. But Monte Pearson (1936-39), Herb Pennock (1923-27), and Lefty
Gomez (1932-38) remained the only pitchers in Yankee history to win
their first four postseason starts, as Hernandez had to settle for
a no decision in start No. 4. Yet prior to facing the Red Sox in
Game 1 of the ALCS, he had allowed only one run in 22 playoff
innings for an astonishing 0.41 postseason ERA.
</P>
<P>
   His playoff highlight came in Cleveland during the 1998 ALCS.
With the Yankees down in the series, 2-1, Hernandez pitched Game 4
on 15 days' rest. He earned the victory with seven scoreless
innings of three-hit ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been able to maintain confidence because I'm
confident in the team,'' said Hernandez. ``I know that whatever
presents itself, we can get out of it.''

ERRORS PROVE COSTLY TO RED SOX

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Make no mistake about it: Mistakes were a big part of
Game 1 of the American League Championship Series Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were the first offenders, on an unlikely throwing
error by star shortstop Derek Jeter only two batters into the first
game.
</P>
<P>
   After Jose Offerman opened the night with a single to center,
the sure-handed, strong-armed Jeter made a nice pickup of John
Valentin's hot grounder to the left side. Hoping to cut down
Offerman at second, Jeter turned and fired, but his throw was way
wide of the bag and his toss disappeared like a comet into foul
territory behind first base.
</P>
<P>
   Result: Offerman raced all the way around to score and Valentin
chugged his way to third. Moments later, Brian Daubach knocked a
single to right and Valentin trotted home with the 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   What a way to begin the night. Pennant-contending clubs
typically carry the hallmark of strong fundamental baseball. Yet
Jeter, with the rushed throw, handed two runs over before the
Yankees even had a chance to bat.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning, Sox catcher Jason Varitek was
charged with a rarely recorded error when he dropped a foul pop
near the Yankee dugout. Leadoff hitter Chuck Knoblauch hit the high
pop, sending Varitek racing to his right. After appearing to make a
nice catch, and holding the ball for less than a second, Varitek
saw it pop out of his glove and drop to the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The official scorers ruled it an error, deeming that it
prolonged Knoblauch's at-bat. Perhaps they were missing key plays
on the field, but nothing was getting by the scorers' hawk-like
eyes. The good news for the Sox: Starter Kent Mercker eventually
got Knoblauch to roll out to short, and the Yanks didn't score a
run.
</P>
<P>
   If it were somewhat strange for Jeter to be making boo-boos, it
was even more peculiar for Sox shorstop Nomar Garciaparra also to
be fighting the ball. But Garciaparra had his problems as well,
committing errors in the third and seventh innings _ the latter
coming only moments after the Yankees had knotted it, 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The slick-fielding Garciaparra, widely held to have one of the
strongest throwing arms in the game, was hoping to cut down Jeter
at second base after gobbling up a Bernie Williams roller to the
left side. Jeter, who had led off with a double, strayed too far
from the bag on the roller _ anticipating Garciaparra wouldn't be
able to handle it _ and had to hurry back to avoid being picked
off. But Garciaparra's toss went far wide of Offerman, who was
covering second, and Jeter advanced to third.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker made the bad throw a moot point, however, setting down
Chili Davis and then Tino Martinez. Garciaparra redeemed himself
nicely on the last out, employing about a 30-inch vertical leap to
snare Martinez's hard liner.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, the Yanks pushed across the tying run when Scott
Brosius led off with a single, moved to second on a sacrifice bunt,
and scored on Jeter's sharp single to right. Right fielder Trot
Nixon made a perfect peg to the plate and Brosius would have been
dead on arrival, except Varitek failed to field the one-hop throw.
The ball out of Varitek's glove, Brosius banged into the Sox
catcher and touched home with the 3-3 equalizer. It wasn't an
error, but a clean catch and tag by the steady Sox catcher would
have preserved the Boston lead.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill followed with a sharp roller to the left side, an
easy play for Garciaparra, but the All-Star watched it hit the heel
of his glove and pop high over his head. Error No. 3 for the Sox.
But it was not costly, as Derek Lowe pitched out of the inning
without further trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of questionable fielding had earlier nearly cost the
Sox dearly. With two outs in the fourth, Brosius looped a fly down
the right-field line and a charging Nixon attempted a shoe-string
catch. The ball landed just inside the foul line, just as Nixon
landed in a belly slide, and the ball rolled past him down the
line. Had it not been for a heads-up Offerman, who chased the ball
down from second base, Brosius would have wheeled around for an
inside-the-park homer. But Brosius had to pull up with a triple,
and Lowe tiptoed by Knoblauch (walk) and Jeter (roller to third) to
get out of trouble.

UMPIRE SAYS HE DROPPED THE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a night full of errors, one of the more costly
miscues came at second base.
</P>
<P>
   The official scoring on the play should read: Error, umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had possession of the baseball before he dropped
the ball,'' explained veteran umpire Rick Reed, who botched a key
call in the top of 10th inning, calling Jose Offerman out on a
force play when Yankee second baseman Chuck Knoblauch clearly
dropped the throw from third baseman Scott Brosius. ``According to
the replay, it was not that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an umpire, it is my job to get it right. I didn't get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's botched call came with the Red Sox and Yankees tied, 3-3,
leaving the Sox with a runner at first base (John Valentin) and one
out. Moments later, Brian Daubach bounced back to Mariano Rivera,
who fired to Derek Jeter covering second to start a 1-6-3 double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two pitches into the bottom of the inning, the game ended
on a Bernie Williams homer. The Sox were left to wonder what might
have happened had Reed made the right call and the rally was
extended. For instance, if Daubach had sacrificed the runners up a
base, Nomar Garciaparra would have come to the plate with one out
and two runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, an umpire for 16 years, blamed himself on two fronts.
First, he said, he was anticipating a double-play attempt and
therefore tried to put himself in a better angle. In repositioning
himself slightly, he compromised his angle. And then, adding to his
own predicament, he anticipated the out call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Umpiring is angles and timing,'' said Reed. ``I didn't know if
they were going to make a double play, and I tried to get a better
angle so I could at least see the base runner _ which is Offerman _
sliding into the bag. In doing so, I lost the angle. If I probably
had not made the move that I did, I probably would have had a
better angle. The last thing you want to do as an umpire is
anticipate a play and have quick timing, and that's obviously what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed waited some 25 minutes after the game before addressing the
media. He used the time, in part, to review the replay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good about it,'' he said. ``You know, it's our
job to get the thing right, and when you don't you feel bad about
it. You take it home with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Reed no doubt will hear from the Fenway Park
faithful, especially if the Sox come home with an 0-2 deficit.
Without a World Series win since 1918, the Boston crowd is ornery
enough without feeling that the umpires are aiding and abetting the
Yankee cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't decide to take 81 years of frustration out
on a call at second,'' said Reed, asked about the prospect of
facing the Boston boo-birds. ``Even though it was important at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Yankee clubhouse, Knoblauch dodged the media, a clubhouse
attendant eventually bringing him his clothes in a room not
accessible to the print or electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, although he was sliding on the play, said he got a
good look how it unfolded. ``He never got control of the ball,'' he
said. ``It's part of the game. Anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman said he told Reed that Knoblauch didn't catch the ball
and told the same to Sox skipper Jimy Williams, who came out to
argue the call briefly.
</P>
<P>
   The play was eerily reminiscent of the 1975 World Series, when
Cincinnati's Ed Armbrister interfered with Carlton Fisk. That call,
too, went against the Sox, though the replay clearly showed that
Armbrister impeded Fisk's ability to handle his bunted ball.
</P>
<P>
   Reed may have been slow to emerge from the umps' room and face
the media, but he didn't hide the truth. He blew the call, as the
videotape made clear, and he made no attempt to cover up his fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt bad _ awful,'' he said. ``That's how you are supposed
to feel if you are an umpire. You are supposed to feel awful if you
miss things that you are expected to get right.''
</P>

WILLIAMS APPLIES FINISHING TOUCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He didn't think it was a home run. Bernie Williams
figured he'd be legging out a double, sliding, getting his uniform
filthy, setting the table for Chili Davis or whomever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was going to be gone,'' Williams said after
his leadoff blast to center off Rod Beck in the 10th inning had
kayoed the Red Sox, 4-3, in the opening game of the American League
Championship Series Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at Yankee Stadium. ``He
(center fielder Darren Lewis) had his back to me, and I figured he
would play the ball off the wall. I was so surprised. It was
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucky Dent was surprised, too. He never figured that his wedge
shot would find the Fenway screen and win the 1978 playoff. So it
goes, this ancient curse, and this time it comes with a twist:
Williams could very well have been wearing carmine hose instead of
pinstripes Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox had wooed him after Mo Vaughn departed for mo' money
in Anaheim, and Williams had been tempted. ``I would say I was very
close,'' he said. ``We had a lot of conversations between my agent
and Mr. Duquette and Mr. (Jimy) Williams. I have nothing but good
things to say about them. But I guess I'm glad I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been here, in the same spot, three years ago. Game 1 of
the ALCS against the Orioles in the Stadium, and Williams cranked a
homer in the 11th to win it. Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, as the game dragged
on and the rain fell and the pitchers came and went, Williams began
dreaming about a reprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all I was thinking about the inning before,'' he said.
``Paul O'Neill grounded out, and it was exactly the same situation
I had in the ALCS. Different pitcher, different team, but the same
setup. What are the chances of it happening twice? Not too much, I
think.''
</P>
<P>
   When Williams stepped in to face Beck, who'd just come in for
Rheal Cormier, he wasn't planning on ending the game with one blow.
Fantasizing, perhaps, but not planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a good at-bat,'' Williams said. ``Just get
on base. I'm the first guy, starting off an inning, and there are
so many great guys hitting behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   But only one of them had done anything. Scott Brosius, the No. 9
hitter, had homered, tripled, and singled. Davis was 0 for 4 and
had fanned to end the seventh. Tino Martinez was 0 for 4 and had
struck out looking in the eighth. It was around midnight. If
Williams didn't step up, they might be serving bacon and eggs in
the dugouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the game was going,'' mused New York manager Joe
Torre, ``it looked like one of those 14-15-inning things.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had just gotten a huge break in the top of the 10th
when second baseman Chuck Knoblauch had dropped an easy forceout
toss but been awarded a putout by umpire Rick Reed that helped
choke off Boston's last gasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying so hard to capitalize,'' Williams said. ``We
had a few men on base and a lot of opportunities to score, and we
just didn't do it. If it took a break like that to get us going, it
is welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   So Willliams figured there was no point in waiting for someone
else to step up. He was the cleanup hitter, the man whose job is to
end an evening with one swing. Beck threw him an inside fastball,
and Williams looked at it for a strike. When Beck threw him
another, Williams lashed it to dead center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to stay inside the ball and hit it in a good part of
the bat and get my hips into it,'' he said. ``And it went out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unbelievable? All too believable.

WILLIAMS BLAST STUNS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-YANKEES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The opening act was, as anticipated, what you would
expect in a passion play, though pockmarked with imperfection,
rain, pain, and an umpire's call that not only will be widely
cursed throughout New England but also remembered with remorse by
the man who made it.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, one minute before midnight and two pitches into
the bottom of the 10th, Bernie Williams, the man Dan Duquette had
tried in vain to pry out of pinstripes last winter, dropped the
curtain on the first postseason meeting between the Red Sox and
Yankees with a walkoff home run. It came off Rod Beck, the closer
suddenly without portfolio, and gave the Yankees a 4-3 win in Game
1 of the American League Championship Series before a frenzied
gathering of 57,181 Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Williams hit an 0-and-1 pitch thrown by Beck, the fourth Boston
pitcher, over the center-field fence, sending the Sox to their
ninth straight defeat in ALCS play. In both 1988 and '90, they were
swept in four straight games by the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who held a 3-0 lead after two innings, managed just
four hits in the final eight innings, though in their last at-bat
they were done in by a blown call by second-base umpire Rick Reed.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman was aboard first after his third single of the
game when John Valentin skidded a ground ball to third baseman
Scott Brosius. Brosius threw to second for an easy force, but the
ball bounced off second baseman Chuck Knoblauch's glove. Umpire
Reed, however, ruled that Knoblauch had possession long enough to
register the out and lost it only as he was switching it to his
throwing hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like that rule is if it hits the glove, he's out,''
said a hoarse Red Sox manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in my mind, he never had any possession of the ball.
You've got to have possession of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late to help the Red Sox, Reed admitted he was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an umpire it's my job to get it right,'' said Reed, a
native of Detroit and a 16-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, who began his tour of duty in the AL in 1983, eight years
after Larry Barnett failed to call interference on Reds batter Ed
Armbrister in the 1975 World Series, understood how long memories
can be in Red Sox Nation. ``I hope they (fans) don't decide to take
81 years of frustration out on one call at second base,'' Reed
said, ``even though it was important at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who began the 10th after Rheal Cormier retired Paul
O'Neill on a comebacker with Derek Jeter aboard in the ninth, took
the bullet for the Sox defeat, which came after three stirring wins
to overtake the Cleveland Indians in their Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, ultimately that's my job,'' said Beck, who was supposed
to bust a fastball inside on Williams but instead saw the ball
drift back over the plate. ``What are you going to do? I'm not
going to say it was somebody else's fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees closer Mariano Rivera pitched the last two innings for
the win and is now unscored upon in his last 17 2/3 innings of
postseason play. He also hasn't allowed a run since July 21.
</P>
<P>
   After Scott Brosius's two-run home run off Sox starter Kent
Mercker cut the Sox lead to 3-2, the Yankees tied it in the seventh
against reliever Derek Lowe despite the throw of a lifetime by Sox
rookie right fielder Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   With Brosius aboard second after a single, his third hit of the
night, and a sacrifice bunt, Jeter lined a single to right that
Nixon fielded on the short hop, then uncorked a throw to the plate
that left him lying face-first on the outfield grass.
</P>
<P>
   But catcher Jason Varitek, who has become in a very short time
one of the best in the game at blocking the plate, was unable to
catch the ball on the bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the right position,'' Varitek said. ``I stayed down,
I didn't come up. But the ball came in and I didn't catch it
cleanly. I think it got there just before he (Brosius) hit me. I
think if I had caught it, I would have hung onto it. A play like
that, you're ready to take your lumps.''
</P>
<P>
   Varitek refused to blame the Sox loss on Reed's call. ``We
thought (Knoblauch) didn't catch it,'' Varitek said. ``But there's
no saying what would have happened. You can't fault an umpire for a
guy hitting the ball out of the park in the bottom of the inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra saved two runs with a backhanded leaping catch of
Chili Davis's liner with two on and two out in the first inning,
then went upstairs again to save at least one more when he took a
hit away from Tino Martinez with Yankees on the corners in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra's Yankee counterpart, Jeter, made a similar grab to
rob Darren Lewis, though for degree of difficulty, the East German
judges scored it much lower than Nomar's plays.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who made just 14 errors during the regular season,
committed a rare mistake in the first inning, when he went deep in
the hole to glove John Valentin's ground ball, whirled, and made a
leaping throw to second, a play he has made dozens of times. This
time, however, the throw scooted into right field, allowing
Offerman, who had opened with a single, to score all the way from
first.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin wound up on third and scored on Brian Daubach's line
single to right.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman was a constant presence on the basepaths against the
Indians, collecting seven hits and drawing seven walks in five
games, and he wasted no time announcing his presence here, lining a
single to center off Yankees starter Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman dribbled an infield single just past the mound to make
it 3-0 in the second, which began with Lewis drawing a full-count
walk, stealing second, and advancing to third on Nixon's base hit.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Advantage, Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Again.
</P>
<P>
   Six more of these might put New England into emotional
overdrive. Maybe it would be like too much cookie dough.
</P>
<P>
   One minute before the stroke of midnight Wednesday, in the
bottom of the 10th inning, Bernie Williams crunched Rod Beck's
second pitch, sending it over the wall in center to give the mighty
world champions a 4-3 victory over the Red Sox in the first game of
hardball's holy war.
</P>
<P>
   This being Red Sox-Yankees, naturally there was a controversial
call right before the defining moment. And, naturally, it went
against the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the 10th, Boston had Jose Offerman on first with
no outs when John Valentin hit a hard grounder to third. Scott
Brosius fired the ball to second to force Offerman but the throw
hit Chuck Knoblauch's glove and bounced out. However, umpire Rick
Reed ruled Offerman out, claiming Knoblauch dropped the ball while
transferring it to his throwing hand. Brian Daubach, the Sox' next
batter, grounded into an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Before you could say ``Larry Barnett,'' Williams was rounding
the bases, Beck was making that long, lonely walk to the dugout,
and delirious Yankee fans were waving banners taunting the Sox
about the Curse of You Know Who.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, he didn't have possession,'' said Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``You've got to have some kind of possession of the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   If they're all like this, it might be too much.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox-Yankees. Side by side for an entire century and 1,832
regular-season games _ eyeballing one another from 200 miles on
opposite ends of Connecticut _ this was their first postseason
meeting. They get to play at least three more of these games. Maybe
six.
</P>
<P>
   Six more. That would be too good. Just try to imagine Pedro
Martinez vs. Roger Clemens in a Game 7 at Yankee Stadium for the
right to represent the American League in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the USAir/Delta shuttle series is inciting debate in
dormitories, brokerage houses, and law offices throughout New
England and New York. There was certainly plenty of energy in the
Bronx. It was not a night to be sporting Boston Red Sox garb. Only
fools rush into Yankee Stadium wearing Sox caps.
</P>
<P>
   It was a late-arriving crowd. Probably there is just too much to
do these days if you are a New York baseball fan. The Mets' playoff
game against the Braves was on television during the afternoon, and
fans who hung till the finish might have gotten stuck in traffic en
route to the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams said before the game he still had his lucky Baby
Ruth candy bar. The candy was on his desk for all three games of
the Sox' September sweep in Yankee Stadium and has been with him
ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The most spontaneous pregame roar came when the megaboard in
center flashed the image of Bucky Dent's 1978 pop fly homer off
Mike Torrez. The Sox had to sit through the entire video, which
also featured Dave Righetti's no-hitter against the Red Sox and
Wade Boggs riding a horse after the Yankees won in '96.
</P>
<P>
   The first game of Apocalypse Now was not particularly
well-played. Nomar Garciaparra made two spectacular leaping,
run-saving catches, then made two errors. The Sox had three errors
on the night.
</P>
<P>
   Boston led, 3-0, in the second, but Brosius homered in the
bottom of the inning, inspiring the first ``Boston Sucks'' chants.
An inning later, Bryce Florie was warming up in the Boston bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee starter Orlando Hernandez settled down nicely and lasted
eight innings before yielding to Mariano Rivera. Red Sox starter
Kent Mercker yielded to Rich Garces, who gave way to Derek Lowe,
who handed the ball to Virtual Rheal Cormier. Rod Beck came on in
the 10th. For two pitches. And one loss.
</P>
<P>
   No one said this was going to be easy, but the Red Sox did what
Jimy promised they would do in the first game against the mighty
Yanks. They competed. They made Yankee Stadium quiet a few times.
This is what the Yankees too often have been able to do in Boston.
They've been able to make scared Red Sox fans sit on their hands
and wait for something bad to happen. Not now. It will not be quiet
at Fenway Saturday when Pedro and Roger match up for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   One down. Three, four, five, or six more left. The Sox go at 'em
with Brothers Martinez Thursday night and Saturday.

WILLIAMS FORCES ISSUE ON CALL 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-ANALYSIS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jimy Williams is a guy with a high boiling point, but
his patience was severely tested Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   His anger was fueled mainly by a 10th-inning call by second-base
umpire Rick Reed. Jose Offerman, who led off with a single, was
called out at second on John Valentin's grounder to third, even
though Yankees second baseman Chuck Knoblauch dropped the ball on
the force play.
</P>
<P>
   But was it a putout? From Williams's view, the ball was never in
Knoblauch's glove and he never had possession. Reed ruled that the
runner was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out (to argue) very often,'' said the Red Sox
skipper, clearly disgusted by the call. ``But it seems like the
rule is that if it hits the glove, you're out. But in my mind, you
have got to have possession of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   After three straight postseason victories, the Red Sox finally
tasted defeat in a 4-3 loss to the defending world champion Yankees
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night. The winning homer by Bernie Williams brought a
quick ending in the bottom of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee manager Joe Torre said he was surprised by how fast the
game turned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie is unpredictable,'' said Torre. ``He comes up large
sometimes, most of the time. I think the thing that surprised me
was that it was so quick. Two pitches, bang! and it was over.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the game was going, it looked like one of those
14-15-inning games. I wasn't sure the (home run) ball was out until
I looked at (center fielder) Darren Lewis and he had his back
turned. At that point I sensed the game was over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a repeat of a game-winning homer by the Yankee center
fielder, who gave New York a 5-4 victory over Baltimore in the 1996
American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams had some other problems with the way the game was
played. Three errors, two by Nomar Garciaparra, deflated the
defensive confidence the Red Sox had showed in beating Cleveland in
the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' said Williams of Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's misgivings.
``First, you tip a cap to their pitching. We had opportunities and
there were some good plays out there. But we made some errors that
hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it during the season. If you get some of those
base hits with men on base and two out, it helps you win
ballgames.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Kent Mercker did his job, as did relievers Rich Garces
and Rheal Cormier. But not so with Derek Lowe and Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mercker gave us 12 outs and they only scored two runs,'' said
Williams. ``That's a commendable job. Beck was in there because he
does a pretty good job against lefthanders. He tried to place his
pitch to Bernie. It just didn't work. But I believe in the guy and
the decision to bring him in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker was given a 3-0 lead in the first two innings, only to
give up a two-run homer to Scott Brosius in the home half of the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee third baseman later scored the tying run in the
seventh inning on Derek Jeter's single. Lowe, the usually steady
Red Sox reliever, was the victim. The throw home by right fielder
Trot Nixon beat Brosius to the plate, but catcher Jason Varitek
couldn't handle the throw, and Brosius scored on a collision at
home plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, I didn't think there would be a play
at the plate,'' Torre said. ``You have to give credit to Nixon, who
made a good throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know until I saw the replay on the scoreboard that
Varitek dropped the ball.''

WEIGHT OF HISTORY TOO MUCH FOR GARCIAPARRA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Part of the reason some believe Nomar Garciaparra can
lead the Red Sox to baseball's Promised Land is that Garciaparra
does not believe.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't believe that the Red Sox are cursed.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't buy into the notion of a franchise snakebit by
decades of bad luck and horrific plot twists and tormented fans.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra never did accept the folklore that said it was the
gods, the fates and the furies denying the Red Sox a fair shot at
baseball immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, in Game 1 of the American League Championship
Series, Garciaparra seemed bent on writing a new script for his
forlorn franchise.
</P>
<P>
   It started in the first inning, in the province of the Red Sox's
dreaded rival, just moments after Garciaparra's Yankee counterpart,
Derek Jeter, committed an error that opened the door to a 2-0
Boston lead.
</P>
<P>
   Lean, focused and spring-coiled like a rattler, the Red Sox's
best player levitated off the infield dirt at Yankee Stadium to rob
designated hitter Chili Davis of a hit.
</P>
<P>
   With a better vertical leap than some NBA players, Garciaparra
soared to snag Davis' screamer, saving at least one run, possibly
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how high I can jump,'' Garciaparra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they try to hit them higher, I won't know. As long as
it's high enough to go get the ball, that's good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But in those brilliant early moments, one got the feeling
Garciaparra was going to do what he was created to do _ upend the
Yanks and history, too.
</P>
<P>
   Then he did it again in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Playing like the best shortstop in the game, Garciaparra went
high to rob another Yankees hitter, this time Tino Martinez, ending
another inning with two runners stranded.
</P>
<P>
   Everything felt right. One sensed a long overdue reprieve for
the Sox, perhaps an end to 80 years of pain and suffering, of Bucky
Dent home runs and Bill Buckner blunders and assorted indignities
that millions of New Englanders have yet to recover from.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, for Garciaparra and the Sox, the crusade to crush the
so-called curse was temporarily postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, defending World Champions and owners of 24 World
Series titles, got the huge benefit of a bad call last night.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the 10th, second-base umpire Rick Reed called
Boston baserunner Jose Offerman out, even though Yankees second
baseman Chuck Knoblauch bobbled the ball and never had possession
on a potential double-play feed from Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox went quietly after that, never giving Garciaparra and
the heart of the Boston order another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed the good omens of a quick start transmuted into more
bad karma for the Red Sox, unless you're Garciaparra, who refuses
to buy into any of that.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the 10th, it was Bernie Williams _ the Yankee
who nearly moved to Boston in free agency _ who hit the second
pitch from reliever Rod Beck over the wall in straightaway center,
securing a 4-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now was the Curse of the Bambino back to haunt the Sox?
</P>
<P>
   Not if you ask Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say that's the difference in the game,'' he said of
the kicked call at second base. ``They're going out there and doing
their job as best they can. I didn't see the play, but I'm sure he
made the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment came just as Reed admitted to reporters that he had
indeed blown the call, leaving the ump feeling ``awful.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the new Red Sox mindset that there are no supernatural
elements influencing the outcome, Garciaparra refused to blame the
loss on the ump's call or anything else. That's just the way the
ball bounced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing to hang our heads about,'' Garciaparra said,
smiling for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, it's a good game when you go into extra innings
like that. Everybody did their job. It was a battle either way. Now
we just come back out (tonight) and play again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with the loss, without a doubt. But am I going
to walk home with my head down? No, not at all. We've still got a
lot of baseball left. We've been in this position before. This is
nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the American League Division Series, Garciaparra
made light of the fact that the Sox had their backs to the wall
against Cleveland, only to come back to win the series and a chance
to play the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that come-from-behind scenario is what made it easy for
Garciaparra to suggest that the best of the Red Sox is yet to come,
no matter how much everyone is stuck on counting them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, we're down 0-1, but that's not where we want them.
(We'll be in good shape being) down 0-2,'' Garciaparra said
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, nothing is going to spook these Red Sox into
believing uncontrollable forces are against them. Not this time. No
matter what.

BECK WAS BRIEF IN HIS RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BECK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jason Varitek saw the pitch that Rod Beck threw and
almost winced. The fastball was sliding back over the plate ``and
Bernie (Williams) knows what to do when he gets a mistake,'' said
the Red Sox catcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was only Rod Beck's second pitch of the 10th inning but
Beck's first pitch, almost an exact precursor of the one to follow,
was also fat, a ball over the middle of the plate. But Williams
didn't swing at the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fastball, fastball inside,'' said Beck, who seemed to
get away with a near-death experience when New York's Williams
didn't swing at the first pitch. ``I wanted to repeat the same
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   So Beck thought his first pitch had been good ``and I got the
first one in there, and it was a real good pitch, right on the
black (of the corner), and I felt I had the release point on that.
And I was going right back in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rod Beck is a veteran reliever, with a thick hide and a short
memory, but Beck has seen enough extra-inning games to know ``games
like this are won by home runs a lot. Unfortunately, I threw the
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a terrible pitch. ``It started out on the inside and
then it came back over the middle,'' he said. ``It was a bad time
for a bad pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still unknown if Beck can be the closer he was with the
Giants and Cubs. Arm surgery has cut back his velocity and it's
just as unknown if Red Sox manager Jimy Williams might save Derek
Lowe for the closer's role the next time; but Lowe had to be used
as a set-up man Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, and he gave up the tying run in
the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   And that time, too, Varitek had the perfect view of a ball that
just moved the wrong way at the last instant. That time the ball
was coming from the arm of right fielder Trot Nixon, whose perfect
throw beat the Yankees' Scott Brosius to the plate by several feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was blocking the plate, and I had nowhere to go but to go
over him,'' said Brosius. Which he did, bowling over Varitek an
instant after Nixon's throw arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's throw had started up the line, said Varitek, ``and it
had a little tail on it. Then it skipped on the grass and . . .
well, it handcuffed me. So I never had a handle on it and therefore
I didn't catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt he would have tagged Brosius out, said Varitek, if the
ball hadn't skipped on the wet infield grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball came in and I took it off the base of my glove, the
heel of my glove, and I never caught the ball before impact and the
impact didn't knock it out,'' said Varitek. ``If I would have
caught it, I would have held onto the ball and he would have been
out.''
</P>
<P>
   So the game was tied at 3-3, bringing the teams to the climactic
10th. In the Boston's half, Jose Offerman was called out at second
even though second baseman Chuck Knoblauch apparently never caught
the ball before attempting to wheel toward first and complete a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even on replay, he didn't even come close to catching the
ball,'' said Varitek. But the Red Sox catcher is ever the realist
and added, ``You can't ever say what would have happened after
that. Regardless, Bernie hit that homer.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rod Beck, he of the thick hide and short memory, vowed he
will forget about it quickly. ``I've been around way too long to
worry about something like that,'' he said.

TORRE FINALLY TURNS TO CONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He hasn't thrown a pitch judged by an umpire in 10
days. David Cone is more tanned, rested, and ready than Richard
Nixon ever was. He may even have cobwebs hanging from his right
arm.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees rubbed out the Rangers so quickly in their Division
Series last week that Cone never got to take the mound. Thursday
night _ finally _ he gets the call and the ball in the second game
of the American League Championship Series against the Red Sox
here. Will he be loose and limber? Or stiffer than the Tin Man?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather be well-rested than the converse, coming in a
little tired, maybe a little hurt,'' says Cone, who hasn't appeared
in a game since he beat Tampa Bay, 3-2, Oct. 2. ``The last time I
had this much rest was during the All-Star break. Then I came out
and pitched a perfect game.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone has been decidedly imperfect since he zeroed out the Expos
July 18, going 2-5 with a 4.82 ERA in 13 starts. ``I've thought
about that a lot during the last six weeks,'' he says. ``After the
perfect game, I was so guarded because I didn't want it to affect
me. Especially for my next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone's next start, against the Indians, was harrowing. He
allowed six runs on six hits in four innings, walked four, threw a
wild pitch, and served up a grand slam to Robbie Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   That sent him into a downward spiral that bottomed out with a
winless streak that stretched across eight starts from mid-August
to late September, the longest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I ever stopped and enjoyed the perfect game,''
Cone concluded. ``I only watched it once. I should have savored it
a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   Given his woes down the stretch, Cone wasn't upset when he
wasn't penciled into the rotation against Texas. And given New
York's starting depth, he knew he might get the ball only once
against Boston. ``If he (manager Joe Torre) wanted to just plug me
into Game 4, I was prepared to deal with that,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre wasn't about to put a man on light duty who's pitched
in nine postseason games and had four World Series starts. So he's
scheduled Cone both for Thursday night and for Monday's Game 5 in
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I always know I'm going to get from David Cone
is the effort,'' Torre says. ``He may not have his sharpness, may
not have his good fastball, but he finds ways to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, Cone has had enough time to savor his afternoon of
perfection, deconstruct his slump, catch up on his correspondence,
and even compose an operetta if he cared to. Some wars don't last
10 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times during the second half of the season when I
did have some doubts, but I'm eager to pitch,'' Cone says. ``I've
been in this position a lot. I relish the opportunity.''

RAMON MARTINEZ NICE SURPRISE PACKAGE FOR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-R. MARTINEZ-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Red Sox team physician Arthur Pappas had to ponder
long and hard about which Martinez brother surprised him more:
Pedro, who pitched six no-hit innings Monday against Cleveland when
virtually no one _ including Pappas _ thought he could go more than
two innings, or Ramon, who underwent shoulder surgery 16 months
ago?
</P>
<P>
   ``Both surprised me,'' said Pappas, replying diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox were confident when they signed Ramon Martinez March
11 that the 31-year-old righthander would pitch this season. Only
not here, not in the majors, and certainly not in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But Ramon Martinez will take the mound Thursday night, just as
he took the mound Saturday afternoon at Fenway Park, his Red Sox
down 0-2 to the Indians. Martinez kept the Indians at bay that
afternoon until an offensive explosion revived the Red Sox' hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five days ago, we were in Fenway Park and it was a very tight
game because we were 0-2,'' said Ramon. ``(Now) I got that in my
mind and I think a lot about that game and (how we) got the chance
to get back in and win the last three games. This time I hope
everything goes the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing he can say about the Yankee lineup, he went on,
``because I haven't faced them before. But I did watch (the
Yankees) many times.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, of course, also has never faced Martinez. Sox manager
Jimy Williams was forced to call on him late in the regular season
when he was short a starter. Since then, Martinez has flourished
and now is Williams's second choice.
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for that fate, Martinez probably would not be on
the Red Sox' postseason roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I understood it,'' said the righthander, ``and I tell Jimy
that if I have any chance that I can get into games, to get that
chance, and that is what happened. So they give me that chance and
here I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Few who follow Boston baseball don't know the differences
between Pedro and Ramon, that Ramon has the quiet bearing of the
Dominican Republic's delegate to the United States while Pedro, 28,
is the seldom-silent cutup and chatterbox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a little different,'' said Ramon. ``I mean, I don't
know . . . I am a little (more) quiet than him and he can talk a
little more than I do. He is a big competitor as well as me . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon's story is well-known in Boston. He rehabilitated from
shoulder surgery 16 months ago and pitched in five leagues this
season (Gulf Coast, Florida State, Eastern, International, and
American).
</P>
<P>
   Many a time Ramon thought of quitting, and either his brother's
words or his own resolve kept him going. ``When I start my rehab,
when I start my throwing, that was the hardest part because there
was a lot of pain, sore days where I say, `I probably am not going
to make it,' '' Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of (soreness), but I never stopped, I never
give up. I mean, I am pretty much well right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Martinez thinks he is much the same pitcher who had been
the ace of the Dodgers' organization before his surgery. Martinez
said he doesn't really sense any difference between the pitcher he
was then and the pitcher he is now, except perhaps for his
velocity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But everything else is here,'' he said. ``I don't have any
problem with my arm. I can throw all my pitches. And I feel better
and better.''

SUPPORT BREWING FOR COOPERATIVES' COFFEE BEANS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  When coffee lovers sip a cup of java, they may find something
in the swirling vapors. A flash of energy, perhaps, or inspiration,
or even a bit of poetry.
<P>
   Santiago Rivera hopes they will see him and his family.
</P>
<P>
   To Rivera, a member of a Nicaraguan coffee-growing cooperative,
and tens of thousands of small farmers in Latin America, the bean
is their survival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in homes and cafes throughout North America, it seems many
people are seeing Rivera in their cups. The vision is giving coffee
a new cachet and offering the people who grow it a better life.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer support is growing fast for gourmet coffee labeled with
the ``fair-trade'' certification _ meaning that the importers buy
from cooperatives only, not large plantations; pay the growers
$1.26 per pound, more than double the average current price; and
give much-needed credit and technical assistance, such as help in
transitioning to organic farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair-trade'' certified beans retail at a premium price, about
$8 to $10 per pound _ the average for gourmet coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers say they're saving the world one latte at a time. Growers
just call it a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``With fair-trade coffee, we make a better life for our families
and communities,'' said Rivera, whose cooperative is near the
northern Nicaraguan town of Somoto.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coffee always has been a very unforgiving business, but to us
it's a way of life, it means a lot. We're glad that Americans are
starting to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most coffee growers in Nicaragua, Rivera has been poor all
his life. Preyed upon by coffee middlemen and subject to the abrupt
price swings caused by international speculators, he couldn't get
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Nicaragua's coffee zones were ripped asunder by
the Contra rebel war. In the '90s, the growers were hit again, this
time by a severe credit crunch and a wave of kidnappings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three years ago, Rivera and his neighbors started selling
through TransFair, a European nonprofit firm that licenses the
fair-trade certification mark for 500,000 farmers in 20 countries
ranging from Latin America to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The change came fast for Rivera _ it has meant a new mule, new
farm equipment, a better diet, schooling for his children.
</P>
<P>
   The fair-trade concept has had great success in Europe since it
was founded there 11 years ago. Coffee brands with the fair-trade
certification mark now do $300 million in annual European sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the American debut came only last month, when TransFair USA,
the Oakland, Calif.-based nonprofit that licenses the mark,
introduced it to the West Coast. To date, 30 coffee companies have
met fair-trade requirements, and their beans are sold in 120 cafes,
restaurants and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   The cities of San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley, Calif., have
pledged to start serving fair-trade coffee in City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair-trade coffee is a way of supporting a living wage for the
people who grow it,'' said San Francisco Board of Supervisors
President Tom Ammiano, who sponsored a resolution supporting the
java. ``It embodies all the progressive values that the people of
San Francisco stand for _ as well as their lust for good coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair-trade coffee has become part of a complex consumer movement
to put ethical standards on international trade.
</P>
<P>
   It echoes the decade-old campaign against buying tuna caught
with nets that also trap dolphins, which has resulted in more than
90 percent of tuna sold in American supermarkets carrying the
dolphin-safe label. A newer example is the White House-sponsored
Fair Labor Association, an alliance of corporations, universities
and human-rights groups that is planning a sweatshop-free label.
</P>
<P>
   Other coffee-growing regions besides Nicaragua have been witness
to social strife. In El Salvador, Guatemala, Colombia and Peru,
coffee cooperatives have been preyed upon by right-wing death
squads allied with the wealthy elites that control most of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   Child labor is commonplace, and pesticides such as DDT _ banned
in the United States _ are routinely used.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range success for the fair-trade movement _ and the social
benefits it brings for the small growers _ ultimately depends on
motivating large numbers of consumers to put their money where they
say their principles are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair-trade coffee isn't charity, it's simply good business,''
said Paul Rice, TransFair USA's executive director, who started the
campaign after living in Nicaragua for 11 years, working with
coffee cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for roasters and coffeehouses because more and more
consumers are asking for it; it's good for consumers because it
tastes great and you can feel good drinking it. And it's good for
the growers because it allows them to finally get some of the
benefits of the gourmet coffee boom.''
</P>
<P>
   But the socially conscious status gets confusing too, as other
causes and groups jump on the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee bars now tout brews with such heart-warming adjectives as
bird-friendly, shade-tree and sustainable. Starbucks has begun
offering a shade-grown variety purchased from cooperatives in the
southern Mexico state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico and Central America, coffee plants are usually grown
under a virtual forest of shade trees, while in Brazil and most
other nations, they are grown with the trees stripped away _ thus
giving birds less habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say Starbucks' move is a good start. But the
corporation's many detractors in California, who blame it for
homogenizing the eclectic coffeehouse scene, say the tag is just a
cynical cosmetic makeover, because most gourmet coffee is
shade-grown.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the controversy, Rice says, TransFair would love to
sell Rivera's coffee to Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   TransFair is trying to persuade the huge firm to give fair trade
a try but hasn't received an answer yet.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry insiders say fair trade is a concept whose time
has come.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these (environmentally conscious) labels are confusing,
and some are nothing more than slick marketing,'' said Adam
Teitelbaum, owner of Adam's Organic Coffees, a San Francisco-based
wholesale firm that sells two varieties of fair-trade certified
beans.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I drink coffee, I think of lots of things _ the
mountainside where the coffee is from, the trees, the growers, the
way they take care of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fair-trade organic coffee is a verifiable way to combine all
these things. I think it'll last in the market after other fads
drop by the wayside.''

 STUDY FINDS RACIAL DIVIDE IN LUNG CANCER TREATMENT  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Black patients in the early stages of lung cancer are less
likely to have surgery than white patients with the same diagnosis,
and as a result are more likely to die of the disease, a new study
has found.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide look at how race influences medical care,
researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York
found a disturbing pattern of substandard treatment for African
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on Medicare patients and others over the age
of 65 with comparable medical circumstances. The researchers also
tried to take such factors as income and gender into account.
</P>
<P>
   The results, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, show that only 64 percent of the black patients had
surgery, compared with 77 percent of the white patients.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and whites who chose surgery had essentially the same
survival rates. But because so few black patients had the
procedure, their overall survival worked out to be substantially
below that of white patients.
</P>
<P>
   For every 1,000 black patients, 264 were still alive five years
after diagnosis (including those who had surgery and those who did
not), versus 341 of every 1,000 white patients. If the black
patients had received surgery at the same relative rate as their
white counterparts, the researchers estimated that 308 per 1,000
black patients would have survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were all patients with potentially curable lung cancer,
and all of them had insurance that would cover the procedure,''
said Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, lead author of the
new study.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is clear,'' he added. ``We need to understand
better what's happening in that interaction between doctors and
patients that leads to some patients having surgery less often than
other patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies also have found evidence of subtle racial
biases in the health care system, causing doctors to order less
elaborate diagnostic workups or otherwise treat minorities less
intensively than white patients.
</P>
<P>
   The new study went one step further by examining a relatively
straightforward medical circumstance in which surgery is the clear
option of choice.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers did not attempt to explain just why black
patients were less likely than their white counterparts to have the
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, for example, whether doctors recommended surgery
and patients declined, or whether the physicians failed to
adequately explain the options. Nor did the researchers look at
what happens in cases where the patient and doctor are of the same
race.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harold Freeman, an African American surgical oncologist who
serves as president of North General Hospital in New York, said
communication problems between black patients and white doctors may
explain part of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: What assumptions do you make about someone of
a different race, and how are you communicating with the person?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the study, specialists at the
University of California at San Francisco said the study has
disturbing implications for health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Results point to ``a difference in how physicians manage cancer
that is based on a patient's race, regardless of other attributes,
and that the consequence of these lapses in care is reduced
survival among blacks,'' wrote UCSF physicians Talmadge King and
Paul Brunetta.
</P>
<P>
   The study looked at nearly 11,000 patients nationwide, including
860 blacks and 10,124 classified as non-Hispanic white. All were
over the age of 65 and were being treated in one of 10 urban areas,
including San Francisco, in which health authorities operate a
detailed surveillance program known as SEER. Patient outcomes and
diagnoses also were cross-checked against Medicare records.
</P>
<P>
   All the patients had been formally diagnosed with operable,
non-small-cell lung cancer during the 1985 to 1993 study period.
Medical experts are nearly unanimous that surgery is the preferred
option for such patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that race could go a long way toward explaining
why the national five-year survival rate from lung cancer is only
11 percent among blacks, compared with 14 percent among whites.
Lung cancer is the deadliest form of malignancy in the United
States, killing more people than cancer of the breast, colon,
prostate and cervix combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence that bias on the part of physicians (either overt
prejudice or subconscious perceptions) influences access to optimal
cancer care is disheartening,'' they concluded.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Feelings of Exclusion
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies comparing black patients with white patients
have found the black patients more likely to feel excluded from
decisions, which could add to communication problems and feelings
of mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Brunetta also said that the new study may not
have fully accounted for differences in income and education levels
between the black and white patients, which could at least partly
account for the apparent differences in medical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   These adjustments were made largely on the basis of the median
income for the population residing within each patient's zip code
area. Researchers found essentially the same racial discrepancies
regardless of where the patients lived.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the racial aspects, Brunetta noted that a large number of
cases, 35.4 percent of the total, had to be excluded from the study
because of inadequate documentation of the tumor stage at
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   That underscored the need for better efforts to identify
patients early on while cancer can still be cured, he said, noting
that patients diagnosed at the early stage have an overall survival
rate of 40 percent after five years, while those diagnosed too
late, or who do not have surgery, typically die within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer of all types is the cause of about 150,000 deaths
annually in the United States. Only about one-third of those with
the most common form of the disease are diagnosed at the
potentially curable stage.

 Let Your Fingers Do the Asking  
 By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Looking to put the spark back in your marriage? Or cure your
dachshund of separation anxiety? Or fix a leaky faucet?
<P>
   Maybe it's time to consider the Internet for help.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Net entrepreneur Courtney Rosen thought. An
avid Rollerblader, she fired up her computer one night and scanned
the Web for instructions on how to rotate the wheels on her inline
skates. It took four weeks of fruitless surfing before she finally
found the answer.
</P>
<P>
   So she decided to create a site where people could learn
everything from ``How to use chopsticks'' to ``How to celebrate New
Year's Eve the Filipino way.'' In August, she launched San
Francisco-based eHow.com, which features original step-by-step
instructions on more than 10,000 possible ``how-tos.'' The advice
is written by a team of 100 full-time and free-lance editors. The
site also accepts contributions from visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my case, starting the site was a better solution than
having to flirt with the store clerk to get him to rotate my skate
wheels for me,'' Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
   EHow is at the forefront of an emerging trend on the Web: expert
sites that put specific answers to direct questions at your
fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites, like eHow, offer prewritten advice on a range of
topics. Those sites are free. Their revenue model is: After they
tell you how to do something, they try to sell you the tools to do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, which usually charge a fee, connect so-called
e-seekers with live experts who can give them personalized advice,
whether it be romantic, financial, medical or career related.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with names like Exp.com, ExpertCentral.com, About.com,
How2hq.com and Ithority.com are appearing from the ether on a
seemingly daily basis to address the need. Many of them are heavily
funded by big-name venture capitalists who think they have hit on
the next big cyber-thing.
</P>
<P>
   The rationale for the free how-to sites goes something like
this: When the Web first gained popularity in the mid-90s, it was
all about pure content, with news sites like CNN.com garnering the
most eyeballs. A few years later, there was a dramatic shift to
e-commerce sites, with the likes of eBay and Amazon.com. The next
wave, according to some people, is the melding of these two
concepts through what they are calling contextual commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Type in ``How to fly a kite'' on the eHow site, for instance,
and along with kite-flying instructions, you'll find a shopping
list that links you to e-commerce sites that sell kites, kite
string, strips of cloth for the kite tail and even picnic baskets,
assuming you'll want to pack a lunch for a day of kite flying in
the park. eHow gets anywhere from a 5 percent to 25 percent cut of
all sales it drives to e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, like ExpertCentral, Exp.com and Ithority, make
money by acting as matchmakers and hooking up e-seekers with the
appropriate expert. The companies boast thousands of experts on
their sites who dispense advice on everything from pets to
parenting. So if an e-seeker pays an expert $100 for, say, tips on
preventing sweaty feet, the site itself may receive a $20 cut as
the middleman.
</P>
<P>
   Putting a twist on the eBay model, some of these sites allow
e-seekers to list the amount they are willing to pay for counsel
and then have experts bid on their business _ a reverse auction for
advice.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether people are willing to pay for advice
online.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Levine, a sexuality and relationship expert who doles out
wisdom on Exp.com, said she has found three new paying clients by
listing her services on the site about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy wanted to spice up a long-term relationship with his
wife,'' said the San Francisco resident. Through an e-mail
exchange, Levine asked probing questions about his particular
situation and then, for 50 bucks, recommended an action plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He e-mailed back a few days later and said the advice worked
like a charm,'' she said contentedly.
</P>
<P>
   Some people like the fact that the Internet allows them to
remain anonymous when seeking help for sensitive problems. But
others just don't feel comfortable getting advice via their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a sociological metamorphosis before these sites
really take off,'' said Martin Debono, an analyst with Internet
consulting firm Gomez Advisors. ``I think there is an inherent
mistrust of anything technological, plus people are so used to
dealing with advice issues face to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Belforte, a 26-year-old San Francisco saleswoman, echoes
these concerns. She recently went on the Net in search of
information about ``which foods I could eat without getting fat.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she did pull up some good information, but was confused
about what was factual and what was not. ``There are so many random
people with their own Web pages these days, you could probably find
someone who says drinking gas makes you healthy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that she would be even more reluctant to pay for
advice on the Web, since anyone could claim to be an expert on
anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, the last thing we want on our site is a 12-year-old
giving out tax advice,'' acknowledged Mark Benning, chief executive
of Exp.com in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   Benning said that every expert listed on his site is carefully
vetted by a investigation service that verifies the expert's
employment history. Moreover, advice sites let customers rate the
experts online and provide feedback about their experiences. The
idea is that certain experts will establish good reputations and
thus get loads of referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Exp.com and other expert sites are banking on the old proverb:
You get what you pay for.
</P>
<P>
   Experts and advice seekers can conduct their sessions via
e-mail, or, if they reside in the same city, they can agree to meet
face to face. Benning said that Exp.com is working on adding
instant messaging technology to its site, as well as
video-conferencing capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   One expert site that has been around for a couple years and does
not charge a dime is About.com in New York City. It makes money
through e-commerce links.
</P>
<P>
   The site features roughly 650 real-life guides who specialize in
everything from the literature of Mark Twain to the lost art of
quilting. These guides host online forums and chat sessions, write
articles, answer questions and highlight links to other relevant
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't dare charge for my advice,'' said About.com dating
expert Brenda Ross, who earns a salary from About.com. ``I just
think it's bad karma.''
</P>
<P>
   So why are expert sites exploding on the Web? Courtney Rosen,
for one, argues that, in the past, advice was handed down from
generation to generation. But in today's mobile world, families are
less cohesive and basic skills, like how to boil an egg, often
don't get taught. That creates a real need for sites like hers, she
said. ``Our one true competitor is friends and family,'' said
Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell McDonald is a 30-year-old entertainment executive in Los
Angeles who can't get enough of online advice sites.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, she has learned to cook a Thanksgiving
turkey, make a wedding toast, prune a rosebush and break up a cat
fight on the eHow site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where else do you have the ability to talk to an expert every
day?'' she said. ``And no matter what question you ask, you don't
have to worry about looking like a fool.''
</P>
<P>
   As for breaking up that cat fight? ``Turn a garden hose on
them,'' said McDonald. And wouldn't you know it, eHow linked her
directly to the site selling the hose.

 Disruptions Hit Pac Bell's DSL Service  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Pacific Bell's high-speed Internet service, which is supposed to
provide a fast, always-on connection to the Net, has been plagued
by periodic outages over the past two days, disrupting service to
some Bay Area customers for more than 24 hours.
<P>
   The outage, which began around noon Tuesday, disrupted service
to an undisclosed number of customers from Mountain View to Marin
County, Pac Bell officials said. The company said it was slowly
restoring service and trying to determine what caused the problem.
Officials would not say how many customers had been affected, but
Pac Bell DSL service representatives said yesterday they had been
receiving a steady stream of calls from users.
</P>
<P>
   While the outage was frustrating for residential customers,
several companies that rely on Pac Bell's digital subscriber line
service for Web access and e-mail said the blackout was crippling
for them. Some companies said they lost service for more than 24
hours, paralyzing their ability to do business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely killing us,'' said Brett Adamcq &LR; , who runs
Verve, a software company in San Francisco. ``When our link is
down, we're cut off from the world and that means our customers
can't reach us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell's &LR;  DSL uses existing phone lines to deliver Internet
service at speeds up to 50 times faster than with traditional
modems. It also lets users talk on the phone and surf the Web
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   As more companies start doing business on the Web, speedy,
reliable connections are becoming a necessity. Many small
businesses look to Pac Bell to get them on the Net. The phone
company is one of just one of a handful of companies that offer DSL
service in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Malone, whose software company Eba Systems also relies on
Pac Bell DSL, said the service is as crucial to his firm as the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``DSL is incredibly important to our company,'' said Malone,
whose company is based in South of Market. ``We're losing business
because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Dainas, a spokesman for Pac Bell, acknowledged there had
been ``intermittent outages'' and said service had already been
restored to some affected customers. Dainas said the company was
working to figure out what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our priority is to fix intermittent disruptions,'' Dainas
said. ``Pac Bell engineers are working to figure out the cause of
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam, who pays about $200 per month for the highest level of DSL
service, said Pac Bell sold him the technology as a tool for
running his business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the premium service and pay a good amount for it and
it still went down,'' Adam said.
</P>
<P>
   DSL user Charlie Mahoney of San Francisco said his service has
been out for more than 36 hours and interfered with his ability to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rely on it for work and I do a fair amount of investing
online,'' Mahoney said. ``I'm actively tied to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first glitch to hit Pac Bell's DSL service. The
Internet service has suffered periodic outages in the past, with
customers losing service for several hours at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Pac Bell also ran into problems trying to
install the service after it lowered prices and was deluged with
requests from people who wanted to sign up. &UR;  &LR; Some people were
unable to access the Internet after DSL was installed; others were
told they could get the service but were then told on installation
day that their wiring couldn't accommodate DSL. Others complained
that technicians missed their appointments for installations.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell blamed those problems on ``growing pains'' and said the
quality of service would improve.
</P>
<P>

 Apple's Profit Falls for First Time in 2 Years  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
For the first time since co-founder Steve Jobs regained control of
Apple Computer two years ago, the company yesterday reported a
decline in quarterly profits compared with the same period 12
months before.
<P>
   But the shortfall was not as bad as expected, and it was
accompanied by several pieces of good news. As a result,
after-hours traders pushed Apple shares up almost 7 percent
following the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The Cupertino computer-maker reported profits from operations of
$90 million (51 cents a share) for its fourth quarter, down 15
percent from last year's net profits of $106 million (68 cents).
Sales for the quarter, which ended September 25, were $1.34
billion, off 14 percent from $1.56 billion in the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Apple had warned on September 20 that its results would fall
below expectations because Motorola, its microprocessor supplier,
couldn't supply enough PowerPC G4 chips to meet demand for
high-end, high-margin Power Mac G4 machines.
</P>
<P>
   Data that Apple provided at the time suggested that earnings per
share could fall between 42 cents and 48 cents, and the consensus
among analysts prior to yesterday's release was that the figure
would be 45 cents. Yet the company did considerably better than
that, even though last month's earthquake in Taiwan caused
additional problems by cutting off power for more than a week at
the plants where Apple's laptops are produced.
</P>
<P>
   Counting several one-time items, profits amounted to $111
million (63 cents).
</P>
<P>
   Among the positive items Apple reported in its earning
announcement and a follow-up conference call with analysts:
</P>
<P>
   _Demand for its products remains strong. At the end of the
quarter, the company had an order backlog of 400,000 units,
amounting to $700 million in unrealized revenue. Orders for the
iBook, a new consumer-oriented laptop that has just begun to reach
customers, have reached 300,000, while orders for enhanced iMac
models announced just last week already total 250,000, according to
Fred Anderson, Apple's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   _Apple's gross margins climbed to 28.7 percent, up from 26.8
percent a year ago. PC manufacturers generally are considered to be
doing well when their gross margins exceed 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _Starting in the first half of next year, IBM will begin
manufacturing PowerPC G4 chips, giving Apple a second source
alongside Motorola. The three companies developed the chip
together, but IBM previously had elected not to make G4s even
though it has continued to manufacture the G3, the
previous-generation PowerPC microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, Apple has reconfigured its G4 lineup to
accommodate the current shortage. A 500-megahertz model, originally
expected to ship in November, has been postponed until next year,
and the company now will offer models with 350-, 400-and
450-megahertz versions of the chips. Prices will correspond to
those previously announced for the 400-, 450- and 500-MHz models.
</P>
<P>
   In the current quarter, Apple's unit volumes and earnings will
both rise ``significantly,'' Anderson predicted, even though gross
margins are likely to decline because of higher holiday marketing
expenses and an industry-wide increase in memory prices.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company expects to catch up with the order backlog
on most of its products during the coming quarter, but iBooks are
likely to remain in short supply. Apple expects to produce between
200,000 and 250,000 of the curvy, colorful notebooks this quarter _
not enough to match even current orders, unless some are canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Kurtis King of Banc of America Securities in San
Francisco said he was pleased but not surprised by the Apple
report. ``Everything negative in it we'd heard before,'' he said,
``and now they're poised to put up some really big numbers in the
December quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Long bearish on Apple's prospects, King recently has turned
positive on the company's stock, at least for the short term. ``A
lot of good news will be coming out of Apple in the next six
months,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   He remains more cautious for the long term, though. ``The jury
is still out on what kind of revenue growth the company can
generate,'' he said, noting that recent growth has been in
comparison to periods when Apple didn't have a complete product
line.
</P>
<P>
   In after-hours trading, Apple's shares rose as high as $68.44.
Earlier, it had closed at $64.03, down $3.65 for the day.

 FIELD _ SF CHRON  
 Differences Cause Left Field Ad Agency to Split Up  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Left Field LLC, a San Francisco advertising shop specializing in
technology clients, is splitting into two new agencies due to
disagreements between its partners.
<P>
   Fred Schwartz and Kevin Burke, two of the three managing
partners, bought the equity interest of the third partner, Michael
McMahon, who started Left Field three years ago. Each of the two
groups will form a new agency; neither will use the name Left
Field.
</P>
<P>
   The split occurred, in part, because Schwartz and Burke were
more interested in being acquired than McMahon, the three partners
said in separate interviews yesterday. Many independent ad agency
partners these days are reaping windfalls by selling stakes to a
larger agency or conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Burke and Schwartz also wanted to put more emphasis on
conventional media, as opposed to McMahon's specialty _ online
advertising, they said. But McMahon said he, too, wanted to beef up
the agency's offline business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any partnership, sometimes you have people who skew
in different directions,'' said Burke. ``We just (concluded) that
the way we were approaching the business was different enough that
it didn't make sense for us to work together any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Left Field's clients already have signed up with
Burke and Schwartz, the two executives said. Those clients, which
include Sun Microsystems, Macys.com, ImproveNet and Visto,
represent 70 to 75 percent of Left Field's revenues, according to
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Other clients include Intelligent Life and Auto Trader.
</P>
<P>
   The two new agencies will work together to service all clients
through the end of the year. ``Inevitably, we're going to lose some
clients and staff,'' said McMahon. But ``there are an enormous
number of new opportunities out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Left Field's 110 employees were notified of the change on
Tuesday and asked to choose between the new entities. Schwartz, the
creative director, said many staff members are likely to stick with
their current bosses, which would mean that members of the creative
and account planning departments will stay with his team and that
the media planning division will go with McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon said he is moving forward with plans to open offices in
Atlanta and New York, and he expects to have 150 employees in the
three cities within a year. Both Auto Trader and Intelligent Life
are based in the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Left Field had been projected to earn $13 million in revenues
this year. Executives declined to disclose how much was paid for
McMahon's interest but said the agreement was signed late last
week.

 E-Trade Ends Quarter Better Than Expected  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Powered by fast-paced account growth, E-Trade Group bucked a
slowdown in the online brokerage industry and lost less money than
expected in the quarter ended September 30.
<P>
   The No. 2 Internet brokerage said yesterday it lost $26.7
million, or 11 cents a share, in its fourth fiscal quarter,
compared to a loss of $15.2 million, or 8 cents a share, in the
comparable quarter a year ago. The company was expected to lose 13
cents a share in the most recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For all of fiscal 1999, Menlo Park's E-Trade lost $54.7 million,
or 23 cents a share, compared to a profit of $1.69 million, or one
cent a share, in fiscal 1998. E-Trade's stock rose 22 cents to
$25.63 yesterday after earnings were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's revenue of $173.2 million was up sharply from a year
ago, but down 2.2 percent from the June quarter, due partly to
lower commissions charged to active customers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said E-Trade's strategy of spending heavily on
advertising - even if that produces red ink in the short term -is
succeeding. The company added 310,000 net new accounts during the
quarter, raising its total to 1.56 million.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade ``is a marketing powerhouse, as shown by the number of
accounts they signed up,'' said Russell Keene, an analyst with the
brokerage firm of Putnam, Lovell, de Guardiola &AMP; Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   With the stock market in the doldrums, the growth of online
trading is slowing from its torrid pace of the first half of the
year. Several rival online brokers have reported trading declines
in the September quarter, compared with the previous period.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade handled 5.1 million total trades during the quarter,
about the same as the June period, as transactions by new customers
offset fewer trades by existing clients.
</P>
<P>
   The firm spent $198 in advertising for each new customer it
attracted in the September quarter, compared with $238 in the June
quarter and $424 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's total assets - $28 billion at the end of September -
grew relatively slowly, in part because it attracts many new
investors who haven't built up much wealth. For every ad dollar
spent, the firm drew in about $25 in customer assets, much lower
than Charles Schwab Corp.'s industry-leading ratio of about $900 in
assets for each ad dollar, Keene calculated. &LR;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: AIN'T LIFE THE GRAND?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ My paternal grandfather, Jakob Glass, a wealthy
investment banker in pre-war Poland, loved to travel but disdained
carrying any bags whatsoever. He would embark on his annual Grand
Tours of Europe without so much as a comb, having deposited in
advance full wardrobes at each of his luxurious hostelries.
</P>
<P>
   In visiting Berlin, an eight-hour train trip from Warsaw,
grandfather would put up at the Hotel Adlon on Unter den Linden
near the Brandenburg Gate. Well before his arrival, a butler would
lay out his personal cache in cherrywood cabinets that rested on
limestone floors covered with oriental carpets.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he stayed there was in 1933, shortly before the
Nazis marched through the Gate to proclaim by torchlight the start
of the 1,000-year Reich. Ten years later, they murdered him and
most of my family as Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, now known as the Kempenski Adlon, has been restored
to its pre-war splendor. (A seedier embodiment, in what was then
East Germany, appears in ``One, Two, Three,'' a 1961 movie that
stars James Cagney in the role of C.R. MacNamara, a Coca-Cola
executive.)
</P>
<P>
   I walked past the hotel the other day after visiting the newly
reopened Reichstag, which once abutted the Berlin Wall and where
nowadays the German parliament sits in the reclaimed German
capital.
</P>
<P>
   Several former Hungarian officials stood by the entrance. Since
they had once allowed thousands of East Germans to escape as
``tourists'' to the West, helping bring down the German Communist
regime, Berlin Mayor Eberhard Diepgen had invited them for the 10th
anniversary of the Wall's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the forest of construction cranes rising above Berlin,
Diepgen threw a big bash at the Town Hall to mark German
Unification Day. While the party was under way, neo-Nazis knocked
over more than 100 graves at Berlin's Weissensee Jewish cemetery.
   As it turned out, I ate the last available sausage but returned
to my hotel, the Westin Grand on Friedrichstrasse, before the
champagne corks popped.
</P>
<P>
   On the way in from Tegel Airport, the taxi driver said he'd
never heard of the Westin, the name of the large chain that
recently acquired the place. But he was familiar with the Grand,
once the favorite hangout of the Stasi, the East German secret
police. Now German politicians like to stay there, a short stroll
from the Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   After we became U.S. citizens in 1948, my father, an inveterate
world traveler, vowed he'd never return to Germany or Poland, a
pledge he kept until his death in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   My son Sam has yet to visit Poland, as I did briefly the other
day after a 90-minute drive on the autobahn. But while in college,
Sam spent a sumdying at Heidelberg University. Breaking with
the practices of his great-grandfather, Sam had checked his
knapsack in economy class.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakob's footsteps, Sam has recently begun a career in
investment banking. If his employers in New York like his work,
they may one day dispatch him here to Berlin, where he can use his
nearly fluent German. Perhaps they'll even put him up at the Adlon,
hard by the Brandenburg Gate, for $250 a night.

 &HT;    UNCERTAINTY OVER PRICES, PROBLEMS RUFFLES MILLENNIUM TRAVEL
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (t) travel categories for release
Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They're up. They're down. They're rising. But will
they fall again?
</P>
<P>
   Prices for New Year's Eve vacation packages have flared and
contracted like beach umbrellas this year. They were up in the
winter, down by summer and rising in autumn. But would-be revelers
may want to hold out for better deals in December.
</P>
<P>
   No matter when you make up your mind, you can be assured that
most New Year's Eve celebrations are ``plain old bad deals,''
according to Laurie Berger, editor of Consumer Reports Travel
Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking here recently at a meeting of the American Society of
Travel Agents, consumer advocate Berger called ``millennium''
packages ``the rip-offs of the century.'' Problems will include
price gouging, overcrowding, ``over-promising'' of amenities,
unfair refund policies and possible Y2K computer bug problems, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, millions are eager to do something special to welcome
2000, and the hospitality industry is even more keen to exploit
that urge. Hotel operators and cruise ship owners have been
juggling prices to determine just how much money travelers will be
willing to spend to feel special.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who has been tracking rates throughout the year, found
that most companies started last winter with outrageously high
prices, and then began slashing them when consumers refused to go
along.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers not only were turned off by the price gouging, but
were concerned about the computer software flaw commonly called the
Y2K bug. The problem could cause many computers to fail when the
date changes to Jan. 1, 2000. Earlier this year, some experts were
predicting technological chaos on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the minimal interest in year-end travel, travel
promoters began cutting prices by as much as 50 percent from
February peaks. For example, one Carnival cruise package Berger
tracked was priced at $2,250 for New Year's Eve 1998. In February,
the company hiked the price to $3,700 for New Year's Eve 1999. That
drove away so many customers that Carnival dropped the rate to
$2,538 in June, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Y2K fears have diminished and many people have
seen their stock holdings rise. With the urge to celebrate growing
again, the Carnival trip is back up to $3,335, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether renewed concerns about the Y2K bug
will kill reservations in November and December, leaving cruise
ships with many vacancies. Travelers might want to wait and hope
travel companies will slash prices at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the worst gouging will be found in the most popular
places for New Year's Eve parties: New York City, Las Vegas and
Orlando. The best deals are in ``secondary'' party cities such as
New Orleans and Houston, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Y2K bug? Berger says it remains a serious
concern, and notes that insurance companies are being extremely
vague in their promises to cover trips ruined by computer problems.
Her advice to millennium travelers is, ``Don't go. I think there
are a lot of risks.''

 &HT;    UNCERTAINTY OVER PRICES, PROBLEMS RUFFLES MILLENNIUM TRAVEL
 &HT;    Moving in (k) commentary and (t) travel categories for release
Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They're up. They're down. They're rising. But will
they fall again?
</P>
<P>
   Prices for New Year's Eve vacation packages have flared and
contracted like beach umbrellas this year. They were up in the
winter, down by summer and rising in autumn. But would-be revelers
may want to hold out for better deals in December.
</P>
<P>
   No matter when you make up your mind, you can be assured that
most New Year's Eve celebrations are ``plain old bad deals,''
according to Laurie Berger, editor of Consumer Reports Travel
Letter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking here recently at a meeting of the American Society of
Travel Agents, consumer advocate Berger called ``millennium''
packages ``the rip-offs of the century.'' Problems will include
price gouging, overcrowding, ``over-promising'' of amenities,
unfair refund policies and possible Y2K computer bug problems, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, millions are eager to do something special to welcome
2000, and the hospitality industry is even more keen to exploit
that urge. Hotel operators and cruise ship owners have been
juggling prices to determine just how much money travelers will be
willing to spend to feel special.
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who has been tracking rates throughout the year, found
that most companies started last winter with outrageously high
prices, and then began slashing them when consumers refused to go
along.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers not only were turned off by the price gouging, but
were concerned about the computer software flaw commonly called the
Y2K bug. The problem could cause many computers to fail when the
date changes to Jan. 1, 2000. Earlier this year, some experts were
predicting technological chaos on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the minimal interest in year-end travel, travel
promoters began cutting prices by as much as 50 percent from
February peaks. For example, one Carnival cruise package Berger
tracked was priced at $2,250 for New Year's Eve 1998. In February,
the company hiked the price to $3,700 for New Year's Eve 1999. That
drove away so many customers that Carnival dropped the rate to
$2,538 in June, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Y2K fears have diminished and many people have
seen their stock holdings rise. With the urge to celebrate growing
again, the Carnival trip is back up to $3,335, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether renewed concerns about the Y2K bug
will kill reservations in November and December, leaving cruise
ships with many vacancies. Travelers might want to wait and hope
travel companies will slash prices at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said the worst gouging will be found in the most popular
places for New Year's Eve parties: New York City, Las Vegas and
Orlando. The best deals are in ``secondary'' party cities such as
New Orleans and Houston, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Y2K bug? Berger says it remains a serious
concern, and notes that insurance companies are being extremely
vague in their promises to cover trips ruined by computer problems.
Her advice to millennium travelers is, ``Don't go. I think there
are a lot of risks.''

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: The agony of Pius XII
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Vatican has defended the wartime pope, Pius XII, against
chargeti-Semitism and a peculiar moral torpor during the
Holocaust. Pius, his defenders said, pursued peace quietly,
discreetly, refusing to endanger even more potential victims,
agonizing over his self-imposed inability to speak out.
</P>
<P>
   Although the defense may be apt, it is not a case one makes for
sainthood. Saints do not wring their hands with a delicately poised
prudence. The case for the pope's sainthood is probably now doomed
by his defenders.
</P>
<P>
   Pius XII is a candidate for beatification, a step away from
sainthood. His candidacy has been sharply challenged by a new book,
``Hitler's Pope,'' by the English journalist John Cornwell.
Cornwell charges that the pope, a lifelong papal diplomat, was so
addicted to treaty-making and fine diplomacy that he failed to
connect with the larger picture of what was going on in
Nazi-occupied Europe. Cornwell's well-documented argument cannot be
balanced by pleas for prudence and discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Pius emerges as a figure less saintly than just human.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Practicing MAD politics
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as a military coup was raising the risk Pakistan will
restart its nuclear arms race with India, the Senate was removing
the United States as leader of the international effort to contain
nuclear weapons, leaving the drive floundering. GOP leadership saw
a shot at paying President Clinton back for besting it on issue
after issue, and took it.
</P>
<P>
   It would be one thing if the treaty banning nuclear tests had
been soberly studied and voted down over substantive misgivings,
but that was not the case. This was partisan opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty formalized a testing moratorium initiated by
President George Bush. It has been signed by 154 nations, ratified
by 51. Most of the rest were waiting to see whether the Senate
would confirm President Clinton's signature.
</P>
<P>
   There are legitimate questions. Could cheaters be detected? Can
the U.S. nuclear arsenal be kept reliable by computer modeling and
other substitutes for major tests? The answers are ``probably.''
The treaty, for instance, would set up the most extensive
monitoring system ever. Whatever fudging there might be at the
margins, no nuclear breakout would seem possible.
</P>
<P>
   The current situation is hardly foolproof.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, where national security is at stake, rejection over the
doubts would at least be defensible. That did not happen. With
enough fatal opposition committed, the GOP leadership rushed the
treaty toward the floor with all the glee and decorum of a bunch of
frat boys depantsing a pledge, before the administration could
defend itself.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Germany, England and France _ and allies who
depend upon our nuclear deterrent as much as we do _ were urging
ratification. Or that Russia and China, our biggest worries, will
now almost surely walk out on the deal. Or that nuclear newcomers
like Pakistan and India will probably crank up abated programs. Or
that wannabes will resume development.
</P>
<P>
   The major flaw in the treaty was not in its provisions but in
the maddening political fact that it was the hated Bill Clinton who
had pulled it off.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had persuaded, at least tentatively, even
such potent rivals as Russia and China to accept a status quo that
in effect locked in U.S. nuclear superiority and had added a
provision that would allow Washington to opt out if it ever
determined its nuclear arsenal was no longer safe or reliable.
</P>
<P>
   It is still technically possible for the issue to be revived in
the next administration.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, however, that the shaky international consensus
will now scatter irretrievably and that the best hope yet for
ending nuclear testing, and thus restraining nuclear spread, has
been lost.
</P>
<P>
   And for the immediate future, we may watch, sidelined by the
Senate, as a militarized and incidentally Islamicized Pakistan not
only decides whether to seek nuclear one-upmanship over India but
perhaps even ponders whether to provide the ``Muslim'' bomb that
the Middle East's anti-Israel extremists have always dreamed of.

FUTURE PROMISE

<P>
   TELAVI, Republic of Georgia _ Wood shavings cover the concrete
floor of the tiny workshop. The only sounds are the clang and
scrape of tools on timber as Rubiko Batiashivili goes about his
solitary work.
</P>
<P>
   With graying hair and a weathered face, Batiashivili is
virtually the last man in this sunny mountain valley who knows how
to handcraft an oaken barrel, and he is suddenly in demand. Given
the importance of wine to the economy of this former Soviet
republic, Georgia's future well-being may rest in Batiashivili's
rough hands.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the sprawling Soviet-era Achinebuli wine factory
here in the Telavi believe they have found the innovation that will
make their product competitive in the world. The breakthrough is
wood _ not-so-high-tech wooden barrels for storing wine and
mellowing its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Quality grapes grow in abundance is this green valley, a
winemaking region called Kakheti, in the shadow of the Caucasus
Mountains. Georgia was the Napa Valley of the tsars. Georgian wines
were prized for their flavor and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the Soviet industrial revolution. The Soviet's
built mass-production plants in the 1950s and 1960s with gigantic
steel vats that reduced prized Georgian wines to the ordinary,
though they remain popular in Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping to revive their winemaking skills and appeal to
lucrative Western markets, Georgian vintners are tapping into past
traditions with plans to store their wine in wooden barrels and
improve its flavor and reputation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Achinebuli winery, one of the country's largest, hired
Batiashivili last year after locals identified the 63-year-old
woodworker as one of the last of a dying breed. He learned the
craft of making barrels to store wine as a teenager half a century
ago, and now he is again putting the skill to work.
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days in his workshop at a corner of the winery
hewing and assembling small barrels. One day soon, he will begin
making full-sized barrels to store wine. For now, they are content
to let him practice his craft, and teach it to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, all the wineries used wooden barrels,'' said
Batiashivili. He added with a smile: ``This factory makes very good
wine, but of course my homemade wine is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiashivili's boastfulness is something of a national trait in
Georgia, where virtually every rural household produces its own
wine, as it has for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Georgia's top wine producers want to live up to their
country's winemaking heritage.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of communism in 1991 and the global success of
such small wine-producing countries as Chile and Australia, the
Georgia wine industry believes it could find its niche in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great traditions. We used to produce very good wines.
But in the Soviet period, we were very backwards and our problem is
that our viniculture specialists don't know just how backward we
are,'' said David Dolmazashivili, director of the Achinebuli
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the quality is improving as the winery has sent its
winemakers abroad to see how Californians, Italians and the French
harvest and produce wines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Dolmazashivili toured the California wine
regions and returned to spread the word on how far Georgia must go
to compete with the likes of Robert Mondavi wineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at least we know what we want and need. We cannot afford
it, but at least we know, whereas before we thought we had the
best,'' Dolmazashivili said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the winery will import oak barrels from California to
begin storing what will become vintage, upscale wine. In the next
batch, they hope to use homemade barrels produced by Batiashivili.
</P>
<P>
   The winery already has begun to purchase stainless steel
processing equipment from Italy to replace the worn and corroding
Soviet-era equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The paret company, Georgia Wine and Spirits, was founded in
1993 as the state-owned vineyards were being privatized, and is
responsible for about half the country's production and sales. The
French beverage multinational Pernod Richard owns a share of the
Georgia company.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the former Soviet Union, the quest to compete
globally begins with the expensive task of updating the technology.
Decades of central planning and lack of competition have left
rusting factories unable to function profitably in a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, though, winemakers have the grapes and the
reputation that has seen them through the rough decade. Wine
remains one of the small country's top exports, sold mainly to
Russia and other former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at its peak in Soviet times, Georgia exported about 120
million bottles of wine a year. Last year, the total was only about
10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian wines sell sporadically in the United States, several
thousand bottles a year primarily in New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago, where Russian immigrants maintain a miniscule but steady
demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a reputation in the West will not be easy in a crowded
market of fine wines from Europe, California, South America and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing producers in Georgia is the lack of
quality control. With some 500 varieties of grapes growing in the
country, Georgia needs establish an appellation system, similar to
France's regional controls that define in absolute terms what makes
a Burgundy, Bordeaux or Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   Producers agree that even Georgia's best-known varieties _ a dry
white wine called Tsinandali, similar to a Chablis, and a dry red
called Saperavi-Mukuzanik, akin to a Merlot _ suffer from widely
varying tastes depending on the winery. Georgia also grapples with
a problem of counterfeiting, claiming that illicit producers in
Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Slovakia bottle wines using Georgia
labels to exploit the good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, winemakers said, the small and poor nation needs
economic freedoms that will encourage entrepreneurs to make and
market their own vintages.
</P>
<P>
   They already exist in abundance here. Virtually every Georgian
household traditionally has a cellar of homemade wine. But few can
find the capital to develop into full-fledged wineries to bottle
and market their product.
</P>
<P>
   Near the mammoth Achinebuli winery, locals in Telavi direct
visitors to a home surrounded by hanging grapevines. It is here, at
the residence of Vajha Nikolaishivili, where one can find the
finest wine in the valley, the locals say.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy man with a bronze face and a passion for wine,
Nikolaishivili talks in a constant stream about the skills his
great-grandfather taught him. He ages his wine in vats buried in
the clay floor of a storehouse on the property. He has more
customers than wine, and reserves a special vat, what he calls
``the grandchild'' for special family occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each harvest you have to produce the best wines you
can,'' said Nikolaishivili, 52, who's family has been producing
homemade wine for the past seven generations. ``Otherwise you shame
the family tradition.''

<P>
   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Luxury resorts line the white sand
beaches, calypso and reggae pulse from open-air bars and sunburned
tourists do the limbo, rum drinks with little umbrellas in hand.
But while the visitors are busy enjoying what Jamaica is best known
for _ sun, sand and fun _ a group of earnest students in this lush
resort are building what many hope will be a new future for this
economically troubled island.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, the newly-formed Caribbean Institute of
Technology, or CIT will graduate its first class of computer
programmers, most of whom will go to work for an Atlanta-based
company doing custom software design for American firms.
</P>
<P>
   The school's first crop of 56 programmers will form the nucleus
of what officials hope will be a budding information technology
sector that will vault Jamaica into the new millennium, helping
broaden an economy now based on tourism, mining and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology is going to take over,'' said Omar
Murray, 23, a former hotel clerk who now spends 10-hour days
building Internet web sites and learning the latest computer
languages at CIT. ``It's the wave of the future. Jamaica might not
be as developed with computers as we'd like, but I'm sure we're
going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique group of partners that set up the school is
convinced. The worldwide demand for programmers, they say,
virtually guarantees the new graduates will find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for programmers is absolutely huge,'' said Ken
Abernethy(CQ), head of computer programs at Furman University, a
Greenville, S.C. school that is providing the curriculum for the
Jamaican operation. ``There are more than 250,000 jobs vacant right
now in the U.S. and the growth rate is on the order of 100,000 new
jobs per year. In the U.S., we're only graduating 25,000 bachelor's
level computer science students a year. Companies are pretty
desperate for programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Going offshore to find those programmers is not a new idea. For
years, U.S. and European companies have been farming out software
work to programmers in Ireland, Israel, India and many Eastern
European countries. In most cases, they can get the work done
cheaper, but that's just an added bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost advantage is a factor, but in reality just getting
the resource at all is often the biggest factor,'' said Stacy
Kenworthy, president of REALM Information Technologies, an Atlanta
software company that has already contracted to hire some of the
CIT graduates. ``The competition for talent is extreme, and in some
areas the shortfall in programmers is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneur James Ram identified the crisis as an
opportunity. Four years ago he founded INDUSA, a firm that
channeled software work for U.S. companies to programmers back home
in his native India.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has worked fairly well, ``although some of the clients
have been uneasy sending work 10,000 miles away,'' Ram said. ``If
they had a problem that required an in-person visit, they'd be
looking at a 23-hour flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram began scouting for someplace closer to the United States,
and settled on Jamaica for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good basic education system based on the British
model, they speak English, they have a surprisingly good
telecommunications infrastructure and they are in the same time
zone as the Eastern U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ram less than a year to get CIT up and running.
Partnering with INDUSA in the venture are Furman, a British
consortium of schools and government agencies, the Jamaican
government and the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology Phillip Paulwell,
has been a big backer, hoping that high-tech can stop the
brain-drain that Jamaica _ and other Caribbean islands _ have
experienced as their highly-educated residents have moved
elsewhere. Software programming seems a good fit because the skill
is in high demand and the industry doesn't require expensive
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology will be the backbone of the global
economy of the future,'' Paulwell said when CIT was founded. ``This
new center will provide access to this economy for large numbers of
Jamaicans and help establish the human resource to launch a
vigorous software development industry in Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   If the school is a success _ and there are already 105 new
students enrolled for next year's term _ it could prove a big boost
to this island of 2.6 million residents, where per capita income is
about US$6,000. Jamaica's economic mainstays, like tourism, have
all been battered in the past decade by hurricanes, poor prices,
competition and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment runs at 20 percent, with the figure rising to 45
percent for those younger than 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate, CIT is a small _ but significant _ bright
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ram is guaranteeing that INDUSA will hire CIT's successful
graduates. He will pay them a beginning wage of US$7 to US$10 an
hour to work in Jamaica for American companies, with the promise
that salaries could rise with hard work and a few years experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican government has put its money up to make the
operation a success, paying $4,000 of the $6,000 total tuition per
student, while loaning many of the students the remainder if
necessary. The students must sign a pledge to remain in Jamaica for
at least three years after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement is based on the fact that demand for
programmers is so high in the United States that beginning college
graduates can sometimes fetch up to US$50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   But many of CIT's students say they want to stay in Jamaica, a
proud island nation with a rich cultural heritage. While most had
never done more than type simple forms on computers before they
enrolled, many believe their soon-to-be-earned diplomas will be
tickets to a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have sacrificed to be here,'' said Traceyann
Samuels, 27, who gave up a government job to enroll at CIT. ``But
it has to pay off. In four to five years, I see myself having my
own consulting business, doing work in software, imaging and
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Williams, 32, already has his own business _ a food
supplement venture that he and his wife are still running while he
attends CIT. He has designed a Web page for the business, and hopes
to design pages for others when he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many people here who do this now, and I think the
field is going to mushroom,'' he said. ``I had no university
training, but now I hope to set up my own Web design shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructors say CIT's curriculum is demanding: students attend
classes for 8 hours a day, often following that up with several
hours of lab work. They are learning all the latest computer tools,
including Web page design, C++, Visual Basic, Java and database
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students will have more hands-on computer experience in
their 10 months here than most university graduates will get in a
four-year degree program,'' said Michael Glova, CIT's managing
director. ``The universities promise a diploma, but we promise
skills that are in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The students are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a newspaper ad for this course and it seemed like the
answer to my prayers,'' said Salomie Lyles, 23, who worked in the
hospitality industry before enrolling. ``To get a degree in
computers would've taken three years, but here we are doing it in
10 months.''

 &HT;    RADICAL STEPS MAY BE NEEDED TO SAVE CHINA'S STILL ENDANGERED
PANDAS

   WOLONG, China _ Normally, cabbages don't threaten giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
   But here the big green plants shoulder up to the very edge of a
winding, rock-pocked road, then creep in neat rows high up the most
impossible-looking mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbage is only one calling card of humanity inexorably
pushing itself into misty wilderness heights, fragmenting the
bamboo-forested mountainland that supports the last clusters of the
estimated 1,000 giant pandas still living in the wilds of southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent habitat protections, wildlife experts assess
continuing human pressures as intense. They are not at all
convinced that the enchanting animals will survive to amble through
many new chapters in their three million-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the panda species, we have a long way to go,'' Liu
Yongfan, vice-director of the State Forestry Administration, told
Chinese and American scientists gathered at this nature reserve for
a conference on pandas earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   China at least is inching down the route of protection.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some efforts are being made to stop the human encroachment
that has cut up panda territory and divided the panda population,
making genetic in-breeding a potentially deadly problem and leaving
isolated, small groups susceptible to environmental crises that
larger numbers could weather.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Research is continuing to improve the achievements already
made in captive panda breeding, to assure the pandas survive
somewhere. China now has about 100 pandas living in captivity, most
of them bred at Chinese zoos and research institutes and the rest
captured from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And now the Chinese are laying the groundwork for the
precarious possibility of reintroducing to the wild, pandas born in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   But money, knowledge and national will are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because people don't know about the cabbages
snaking up nature reserve mountains, or the peasants still
stripping forests here for firewood, or about the poachers or the
hunters whose snares may grab pandas by mistake, but kill them
nonetheless, said Zhang Hemin, director of the China Research and
Conservation Center for the Giant Panda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, there is something wrong with the propaganda,''
Zhang lamented in an interview with Cox Newspapers. ``People read
about cloning, and they think there is no problem now with the
panda. Some say in the wild there are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His success is one reason for the blase attitude. Every time a
panda gives birth at Zhang's breeding center, the feel-good news is
trumpeted around the country by the official media.
</P>
<P>
   And before the panda conference here was half finished, Beijing
newspapers published optimistic accounts of the still tentative
hope Zhang had expressed in a speech to introduce captive-born
pandas to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of reintroduction may be an exciting, very
long-term project, but is fraught with difficulty under even the
best conditions. The newspapers did not mention that Zhang failed
to get state funding for the one-square-mile enclosure he wants to
build high on the mountain to begin experimental training, but will
be lucky to finance a semi-wild area of one-fifth of a square mile.
</P>
<P>
   If any pandas do become ready for release to the wild, a crucial
question is whether there is enough wild to support them.
</P>
<P>
   One key development that will help determine panda policy is a
panda survey that has been delayed several years for lack of funds,
according to Yan Xun, chief biologist for China's nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is to begin early next year with the aim of
generating solid estimates of the numbers of pandas alive today and
where they live. The last survey was finished in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the population is decreasing very fast, maybe we will
formulate some strict policies to stop the spread of townships or
even to remove some co-inhabited areas,'' Yan said, referring to
areas where both pandas and humans live.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wolong, a 720-square-mile nature reserve, attempts to
remove some peasant families who farm, hunt and collect wood simply
were called off. The issue was sensitive because many local
residents are ethnic Zang (of Tibetan origin) or Qiang, and the
central government has been under international fire elsewhere for
ham-fisted tactics against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of the rights of animals versus the rights
of people,'' explained Deng Xiangsui, director of wildlife
conservation here in Sichuan Province, where 80 percent of the
giant pandas are believed to live.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial policy change already, he said, was the outlawing of
timber-cutting throughout the region last fall. Although Deng said
the tough regulation long had been in the works, the central
government acted only after last year's devastating summer floods
cost millions of dollars
</P>
<P>
   and hundreds of lives _ another by-product of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the government went further and prohibited the
transport of lumber in protected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal frequently cited at the conference, which was run
by the Minnesota-based Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, is
setting up ``panda corridors'' to link reserves and other panda
habitat now divided by roads or communities or forest
clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Corridors would promote mixing of animals from different
geographic areas, potentially improving genetic diversity and
giving pandas wider areas to forage for food in the event of a
localized crisis such as fire or bamboo ``flowering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, a cyclical outburst of bamboo blooms killed
off large patches of bamboo, resulting in starvation deaths of 80
percent of the pandas in some isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Making such corridors is another tough goal, an example of
``nascent ecology'' that scientists don't quite know how to do yet,
according to Ulysses Seal, chairman of the American group.
</P>
<P>
   But something must be done to ease human pressure and better
protect the remnants of the panda population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without intervention,'' Seal said, ``I'd say in the next 100
years we'd see these fragmented (panda) populations wink out one by
one.''

   TELAVI, Republic of Georgia _ Wood shavings cover the concrete
floor of the tiny workshop. The only sounds are the clang and
scrape of tools on timber as Rubiko Batiashivili goes about his
solitary work.
</P>
<P>
   With graying hair and a weathered face, Batiashivili is
virtually the last man in this sunny mountain valley who knows how
to handcraft an oaken barrel, and he is suddenly in demand. Given
the importance of wine to the economy of this former Soviet
republic, Georgia's future well-being may rest in Batiashivili's
rough hands.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the sprawling Soviet-era Achinebuli wine factory
here in the Telavi believe they have found the innovation that will
make their product competitive in the world. The breakthrough is
wood _ not-so-high-tech wooden barrels for storing wine and
mellowing its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Quality grapes grow in abundance is this green valley, a
winemaking region called Kakheti, in the shadow of the Caucasus
Mountains. Georgia was the Napa Valley of the tsars. Georgian wines
were prized for their flavor and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the Soviet industrial revolution. The Soviet's
built mass-production plants in the 1950s and 1960s with gigantic
steel vats that d prized Georgian wines to the ordinary,
though they remain popular in Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping to revive their winemaking skills and appeal to
lucrative Western markets, Georgian vintners are tapping into past
traditions with plans to store their wine in wooden barrels and
improve its flavor and reputation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Achinebuli winery, one of the country's largest, hired
Batiashivili last year after locals identified the 63-year-old
woodworker as one of the last of a dying breed. He learned the
craft of making barrels to store wine as a teenager half a century
ago, and now he is again putting the skill to work.
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days in his workshop at a corner of the winery
hewing and assembling small barrels. One day soon, he will begin
making full-sized barrels to store wine. For now, they are content
to let him practice his craft, and teach it to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, all the wineries used wooden barrels,'' said
Batiashivili. He added with a smile: ``This factory makes very good
wine, but of course my homemade wine is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiashivili's boastfulness is something of a national trait in
Georgia, where virtually every rural household produces its own
wine, as it has for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Georgia's top wine producers want to live up to their
country's winemaking heritage.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of communism in 1991 and the global success of
such small wine-producing countries as Chile and Australia, the
Georgia wine industry believes it could find its niche in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great traditions. We used to produce very good wines.
But in the Soviet period, we were very backwards and our problem is
that our viniculture specialists don't know just how backward we
are,'' said David Dolmazashivili, director of the Achinebuli
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the quality is improving as the winery has sent its
winemakers abroad to see how Californians, Italians and the French
harvest and produce wines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Dolmazashivili toured the California wine
regions and returned to spread the word on how far Georgia must go
to compete with the likes of Robert Mondavi wineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at least we know what we want and need. We cannot afford
it, but at least we know, whereas before we thought we had the
best,'' Dolmazashivili said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the winery will import oak barrels from California to
begin storing what will become vintage, upscale wine. In the next
batch, they hope to use homemade barrels produced by Batiashivili.
</P>
<P>
   The winery already has begun to purchase stainless steel
processing equipment from Italy to replace the worn and corroding
Soviet-era equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Georgia Wine and Spirits, was founded in
1993 as the state-owned vineyards were being privatized, and is
responsible for about half the country's production and sales. The
French beverage multinational Pernod Richard owns a share of the
Georgia company.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the former Soviet Union, the quest to compete
globally begins with the expensive task of updating the technology.
Decades of central planning and lack of competition have left
rusting factories unable to function profitably in a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, though, winemakers have the grapes and the
reputation that has seen them through the rough decade. Wine
remains one of the small country's top exports, sold mainly to
Russia and other former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at its peak in Soviet times, Georgia exported about 120
million bottles of wine a year. Last year, the total was only about
10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian wines sell sporadically in the United States, several
thousand bottles a year primarily in New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago, where Russian immigrants maintain a miniscule but steady
demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a reputation in the West will not be easy in a crowded
market of fine wines from Europe, California, South America and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing producers in Georgia is the lack of
quality control. With some 500 varieties of grapes growing in the
country, Georgia needs establish an appellation system, similar to
France's regional controls that define in absolute terms what makes
a Burgundy, Bordeaux or Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   Producers agree that even Georgia's best-known varieties _ a dry
white wine called Tsinandali, similar to a Chablis, and a dry red
called Saperavi-Mukuzanik, akin to a Merlot _ suffer from widely
varying tastes depending on the winery. Georgia also grapples with
a problem of counterfeiting, claiming that illicit producers in
Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Slovakia bottle wines using Georgia
labels to exploit the good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, winemakers said, the small and poor nation needs
economic freedoms that will encourage entrepreneurs to make and
market their own vintages.
</P>
<P>
   They already exist in abundance here. Virtually every Georgian
household traditionally has a cellar of homemade wine. But few can
find the capital to develop into full-fledged wineries to bottle
and market their product.
</P>
<P>
   Near the mammoth Achinebuli winery, locals in Telavi direct
visitors to a home surrounded by hanging grapevines. It is here, at
the residence of Vajha Nikolaishivili, where one can find the
finest wine in the valley, the locals say.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy man with a bronze face and a passion for wine,
Nikolaishivili talks in a constant stream about the skills his
great-grandfather taught him. He ages his wine in vats buried in
the clay floor of a storehouse on the property. He has more
customers than wine, and reserves a special vat, what he calls
``the grandchild'' for special family occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each harvest you have to produce the best wines you
can,'' said Nikolaishivili, 52, who's family has been producing
homemade wine for the past seven generations. ``Otherwise you shame
the family tradition.''

 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.

   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Luxury resorts line the white sand
beaches, calypso and reggae pulse from open-air bars and sunburned
tourists do the limbo, rum drinks with little umbrellas in hand.
But while the visitors are busy enjoying what Jamaica is best known
for _ sun, sand and fun _ a group of earnest students in this lush
resort are building what many hope will be a new future for this
economically troubled island.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, the newly-formed Caribbean Institute of
Technology, or CIT will graduate its first class of computer
programmers, most of whom will go to work for an Atlanta-based
company doing custom software design for American firms.
</P>
<P>
   The school's first crop of 56 programmers will form the nucleus
of what officials hope will be a budding information technology
sector that will vault Jamaica into the new millennium, helping
broaden an economy now based on tourism, mining and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology is going to take over,'' said Omar
Murray, 23, a former hotel clerk who now spends 10-hour days
building Internet web sites and learning the latest computer
languages at CIT. ``It's the wave of the future. Jamaica might not
be as developed with computers as we'd like, but I'm sure we're
going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique group of partners that set up the school is
convinced. The worldwide demand for programmers, they say,
virtually guarantees the new graduates will find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for programmers is absolutely huge,'' said Ken
Abernethy(CQ), head of computer programs at Furman University, a
Greenville, S.C. school that is providing the curriculum for the
Jamaican operation. ``There are more than 250,000 jobs vacant right
now in the U.S. and the growth rate is on the order of 100,000 new
jobs per year. In the U.S., we're only graduating 25,000 bachelor's
level computer science students a year. Companies are pretty
desperate for programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Going offshore to find those programmers is not a new idea. For
years, U.S. and European companies have been farming out software
work to programmers in Ireland, Israel, India and many Eastern
European countries. In most cases, they can get the work done
cheaper, but that's just an added bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost advantage is a factor, but in reality just getting
the resource at all is often the biggest factor,'' said Stacy
Kenworthy, president of REALM Information Technologies, an Atlanta
software company that has already contracted to hire some of the
CIT graduates. ``The competition for talent is extreme, and in some
areas the shortfall in programmers is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneur James Ram identified the crisis as an
opportunity. Four years ago he founded INDUSA, a firm that
channeled software work for U.S. companies to programmers back home
in his native India.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has worked fairly well, ``although some of the clients
have been uneasy sending work 10,000 miles away,'' Ram said. ``If
they had a problem that required an in-person visit, they'd be
looking at a 23-hour flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram began scouting for someplace closer to the United States,
and settled on Jamaica for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good basic education system based on the British
model, they speak English, they have a surprisingly good
telecommunications infrastructure and they are in the same time
zone as the Eastern U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ram less than a year to get CIT up and running.
Partnering with INDUSA in the venture are Furman, a British
consortium of schools and government agencies, the Jamaican
government and the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology Phillip Paulwell,
has been a big backer, hoping that high-tech can stop the
brain-drain that Jamaica _ and other Caribbean islands _ have
experienced as their highly-educated residents have moved
elsewhere. Software programming seems a good fit because the skill
is in high demand and the industry doesn't require expensive
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology will be the backbone of the global
economy of the future,'' Paulwell said when CIT was founded. ``This
new center will provide access to this economy for large numbers of
Jamaicans and help establish the human resource to launch a
vigorous software development industry in Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   If the school is a success _ and there are already 105 new
students enrolled for next year's term _ it could prove a big boost
to this island of 2.6 million residents, where per capita income is
about US$6,000. Jamaica's economic mainstays, like tourism, have
all been battered in the past decade by hurricanes, poor prices,
competition and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment runs at 20 percent, with the figure rising to 45
percent for those younger than 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate, CIT is a small _ but significant _ bright
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ram is guaranteeing that INDUSA will hire CIT's successful
graduates. He will pay them a beginning wage of US$7 to US$10 an
hour to work in Jamaica for American companies, with the promise
that salaries could rise with hard work and a few years experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican government has put its money up to make the
operation a success, paying $4,000 of the $6,000 total tuition per
student, while loaning many of the students the remainder if
necessary. The students must sign a pledge to remain in Jamaica for
at least three years after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement is based on the fact that demand for
programmers is so high in the United States that beginning college
graduates can sometimes fetch up to US$50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   But many of CIT's students say they want to stay in Jamaica, a
proud island nation with a rich cultural heritage. While most had
never done more than type simple forms on computers before they
enrolled, many believe their soon-to-be-earned diplomas will be
tickets to a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have sacrificed to be here,'' said Traceyann
Samuels, 27, who gave up a government job to enroll at CIT. ``But
it has to pay off. In four to five years, I see myself having my
own consulting business, doing work in software, imaging and
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Williams, 32, already has his own business _ a food
supplement venture that he and his wife are still running while he
attends CIT. He has designed a Web page for the business, and hopes
to design pages for others when he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many people here who do this now, and I think the
field is going to mushroom,'' he said. ``I had no university
training, but now I hope to set up my own Web design shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructors say CIT's curriculum is demanding: students attend
classes for 8 hours a day, often following that up with several
hours of lab work. They are learning all the latest computer tools,
including Web page design, C++, Visual Basic, Java and database
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students will have more hands-on computer experience in
their 10 months here than most university graduates will get in a
four-year degree program,'' said Michael Glova, CIT's managing
director. ``The universities promise a diploma, but we promise
skills that are in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The students are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a newspaper ad for this course and it seemed like the
answer to my prayers,'' said Salomie Lyles, 23, who worked in the
hospitality industry before enrolling. ``To get a degree in
computers would've taken three years, but here we are doing it in
10 months.''

 &HT;    RADICAL STEPS MAY BE NEEDED TO SAVE CHINA'S STILL ENDANGERED
PANDAS
 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   WOLONG, China _ Normally, cabbages don't threaten giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
   But here the big green plants shoulder up to the very edge of a
winding, rock-pocked road, then creep in neat rows high up the most
impossible-looking mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbage is only one calling card of humanity inexorably
pushing itself into misty wilderness heights, fragmenting the
bamboo-forested mountainland that supports the last clusters of the
estimated 1,000 giant pandas still living in the wilds of southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent habitat protections, wildlife experts assess
continuing human pressures as intense. They are not at all
convinced that the enchanting animals will survive to amble through
many new chapters in their three million-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the panda species, we have a long way to go,'' Liu
Yongfan, vice-director of the State Forestry Administration, told
Chinese and American scientists gathered at this nature reserve for
a conference on pandas earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   China at least is inching down the route of protection.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some efforts are being made to stop the human encroachment
that has cut up panda territory and divided the panda population,
making genetic in-breeding a potentially deadly problem and leaving
isolated, small groups susceptible to environmental crises that
larger numbers could weather.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Research is continuing to improve the achievements already
made in captive panda breeding, to assure the pandas survive
somewhere. China now has about 100 pandas living in captivity, most
of them bred at Chinese zoos and research institutes and the rest
captured from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And now the Chinese are laying the groundwork for the
precarious possibility of reintroducing to the wild, pandas born in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   But money, knowledge and national will are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because people don't know about the cabbages
snaking up nature reserve mountains, or the peasants still
stripping forests here for firewood, or about the poachers or the
hunters whose snares may grab pandas by mistake, but kill them
nonetheless, said Zhang Hemin, director of the China Research and
Conservation Center for the Giant Panda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, there is something wrong with the propaganda,''
Zhang lamented in an interview with Cox Newspapers. ``People read
about cloning, and they think there is no problem now with the
panda. Some say in the wild there are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His success is one reason for the blase attitude. Every time a
panda gives birth at Zhang's breeding center, the feel-good news is
trumpeted around the country by the official media.
</P>
<P>
   And before the panda conference here was half finished, Beijing
newspapers published optimistic accounts of the still tentative
hope Zhang had expressed in a speech to introduce captive-born
pandas to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of reintroduction may be an exciting, very
long-term project, but is fraught with difficulty under even the
best conditions. The newspapers did not mention that Zhang failed
to get state funding for the one-square-mile enclosure he wants to
build high on the mountain to begin experimental training, but will
be lucky to finance a semi-wild area of one-fifth of a square mile.
</P>
<P>
   If any pandas do become ready for release to the wild, a crucial
question is whether there is enough wild to support them.
</P>
<P>
   One key development that will help determine panda policy is a
panda survey that has been delayed several years for lack of funds,
according to Yan Xun, chief biologist for China's nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is to begin early next year with the aim of
generating solid estimates of the numbers of pandas alive today and
where they live. The last survey was finished in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the population is decreasing very fast, maybe we will
formulate some strict policies to stop the spread of townships or
even to remove some co-inhabited areas,'' Yan said, referring to
areas where both pandas and humans live.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wolong, a 720-square-mile nature reserve, attempts to
remove some peasant families who farm, hunt and collect wood simply
were called off. The issue was sensitive because many local
residents are ethnic Zang (of Tibetan origin) or Qiang, and the
central government has been under international fire elsewhere for
ham-fisted tactics against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of the rights of animals versus the rights
of people,'' explained Deng Xiangsui, director of wildlife
conservation here in Sichuan Province, where 80 percent of the
giant pandas are believed to live.
</P>
<P>
   One  policy change already, he said, was the outlawing of
timber-cutting throughout the region last fall. Although Deng said
the tough regulation long had been in the works, the central
government acted only after last year's devastating summer floods
cost millions of dollars
</P>
<P>
   and hundreds of lives _ another by-product of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the government went further and prohibited the
transport of lumber in protected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal frequently cited at the conference, which was run
by the Minnesota-based Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, is
setting up ``panda corridors'' to link reserves and other panda
habitat now divided by roads or communities or forest
clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Corridors would promote mixing of animals from different
geographic areas, potentially improving genetic diversity and
giving pandas wider areas to forage for food in the event of a
localized crisis such as fire or bamboo ``flowering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, a cyclical outburst of bamboo blooms killed
off large patches of bamboo, resulting in starvation deaths of 80
percent of the pandas in some isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Making such corridors is another tough goal, an example of
``nascent ecology'' that scientists don't quite know how to do yet,
according to Ulysses Seal, chairman of the American group.
</P>
<P>
   But something must be done to ease human pressure and better
protect the remnants of the panda population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without intervention,'' Seal said, ``I'd say in the next 100
years we'd see these fragmented (panda) populations wink out one by
one.''

   CHICAGO _ It's too soon to know whether we've gotten any

performance of William Bolcom's ``A View From the Bridge,'' based

SEATTLE'S SALMON SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE PAUL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bill Robinson was standing along a railing, spotting
silvery shadows just beneath the surface of the dark emerald water
below.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good-looking chinook right there,'' he said, pointing
out what was likely to be a 12- to 14-pound specimen. ``That's one
of those endangered fish,'' he added with a wry smirk.
</P>
<P>
   The dark spots on its back distinguish chinook salmon from the
smaller sockeyes that also were swimming through what are
officially known as the Hiram Chittenden Locks but locally called
the Ballard Locks or just the Locks.
</P>
<P>
   The Locks are one of Seattle's biggest tourist attractions. And
a free one at that. On a gorgeous summer day, people sunbathed on
the grassy banks nearby, strolled the concrete walkways and took
pictures of the yachts and crabbers going through the ic
marvel that separates the salt water of Puget Sound from the
freshwater lakes of Seattle's inner port.
</P>
<P>
   And they watched the salmon _ noble fish of Indian legend, of
Indian identity, of biological heroics and of cultural dominance _
``climb'' the Locks' concrete ladder. After spending two to four
years maturing in the ocean, the fish return here.
</P>
<P>
   The Locks present just one more challenge in the fish's journey
to the distant streambeds where they were born and where they will
soon die, said Robinson, who is executive director of the Northwest
Steelhead and Salmon Council of Trout Unlimited, a major
conservation organization.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that chinook and sockeye are still passing through the
Locks is next to miraculous when you consider how the wild salmon
stocks of the Pacific Northwest (and elsewhere in the world) have
been decimated after 100 years of overfishing, urban growth and
extreme habitat degradation. Since 1991, more than two dozen salmon
population groups in the region _ usually identified by the waters
they inhabit or return to _ have been listed for protection under
the Endangered Species Act. Others are being closely watched.
</P>
<P>
   How much the average Seattleite thinks about the fate of salmon
is hard to say, but in many ways the fish remain a powerful symbol
for all that is right and all that is wrong with life in the
Emerald City on Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything having to do with salmon,'' Robinson said, ``by and
large will affect everything else. These fish are nothing more than
an indicator of our quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Big for its britches?
</P>
<P>
   I last saw Seattle on a quick weekend trip in the mid-1980s.
Microsoft was a fledgling public company, and the sleepy downtown
seemed to get sleepier at night. Things have definitely changed:
Like many rebounding cities yearning for respect and convention
business, downtown Seattle has been Pottery Barned and Wolfgang
Pucked.
</P>
<P>
   And in the midst of its prosperity and aliveness, you'll come
face to face with the flip side: the hordes of homeless and walking
wounded and young drifters who remind you that the raging bull
market has not been wonderful for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The Downtown districts are gleaming with glass-walled shopping
palaces and an impressive concentration of fine and trendy dining
opportunities. The construction binge is hardly over, what with all
the high-tech billionaires pouring money on their nouveau dreams.
</P>
<P>
   If Seattle seems a little big for its britches, well, that's the
way of the with-it urban world right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all so in love with itself,'' said a friend who lives and
teaches there. ``It thinks it's London or something.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to find pockets of genuine Seattle. That fact
dawned on me as I was catching Bill Robinson's enthusiasm for the
sight of silvery salmon in the water at the Locks.
</P>
<P>
   Stem to stern
</P>
<P>
   Not everything in Seattle has to do with salmon, yet you're
never too far from water. At the Center for Wooden Boats, on the
south shore of Lake Union, you can find a gem of a place. Museum,
education complex and marina (instruction and rentals available),
the center celebrates boating. It operates on donations and
volunteer power.
</P>
<P>
   The center's slips and work areas offer a changing inventory of
boats needing repair and boats under construction. On the front
grounds, under an awning, rested a 600-year-old red cedar log from
Alaska, which is being carved into a 36-foot-long traditional Haida
canoe.
</P>
<P>
   One morning I found a restoration project under way. A blue tarp
covered the back end of a 60-foot ketch that is both obsession and
home to Seaton Gras. Gras is rebuilding the boat, the Merry Maiden,
from stern to stem, replacing rotted wood and thousands of corroded
bronze screws. ``Everything needs attention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gras hopes that by next year he will have it seaworthy again and
can take his teen-age daughter, Tiare, on a round-the-world cruise.
It won't be the first time for Gras. When he was 13, his father
took the family on the adventure of their lives. In this very boat
the Gras family of suburban Boston spent six years circumnavigating
the globe. After they returned, Gras took the Merry Maiden out
again, going around the world by himself in the next seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Merry Maiden had sat untouched for years until Gras, now 43
and still a self-described ``international spirit,'' decided to
take up his dream once more.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon struggles
</P>
<P>
   Bill Robinson prefers grilling fresh salmon at home _ with just
a bit of olive oil and some spices _ to eating the fish in
restaurants. Too often, he said, restaurant salmon is either
overcooked or oversauced.
</P>
<P>
   That might be true, but salmon justifiably is king in the many
restaurants that define Seattle's seafood cuisine. Ivar's and
Elliott's are old-line tourist attractions; Etta's, Chandler's,
Ray's, Anthony's _ locals line up behind their favorites just as
Kansas Citians square off over barbecue: Gates or Bryant's?
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the restaurant, fresh fish is as likely to be
hatchery-born or farm-raised as wild. Fishing regulations have
become so complex and seasons and allowable catches so variable
that finger-pointing by commercial fishermen, tribal fishermen,
sport fishermen, land interests and countries (the United States
vs. Canada, for instance) is common and the ranks of
self-supporting salmon boats are thinning. Yet, said Chris Mohr, an
Olympic Peninsula resort operator and sport-fishing lobbyist,
``Nobody wants to catch the last salmon.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite salmon's precarious status, the fishing industry remains
vital to Puget Sound. Halibut and cod are doing especially well,
industry people said. The great majority of the salmon boats based
at the Fishermen's Terminal, on the Lake Washington Ship Canal just
east of the Locks, take their catch in Alaska, where sockeye and
other species remain abundant, said Bill Anschutz of the city's
Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The early-morning bustle at Pike Place Market, home to four
fresh-fish companies, conveys one sign of health. Sockeye from
Alaska's Copper River region was the salmon du jour when I stopped
at Pike Place Fish. It was 7 a.m., still a couple hours before the
tourists would arrive, but an ideal time to see the historic market
coming alive. (Almost demolished in the early '80s, the market has
become the magnet of genuineness upon which Seattle's downtown and
waterfront revitalization depends.)
</P>
<P>
   At Pike Place Fish the garrulous, orange-slickered man known as
the Bear _ just the Bear, he said _ was stacking 300 pounds of
salmon, flown in overnight, on a freshly shoveled bed of ice. Later
in the day, the Bear turns into the archetypical
fishmonger//performance artist. His gruff voice will rise as he
banters with passing tourists. A voice will call out from behind
the counter _ ``Salmon'' _ the Bear will pick up one of the
20-pounders and fling it a dozen feet to the counter man, who'll
fillet it or wrap it up whole for a customer. ``Caution: Low Flying
Fish'' read the signs.
</P>
<P>
   And another thing ...
</P>
<P>
   One night, in search of a light dinner, I fell into Cafe
Campagne, a bistro and wine bar near Pike Place Market. I had
appetizers at the bar, including a delicately grilled salmon
brochette and a salad with smoked salmon and bits of orange.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another and soon I was talking salmon with a
nearby diner. A former biologist and natural historian who now
operates an adventure-tour business, John Tillotson lamented the
fate of the Duwamish River, which drains into Elliott Bay. Its
once-putrid mouth was mostly filled in by the manmade Harbor
Island, I'd learned from Bill Robinson. Yet in recent years it has
become cleaner and small stocks of brave fish still make their way
again upstream. I even had watched some Duwamish Chinook being
caught from a public pier in West Seattle, near the mouth of the
river.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sit on its banks you could understand the whole
region,'' said Tillotson, who had explored the river as a boy. What
he meant was you could contemplate the history of industrial
pollution, unchecked growth and civic misguidance. ``The only place
the river truly speaks,'' he added, ``is where the glacier drips.''
</P>
<P>
   As I said, one thing leads to another and soon we were speaking
with a couple who had arrived for a late dinner at the bar, Ron
Zimmerman and Carrie Van Dyck. Turned out they ran the Herbfarm,
which, in addition to its nursery and catalog operation in the
exurbs east of Seattle, presents one of the most extraordinary
dining experiences you'd find around here: a legendary nine-course,
five-hour meal comprising fresh ingredients and herbs that define
the cuisine of the Pacific Northwest. Zimmerman considers salmon
and cedar to be the region's pillars.
</P>
<P>
   Their restaurant burned in 1997 and only recently had they
resumed serving their special weekend dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, I was sitting at one of their tables in a
wine-tasting room in Issaquah. Some of Executive Chef Jerry
Traunfeld's delectable creations: a mussel speared by a sprig of
rosemary, Dungeness crab salad with chilled fennel foam, seared
weathervane scallops and summer chanterelles, breast of Muscovy
duck rubbed with lavender and black pepper, a sorbet made from
apricot and meadowsweet ...
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention the salmon? Traunfeld's king salmon came from
Humboldt Bay in northern California. He slow-baked it at 200
degrees. When the dish arrived, it was startling. The succulent
pink flesh had been wrapped in a now-transparent zucchini petal,
looking for all the world like (I really do apologize for this)
sheer lingerie.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly my search for the salmon soul of Seattle had taken an
unexpected turn.
</P>
<P>
   GOING TO SEATTLE
</P>
<P>
   Getting there
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is served by most major airlines and Amtrak. Southwest
Airlines offers nonstop flights from Kansas City; recent
promotional fares have been as low as $200 or so round trip, and
regular coach fares as much as $500 round trip in peak season.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around
</P>
<P>
   - By car: Interstates 5 and 90 meet near the heart of the city.
Driving around the city can pose a challenge, especially at rush
hour. ``You can't get there from here'' is a local motto. Ferries
connect Seattle with Bainbridge Island and other spots; for ferry
schedules and information: (206) 464-6400 or
www.wsdot.wa.gov//ferries/.
</P>
<P>
   - If you're staying downtown, the Metro Bus offers free service
in a large downtown zone. The Monorail connects Westlake Center and
Seattle Center ($1.25 each way for adults). The Waterfront
Streetcar ($1, or $1.25 at rush hour) runs up and down Alaskan Way
from Pier 70 to the International District, providing an easy
(although probably crowded) overview of ferry terminals, the
Seattle Aquarium and numerous bayfront attractions and eateries.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown accommodations
</P>
<P>
   Many of the major chains, from modest to high end, are
represented in or near downtown. Some other options:
</P>
<P>
   - Claremont Hotel, 2000 Fourth Ave. (at Virginia Street). This
locally owned redo has small-hotel charm, spacious rooms, a creaky
elevator, but exceptional service. $129-$189. (800) 448-8601.
</P>
<P>
   - Inn at the Market, 86 Pine St. A fine, cozy hotel right in the
thick of the Pike Place Market area. $155-$345. (800) 446-4484.
</P>
<P>
   - Pacific Plaza Hotel, 400 Spring St. A spartan, budget
alternative with small rooms but convenient to the Waterfront and
Pioneer Square. $104-$130; lower rates in winter. (800) 426-1165.
</P>
<P>
   - Houseboat Hideaways, various locations on Lake Union. Fully
furnished houseboats, including galley kitchens (but not food), can
be rented at prices rivaling those of elegant hotels. $165-$195.
(206) 323-5323.
</P>
<P>
   Dining out
</P>
<P>
   - Campagne, 86 Pine St., and Cafe Campagne, 1600 Post Alley (at
Pine). Top-notch French country cooking; the cafe is the casual
alternative to its more expensive partner upstairs. Campagne: (206)
728-2800; Cafe Campagne: (206) 728-2233.
</P>
<P>
   - Chandler's Crabhouse and Fresh Fish Market, 901 Fairview Ave.
North. A dockside location at South Lake Union makes this a
picturesque spot for reliably prepared fresh seafood, especially
Dungeness crab. (206) 223-CRAB (2722).
</P>
<P>
   - The Herbfarm Restaurant, temporarily located in Issaquah, 17
miles east of Seattle. Save up and plan ahead for a distinctive
dining experience: a nine-course, five-hour extravaganza of superb
food and wine. The menu changes weekly and with the seasons. It's a
fixed-price meal ($135 to $155 a person, plus tax and gratuity).
Make a reservation now; if it's booked, get on a waiting list or
keep trying, because late cancellations could open some spots for
you. (206) 784-2222.
</P>
<P>
   - Honey Court Seafood Restaurant, 516 Maynard Ave. S. In the
heart of the International District, this Chinese restaurant has
Vietnamese influences and many unusual seafood dishes. Not fancy
but reliable and reasonable. (206) 292-8828.
</P>
<P>
   - Longshoreman's Daughter, 3508 Fremont Place N., on the main
drag of the funky Fremont district. Try it for a stylish and
attitudinal spin on comfort food, including breakfast. (206)
633-5169.
</P>
<P>
   - Ray's Boathouse, 6049 Seaview Ave. NW, near Ballard Locks.
From pan-fried razor clams to house-smoked cod, and, of course,
whatever fresh salmon and other catches are available, Ray's is a
Seattle standby for finely prepared seafood with a gorgeous
waterside view of Shilshole Bay. Reservations are highly
recommended. (206) 789-3770.
</P>
<P>
   Attractions
</P>
<P>
   - Hiram M. Chittenden (or Ballard) Locks, 3015 N.W. 54th St.

   - Center for Wooden Boats, 1010 Valley St. (South Lake Union).
Free admission. (206) 382-2628 or www.cwb.org.
</P>
<P>
   - Fremont, centered on Fremont Avenue North and 36th Street
North. You have to wonder about a wacky, anything-goes neighborhood
with its own walking-tour brochures. Organized anarchy is always
suspicious, but Seattle is nothing if not self-conscious. And
Fremont typifies it: The arts-oriented district has unusual shops,
some funky and fine dining and a famous collection of public
sculptures, such as a genuine Lenin statue, salvaged from the
Soviet bloc, and a '50s-era decorative rocket.
</P>
<P>
   - Gas Works Park, North Northlake Way and Meridian Avenue North,
near Fremont and Wallingford neighborhoods. The rusting hulk of
industrial pipes makes for an eerie public sculpture in this
offbeat gathering place. The former gas plant has been turned into
a rolling green space with a spectacular view of the downtown
skyline across the water. Home to outdoor movies, concerts and the
western terminus of a 121/2-mile hiking and biking trail. Don't
miss the hilltop mosaic sundial.
</P>
<P>
   - International District, South Washington Street to South
Weller Streets, between Fourth and 12th avenues. Seattle's various
Asian communities, immigrants from Japan, China, Vietnam, Korea,
the Philippines and elsewhere, come together in this lively
commercial neighborhood of shops and restaurants. The district is
south of Pioneer Square and within a Ken Griffey dinger of the new
Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   - Pike Place Market, on Pike Place from Pike Street to Virginia
Street. Two decades after it was saved from certain demolition,
this longtime farmer's market and merchandise mall is still the
first stop for tourists, and deservedly so, for its genuine mix of
food, flowers, fish and fun. People watching, romantic dining, a
buzzing streetscape, it's the major local antidote to the
same-as-everywhere retailing that has surged into Downtown.
</P>
<P>
   - Pioneer Square, along First Avenue from Columbia Street to
Jackson Street. Like Pike Place Market, this old-town neighborhood
still has a vibrant, alternative feel, with lots of shopping,
eating and drinking opportunities. The soul of Pioneer Square can
be found in the huge Elliott Bay Bookstore (101 S. Main St.),
recently saved by a new, deep-pockets owner.
</P>
<P>
   - Seattle Center, Fifth Avenue at Broad and Mercer streets. This
is ground zero for the Space Needle: No matter how often you see it
from around town, up close is something else again. It's also home
to seasonal events, such as Labor Day's Bumbershoot Festival, and
permanent fixtures such as the Opera House, Intiman Theater and the
Children's Museum. Coming in the spring of 2000 is the Experience
Music Project, a rock museum inspired by local hero Jimi Hendrix,
paid for by Microsoft gazillionaire Paul Allen and designed by
architecture's Wizard of Wild, Frank Gehry.
</P>
<P>
   A SALMON MISCELLANY
</P>
<P>
   - Fact: There are five species of wild Pacific Northwest salmon:
chinook (sometimes called king), sockeye, coho, pink, chum.
Steelhead trout is a close relative. ``Farming'' of Atlantic salmon
in the region has caused some debate over the genetic implications.
</P>
<P>
   - Excerpt: ``Aflame with the crimson color of marriage, the
salmon// Seek their lovers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Mieko Chikappu, from ``Salmon Coming Home in Search of Sacred
Bliss''
</P>
<P>
   - Event: Salmon Homecoming, second weekend of September. The
Native American heritage celebration includes a coastal-tribe
gathering, a Plains-style powwow, entertainment events and public
forums on salmon and conservation issues. Based at Seattle Aquarium
and extending to locations along the waterfront area in both
directions. Information: (206) 386-4300.
</P>
<P>
   - Reading: David Hutchinson, proprietor of Flora &AMP; Fauna Books,
a Pioneer Square shop specializing in natural history, recommends
Salmon of the Pacific, by Adam Lewis (Raincoast Books; $14.95
paperback). The well-illustrated book introduces general readers to
salmon and their life cycles.
</P>
<P>
   - Trend: Pacific Northwest salmon stocks appear to have
rebounded a bit this year, at least partly helped by cyclical
changes in ocean conditions, according to reports. Yet two dozen
population groups in the region have been listed officially as
endangered. Puget Sound chinook, which is considered a Seattle
totem, joined the list just last March.
</P>
<P>
   - Excerpt: ``I am told by many of you that I must forgive and so
I shall after// that salmon leaps into the night air above the
water, throws// a lightning bolt at the brush near my feet, and
starts the fire// which will lead all of the lost Indians home//
...''

collection of the Seattle Art Museum, First Avenue and University
Street; (206) 654-3100.
</P>
<P>
   - Event: Issaquah Salmon Days, first full weekend of October:
Family-oriented events, entertainment, a salmon bake and other
activities, most of them free, celebrate the salmon's return and
typically attract 200,000 people to this town east of Seattle off
Interstate 90. (This year's event was its 30th anniversary.)
Fish-watching is possible at a state hatchery there and on Issaquah
Creek throughout the town. Information: (425) 392-0661 or

own kitchen or grill? Some of Seattle's seafood purveyors will ship
their salmon (and other fish) overnight. Among them: Pike Place
Fish, (800) 542-7732 or www.pikeplacefish.com, and Wild Salmon Fish

CHICAGO COMPANY OFFERS LUSH TAKES ON MILLER, `FALSTAFF' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ It's too soon to know whether we've gotten any
masterpieces out of the bunch. But the ongoing flowering of new
American operas suggests that a medium long derided for pompous
irrelevancy is, in fact, very much a living organism.
</P>
<P>
   Even smaller opera companies in the Midwest have been doing
their part to refresh the repertory. In the last 10 years alone,
Opera Theatre of St. Louis has mounted four main-stage premieres of
American operas, by David Carlson, Anthony Davis, Stephen Paulus
and Paul Schoenfield. 1998 saw world premieres from Lyric Opera of
Kansas City (Henry Mollicone's ``Coyote Tales''), Tulsa Opera (an
extensive revision of David Carlson's ``Dreamkeepers'') and Opera
Omaha (Libby Larsen's ``Eric Hermansson's Soul'').
</P>
<P>
   Particularly interesting now is a cluster of new operas based on
classics of 20th-century American literature and mounted by the
country's three top opera companies. Last season it was Tennessee
Williams' ``A Streetcar Named Desire,'' turned into an opera by
Andre Previn and introduced by San Francisco Opera. Come December,
the Metropolitan Opera will give the world premiere of John
Harbison's operatic version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ``The Great
Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   And just last weekend, Lyric Opera of Chicago gave the first
performance of William Bolcom's ``A View From the Bridge,'' based
on the original one-act version of Arthur Miller's play. Adding to
the allure of a Chicago weekend was a new production of
``Falstaff,'' with superstar bass-baritone Bryn Terfel as the
Lothario manque.
</P>
<P>
   Options also included a Chicago Symphony Orchestra concert, with
music director Daniel Barenboim conducting the Bartok First Piano
Concerto (with Yefim Bronfman as soloist) and Mahler's First
Symphony. (See accompanying story.)
</P>
<P>
   Streetwise `View'
</P>
<P>
   Miller himself joined Bolcom, librettist Arnold Weinstein and
other members of the creative team for a full-house public forum
Oct. 9 at the Merle Reskin Theater. And he pronounced the 1955
``View'' _ with the lawyer Alfieri as narrator//commentator in the
manner of a Greek chorus _ as a natural for operatic treatment.
(Indeed, the play first was turned into an opera back in 1961, by
Italian composer Renzo Rosselini, brother of the film director
Roberto Rosselini, but that version has vanished with scarcely a
trace.)
</P>
<P>
   Musically speaking, the new ``View'' will disturb no one's
digestion. Presumably befitting its setting in the shipyards of
1950s Brooklyn, it often suggests an updated Leonard Bernstein, in
streetwise ``West Side Story'' vein.
</P>
<P>
   Bolcom's tonality is tarted up with more added-note dissonance,
but he shares his late precursor's orchestral virtuosity and jazzy
urgency _ and his readiness to indulge in sheer opulence. The vocal
writing is mostly grateful, taking on more angularity and higher
pitch when dramatic tensions get screwed tighter.
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-a-half hours long with one intermission, the opera is
set in an Italian-American neighborhood in the port community of
Red Hook. Eddie Carbone, a dockworker, is married to the sensible,
long-suffering Beatrice. But their marriage is threatened by
Eddie's obsession with his orphaned 17-year-old niece, Catherine,
who shares their small apartment.
</P>
<P>
   This obsession comes to a head when Eddie and Bea take in two of
her cousins, illegal aliens _ ``submarines,'' they're called _
fresh off the boat from Italy. Soon a romance sparks between
Catherine and Rodolpho, whose blond hair and singing set him apart
from the community's macho males.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to drive a wedge between the young lovers, Eddie even
insinuates that Rodolpho is gay and interested in marrying
Catherine only to gain citizenship. When this ploy fails, Eddie
betrays Rodolpho and Marco to the immigration authorities, which
makes him anathema in the community.
</P>
<P>
   When Marco returns to the apartment, Eddie pulls a knife and the
two struggle. Marco finally grabs Eddie's arm and with it plunges
the knife into his betrayer's chest. The lawyer Alfieri and the
chorus, who have shared scene-setting and commentary, close the
opera with musings on Eddie's fate and its place in a history going
back to ancient Sicily and Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The play has been skillfully nipped and tucked by Weinstein, who
previously collaborated with Bolcom and Robert Altman on
``McTeague,'' introduced by Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1992. Miller
himself has contributed a new soliloquy for Marco, lamenting that
he has escaped from poverty in Italy only to be betrayed by someone
he thought was a friend.
</P>
<P>
   But does ``View'' work, dramatically, as an opera? What I find
less than convincing is the full and immediate disclosure of
Eddie's passion for Catherine. An epiphany more gradually achieved
would have lent more natural tension to the early scenes. And
repeated ``Yehs'' from a purely incidental character called Mike
were unnecessary and annoying.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Chicago staging, by director Frank Galati (of
``Ragtime'' fame), was a fine piece of work. The evocative set,
with its crisscrossings of girders, railed ramp and balconies, was
designed by Santo Loquasto, who also did the costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The effect was much enhanced by Wendall K. Harrington's
background projections of harbor scenes. (Why don't opera companies
do more with projections?) Lighting designer Duane Schuler went for
unremitting gloom, but there was a reason for it.
</P>
<P>
   Emotionally and vocally, Kim Josephson was a powerhouse Eddie,
and he had his match in Catherine Malfitano's ardent, full-voiced
Beatrice. Alas, Juliana Rambaldi's edgy soprano made Catherine a
less alluring Lolita. Gregory Turay was a handsome, winsome
Rodolpho, and in the first act, when he didn't overextend his
essentially lyric tenor, he pleased the ear. But in the second act
highflying vocal lines put both the young lovers over the aural
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McCrory sensitively balanced Marco's rough edges with his
intrinsic sense of honor. It's too bad Bolcom stuck his sturdy
bass-baritone in so ungratefully low a range at the beginning and
end of the new ``Ship Called Hunger'' aria. Timothy Nolen was a
dignified, richly textured Alfieri.
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Dennis Russell Davies occasionally let the orchestra
play too loudly, but it certainly played well _ expressively and
responsively. Both musically and dramatically, Donald Palumbo's
chorus was a strong participant.
</P>
<P>
   Luxurious `Falstaff'
</P>
<P>
   I didn't much care for Frank Philipp Schloessman's ``Falstaff''
set, which looked like a lot of cheap knotty-pine paneling
stenciled with architectural details. And what was the point of Sir
John's emergence from a red-walled, rough-lidded underground lair?
Olivier Tambosi's direction also made for a curiously slack,
directionless third act.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryn Terfel, who was such a hit in his Kansas City recital
last fall (sponsored by the William Jewell College Fine Arts
Program), was the Falstaff of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Others have made the errant knight a more visibly sympathetic
character, more pitiable in his delusions. Terfel's Falstaff was a
grotesque, with huge belly, lurching and tottering and massaging
his lumbago. But the sympathy was in his voice, big and luxurious,
his every word clear and meaningful.
</P>
<P>
   Bernadette Manca di Nissa was a Mistress Quickly to die for,
with a contralto big as all outdoors but also supple _ and capable
of a high float. Brad Cresswell's Dr. Caius, in splendid voice, was
another luxury. Lucio Gallo was a dashing Ford, with tones to
match, but I thought his jealousy a bit too hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Risley and Kallen Esperian were effective as,
respectively, Meg Page and Alice Ford, if without compelling
individuality. Raymond Aceto was an outstanding Pistola; honorably
rounding out the cast were David Cangelosi as Bardolfo, Inva Mula
as Nannetta and Gwyn Hughes Jones as Fenton.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Pappano drew the maximum of color and energy from
Verdi's score, but coordination between stage and pit wasn't as
secure as one would have expected.
</P>
<P>
   The performances
</P>
<P>
   Lyric Opera of Chicago performances of ``A View From the
Bridge'' run through Nov. 5; performances of ``Falstaff'' continue
through Oct. 29. A company premiere of Handel's ``Alcina,'' with
Rene Fleming, opens Oct. 30. Call (312) 332-2244, Ext. 500, for
ticket information.

WILLIAM LEAST HEAT-MOON CHRONICLES THE JOYS AND PERILS OF AN
AMERICAN JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GEORGE GURLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   River-Horse: The Log Book of a Boat Across America, by William
Least Heat-Moon (506 pages; Houghton Mifflin; $26)
</P>
<P>
   William Least Heat-Moon followed his peripatetic best seller,
Blue Highways, with PrairyErth, a ``deep map'' profile of Chase
County, Kan., that celebrated the wonders of a single place.
</P>
<P>
   He resumes his nomadic ways with River-Horse: The Log Book of a
Boat Across America (506 pages; Houghton Mifflin; $26), a magical
book that belongs among such American classics as the journals of
Lewis and Clark, Walden and Mark Twain's Mississippi River
writings.
</P>
<P>
   The cross-country saga unfolds aboard a 22-foot dory that
Heat-Moon named Nikawa, ``river horse'' in Osage. The narrative is
a web of adventures, anecdotes, encounters with colorful
characters, scraps of history, philosophical and lyrical musings
and occasional polemics against our depredations of the land. A
thread of humor runs through it all.
</P>
<P>
   The dream of this interior journey by rivers, lakes and canal
from Atlantic to Pacific _ more than 5,000 miles in a single season
_ was born in the creek that ran near Heat-Moon's boyhood home in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``One afternoon, when I was 10 and messing about in it, I
suddenly realized it wasn't a dead end,'' Heat-Moon writes. ``That
flow around my ankles actually went somewhere. Just like a road, it
had a destination far beyond my sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat-Moon, of course, became a consummate American traveler: ``I
can now say I've visited every county in the contiguous United
States except for a handful in the Deep South, and those I'll get
to soon. Put your finger at random anyplace in this United States
atlas, and I've either been there or within twenty-five miles of
it, but for the desert of Nevada where the gap can be about twice
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years before Heat-Moon's Nikawa left Newark Bay, N.J., in
April 1995, the veteran roadrunner had another awakening that drove
him to watery highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed the web of faint azure lines, a varicose scribing of
my atlas,'' he writes in an echo of Marlowe's opening monologue in
Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness. ``They were rivers. I began
tracing those twistings in search of a way to cross America in a
boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Blue Highways and PrairyErth were solo efforts, and Heat-Moon
considers isolation ``almost a necessity for writers.'' But he
decided to invite friends along for River-Horse. They appear as a
``sequential composite'' character, Pilotis _ ``my pelorus of the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   He wanted his trip to be a ``jolly'' one, and the running
dialogue between him and Pilotis provides much of the delightful
buoyancy of River-Horse. Like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza, the two
characters prod each other into friendly//disputatious banter.
Pilotis rises to the surface of a conversation ``like a hungry
pike'' and pursues ``thoughts as if they were mayflies,'' writes
Heat-Moon. Pilotis' prudence ``serves to raise my pluck.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiking in the Rocky Mountains, Heat-Moon takes a mouthful of
snow. ``There's one scoop of precipitation that won't make it to
the Atlantic,'' says Pilotis. Rethink that, says Heat-Moon. Pilotis
considers, then: ``Yes, I guess it still will _ unless we cross the
Divide tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pilotis device is a lovely evocation of friendship, a
friendship so close the two seem like poles of a single
personality.
</P>
<P>
   `Snowmelt imperative'
</P>
<P>
   Trees hurled by raging rivers, channels choked by nearly
impenetrable mazes of willows, violent weather and mechanical
problems threaten the passage of Nikawa. The crew cringes when
someone says ``things are going well.'' Great Ears _ the
cantankerous, vindictive Missouri River _ is sure to overhear and
make them pay.
</P>
<P>
   The ``snowmelt imperative'' _ the need to reach the Western
rivers in time to catch water running off the Rocky mountains _
gives the story a sense of urgency. River-Horse is not an idyll
about ``messing around in boats.'' It's a fear-haunted quest, a
race against time.
</P>
<P>
   When the action lags, Heat-Moon's writing keeps River-Horse
afloat. The Missouri is ``like a cross-grained grandfather,'' he
writes. It will ``do anything but bore us.'' An old fellow is
``pale as if he'd been partially erased.'' Adventure is ``putting
into motion one's ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat-Moon has a wonderful ear for dialogue. Waitresses
encountered along the way score some memorable lines: ``Now you
boys keep your mast up and your keel down,'' says one. (``Was that
sexual?'' wonders a crew member.)
</P>
<P>
   Heat-Moon doesn't exploit his Native American heritage _ he has
a bit of Osage blood _ but when it comes into play, you can hear an
eagle-bone whistle in his prose. On a riverbank stroll years before
this trip, about to give up looking for Indian pictographs, he
suddenly spots the Plains Indian sign for the Moon of Heat and
experiences another epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that eroded limestone was a drawing of my name. I realized
William Clark and Meriwether Lewis, whose names I also bear _
William Lewis Trogdon _ had seen it, the only piece of Indian
`picture writing' all of us _ red, white, mixed _ ever encountered.
A few months later, I moved to an old farm near the river bluffs,
and I began seriously hunting a water way across America.''
</P>
<P>
   Such coincidences are thematic in River-Horse. Whenever disaster
threatens, some saving agency intervenes. (According to Pilotis,
Heat-Moon's ``whilom wife'' said he's not smart, but he is lucky.)
In a stretch of unreadable river, the only man capable of guiding
them suddenly appears out of nowhere. ``You just got to look
ahead,'' Billy Joe Conrad tells them. Then he sits in the stern,
tells them he's blind in one eye and faces the wake where they've
been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I'm not responsible if you hit something,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Characters as various and colorful as Canterbury pilgrims flow
through the pages of River-Horse. They meet a salesman more
interested in the problems of marketing store-brand detergent than
their quest and a ``loud, cigar-gnawing bantam'' official who won't
let them take Nikawa out of the flooding Missouri River. Strangers
rescue them, feed them and help them on their way. A chance meeting
with such a family on the river at Commerce, Mo., reads like a lost
chapter out of Huckleberry Finn.
</P>
<P>
   When Kansas City hoves into view, ``the city towers rose from
the river bluffs like Oz and gave us a remarkable riverscape,''
writes Heat-Moon. But he comes down hard on this city for
squandering its gift of nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kansas City, Missouri, is the preeminent city on the longest
river in America, but you would never know it from talking to the
inhabitants ... There is no spiritual link between them and it and
only a distant awareness of its connection to their iced tea,
potted geraniums, and baptized babies ... Kansas City, born of the
Missouri, has turned away from its great genetrix more than almost
any other river city in America.''
</P>
<P>
   River-Horse is an education, a rich book, a long book that I
wished were longer. It stirs a certain uneasiness of the kind
expressed on faces that watched the voyagers pass by. They
``betrayed a wistfulness, as if their lives were little more than
anchors.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the voyage, Heat-Moon lies down on warm soil
and muses in a fashion worthy of Melville's Ishmael: ``I thought
how far I was from where and when this journey began, how I was so
distant from that fellow passing for me 20 months ago, the one so
eager to learn the secrets of river passage. Could he _ the me of
that moment _ and I sit down together, he would want to know what I
knew and absorb what I had experienced, and he would regard me
enviously, just as I do those men who have returned from the moon.
But there would be forever a distance between him and me: I went
and he did not.''

BLUE JEANS DANCE BACK INTO THE FASHION PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACKIE WHITE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could assume in today's space-age culture that 150-year-old
denim would fade into the background and like, say, big hair, the
color purple and mile-high stiletto heels, become merely the
favored choice of a few loyals.
</P>
<P>
   Not a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are jeans still a national uniform of sorts, but once
again, denim is also the hot topic on the fashion front.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everyone who is anyone in the apparel business is
offering a jeans line. Designer Anna Sui, for one example, launched
a new label this season.
</P>
<P>
   A significant number of the fashion media was decked out in
denim jeans jackets during the New York spring fashion week last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Then they watched high-end designers such as Oscar de la Renta,
Marc Jacobs and John Bartlett flood the spring runways with
everything from denim jeans suits to ballgown skirts and chemises.
</P>
<P>
   Two seasons earlier in Europe, Tom Ford's Gucci jeans, drenched
with a heavyweight dose of beaded embroidery and feathers, set off
the explosion of embellished denim. And just last week during the
French spring fashion collections, Christian Dior's designer John
Galliano sent out a high-cropped, belted denim jacket over a dress
cut from silk imprinted with jeans images.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about shining moments. This is it for denim,'' declared
trade journal Women's Wear Daily in a special supplement recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``One beauty of the denim fabric,'' says Sarah Clancy, a product
developer with the Lee Co. in Merriam, ``is it can always take on a
different life.''
</P>
<P>
   As with most major fashion ideas, denim is a cyclical trend.
``Every time a designer doesn't know what to do, he pulls up denim
to stir up an audience,'' says Norman Karr, the executive director
of New York-based Jeanswear Communication, a public relations leg
of the jeans industry. ``The designer knows there is a universal
appeal. ... It's sort of, look what they've done to denim now.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk through most any department or discount store these days
and you'll fall into a sea of indigo _ dozens of shades from dark
to streaked to light _ with an overwhelming variety of labels and
styles ranging from boot cut and straight leg to the new, popular
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   And you can expect more to come. In the fashion category, dark
blue denim, which has been around awhile, is still a favorite. But
with fashion-oriented products capturing the consumer's attention,
you can expect to see a burst of new imaginative looks moving into
the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein is marketing what he calls ``dirty denim'' for
spring 2000. It's stone-washed with a sanded finish, according to
Fairchild Publications. And Klein's product will come with a hang
tag that says it ``... looks and feels like it walked a thousand
miles, then crawled a few more. Lived a lifetime on horseback. Fell
off a motorcycle and got back up again ...''
</P>
<P>
   The Lee Co.'s version is called ``Metro denim,'' with two
finishes dubbed ``Corrosion'' and ``Petrol.'' Clancy says it is
sandblasted, laundered, sanded around the details and ultimately
washed with a colored tint.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the brightest spotlight is focused on decorated
denim. Reminiscent of the 1970s when denim was the canvas for
artistic adornment, jeans in stores are beaded, trimmed with silk
or contrasting fabrics, embroidered or printed. Hems are scalloped
or decked with prints.
</P>
<P>
   It's a decidedly more feminine look, says Tina Hodak, the
fashion director of the Jones Store parent company, who says the
adornment is driving the jeans resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   Other styling ideas involve cropped pants or cutoffs below the
knee. And spring is expected to bring high-rise ``flood pants.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jeans are only part of the story. The influence is also
lying heavily on the collective minds of the fashion industry. It's
like the practice of some designers and manufacturers who found
success by fashioning familiar sportswear shapes into luxurious
fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   Welt seaming and stitching, almost everyone's skinny pants in
leather or sequins, and jeanslike short jackets are some examples
of the impact, says Gregg Andrews, fashion director with Nordstrom
stores. ``It has a life unto itself,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And denim is being mixed with silks and rayons to produce a
sheen. ``It makes it look a little dressier and the jeans are worn
with beaded tops and strappy sandals,'' Andrews notes.
</P>
<P>
   Is denim selling? Fashionable looks, yes. Basics have been
``soft,'' says Kathy Bradley-Riley, sportswear merchandise group
manager for Doneger, New York-based retail consultants.
</P>
<P>
   Troubles at Levi Strauss, which has closed some European plants
and laid off workers, have illuminated the difficulties of an
apparel business that often turns on a trend. Most observers put
blame on Levi's internal problems and perhaps the company's
inability to stay in touch with the customers and move quickly on
trends. Nevertheless, the company is introducing several labels
that include the basics and the decidedly trendy.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, jeans sales are up about 3 percent to 4 percent over
last year, Karr says.

 &HT;    Feeling older all the time
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Just in case you weren't feeling too old today,
this may certainly change things. According to an e-mail I
received, each year, the staff at Beloit College in Wisconsin puts
together a list to try to give the faculty a sense of the mindset
of that year's incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   Here is this year's list that was sent to me:
</P>
<P>
   _ The people who are starting college this fall across the
nation were born in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have no meaningful recollection of the Reagan Era and did
not know he had ever been shot.
</P>
<P>
   _ They were prepubescent when the Persian Gulf War was waged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Black Monday 1987 is as significant to them as the Great
Depression.
</P>
<P>
   _ There has been only one Pope. They can only really remember
one president.
</P>
<P>
   _ They were 11 when the Soviet Union broke apart and do not
remember the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have never feared a nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   _ They are too young to remember the space shuttle blowing up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tianamen Square means nothing to them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Their lifetime has always included AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bottle caps have always been screw off and plastic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Atari predates them, as do vinyl albums. The expression ``you
sound like a broken record'' means nothing to them.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have likely never played Pac Man and have certainly never
heard of Pong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Star Wars looks very fake to them, and the special effects are
pathetic.
</P>
<P>
   _ There have always been red M&AMP;M's and blue ones are not new.
There used to be beige ones?
</P>
<P>
   _ They may have heard of an 8-track, but probably never have
actually seen or heard one.
</P>
<P>
   _ The compact disc was introduced when they were 1 year old.
</P>
<P>
   _ As far as they know, stamps have always cost about 32 cents.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have always had an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have always had cable.
</P>
<P>
   _ There have always been VCRs, but they have no idea what Beta
is.
</P>
<P>
   _ They cannot fathom not having a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Roller skating has always meant inline for them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tonight Show has always been with Jay Leno.
</P>
<P>
   _ Popcorn has always been cooked in the microwave.
</P>
<P>
   _ They never took a swim and thought about ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Vietnam War is as ancient history to them as WWI, WWII or
even the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   _ They have no idea that Americans were ever held hostage in
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   _ They can't imagine what hard contact lenses are.
</P>
<P>
   _ They never heard, ``Where's the beef?'' ``I'd walk a mile for
a Camel,'' or ``de plane, de plane!''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Titanic was found? They thought we always knew where it
was.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kansas, Chicago, Boston, America, and Alabama are places, not
groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ McDonald's never came in foam containers.
</P>
<P>
   _ There has always been MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Do you feel old yet?

 &HT;    Clearing up an earlier news story
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ ``Texas Constitution 2000'' is a small
group of people with a big idea: persuade 176 out of 254 counties
in the state to ratify a roughly 20-page proposed state
constitution to replace the present document. Why 176 counties?
Because the proportion of 176 out of 254 is the same percentage as
the nine of 13 colonies that were required to ratify the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Sabine County was the first county to ``ratify'' this
constitution a few weeks ago, when 16 people showed up at the
ratification convention, held at the Fairmount Volunteer Fire
Department outside of Hemphill, the county seat. Attendees say the
vote among the 16 was unanimous. One down, 175 to go. Next stop,
according to a press release sent from the group last week, is
neighboring San Augustine.
</P>
<P>
   I pointed out to Wes Burnett, one of the writers of the proposed
constitution and a fellow newspaper publisher in West Texas, that
16 people is not an overwhelming number. He countered by saying the
event was well publicized, with the proposed constitution inserted
into the Sabine County paper, and several ads run announcing the
meeting. His analogy was to voter turnout: There's no requirement
that a minimum number of voters show up at the polls for an
election to be valid. Maybe so, but 16 is a pretty slim number for
ratifying a constitution, even in tiny Sabine County.
</P>
<P>
   There have been numerous efforts to rewrite the state's current
constitution, in existence since 1876. At the time, the Legislature
was dominated by rural interests who distrusted the big-city
politicians and drafted a document that compels voters to decide
matters usually decided by legislatures. That's why our
constitution has nearly 400 amendments, and why we'll head to the
polls again next month to consider another dozen or so proposed
amendments. As state Rep. Jim McReynolds (D-San Augustine) put it,
Texas has a cumbersome process that is probably not the most
democratic way to do things, since amendment-only elections
typically have turnouts of less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant) agrees. He and San
Angelo Democratic Rep. Rob Junell took a shot at rewriting the
constitution during the last session, an effort that went
absolutely nowhere. Ratliff told me last week that there are only
two ways to rewrite the constitution:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Legislature can hold a constitutional convention, as was
attempted in the 1970s;
</P>
<P>
   _ Or the entire constitution can be rewritten by one giant
amendment that would in effect replace the existing document, the
tact Ratliff and Junell tried.
</P>
<P>
   Either way the voters would have to approve a new document.
Ratliff doubts he'll try again in 2001, noting drily that ``the
Legislature doesn't particularly act in the absence of crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   There may not be a crisis, but eventually, as McReynolds said,
Texas is going to have to rewrite its constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ratliff nor McReynolds had heard of Texas Constitution
2000, but both are understandably skeptical of the effort, mainly
because holding ``ratification meetings'' in separate counties
isn't described as a way that the constitution can be rewritten. I
suspect their skepticism will increase if and when they read the
proposed constitution. It would be a radical change. Under the
proposed new constitution:
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas in effect would become a separate nation and secede from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   _ Taxation would be prohibited, and the government would exist
on voluntary contributions.
</P>
<P>
   _ No types of gun control would be permitted. You could own a
cruise missile if you wished and had the money.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas would be prohibited from issuing currency. The new
nation would presumably have to rely on the gold standard.
</P>
<P>
   _ All ``foreign agents,'' including federal officers of the FBI,
DEA, etc. would be required to leave once the new constitution went
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more, and you can read if for yourself on the
Internet at www.tcrf.com.
</P>
<P>
   I called the toll-free number and talked to Dan Hollis, who is
on the ratification committee. He admitted I was the first person
to call the number, which just became active last week. I asked the
obvious question: Say this group actually manages to get this
ratified by holding meetings in 176 counties. Does anyone actually
believe the state of Texas will simply hand over the reins of
power?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. Hollis doesn't know what would happen next, though he
assured me his group's motives are entirely peaceful, a sentiment
echoed by publisher Burnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're advocating is a lawful and peaceful transition from
what we have now,'' Hollis said.
</P>
<P>
   I find it sad that there are intelligent people out there who
feel so utterly alienated from our government. I'm no fan of
government; far too often, it's incompetent, overly intrusive and
uncaring. But I don't view government as the enemy, and I believe
it does a great deal of good. Government, through our taxes, funds
public schools, maintains roads, offers our children a college
education at a reasonable price, provides fire protection, runs
libraries and does a myriad other things. The idea of living in a
society without a representative government has no appeal to me _
though like most folks I think I pay too much in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   That people are able to band together and espouse such radical
notions without fear of prosecution or retribution is proof that
our system of government, however imperfect, is that best man has
been able to create. Messrs. Hollis, Burnett and company are
perfectly free to try, peacefully, to change our form of
government, to talk people into adopting a constitution that would
radically change our way of operating.
</P>
<P>
   I just think they're flat wrong, but I'll go to my grave
defending their right to say what they please.

 &HT;    In Mexico, the idea of a free press takes hold
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The air in this urban behemoth has been thick for
years, but in the past few has carried a whiff of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist sentiment has always been part of Mexican political
rhetoric, but those words seldom matched the reality of a political
monopoly run for the benefit of the very few. These days, however,
you can see, feel and hear manifestations of political competition.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the nomination of the Partido Revolucionario
Institucional (the Institutional Revolutionary Party) was
tantamount to victory. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican press, so timid in criticizing government for so
long, is flexing editorial muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The road to democracy in Mexico has been widened, and there is
no turning back. What is amazing is the sudden nature of that shift
in political culture.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI dominance has been cracking as opposition parties
captured municipal and state power and won seats in the Congress.
These days, Mexicans are living proof that once you give people a
taste of democracy, they get hungry for more.
</P>
<P>
   The democratization movement is fueled by advances in technology
that make it possible for information to travel quickly and
broadly, making a mockery of borders, making it easy for people to
compare and contrast all facets of life.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican newspapers, for example, are looking north for new
models. The Mexico City daily, La Reforma turned to Max Jennings,
former editor of the Dayton Daily News, who spent months in the
Mexican capital, training the staff on news gathering North
American style.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Francisco Ealy Ortiz, the larger-than-life publisher of El
Universal, another Mexico City daily, used the 30th anniversary of
his administration earlier this month as a platform from which to
demand freedom of information and public-records legislation. Now
in its 83rd year, El Universal underwent an extensive format change
with the help of the American Press Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the newspaper's staff has been undergoing an overhaul
as well. Roberto Rock, editor of El Universal, joked with a group
of visiting North American newspaper editors that the staff used to
be so old that those wanting a job at the newspaper would scheme to
induce turnover. ``They plot to leave windows open in the winter
hoping that someone would catch pneumonia,'' he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   The staff is younger _ average age about 31 _ and better
educated. Moreover, they do business differently. Mexican
journalists of yesteryear generally fell into two very broad
categories: those who would trade favorable coverage for cash and
those who would probe relentlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fell into the latter category could expect to be
threatened, harassed or killed.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a reporter for La Tarde was shot 12 times _ nine
times in the face _ as he walked down the street. No one can say
who did it.
</P>
<P>
   So for both political and professional reasons, Ealy's push on
press freedom issues is bold talk indeed, but the publisher is a
bold man.
</P>
<P>
   He is bright, articulate, well-connected and certainly
self-assured. He talks of fighting the enemies of El Universal for
the past 30 years and coming out on top. It was surely no
coincidence that each musical group hired to entertain _ and he
hired a bunch of them, everything from mariachis to a full
orchestra _ during a three-day bash to celebrate his three decades
of leadership played ``My Way.''
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, however, newspapers like El Universal play to
a small, affluent crowd. The medium with real reach is radio. As in
North America, talk radio in Mexico is very popular. That doesn't
mean, however, that politicians can ignore Ealy.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican talk-radio hosts, like their North American
counterparts, use newspapers as a springboard into their topics, so
while the direct influence may be limited, the indirect influence
is more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics may like to think that this democracy craze is
transitory, that it's possible for Mexico to return to old
political ways. It is not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ealy and other Mexican newspaper publishers, editors and
reporters truly have it their way in the future remains very much
to be seen. Nonetheless, the signs today are quite promising.

 &HT;    Sizing up early favorites to fill Luna's Senate seat

amendments. If none of the Senate candidates gets a majority, the
governor will call a runoff a few weeks later between the top two
finishers, regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   State Reps. Leticia Van de Putte, 44, and Leo Alvarado Jr., 60,
both Democrats, were among the five candidates who filed as of the
Oct. 4 filing deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Puente, the dean of the San Antonio House
delegation, whose legislative district overlapped much less with
the Senate district than the other two, passed up the race because
of a young family and busy law practice. He would have had Luna's
support had he run.
</P>
<P>
   Luna, 66, was rumored to have been planning to retire after the
legislative session anyway _ and now his diabetes has caused him to
have both legs amputated in August. He had served eight years in
the Texas House of Representatives before election to the Texas
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Luna had missed much of the 1999 session because of
complications from his diabetes _ though at one point he had asked
that if a vote on vouchers was to be taken, he be given time to get
there, even if it was on a stretcher, to vote ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio observers consider the race to be between the two
state representatives, and the question appears to be whether Van
de Putte, a pharmacist, will win it without a runoff. Alvarado is
recovering from esophageal cancer, and the main question seems to
be whether he will dip into his own pocket to finance negative
attacks against his colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Lauro Bustamante, 48, a lawyer, also has filed to run.
He's a cousin of former U.S. Rep. Albert Bustamante, but any
benefit he picks up from sharing the surname is colored by his
cousin's defeat for re-election to Congress in 1992 in a cloud of
scandal over bribery allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Also running for the Senate seat are Republicans Mark Weber, 40,
who lists himself as self-employed, and Anne Newman, 52, a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans are considered on the conservative side of
the Republican Party and are not expected to have much chance. The
26th ranks among the most Democratic-leaning of Texas' 31 Senate
districts.
</P>
<P>
   One question is how much an election on whether to pay for a new
sports arena for San Antonio with an increased hotel/motel/rental
car tax might have on the Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   Although Republicans normally turn out better than Democrats for
special elections, stadium backers are expected to spend money to
get Hispanic voters to the polls, because they tend to favor the
stadium. They also tend to favor Democrats, and the district is 65
percent Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   While a state representative does not have to give up his or her
seat to run in the special election, Van de Putte says she'll run
for the Senate seat next year even if she loses the special
election.
</P>
<P>
   Two candidates are already campaigning for Van de Putte's House
seat. Municipal Court Judge Robbie Vazquez resigned Oct. 2 in order
to be ready to run, and Mike Villareal, a computer database
developer, has already sent out a fund-raising letter signed by
former Mayors Henry Cisneros and Nelson Wolff.
</P>
<P>
   Trey Fischer, a lawyer, is looking at Alvarado's House seat, as
is John Elizondo, son of County Commissioner Paul Elizondo, a
former state representative. Others are expected to jump in.
</P>
<P>
   And so on . . . Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-Laredo, who had been
pondering retiring, now says she'll seek re-election. That
sidelined the potential races of state Rep. Henry Cuellar
(D-Laredo) and former state Rep. Richard Raymond (D-Benavides), who
lost a statewide race last year for land commissioner. Both had
been gearing up for a Senate race.

 &HT;    Why is it news when Christians talk environmentalism?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ They came from all over the country _ authors,
scientists, scholars. They jammed reams of research and analysis
into two days, all focused on a riveting modern-day discovery:
</P>
<P>
   Christianity and environmentalism: Same thing!
</P>
<P>
   A equals B equals A. Take one. Substitute the other. Dismiss
one, dismiss both.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a modern-day discovery because any distinction seemed
silly centuries back, when man was tied so closely to the land.
Native Americans were Franciscans. They just didn't know it. Yes,
they took down a buffalo or two, but never three or four _ hundred
thousand.
</P>
<P>
   Saint Francis of Assisi, who many believe came as close to
perfection as any mortal, saw nature as his altar, his temple, his
place of worship. One would hear analogies over and over at
``Caring for Creation,'' a Baylor University conference
co-sponsored by the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For God so loved the world, interpreted
author/pastor/activist/TV host Tony Campolo for the Baylor
audience, that he gave his only begotten son to ``rescue his
messed-up creation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take the Bible seriously, we'll be environmentalists,''
he said. We will hear the songs of whales as hymns. We will see the
torching of rain forests as pagan sacrifice. We will oppose
environmental degradation not just because it spoils God's gifts
but because the poor _ ``the least of these'' _ are most sure to
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was the first of a series sponsored by the BGCT
and reflects a break-out mentality among some believers.
</P>
<P>
   These Christians seemingly have one word they must battle: the
``dominion'' that Genesis 1:28 gives man over all, from prairie dog
to sea urchin.
</P>
<P>
   But only a foolish king would gobble up all the sea urchins like
jelly beans, disrupting food chains, setting off chains of gradual
cataclysm.
</P>
<P>
   Hence a working Christian term to sustain all: stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   As a bumper sticker at the conference read, a symbolic fish in
the center: ``Extinction is not stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   Dudley Burton, chairman of the Baylor Department of
Environmental Studies, hosted a discussion on sustainability _ the
paradigm of consuming and conserving that leaves something there
for all in need and for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   As crucial and theological as this concept may be, ``The Baptist
Church has not been at the forefront of this movement,'' bemoaned
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why churches might take a pass, judging by the
chief motivation that drives every day but Sunday. Greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homo-economicus'' is how University of Northern Arizona
Professor and author Max Oelschlaeger terms our modern-day bent. We
are defined not as inspired beings or stewards, but as consumers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our freedom comes from picking Coke or Pepsi.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism like this runs counter to the American way,
acknowledged Campolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frugality is a subversive lifestyle,'' he said. And when the
greatest good is stated not by Scripture but by the Dow, the
disciples of ``ecumenical environmentalism'' have their work cut
out.
</P>
<P>
   Suffice it to say that Pat Robertson and the Christian Coalition
can't talk about environmentalism without attaching ``radical'' to
the term.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it a news flash when Christian scholars get together to
discuss reverence for the gifts that manifest their maker?
</P>
<P>
   It may be that though Americans claim vociferously to be of
faith, most of them of Protestantism, they have their ``isms''
misaligned. Stewardship is for accountants. Faith is in the gold
standard. Capitalism is the one true religion.

<P>
   EDIT-NUKE _ Politics used to stop at the water's edge. Not with
this Congress, especially its most rabid isolationists and
Clintonphobes. They have deluded themselves into thinking now the
Cold War is over, they can be as irresponsbile as they please.
That's the message of the test ban treaty defeat. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   EDIT-RAMSEY _ No one is happy with the outcome of the Ramsey
grand jury, but we have to accept the decision. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Pius XII is a candidate for
beatification, a step away from sainthood. His candidacy has been
sharply challenged by a new book, ``Hitler's Pope,'' in which Pius
emerges as a figure less saintly than just human. (Rosenfeld, Cox
News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ERNESTMURRAY-COLUMN _ Just in case you weren't feeling too old
today, this may certainly change things. According to an e-mail I
received, each year, the staff at Beloit College in Wisconsin puts
together a list to try to give the faculty a sense of the mindset
of that year's incoming freshmen. Here is this year's list that was
sent to me. (Ernest Murray is managing editor of The Lufkin Daily
News) MOVED
</P>
<P>
   BORDERS-COLUMN _ ``Texas Constitution 2000'' is a small group of
people with a big idea: persuade 176 out of 254 counties in the
state to ratify a roughly 20-page proposed state constitution to
replace the present document. Why 176 counties? Because the
proportion of 176 out of 254 is the same percentage as the nine of
13 colonies that were required to ratify the U.S. Constitution.

</P>
<P>
   MCNEELY-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It's always a gift to state
representatives when a state senator chooses to resign in midterm
rather than simply not run for re-election. The early resignation
gives them a shot at moving up to the Texas Senate without giving
up their House seats. Sen. Greg Luna (D-San Antonio), who has
represented the center-city 26th District since 1992, resigned
Sept. 24 for health reasons. (McNeely, Austin American-Statesman)

</P>
<P>
   HIGHPOINT _ HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Ready or not, here comes the
much-hyped year 2000, when stores were expected to roll out Space
Age furnishing designed for ``homes of the future.'' So what's
La-Z-Boy, known for its cutting-ege designs, pitching for next
spring? Try a wooden folding chair. Today as the world's largest
furniture market opens in High Point, N.C., with a preview of the
newest designs, this chair is bare-bones comfort. Trends aside, the
buzz at this market are the celebrities _ authors, artist,
designers, all lending their names to new collections. (Flanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BILINGUAL-BABIES _ Infant education in a second language is
catching on around the world, giving a whole new meaning to the
question: how low can they go? The Language Workshop for Children
in New York, for example, starts infants at six months. The
Atlanta-based Primrose Schools Franchising Company, with 70 schools
in seven states, includes Spanish in its core curiculum for 4- and
5-year-olds. We hone in on Kidspeak International. Based in Inman
Park, the four-year-old program dispatches 20 instructors of French
and Spanish to schools and pre-schools around the metro area,
specializing in teaching the very young. (Hulbert, Atlanta

   Hurricane Floyd's 150-plus-mph winds have ceased; the seas are

will empty its bulging wardrobes and sell off 10,000 ballet and
opera costumes. (N.Y. Times News Service)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-COLORADO _MONTROSE, Colo. _ For any hike into the Black
Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument in Colorado, you must get
a backcountry permit. That's so park rangers can keep track of who
goes in. A pamphlet on hiking the inner canyon offers this chipper
bit of advice: ``Hikers are expected to find their own way and be
prepared for self-rescue.'' Self-rescue? Of the 220,000 people who
visit the monument each year, only about 3,000 accept the challenge
to hike in, says Paul Zaenger, a supervisory ranger at the
monument. ``It's a very demanding thing,'' he says. (Abramson,

   GETAWAY _ Black Rock Mountain State Park is one of autumn's

   MAKEUP-THERAPY _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Any old lipstick can
colorize your mouth. A really great lipstick can ``calm and

   DENIM-FASHIONS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the past few years,
the jeans business has been fueled by different shapes. Surely
you've worn or have studiously avoided one of the following: Legs
so wide they could easily slip over an elephant's foot; low-slung
waists that flirt with disaster; or highwater hems that bare the
meatiest part of your calves. Now, jeans are getting kicked in the
back pocket by a slew of new details that render them either more
refined or more rugged. (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). MOVED. WITH

   COXNET BOOKS _ (EDS: This is the CoxNet Books page for the

Robert Frost and writes like Bertrand Russell. He looks like the
boy next door, the healthy and happy kid who wins all the school
awards and helps his dad fix the roof and his mom tend her garden.
His book has caught the publishing industry, pundits and perhaps
America napping. It might be waking them all up. (Reid, Palm Beach

   WITH: REVIEW BAD EYE BLUES -- A new novel by Neal Barrett Jr.,
titled ``Bad Eye Blues'' is outrageous, downright silly in places,
has an impossible plot and often unbelievable characters, but I

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ ``We were getting calls from people hundreds a
miles away, people who couldn't even pronounce his name,'' Emory's
Claire Nouvet said moments before he would walk unassumingly from
the wings and begin to speak. ``We even got e-mails from New
Zealand.'' It's not every day that star power is given to a
philosopher, but this was Jacques Derrida, pied piper of literary
criticism for 20 years or more, enfant terrible of the strange
phenomenon known as deconstruction. Derrida came to Atlanta
recently to give the keynote lecture at Emory University's
International Symposium on Jean-Francois Lyotard, professor of
philosophy and French at Emory before his death in April 1998.

   BOOK-NOTES _ In a letter to his son in 1900, Joel Chandler
Harris bemoaned the fact that people no longer wrote letters.
``They dictate dispatches and scribble messages,'' he said. ``When
you are in the humor, you should take a peep at some of the letters
written by people long ago.'' In ``Letters of a Century,'' that's
exactly what Lisa Grunwald and Stephen Adler have done. The result
is a fascinating compilation of correpsondence from folks ranging
from presidents (Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman) to Elvis and
Groucho Marx. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.

   BOOKS-GLYNN _ Long before Tom Brokaw's bestseller ``The Greatest
Generation'' recorded memories of Americans during World War II,
Sonja Kinard, 66, set out with her sister, Thora Kimsey, to record
the same kind of slice of life, focusing on what then was the tiny
port town of Brunswick in south Georgia. And they found out that,
for many residents of coastal Georgia, World War II really started
on April 8, 1942, four months to the day after Congress declared
war on Japan. They began interviewing coastal residents, and asking
others to record their memories, which they've recorded in a new
book, ``Memories from The Marshes of Glynn: World War II,'' which
will hit bookstores this week. It's a vivid, poignant, even painful
account that paints a picture of shows how small town people
handled, physically and mentally, what for most was the most
traumatic period of their lives, a time when what seemed like a
faraway war came to Georgia, literally. (Hendrick, Atlanta

   MOVIES-TRENDS _ Today is not just another opening weekend at the
movies. Debuting across the country is mainstream Hollywood's
controversial ``Fight Club'' with Brad Pitt and a hefty $65 million
budget. Some advance screening audiences have slammed the film,
dubbing it socially irresponsible for its graphic depiction of
bloody pugilism in the wake of the Columbine and Buckhead
shootings. But also starting today is ``The Omega Code,'' an $8.5
million movie with name stars and a distinct religious message.
``Code'' is financed partly by Trinity Broadcasting Network, which
not only has used Hollywood talent to make a film patterened after
the Bible's book of Revelations, but is unabashedly promoting the
movie on its network, urging its Christian viewers to buy tickets
en mass. And many seem to be responding. More than 1,000 ``Omega
Code'' tickets, for instance, have been sold for weekend showings
at Regal's megaplex at the Mall of Georgia. Trinity's goal is not
to attack Hollywood to force changes in film content, but to join
the moneymaking machine and create Bible-based movies for an
untapped audience. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   MOVIE-FIGHT _ Movie review: ``Fight Club'' with Brad Pitt,
Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter about a secret confab where

   HIGHPOINT _ HIGH POINT, N.C. _ Ready or not, here comes the
much-hyped year 2000, when stores were expected to roll out Space
Age furnishing designed for ``homes of the future.'' So what's
La-Z-Boy, known for its cutting-ege designs, pitching for next
spring? Try a wooden folding chair. Today as the world's largest
furniture market opens in High Point, N.C., with a preview of the
newest designs, this chair is bare-bones comfort. Trends aside, the
buzz at this market are the celebrities _ authors, artist,
designers, all lending their names to new collections. (Flanders,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   BILINGUAL-BABIES _ Infant education in a second language is
catching on around the world, giving a whole new meaning to the
question: how low can they go? The Language Workshop for Children
in New York, for example, starts infants at six months. The
Atlanta-based Primrose Schools Franchising Company, with 70 schools
in seven states, includes Spanish in its core curiculum for 4- and
5-year-olds. We hone in on Kidspeak International. Based in Inman
Park, the four-year-old program dispatches 20 instructors of French
and Spanish to schools and pre-schools around the metro area,
specializing in teaching the very young. (Hulbert, Atlanta

   TRAVEL-COLORADO _MONTROSE, Colo. _ For any hike into the Black
Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument in Colorado, you must get
a backcountry permit. That's so park rangers can keep track of who
goes in. A pamphlet on hiking the inner canyon offers this chipper
bit of advice: ``Hikers are expected to find their own way and be
prepared for self-rescue.'' Self-rescue? Of the 220,000 people who
visit the monument each year, only about 3,000 accept the challenge
to hike in, says Paul Zaenger, a supervisory ranger at the
monument. ``It's a very demanding thing,'' he says. (Abramson,

   DENIM-FASHIONS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the past few years,

you've worn or have studiously avoided one of the following: Legs
so wide they could easily slip over an elephant's foot; low-slung
waists that flirt with disaster; or highwater hems that bare the
meatiest part of your calves. Now, jeans are getting kicked in the
back pocket by a slew of new details that render them either more
refined or more rugged. (Sturrock, Palm Beach Post). MOVED. WITH

His book has caught the publishing industry, pundits and perhaps

   SKUBE-ON-BOOKS _ ``We were getting calls from people hundreds a
miles away, people who couldn't even pronounce his name,'' Emory's
Claire Nouvet said moments before he would walk unassumingly from
the wings and begin to speak. ``We even got e-mails from New
Zealand.'' It's not every day that star power is given to a
philosopher, but this was Jacques Derrida, pied piper of literary
criticism for 20 years or more, enfant terrible of the strange
phenomenon known as deconstruction. Derrida came to Atlanta
recently to give the keynote lecture at Emory University's
International Symposium on Jean-Francois Lyotard, professor of
philosophy and French at Emory before his death in April 1998.

   BOOK-NOTES _ In a letter to his son in 1900, Joel Chandler
Harris bemoaned the fact that people no longer wrote letters.
``They dictate dispatches and scribble messages,'' he said. ``When
you are in the humor, you should take a peep at some of the letters
written by people long ago.'' In ``Letters of a Century,'' that's
exactly what Lisa Grunwald and Stephen Adler have done. The result
is a fascinating compilation of correpsondence from folks ranging
from presidents (Theodore Roosevelt, Harry Truman) to Elvis and
Groucho Marx. (O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA: 6 p.m.

ALDA BURNISHES HIS MD FOR APPEARANCE ON `ER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is now the grizzled veteran, 63 (63!), his shoulders more
stooped tha The white lab coat is still there, but he has
traded in his green fatigues for blue scrubs.
</P>
<P>
   One of television's most famous doctors is back into the chaotic
fray, of both a hospital and network television, at least for a
month or so.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Alda joined ``ER'' (NBC) Thursday night for the first
installment of a five-episode run. The hotshot young gun who was
Hawkeye Pierce is now the mentor, Dr. Ted Lawrence, a new attending
physician brought into the Chicago hospital by one-time student Dr.
Kerry Weaver (Laura Innes).
</P>
<P>
   After ``M-A-S-H'' (not to be confused with the dreadful spinoff
``AfterMASH''), Alda continued what has become a solid screen and
stage career. Among his post-Hawkeye highlights, Alda lists his
performance in the Broadway play ``Art,'' and his recently filmed
run on ``ER.'' Alda, who won Emmys as an actor, director and writer
for ``M-A-S-H,'' said the decision to return, albeit briefly, to
network television was not a hard one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes without reading anything,'' he said in a telephone
interview last week. ``The reason was is because I'm so impressed
with what I see on the air. Some of the sequences are some of the
best things I've ever seen on television. I'm in this wonderful
position that I can do things that are wonderful to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect tension to develop quickly between Lawrence (Alda) and
Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards).
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lawrence) is a teacher,'' Alda said. ``This character helped
invent ER medicine. He is one of the pioneers. He knows how it goes
and he likes to tell people. Some of the people who know how to do
it their way maybe don't want to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the story, (Weaver) is the one who brings me into the
hospital. I was her mentor,'' Alda said. ``She had to hire him in a
hurry. She didn't really check it out with the Mark Greene
character. So he is not too happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Alda said he can see some similarities between the
two medical shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see roots in `ER' that go back to `M-A-S-H,' and I think
they are aware of that,'' Alda said. ``There were things in
`M-A-S-H' they wanted to pick up on and carry forward. There is a
greater frankness about the wounds, for instance. And there is a
greater reliance on the technical talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``(But) the medicine that we were dealing with on `M-A-S-H' was
medicine of 50 years ago. The terms were different, the procedures
were different. For me it was a whole new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Alda is still seen regularly on television, as the host of the
PBS series ``Scientific American Frontiers,'' which taps into his
childhood fascination with science.
</P>
<P>
   So could the man who played one of the most legendary television
characters in history ever see himself returning to a network
series full time? ``I love working with these people (on `ER'),''
Alda said. ``But the idea of going in every day on a series, I
don't think ... I don't picture that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if I ever did picture it, I couldn't picture it unless it
was with people like this, because they are tops,'' Alda said. An
open door for a return? ``They left it open _ a crack,'' he said.

IN MEXICAN WORK FORCE, PREGNANCY IS PUNISHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After working 10 years as an accountant for a shoe
manufacturer, Carmen Rodriguez was dismissed because she was about
to have her second child.
</P>
<P>
   Maria, a successful 29-year-old sales representative for a
US-based cosmetics company, was fired without severance pay when
her bosses found out she was two months pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she passed a typing drill and two job interviews,
Ana Barbara Solis, 27, wasn't allowed to start work at a medical
supply firm until she provided a doctor's certificate stating that
she wasn't pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like these are heard everywhere in Mexico, where despite
the influx of tens of thousands of women into the country's work
force over the past three decades, public and private managers
routinely punish female employees for being pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks ago, a glimmer of hope emerged when Mexico
City's first female mayor took power. In one of her first official
acts, Mayor Rosario Robles signed an order into the city's penal
code that would fine businesses that require pregnancy tests or
that fire an employee because she is pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The practice has continued, for years even by some branches of
US companies doing business here, despite heavy criticism from
human rights advocates and US government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Robles is trying to change a culture that often exacts an
emotional, physical and financially devastating price on a working
woman who is expecting.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the consequences, based on testimony gathered by women's
support groups, have included forced abortions, divorce and, most
often, dismissals from their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important that you have something that you can arm
yourself with against these businesses,'' said Maria, who asked
that her full name _ and that of her former employer _ not be
published for fear of retribution. ``These company decisions are
being made by people with no scruples.''
</P>
<P>
   The new law would require those who violate the antipregnancy
discrimination code to serve from 100 hours of community service to
three years in prison. In the most serious cases, a business can be
shut down, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's constitution prohibits discrimination, although
newspaper help wanted ads typically state up-front the age, gender,
marital status and ``presentability,'' that an applicant should
have. But labor laws do not specifically mention pregnancy tests or
dismissals based on pregnancy, a loophole that hundreds of
companies, both domestic and international, have used to justify
their methods.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for these corporations argue that the pregnancy tests
are necessary to protect female workers' safety and to shield
themselves from paying expensive government-mandated maternity
leave, which allows for three months leave with pay for a woman who
has worked at least 30 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   For years, among those conducting tests were some
</P>
<P>
   branches of US companies doing business here, despite heavy
criticism from human rights advocates and US government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnancy-testing problem has been most evident in the
thousands of assembly plants that have sprouted along the
US-Mexican border, where officials have documented stories of women
who had to submit monthly urine samples or even show managers their
used sanitary napkins.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City officials say they have also found several cases of
pregnancy discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no statistics to tell us how big the problem is, but
it's clear from the cases we're hearing that something has to be
done, especially on the local level,'' said Gabriela Delgado
Ballesteros, coordinator of Promujer, a city agency formed two
years ago to promote gender equality.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is not the only Latin American country where female
applicants are asked to take pregnancy tests. The Brazilian
congress passed a law in May outlawing the practice as part of a
reform of its labor laws. Employer-requested pregnancy tests are
also against the law in Colombia and Venezuela, but still widely
practiced.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has come under more scrutiny, though, largely because of
its partnership with the United States and Canada under the 1994
North American Free Trade Agreement, and because so many American
corporations have set up thousands of assembly plants along the
border and interior regions of the country. The factories employ
mostly women, who put together everything from blue jeans to
computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industries where (these tests) are done are predominantly
US corprations that would never do it in the United States,'' said
LaShawn Jefferson, a research director for the women's rights
division of Human Rights Watch, which filed a complaint under NAFTA
in 1997. A final report from the US Labor Department is expected to
be released soon.
</P>
<P>
   Companies inside the United States halted such pregnancy testing
more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, pregnancy discrimination is not just a prehire issue.
Many women also claim to have been harassed or fired for becoming
pregnant even after years of working for a company.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's problems at the shoe factory began soon after she
found out she was pregnant with her first child, Alan. Company
officials began harassing her and warning her that she might be
fired for giving her child more attention than her work. When she
became pregnant with her second child, the company fired her for
``neglecting her duties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For Mexican men, a woman without children is disposable,'' she
said one day last week while sitting on a park bench with Alan as
she read the employment ads in a newspaper. ``For a business, a
women with a child is disposable.''
</P>
<P>
   When doctors discovered she had an at-risk pregnancy, Maria was
told to get plenty of bed rest, but her bosses at the cosmetics
firm refused. Because of that, she said, her baby girl died eight
days after being born.
</P>
<P>
   She became pregnant again six months later, as her doctor
recommended. When company officials found out, they fired her. She
took her case to Mexico's federal labor department, which
eventually arbitrated a settlement whose terms have been sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only crime was to get pregnant,'' Maria said.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some progress toward ending pregnancy
discrimination. US automaker General Motors, which is one of
Mexico's largest private employers, ended its prehire tests in
March 1997. Five months ago, Mexico's Education Ministry announced
that teachers would no longer be asked to undergo pregnancy tests.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, attempts to revise the federal labor laws have so far
failed. A bill introduced last year in the Chamber of Deputies died
in committee, and another one introduced this year has yet to be
acted upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 5 out of 10 Mexican households, the woman helps with some
income support, so it's only fair that we stop discriminating
against them,'' said Maria Elena Cruz Munoz, a congressional
representative from the conservative National Action Party who
submitted this year's version of the antidiscrimination measure.
``We should also make it so that men play a more active role in
raising our children. Maybe then these problems will stop.''

SENATOR STANDS READY TO BLOCK `SOFT MONEY' BAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enemies of big money in politics have executed a
textbook plan for changing the way US elections are funded. They
have pushed an overhaul measure through the House, enlisted the
support of a majority of senators, and secured President Clinton's
vow to sign the plan into law.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Senate opened debate Thursday on transforming a
campaign-finance system that has endured since the Watergate
scandal, the overhaul plan faces near-certain death at the hands of
an opposition movement led by a single Republican senator.
</P>
<P>
   So much for going by the book.
</P>
<P>
   As he has done for a decade, Kentucky Senator Mitch McConnell
stood prepared to kill by filibuster the effort to ban unlimited
and unregulated contributions known as ``soft money'' from federal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of McConnell's stand, several backers of the
soft-money ban said the best they can hope for are incremental
changes that don't further harm the election process. The debate
opens as both major parties set records in raising soft money,
padding the $55 million they amassed in the first six months of the
year. ``I see a chance of getting something through,'' said Senator
John F. Kerry. ``But I also see a chance that we could get a bill
that masquerades as reform and does actual damage to the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a longtime proponent of altering the campaign-finance
system, criticized a recent move to scale down the overhaul measure
by removing a proposal that would ban so-called ``issue ads'' that
attack candidates in the final weeks of an election. The ads are
aired by special-interest groups that are not required to disclose
the source of funds.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is expected to last as long as five days, with
senators voting on several alternative proposals, including a more
comprehensive plan crafted by Representatives Martin T. Meehan, a
Lowell Democrat, and Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican.
The House approved their measure last month, 252-177.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown is rich with subplots, from the presidential
campaign of the overhaul plan's chief GOP sponsor, Senator John
McCain of Arizona, to a potential labor backlash against Kerry in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the high stakes of the overhaul plan, a
Massachuetts union leader reacted angrily Wednesday to reports from
Washington lobbyists that Kerry had suggested to Democratic
colleagues that softening their pro-labor stance could help
overcome Republican opposition to the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suggest to the senator that he negotiate on somebody else's
back, not on ours,'' said Rich Gambino, business manager of Local
103 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. ``He
has once again shown his detachment from the everyday worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry denied suggesting in a closed-door meeting with Senate
Democrats that they consider restricting labor's ability to help
fund federal elections. He noted that he has voted regularly
against measures that would curb political contributions from
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you point-blank, that is not accurate,'' Kerry
said of the assertions about his remarks to Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he spoke only abstractly about labor issues. ``I
talked about having to address the perception that the Republicans
won't give in at all unless we find some way to deal with their
labor arguments,'' he said. ``I said we need to do it in a
fair-minded way _ but I don't support their efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Senate supporters of the overhaul measure fell eight
votes short of the 60 needed to prevent McConnell's filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   With Democrats remaining virtually united behind the overhaul
plan, as they were last year, McCain said he has yet to sway enough
GOP colleagues to stymie McConnell and a coalition of opponents
ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown is the first major battle for Scott Harshbarger,
the former Massachusetts attorney general who is now president of
Common Cause. The group is leading a lobbying effort to boost the
overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger defended the decision to drop the ``issue ad''
provision as a reasonable effort to secure enough votes to overcome
McConnell. ``This may be the way to get the support of several
senators who have said they oppose soft money but have voted
against the bill for other reasons,'' Harshbarger said. ``Now they
are either for soft money or against it.''

 &HT;    Sometimes people of faith change the world.
 &HT;    Jesse Ventura would disagree. Recently he said, ``Organized
religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded people who need
strength in numbers.''
 &HT;    Consider the story of Peggy Sandlin, a member of Bread for the
World, a group that mobilizes Christians to affect politics to help
the poor.
 &HT;    Shortly after her congressman, Spencer Bachus (R-Ala.), was
named chairman of a banking subcommittee, BFW asked her to call him
about ``Jubilee 2000,'' a proposal to forgive the debt of the
world's poorest nations. Peggy, a family friend, asked him if he
knew about debt relief.
 &HT;    ``I know nothing about it,'' he replied.
 &HT;    She told him that many sub-Saharan nations are being crushed by
their efforts to pay off debt for the purchase of military
equipment during the Cold War. Tanzania, for example, spends four
times as much on debt as on primary education, and nine times more
than on health.
 &HT;    She told him of a bill to forgive 41 such nations of $970
million.
 &HT;    ``What I like is they are not relieved of their obligation to
pay the debt, but it goes into a trust fund to be used only for
health, education and the environment,'' she said. ``If an
international agency found that money was not going into the trust
fund, debt relief is canceled,''
 &HT;    When BFW first heard of Bachus' appointment, and asked
colleagues if he would be open to Jubilee 2000, they said ``Good
luck.'' The very conservative congressman has an office full of
plaques from budget-cutting groups, ``The Sound Money Award.''
Jubilee 2000, meanwhile, was supported by the most liberal
religious denominations - Episcopalians and Methodists.
 &HT;    But Bachus is a deeply committed Southern Baptist. So he agreed
to meet with other BFW constituents from his Birmingham district.
 &HT;    Elaine Van Cleve told him ``Each day 34,000 people die of
hunger-related diseases.''
 &HT;    Bachus asked, ``Explain the connection between that and debt.''
 &HT;    ``All I know is that as a mother, if I had debt inherited from
my grandparents, and at the same time was trying to feed a child, I
would want to feed my child,'' she said.
 &HT;    In the United States, we spend $4,093 per person on health care.
In Ethiopia it is only $3, in Nigeria it is $5, in Nicaragua $37.
An average for the 41 countries is $22.
 &HT;    Bachus instantly agreed to sponsor the Debt Relief for Poverty
Reduction Act, and is now a passionate advocate: ``Please help 700
million of your brothers and sisters in the poorest countries of
the world,'' he wrote to other House Members. ``This legislation is
the first necessary step for raising the standard of living of
those in 41 impoverished countries, those in most need, the most
vulnerable, the most helpless.
 &HT;    ``What would it cost your constituents? Over three years it
would only cost each American a mere $1.20 a year for three years.
It is the cost of an ice cream cone, a gallon of gas, a Sunday
paper. Against this minuscule sacrifice, what is the cost of not
acting as it applies to 15 baby boys or girls born into the poorest
of countries?'' he asked.
 &HT;    ``Of those 15, three will die before a fifth birthday. Of the
remaining 12, four will suffer the scourge of malnutrition with
permanent consequences to their physical and mental development. Of
the remaining eight, they are in no way fortunate. Their chances of
... suffering disease and depravation, of being orphaned, are
great, sometimes as much as 50-50. Their burdens are day to day.
They are painful. They are heavy.''
 &HT;    What the bill can do can be seen in Uganda, which had $40
million of debt payments diverted into a Poverty Action Fund. In
two years, the number of children in elementary school more than
doubled from 2.6 million to 5.3 million.
 &HT;    The bill recently won support from President Clinton and has a
good chance of passage.
 &HT;    ``This decision will define us as either a loving people, a
people filled with grace and compassion, or it will define us as a
people focused on the monetary, the temporal,'' says the
congressman who took a phone call from Peggy Sandlin.
 &HT;    ``The bill is a gift of life,'' he told me. ``Jubilee 2000 is a
celebration of the 2000th birthday of Christ. What did Christ give
us? He gave us lives as Christians. What more appropriate time to
give to these poor in celebration of the birth of Jesus who gave us
life?''
 &HT;    Sometimes America's democracy works like it is supposed to.

U.S. CURTAILS REACH OF LAW REQUIRING RESEARCH DISCLOSURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To the relief of universities and hospitals, a
federal agency has narrowed the scope of a new law that might have
forced thousands of researchers to disclose details of their work,
possibly including confidential interviews and trade secrets, to
anyone who asked.
</P>
<P>
   The law, approved last year with little debate, said the public
could obtain ``all data'' produced by researchers who receive
federal money, though certain restrictions applied. Universities
said the law would allow businesses to harass scientists conducting
research in sensitive areas such as the health effects of smoking
and air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But the office charged with putting the measure into effect has
said it applies only to the research federal agencies use when
creating rules that have the force of law. Even then, researchers
may withhold trade secrets, confidential medical information,
messages to colleagues, and certain other material.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over what scientists must disclose is sure to
continue, however. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a major business
lobbying group, has threatened to file suit, arguing that White
House officials illegally narrowed the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is sleight of hand,'' said Bill Kovacs, a vice president
for the group. ``We're going to do something about it. We just
don't know what yet.'' As a first step, he said, the group may file
a request for information under the law with the expectation of
being denied.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said the law, though less onerous than they
first feared, might still place additional costs and burdens on
researchers. Moreover, the law could allow industry groups to file
``repetitive and expensive'' requests in order to thwart research
that might harm their business interests, said George Leventhal, a
policy analyst at the Association of American Universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been concerned that this will scare scientists away
from sensitive areas like, hypothetically, the health effects of
environmental toxins or research into tobacco,'' Leventhal said.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco giant R.J. Reynolds used a state open-records law to
compel a Georgia researcher to release the names of children who
took part in a study that gauged the popularity of Joe Camel, the
cartoon character once used to pitch cigarettes. The state law was
amended before the researcher released any names, but some
scientists fear the new federal law would expose them to similar
requests from tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The law arose from a complaint by industry groups that they
could not obtain data from the Harvard School of Public Health that
was later cited by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in
setting tougher air-quality standards. Harvard said releasing the
data would violate the confidentiality of people who had offered
medical histories and other personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The law broadens the 32-year-old Freedom of Information Act,
which requires the federal government to release certain documents
on request, to include data from researchers who receive federal
money. The law drew little attention when it was approved by
Congress last year and signed into law by President Clinton as part
of a 4,000-page appropriations bill. But as word of the law spread,
it drew loud complaints from the research community, including
Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
Partners Health Care, and the Boston University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The law was sponsored by Senator Richard Shelby, Republican of
Alabama, and supported by Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. They
said the public has a right to see the details of research that was
paid for by public money.
</P>
<P>
   But as drawn by the Office of Management and Budget, the White
House agency charged with implementing it, the law provides access
only to data the government cites in writing rules that have ``the
force and effect of law.'' Those rules would include, for example,
the EPA's air-quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   David Litster, vice president for research at MIT, said the
agency has significantly narrowed the law so that ``it is not a
serious problem. If all research were suddenly to come under the
FOIA law, we'd have problems. Now, it's only research that's used
as a basis for government actions, which is a small fractioe
total, and philosophically I'm not sure I have a problem with that.
If the government is making laws based on research, we ought to be
able to get at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott and two other Republican senators have said, however, that
the Office of Management and Budget had rendered the law
``potentially meaningless.'' In a letter to the office last month,
they said agencies use research data to make many important rules
and decisions that do not have the force of law, and such
information should be available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, Kovacs said, the government ``forces'' states to
deny permits when too many industrial businesses want to build
factories in poor and minority neighborhoods. Any research used to
support that requirement should be public, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also complained that the law as
interpreted by the Office of Management and Budget applies only to
future research. This means that Harvard, for example, could not be
compelled to release data the EPA used in writing clean air rules,
Kovacs said.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Rush Holt, Democrat of New Jersey, said he
believes the new law still goes too far. He said he will file
legislation to repeal the law because it requires researchers to
release too much data.
</P>
<P>
   Universities offered a mix review of the law, with many saying
that the Office of Management and Budget removed its most
burdensome aspects. But Ruth Flower, director of government
relations at the American Association of University Professors,
said her group ``has a problem with the Freedom of Information Act
being used with respect to individuals. It was created to get at
government agencies, to allow access to agency information.''

MEDICAL GROUP STIRS OUTCRY FOR FINING DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At a time when financial rewards and penalties to
physicians are burning issues for a Congress bent on reforming the
perceived abuses of managed care, a physicians group in Cambridge,
Mass., has adopted a controversial policy to begin penalizing
individual doctors in the group $250 a day for each day a patient
spends in a hospital that is deemed ``not medically necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine, outlined in an internal memorandum obtained by The
Boston Globe and effective Nov. 1, has unleashed a torrent of
criticism from physicians and provoked consternation from medical
ethicists who say the policy is too punitive and could lead to
denial of necessary health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pushing the envelope,'' said Dr. David Himmelstein, an
internist in the group, called the Mount Auburn Cambridge
Independent Practice Association Inc. ``We've been bordering on the
immoral for a long time. This clearly goes over that edge. I am
horrified, but not surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The tempest surrounding the new penalty, which will apply to 350
physicians in the Mount Auburn practice, highlights a fundamental
dilemma of managed health care _ how to rein in escalating medical
costs by influencing doctor behavior while still preserving the
physician's ability to make independent clinical decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As managed care has evolved, health maintenance organizations
and physicians groups have deployed a number of means to deter
unnecessary hospitalizations and procedures, including the use of
monetary rewards and penalties to physicians. But the financial
incentives have for the most part been relatively indirect, with
hundreds of doctors in any given group sharing both risks and
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The Mount Auburn policy, however, is drawing criticism because
it is aimed directly at the wallets of individual physicians, a
practice frowned upon by the Massachusetts Medical Society and the
American Medical Society, which represent physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physician incentive payments should be based on performance of
groups of physicians rather than individual physicians,'' said Yael
Miller, director of health systems at the Massachusetts Medical
Society. ``That's AMA policy, and that's our policy.'' Miller said
direct penalties levied on physicians for violating group
guidelines are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how the rule is supposed to work, according to the memo,
dated Sept. 23. Case managers who scour hospital admissions to
identify unnecessary stays will call offending doctors and offer
``alternative treatment plans.'' If the case manager disagrees with
the physician over the hospital admission, the dispute is sent to a
committee of a dozen doctors in the Mount Auburn practice who
ultimately determine whether to dun the physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our work is to try to identify and eliminate waste and improve
the care we deliver to patients,'' said Dr. Rob Janett, medical
director of the Mount Auburn practice and a primary care physician
at Cambridge Hospital. ``An unnecessary day in the hospital is not
only expensive, it is also potentially harmful to patients. The
only penalty being meted out here is against ineffective clinical
decision making.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Dr. Efficiency, and I'm controversial for it, Janett
added. ``But I believe it's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the $250 amount was deemed ``large enough to
capture physicians' attention, but not to be so large as to be
onerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians in the group, however, argue that the amount,
which would be multiplied by the number of days deemed unnecessary,
casts a pall over their decision-making, particularly in borderline
cases where the correct path is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a gray area, doctors are being encouraged to err
on the side of not hospitalizing rather than on what they think
patients need,'' said a Mount Auburn doctor who declined to be
identified. ``It will have a chilling effect on doctors who want to
look out for their patients but are constantly having to ask
themselves whether they're going to have to pay a financial penalty
for it out of their own pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other physician groups do not levy such direct penalties
for inefficient practice. Harvard Vanguard, which has 500
physicians, pays its physicians a salary that varies based on the
physician's caseload and their patients' satisfaction. Neither does
Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Mass., which has 450 physicians, nor
Primary Care LLC, a group of 800 doctors based in Norwell. Both
Lahey and Primary Care officials say their groups instead use
education and peer pressure to try to get physicians to cut down on
waste.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over wasteful medical spending is a difficult, if not
ambiguous, one. Some health care observers point out that
physicians in California tend to rely much less on hospitals to
treat patients, without evidence that patients in California are
suffering worst health care outcomes. The number of days spent in a
hospital per thousand residents in California in 1997, the most
recently available data, was 499.5, compared to 700.1 days in
Massachusetts, according to a survey by the American Hospital
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Some take those figures as a sign that hospitalization could be
cut further without harming patients. Others, however, argue that
Massachusetts is below the national average, which is 719.3 days
per thousand residents, even though its teaching hospitals tend to
care for some of the sickest patients in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Lown, a well-known cardiologist and an outspoken
critic of the use of financial incentives to influence doctors'
behavior, argued that the policy will erode patients' trust in
their physicians. ``This is utter disdain of ethical principles,''
he said. ``It is an abandonment of the sick and vulnerable and it
makes doctors part of the conspiracy. The doctor essentially
becomes an employee of an organization to whom patients are just a
commodity. It's absolutely disquieting.''

THE JOYOUS ARRIVAL OF BABY 6 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And baby makes 6 billion. According to the United Nations, the
Earth's human population reached 6,000,000,000 this week, a round
number by anyone's measure. Where this milestone baby made her
appearance no one can say, but it's a reasonable guess that she was
welcomed by her parents and siblings the way most new family
members are welcomed: joyfully.
</P>
<P>
   Baby 6 Billion's arrival should make all of us joyful. A century
ago, the world couldn't even sustain 2 billion human beings. Ten
centuries ago, fewer than 500 million could keep themselves alive.
For a baby born at the turn of the last millennium, surviving
childhood was at best a 50-50 proposition; surviving past 40 was
extraordinary. Baby 6 Billion, by contrast, can look forward to 65
birthdays. And that's if she lives in the Third World; if she is a
child of the West, her life expectancy is closer to 75.
</P>
<P>
   The human race has never had it so good. Per capita wealth has
soared in this century. Frightful diseases have been eradicated.
Infant mortality has plummeted. The marvels of modern medicine,
energy, and agriculture reach more people in more parts of the
world than ever before. The planet's food supply is growing faster
than its human population. Poverty and hunger have not been wiped
out, but, by and large, human beings enjoy better, healthier,
cleaner, more prosperous lives than at any time in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would expect lovers of humanity to jump with joy at the
triumph of human mind and organization over the raw killing forces
of nature,'' the late, great optimist Julian Simon wrote in ``The
Ultimate Resource,'' his masterpiece. ``Instead, many lament that
there are so many people alive to enjoy the gift of life.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, Vice President Al Gore, who proclaims
that ``no goal is more crucial to healing the global environment
than stabilizing human population.'' By which he means: People
should stop having so many children. Not all people, of course. Not
people like Gore, a father of four. But people in places like
Bangladesh and China, the sort of places routinely described as
``overpopulated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a brilliant essay a few years back, P.J. O'Rourke reflected
on population controllers who preach that fewer babies is what the
world's impoverished nations need most.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going around the poor parts of the world shoving birth-control
pills down people's throats, hustling them into abortion clinics,
and giving them cheap prizes for getting sterilized is to assume
that those people don't want babies as much as we do, that they
won't like those babies as well as we like ours, and that little
brown and yellow babies are not as good as the adorable pink, rich
kind. American children grow up to be valuable citizens.
Bangladeshi children grow up to be part of the world population
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1798, Thomas Malthus published his famous ``Essay on the
Principle of Population.'' It argued that human beings increase
faster than the food supply, since population grows geometrically
(2, 4, 8, 16, 32), while food stocks rise only arithmetically (2,
4, 6, 8, 10). More people means more consumption, Malthus warned,
which in turn means shortages, hunger, and misery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malthus was right,'' declares Gore in his book, ``Earth in the
Balance.'' But Malthus was wrong. People don't breed like rabbits,
multiplying without regard to their ability to support their
offspring. In every society, men and women think about the costs
and benefits of rearing children and choose the fertility level
that suits their circumstances. In 1803, Malthus revised his essay,
admitting that he had been wrong _ that unlike animals, human
beings do take preventive measures to keep their numbers under
control. ``The preventive check is peculiar to man,'' he wrote,
``and arises from that distinctive superiority in his reasoning
faculties, which enables him to calculate distant consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Honesty compelled Malthus to repudiate his error. But
neo-Malthusians persist in theirs, repeatedly warning that disaster
lurks around the corner. Time after time their warnings have proven
false. When will they follow Malthus's lead, and acknowledge that
they have erred?
</P>
<P>
   The most striking demographic datum is not that we are 6
billion, but that fertility rates _ the average number of children
per woman _ are dropping everywhere. It takes a fertility rate of
2.1 just to keep a population level. In no European country is the
fertility rate that high; the continental average is 1.5. In China,
the rate is now 1.8; in Japan, 1.4; in Russia, 1.3. Even in the
``overcrowded'' Third World, fertility rates have plunged, from 6 a
generation ago to 3 today _ and falling.
</P>
<P>
   Women the world over are having fewer children. We are in the
middle of a global ``baby bust,'' and before long _ within 40 or 50
years _ the human race will begin shrinking. And then we will
really have something to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   For babies are a blessing. And the more babies each generation
produces, the more blessed is the generation that follows. ``Humans
have for tens of thousands of years created more than they have
destroyed,'' Julian Simon wrote. ``That is the . . . most
fundamental of all facts about the progress of civilization.'' More
people mean more problems, but they also mean more minds, more
imagination, and more knowledge to solve those problems. Baby 6
Billion has been born into the best era our species has ever known.
Give her and her generation half a chance, and the era to come will
be better still.

FALLING LEAVES SPREAD COLOR, PEACE, CLUTTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RUTH S. FOSTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A stress encounter group I know recommends sitting quietly at
this time of year and watching the colored leaves fall. Sometimes,
they float slowly to the ground on sunny Indian summer days.
Sometimes they fly with fury in a whipping wind. Something for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Steal a moment, take a deep breath and a few seconds to tame our
electronically chopped-up micro-time. Maybe even meditate.
</P>
<P>
   Can you name the trees in the forest by their colors? Each tree
has its distinctive time and hue. The fall pageant starts in
October with the glowing red maples, which I think have the most
vivid colors, ranging from yellow to red to maroon and every
nano-shade in between.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar maples turn a vibrant orange. Honeylocusts are yellow,
zelkovas unfold red-orange. Vivid red bushes of wild sumac, aronia,
euonymus (called burning bush with good reason), and enkianthus
explode. Dogwood leaves turn early with shades of deep red and hold
all fall.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 days later, a second wave of color unfolds. Dogwoods
are joined by Japanese maples in orange and red, birches turn pale
gold and Norway maple a deeper yellow. Incidentally, Norway maple
leaves don't compost well, they just turn to yucky mush.
</P>
<P>
   November brings the fall finale as oaks wear deep scarlet and
mahogany. Golden beeches fill the woodlands. On city streets,
Callery pears turn a deep, rich red. The last tree to truly delight
the eye is the Japanese red maple, which seems filled with blood as
the low sun shines through its leaves. In Japan, gardens often
include such a maple in the western corner to provide old folks
with a warm spot to sit in the setting sun.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the leaves fall is a little like meditating. While it
clears the mind, though, it unfortunately clutters the backyard.
Again, as always, tons of leaves will fall.
</P>
<P>
   An acre of oak forest drops 2 1/2 tons of leaves. An acre of
pine spreads 3 1/2 tons of needles. They're 70 percent nitrogen. If
left on the ground to decay, they turn into a layer of soft
compost, nourishing their mother tree with a protective matrix for
new feeding roots. Such is the forest's natural cycle.
</P>
<P>
   What about our backyard? The sheer bulk of beautiful leaves is
overwhelming. Who hasn't dragged endless bags of them from one
place to another, again and again?
</P>
<P>
   To reduce this nagging yard work, decide which leaves really
have to go and which can stay where they fall. On walks, they
become slippery when wet. On lawns, they cause problems. Too deep
on perennial beds, they can cause crown rot. Leaves serve as comfy
snowsuits for many fungi and insects. And what about our current
mantra, ``Make compost?''
</P>
<P>
   You can leave the leaves under trees, shrubs, and on sturdy
groundcover plants. Over the winter, the leaves will self-destruct
into compost. In spring, instead of paying for another two inches
of new red bark mulch, just sprinkle enough of that fancy stuff to
cover the leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments repeatedly have shown that the larger the mulched
area under any tree, the healthier it is and the faster it grows.
Old beech trees really benefit from letting the leaves stay because
they feed the biotic activity necessary for healthy roots.
</P>
<P>
   Do definitely throw out (in the garbage) any plants that are
troubled by diseases or insects. Those needing fall sanitation
include roses, irises, peonies, phlox, stalks of spent perennials,
vegetables, raspberries, and fruit trees. (If you can get to it. I
never truly do.)
</P>
<P>
   If you really love your lawn and want decent grass, you get the
dreaded leaf chore. Don't just rush out in a swivet and rake the
endless fluffy fellows. First mow through them, right on the grass,
which reduces their volume by half.
</P>
<P>
   Then mow again, collect the chopped up bits in the lawnmower
bag, and pile them up. In two weeks, their height will shrink by
half. By spring, it'll reduce by half again. The mountain of
October will have become a few inches of good compost for summer
mulching.
</P>
<P>
   To make compost pie, throw on some dirt between each foot of
leaves and grass clippings. Add water if they're dry. Make as many
layers to the pie as you have patience for. You can make compost
pie on the vegetable bed if you add a sprinkle of lime or ashes. It
can be dug in in late November, and the soil formed into raised
furrows all ready for earlier spring planting. You also can wait
and just pull the mulch aside in spring. The ground will be soft
and ready to plant, the simple essence of that supposedly
mysterious science called no-till farming.

area for many years and has written numerous articles on gardening

EASING STRESS WHEN CHILDREN APPLY TO COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With deadlines for college applications looming and a daughteing on procrastination, Jacqueline Lerner of Wayland was
getting nervous. Two weeks ago, she decided it was time to force
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the source of her stress was the essay,'' says Lerner.
``I could imagine her thinking, `I have no idea what to say, I
can't write this,' so I told her that before the weekend ended, she
had to brainstorm with her dad about what to write.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday, Blair had written four essays. Clearly, she had
turned a corner. ``She was like a new person,'' says Lerner.
</P>
<P>
   For parents of high school seniors, October is the month of
reckoning. If the college application processis not under way, or
if it is moving along only with great ambivalence or foot dragging,
it's time to figure out why.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they have to have visited colleges by now; many
students _ including Blair, a senior at Wayland High _
prefer to visit only after they are accepted. That's a strategy
that Cambridge educational psychologist and therapeutic tutor Ted
Sutton endorses. ``It's a different experience to go in the spring
when you know they want you than in the fall when you worry, `What
if I love them and they reject me?' '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   A senior also doesn't have to have choices prioritized by now.
But six or seven schools should be identified, applications should
be in hand, and essays should be under way, says educational
consultant Michael Spence of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   By far, the single biggest reason seniors pause in the process
or can't get started at all is fear of rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, a certain amount of anxiety is normal; even the
senior engaged in the process feels it. ``Every child worries about
being embarassed in the eyes of peers, teachers, and parents. Their
sense of themselves, their value as a person, is tied to this,''
says developmental psychologist William Damon, director of the
Stanford University Center on Adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   For some seniors, however, fear of failure is so overwhelming,
they become stuck. They throw up roadblocks _ there's no good time
for campus visits; get hung up on a detail _ urban vs. suburban,
East vs. West, math major vs. biology; or become passive _
``Whatever you say, Mom'' _ or belligerent: ``I don't want to talk
about it!'' Says Damon: ``It's as if they say to themselves, ``I
don't want to embarrass myself, so I'm not even going to try.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Helping them is tricky. On the one hand, the senior who has
pretended to herself all summer and half the fall that this is
going to go away is probably now near panic. ``You see all your
classmates in a frenzy and you wonder, `What's wrong with me? How
come I don't know where to go?' '' says Damon. If a parent keeps
quiet, waiting for the child to make the first move, a senior feels
unsupported, as if you don't really care. Worse, she may take your
silence as confirmation of her fears: ``Even Dad doesn't think I
can get in anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, intervening inappropriately can add to her
pressure: ``I don't think I'm good enough to go anywhere, and
here's Dad pushing the Ivies on me again.''
</P>
<P>
   A good starting point is to get issues out on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many families, the process of making choices gets tangled
up with the separation itself,'' says clinical psychologist Ann
Willard, who supervises counseling at Concord Academy. She says
parents can defuse anxiety about leaving home by focusing
discussion on finding the best college for him to do the next stage
of his growing up. In other words, to see this as part of a
continuum rather than the end of something and the start of
something else.
</P>
<P>
   We also need to explicitly take our ego out of the ring.
``Seniors feel unspoken pressure from the community, especially if
college is part of the culture; from their peers, who are
developmentally very competitive; and most of all from parents,''
says Willard.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there's been a lifelong assumption he'll go to the same
school as Dad, or that he'll be the first in the family to go to
college, or that his parents have sacrificed for years so he could
go. Asks Willard: ``What teen can say in the face of that, `I'm not
sure, I'm worried I can't cut it'?'' Indeed, Willard says students
frequently tell her, ``My parents say it doesn't matter where I go,
but I know it really does.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice is to reiterate aloud and often that you will support
her wherever she goes and that she has many options, including
taking a year off to do something nonacademic.
</P>
<P>
   ``To hear you offer that up is very freeing,'' says Larry
Sullivan, assistant executive director of the National Association
of School Psychologists.
</P>
<P>
   For seniors who have not allowed themselves to think that
thought, there can be incredible relief: ``You know, I'm really not
ready yet.'' For others, having the freedom to talk about what's
been on their mind is sometimes the only way they realize that
``yes, I do want to go to college after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Take time to reach this decision, but not too much. ``Keep
talking about it, but set a deadline for mid-November,'' says
Sutton. Even if the decision is not to go to college next, a senior
still needs to make a plan now for June.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not, he'll be anxious and panicky all year,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If the decision is to wait a year, that doesn't mean to wait to
apply. ``Applying when you're not in an academic environment is
psychologically hard,'' says Spence. Besides, he adds, colleges
almost universally look favorably upon students who seek deferrals.
``Their view is that these kids will be more mature, more serious
learners,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   If she decides to go forward after all, a key to unfreezing her
is to rid her of misconceptions. For instance:
</P>
<P>
   --``I need to decide my major now.'' The idea that some
classmates know exactly where they want to go and what they want to
major in can make someone who doesn't know feel inadequate _ ``I
should know this by now!'' _ and paralyzed: ``How can I decide on
college if I don't know my major?'' Sullivan says that more than
half of a typical freshman class changes majors and that some
schools don't even allow you to declare a major as a freshman. He
also encourages seniors to think about career direction, rather
than career choice.
</P>
<P>
   --``I have to apply early decision.'' Early decision is binding
_ you have to go if you get in _ yet it's increasingly popular.
Sullivan thinks that's due to the increased pressure seniors feel
as well as a kind of magical thinking: ``If I get into this school,
it means it's the perfect place for me.'' In fact, it often isn't,
he says: A teen can be a different person by April and rue the
commitment. If you must go early, he says, go for early action;
it's not binding.
</P>
<P>
   --``There's one perfect school for me.'' Too anxious to make
decisions, a student can use the search for perfection to keep
putting decisions off. Spence suggests she talk to a freshman who
ended up at a ``safety'' school and is deliriously happy.
</P>
<P>
   --``My SATs aren't good enough.'' A student may not want to take
them again because he's afraid he'll lower the one good score he
had. Not so, says Sullivan: The best score you get is what counts,
even if best math was achieved on a different day than best verbal.
(Deadline for the Dec. 4 test is Oct. 29.)
</P>
<P>
   Once there's movement in a senior's thinking, the typical parent
jumps into action. But Sullivan cautions us to walk a fine line
between being supportive _ picking up a pizza the night he's
working on an essay, offering to photocopy applications _ and being
directive: scheduling a visit without asking him first, telling him
what to do when. For a child who is disorganized, Damon recommends
providing structure and scaffolding _ ``I can help you make folders
and a timeline so you can keep a checklist'' _ but don't do the
work for him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you make an appointment at a school he's
agreed to visit, and he wants to back out and you let him, he won't
feel good about himself. ``Hold him to a commitment,'' says
Sullivan. ``Learning to be trustworthy is a developmental task of
the age.'' If he wants out of an appointment he never agreed to,
then you should cancel.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton says 95 percent of seniors need a gentle, supportive
push, much the way Jacqueline Lerner nudged Blair. But Lerner also
has had the opposite experience with her son, Justin, who knew
exactly where he wanted to go. In some ways that was harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling that you'll die if you don't get into that one
school is incredibly stressful,'' says Lerner. ``Because my
daughter doesn't have tunnel vision, she has more of an open mind
about where a good match might be.''

COULD THE PAIN BE A GENTLE NUDGE OF LOVE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack, darling, I owe you an apology.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry I was late for dinner and left you wondering why I
hadn't called or left a note. I'd gone for an early autumn swim
with Lynn and then couldn't find my watch. Ordinarily, I'd run
around madly, then give up and rush home, but I've decided that
stress is playing a part in all the headaches I've been having
lately, and so I slowed way down, paid attention to my breathing,
and carefully retraced my steps until I found my watch by the
seawall. It was only then that I thought about where I was supposed
to be, and by then I was already 20 minutes late. I'm sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy, how can I explain why I didn't return your call?
</P>
<P>
   I asked you for a favor and you called back to say yes. Then I
didn't get back to you. I know that's inexcusable because I
ordinarily would never be so irresponsible, but I'm coming to see
that the pressure I put on myself _ to return every call, to deal
with every e-mail, to answer every letter, to show up on time and
always keep my word _ may be ruining my health. This is what
happened. At the end of a very long day, I stared at my list of
things still to do, including returning your call. I registered my
reluctance. I noted the tension behind my eyes and . . . walked
away. I don't blame you for being annoyed. Recognizing that I'm
letting people down, then doing it anyway, bothers me terribly,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul, I'm sorry your secretary had to call to remind me I
was missing our appoint
</P>
<P>
   I'm trying to be less fragmented, and it's getting me in all
sorts of trouble. I'd decided to make pesto that morning. I was
trying to be fully present, cutting off basil leaves to music,
feeding nuts and cheese into my blender in a slow easy rhythm. I
wasn't reviewing lists in my head or checking the clock. I was so
peaceful and fully engaged that I completely lost track of the
time. When your secretary finally reached me, I was so deep in
another realm of experience that it took me a while to figure out
what she was talking about. I can't promise you it won't happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   This is really a scary time for me.
</P>
<P>
   All my life, I've been trying to hitch myself to schedules and
routines. As someone with adult attention deficit disorder, I'm
naturally distractible and forgetful. I've had to teach myself to
write everything down, to tie my keys to my pocketbook, to check my
calendar twice a day, and to take care of things the minute I think
of them. This degree of self-discipline is foreign to my nature.
It's been a terrible strain. And just when I've finally gotten the
organization of my life down to a fine art, my body has rebelled at
the price it's being asked to pay.
</P>
<P>
   I feel as if I'm entering dangerous waters, heading back into
the chaos I just got under control. I don't want to disappoint
anyone, but evidently I can't keep performing at this level.
Without my consent, pain has become my personal defensive lineman,
taking me down whenever I grab the ball and begin running down the
field at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   When I think I'm my own worst enemy, I despair. If I weren't
stuck with myself, I'd get a divorce. Yet when our Unitarian
minister said in church, ``Your life is held in a greater love,
encompassed by a larger mind, a deeper strength, an everflowing
creativity,'' I felt suddenly hopeful. I listened intently as Mary
went on: ``Rest in this greater love. And when you can't feel it,
or find its pulse, rest in the tangible love of your family, and
friends, and congregation. And when you can't feel that, rest in
the grace of the world. And when you can't find that, just rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly I thought, what if this greater love is what's slowing
me down? Perhaps what I call suffering is a tough-but-caring nudge,
the only thing capable of outfoxing my stubborn determination to
keep on doing more. Perhaps some knowing force with my best
interests at heart is taking me out of this stress-filled game as
gently as possible, using the only means at its command to stop me.
</P>
<P>
   When I peer straight ahead, it looks bleak. But what if love's
strong and certain hand is trying to point me in another direction?
There's something intriguing about that peaceful realm I visit so
rarely. Can I give myself permission to enter a world in which
people don't need to accomplish so much or drive themselves so
relentlessly?
</P>
<P>
   Mary said that no matter what we do, we are ``nestled in the
palm of love's hand.'' Invisible though it may be, if we rest, will
we discover it has the power to support us in our need and our
vulnerability?
</P>
<P>
   The sharp pain in my head won't listen to reason.
</P>
<P>
   It says, Try.

ICE, WATER SHIELD SHOULD GO OVER BARE SHEATHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am having my house reroofed, using 22 squares (2,200 square
feet) of shingles to go over one layer of old shingles. Bids ranged
from $3,200 to $4,000 and included new ridge vents. Continuous
sof-fit vents would be $400 more. Stripping added $1,800 to $2,000.
I am not objecting to the price, but one roofer recommended putting
Ice &AMP; Water Shield over the old shingles. Is that a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   PAT DELEO, Reading, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. In a word, no. The Ice &AMP; Water Shield is a rubberized
membrane set along the edge of the roof 3 to 6 feet up from the
roof edge, and is intended to prevent leaking from water backed up
by ice dams. The Ice &AMP; Water Shield should go over bare wood
sheathing to make it stick to the sheathing and lie flat, so enough
shingles should be removed to allow this. Even the manufacturer,
W.R. Grace, suggests that its shield go over bare sheathing.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, you certainly have no complaint about the bids;
they are all bargains. The low bid is less than $1.50 per square
foot, and the high is less than $2. If the work is of good quality,
you can't get any better. Those soffit vents for $400 are also a
good buy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I relocated several windows and doors and, as a result, had
to reshingle around those moved windows and doors; the shingles are
white cedar Extras, and, needless to say, they differ from the
weathered shingles that remained on the house. How can I make the
new shingles look like the old?
</P>
<P>
   JACK ALDRICH, Shrewsbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have four choices. The first and easiest is to sit back
and wait for the new shingles to weather. You are a little inland
for rapid weathering, which occurs fastest in a marine environment,
but in two years no one will see the difference. The other choices
require coating the entire house, or at least the wall where the
changes were made, with:
</P>
<P>
   1. Bleaching oil, which will hasten weathering and make the
color more even.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bleaching stain, which produces a rather distinct gray color,
not much like weathering.
</P>
<P>
   3. Semitransparent stain, which provides a color other than the
weathered look.
</P>
<P>
   Short of leaving everything alone and tolerating the different
colors, I suggest using the bleaching oil. Only one coat is needed
forever. The others also need only one coat, but require recoating
every five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Hi, handyman, remember me? I'm the one who was looking for
five-eighths-inch ball bearings for my glider. You found the
bearings in the McMaster-Carr catalog, and I appreciate that, but I
also found the catalog on the Net at www.mcmaster.com, and received
the needed bearings in a short time.
</P>
<P>
   CHRIS EVANS, Franklin, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The handyman appreciates the information, which he
immediately put in his file. Thanks.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting in 6 inches of fiberglass insulation in my
cellar ceiling, with the vapor barrier paper up, touching the
ceiling above. What about all those wires and pipes in the ceiling;
should they be covered?
</P>
<P>
   ANTHONY COSTELLO, Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If they are near the ceiling or between the joists, cover
them; if they are at the bottom of the joists, don't; it is simply
not practical to do so. Covering the pipes will provide insulation
so they will not freeze in the cold cellar, made colder by
insulating the ceiling. If you are concerned about no access to the
pipes and wires if they need repair, don't be. It is unlikely that
they will fail; after all, the wires and pipes in other walls and
ceilings of the house are inaccessible, and how many times have you
had to fix them? It would not hurt to insulate any exposed pipes
with foam tube insulation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I know that driveway sealer is mostly cosmetic, but I plan to
seal my driveway to fill the cracks. Will sealer fill cracks?
</P>
<P>
   AXEL WIRTH, Amherst, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   A. Sealer will fill cracks an eighth-inch and smaller; it will
not do very well on cracks a quarter-inch or wider. Fill the wider
cracks with driveway crack filler, sold in caulking cartridges.
</P>
<P>
   Filling the cracks either way helps keep water from getting into
the cracks and then freezing in winter, making them wider. But it
is not critical to the life of the driveway.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ David Kaczynski has a deal with a Los
Angeles company for a movie about his life and a pivotal moment in
1996 when he turned in his brother, Theodore Kaczynski, the
convicted Unabomber.
</P>
<P>
   The film, to be made in conjunction with Walt Disney Motion
Picture Group, will focus on Schenectady residents David Kaczynski
and his wife, Linda Patrik. They will be consultants on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Guber Stephen, executive vice president of the
Avnet/Kerner Co., said the Kaczynskis would not receive
compensation for the film rights. ``Any money is going to the
victims' families,'' but she said she ``was not at liberty to say''
how much they will get.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen first approached the couple about 3 1/2 years ago and
discussions began in earnest about a year ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is in its infancy. The company, which produced
``When a Man Loves a Woman'' and ``Up Close and Personal,'' must
first hire a script writer.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``too soon to tell'' who will play David and Linda, and
when the film is likely to be in theaters, Stephen said.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Kaczynski, a reclusive former mathematics professor
whose manifestoes harped against technology, was sentenced in 1998
to life without parole for a series of bombings that killed three
people and wounded 22 others. His reign of terror lasted from 1978
to 1996, when he was arrested at his Montana cabin after David
Kaczynski told the authorities he suspected his brother was the
bomber.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski is called the Unabomber because his targets included
universities and airline offices.
</P>
<P>
   Kaczynski pleaded guilty to avoid a trial at which his lawyer
had planned to offer an insanity defense, but the guilty plea also
saved him from being sentenced to death.

   BOSTON _ Siddiq Abdullah was 3 when his Muslim family left
behind furniture and farmland in India 52 years ago. After a
desperate dash to the city of Lahore, Pakistan, the family was
forced to sleep on the floor of its new home until his parents
reestablished themselves enough to buy beds, recalled Abdullah, 55,
an economics professor at Pine Manor College and the University of
Massachusetts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   From his hometown of Bareilly, India, Vinod Misra also witnessed
the human toll of the Aug. 14, 1947, partition, which turned
British-ruled India into the independent nations of
Hindu-and-Sikh-dominated India and Muslim-dominated Pakistan.
Bareilly, in the north of India, filled with Hindus and Sikhswho
had fled Pakistan. In Misra's memories, the displaced were always
broken people who had lost either a leg or a hand. Families were
broken, too, with a mother, a father, or a child lost to the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Misra, Abdullah, and a group of 11 other local Pakistanis and
Indians recently wove together their personal tales of horror after
getting an early look at the new film ``Earth.'' The movie explores
how partition shattered friendships between Hindus, Muslims, and
Sikhs in Lahore.
</P>
<P>
   The division of India into two countries displaced 12 million
Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs who crossed the new border in both
directions to evade religious persecution. More than 1 million
people were killed in the process.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Earth,'' Indian director Deepa Mehta, a Hindu, tells this
violent story through the eyes of 8-year-old Lenny. The child is
the daughter of upper-class Parsis, a group that remained neutral
as its country broke in two.
</P>
<P>
   It's international history that most Americans barely know
about. Yet, its effects are still felt in both countries today.
Since 1947, India and Pakistan have fought each other in three
wars. Earlier this year, they threatened each other with a nuclear
punch and engaged in 10 weeks of armed conflict over Kashmir, a
long-disputed territory that they jointly administer. News of a
military coup in Pakistan, which led to the ouster of the country's
prime minister and his government, could further heighten tensions
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In an intense discussion that crested with raised voices and
then ebbed into relieved laughter, local Indians and Pakistanis
talked about partition's impact on families and the toll it has
taken on Indian-Pakistani relationships.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sad chapter in India's history but at least (the
film) will make people realize what happened,'' said Usha Vakil,
50, a delicate-looking woman who was born in New Delhi and now
lives in Hingham, Mass.. ``We talk about World War II, but we never
talk about the biggest partition that ever took place in the world.
What trauma did it leave behind? Nobody addresses that, and those
scars last from generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Indian-born woman, however, thought partition was a
chapter of history best left in the books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wonder why they made the movie at this time,'' said Jaya
Vorunganti, of Burlington, Mass., with a mixture of anxiousness and
anger. ``India is trying to be fair to everybody, and a movie like
this creates tension between different groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehta is accustomed to her work being the subject of intense
scrutiny and debate. Her 1997 movie, ``Fire,'' shed a controversial
light on lesbianism in India.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Fire,'' ``Earth'' has gotten mixed responses from Hindus,
Muslims, and Sikhs since opening earlier this year in India and 11
cities in the United States. (In keeping with the two nations'
strained relationship, Pakistan doesn't show Indian movies, and
India doesn't show Pakistani ones).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   `Rose-colored glasses'
</P>
<P>
   ``Some said it was anti-Hindu, some said it was anti-Muslim, and
some felt it was unbiased,'' said Mehta in a weary, gravelly growl,
speaking from her home in Montreal. ``It's about everybody being
overly sensitive about (being shown) in a light that's not
complimentary. We like to see life through rose-colored glasses and
not address things that are difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Tension has often existed between the Muslims and Hindus. In the
17th century, Hindus chafed under harsh Islamic rule. But when the
British gained power in the next century, Muslims and Hindus united
against a system that denied them jobs and high government
positions.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s, Muslim leaders thought Hindus, the majority group
in India, were becoming too powerful. Skirmishes between them
started to occur. Soon, some Muslims began demanding their own
country. They got their wish in August 1947.
</P>
<P>
   After a screening of ``Earth,'' the local group willingly delved
into who caused the unease among Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs. The
Indians angled their accusations at British and Indian politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could pit one against the other just to control the
country,'' Govind Vakil, 51, an architect and Usha's husband, said
of the British.

   Soft-spoken Vinod Chungi, 52, of Sharon, Mass., who was born in
Hyderabad, India, agreed, adding, ``The worst part is that the
politicians are continuing that policy. They play people against
each other for their own purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Musadik Malik, 37, who writes medical reports for the

economic disparities between Muslims and Hindus in Lahore, his
hometown.

   Hindu exodus
</P>
<P>
   Malik grew up in a city where Hindu domination was still
evident: hospitals, mansions, and streets bore Hindu names. Before
partition, Hindus held the professional jobs in Lahore, Malik said,
while Muslims were generally workers and peasants. Then, in 1947,
Hindus literally ran for their lives, leaving Muslims their
businesses and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth'' doesn't expis aspect of partition. Instead, it
tells the story by describing the friendship between Lenny's Hindu
nanny and her lovelorn circle of male Muslim, Sikh, and Hindu
friends. As the religious tension in the country intensifies, it
slowly chips away at their bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about the politics of partition,'' said Pakistani
author Bapsi Sidhwa, a Parsi who lives in Houston. ``Earth'' is
based on her award-winning, semi-autobiographical book, ``Cracking
India.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about what happened to the common people dislocated
because of the religious violence,'' Sidhwa continued.
</P>
<P>
   Friendships across religious lines existed before, during, and
after partition, agreed the Indians and Pakistanis. Misra, a Hindu,
confidently raised his voice above the din to describe his days at
a Muslim college in India. ``We respected each other's
differences,'' Misra, 56, who heads a management consulting company
in Burlington, said emphatically. ``I had the same relationship
with my Hindu and Muslim friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The less fortunate felt the ire of religious hatred. In
``Earth,'' Muslims burn Hindu neighborhoods, a train arrives in
Lahore from India filled with murdered Muslims, Sikh and Hindu
families flee to India, and those who remain in Pakistan convert to
Islam or Christianity.

<P>
   Midnight's children
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Anita Raj-Silverman, a 28-year-old American-born
woman of Indian descent, never talked about those tumultuous
events. Raj-Silverman finally asked them about it after seeing
``Earth'' at a film festival earlier this year. Suddenly, the
stories tumbled out.
</P>
<P>
   Raj-Silverman's Hindu father was a 12-year-old boy who trekked
from Pakistan to India with his family. Her mother, a Sikh who
lived in India's Punjab region, could no longer play with her young
Muslim friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an uncle by marriage whose parents were decapitated in
front of him,'' said Raj-Silverman, an assistant research professor
at Boston University's School of Public Health. ``I was told,
`Don't talk to your cousins about it.' You don't talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Earth,'' said Mehta, encourages dialogue _ younger generations
now understand what caused the rift between Pakistan and India.
Those who lived through partition, she says, are finally talking
about their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   But it became clear during the group discussion that resentment
over the death, loss, and chaos still simmers. Shundana Tusaf, a
blunt-speaking architect studying architectural history at MIT,
said that as a child in Peshawar, Pakistan, she could hear the
anger in the words of her history teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used jargon, saying, `Hindus are bad,' '' recalled Tusaf,
29, ``or `The British were not as bad as the Hindus.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The statement caused many in the room to rumble in disagreement.
Until that point, no one had blatantly talked about the festering
hatred between the groups. Usha Vakil's voice finally rose above
the others: ``I was never taught like that. I don't remember
hearing in schools that Pakistan is bad, Muslims are bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Malik revisited the subject in a phone
conversation. He wasn't taught to hate Hindus in school, he said,
but Tusaf's comments and the group's reaction to them illustrated
an important point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're in Pakistan or India, no matter what we say publicly
for face saving, the truth is . . . there is a lot of hatred,
because there is a lot of blood. The pain is going to take a long
time to go away.''

IF ONLY MARTHA COULD TIDY UP WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   William R. Mattox Jr., writing on the op-ed page of Tuesday's
USA Today, suggests that ``instead of paying so much attention to
an ever-growing cast of fruitcake candidates, (the Reform Party)
ought to be paying closer attention to America's premier fruitcake
maker, Martha Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   Martha for president? It's a splendid idea, but unfortunately
it's not to be.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day, the business page of The New York Times
featured a story about the initial public offering of Martha
Stewart Living Omnimedia. The piece raised the question of what
might happen to Martha's conglomerate if there were no Martha to
run the operation. Martha is a micro-manager who has her hand in
every corner of her company. She's much too busy presiding over her
vast media and merchandising empire to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   While we may be denied Martha Stewart in the White House, why
shouldn't we insist on a president whose standards are as high as
Martha's? We need a president strong enough to march us into the
next millennium the Martha Stewart Way, a candidate who knows a
good thing when he sees it, one who can be relied upon to tend the
national compost heap as carefully as Martha would.
</P>
<P>
   Which of the many hopefuls could pass the Martha Stewart test?
When we weigh a presidential candidate, we should ask: What would
Martha do? What would Martha say?
</P>
<P>
   For example, Playboy magazine asks for the candidate's views on
religion. The candidate might respond:
</P>
<P>
   a) ``The separation of church and state is fundamental to
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   b) ``I support mandatory prayer in the classroom, as long as
it's Christian prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   c) ``Church-going could be a real money-maker, if a financial
genius like myself got behind it.''
</P>
<P>
   d) ``Organized religion is a sham and a crutch for weak-minded
people who need strength in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   e) ``Beautiful flower arrangements add so much to any service of
worship.''
</P>
<P>
   At a photo op in a fly-blown New Hampshire doughnut shop, the
candidate is offered a cruller. The candidate:
</P>
<P>
   a) says, ``I tried one of these when I was at Harvard, but I
never digested it.''
</P>
<P>
   b) takes a big bite and smiles bravely for the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   c) says, ``Crullers are a crutch for weak-minded people who
can't handle doughnuts.''
</P>
<P>
   d) says, ``Crullers could be as big as bagels, if someone as
talented and innovative as I am decided to market them.''
</P>
<P>
   e) scrubs down the counter and the display case, then invites
the press into the kitchen to watch while he whips up a batch of
sugar-raised doughnuts from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Asked for an opinion on the controversial elephant-dung painting
of the Virgin Mary at the Brooklyn Museum, the candidate says:
</P>
<P>
   a) ``I understand the elephant's First Amendment rights weren't
abridged in the creation of this painting.''
</P>
<P>
   b) ``This painting is an insult to God-fearing people of every
religious persuasion.''
</P>
<P>
   c) ``Elephant dung is a crutch for weak-minded alleged artists
who can't handle paint.''
</P>
<P>
   d) ``A person with my amazing financial acumen could make a
fortune cornering the elephant-dung art market. If it weren't so
unsanitary.''
</P>
<P>
   e) ``Elephant dung has so many other uses. I always keep a
supply on hand. It makes cunning door stops, clever hostess gifts,
and it's the perfect medium for planting spring-flowering bulbs.''
</P>

WALTER MOSLEY: FROM MYSTERY TO REDEMPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speaking to author Walter Mosley is like encountering his books
in living form. He's as breezily philosophical as Socrates Fortlow,
the murderer and rapist walking a rocky path toward redemption in
his new novel, ``Walkin' the Dog,'' published this month. But he
can also be as engagingly down-home as the Easy Rawlins character
in his mystery series.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, 47, learned to write by being an avid reader. It wasn't
until he was 34 years old with 15 years logged as a computer
programmer that he finally put pen to paper and produced his first
work.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' to ``A Little Yellow Dog,''
Mosley's fans watched him fine-tune Rawlins, the reluctant
detective who solves crime in his Watts neighborhood. In the
process, Mosely brought to life inner-city Los Angeles in the
mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
   With the science-fiction ``Blue Light'' and ``RL's Dream,'' a
novel about a Mississippi Delta bluesman, Mosley broke out of the
mystery mold. And there's more to come from the author who
enthusiastically calls writing ``the most wonderful thing in the
world; I do it every day.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, Random House will publish ``Working on the Chain
Gang,'' which Mosley says is about ``the chains created by
capitalism, mass media, and a miscomprehension of government.''
He's also developing his Rawlins character into a possible one-hour
ABC drama.
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is currently writing science fiction short stories and
two screenplays for HBO. One of his television projects is a sequel
to ``Always Outnumbered,'' the critically acclaimed 1998 TV version
of his first Fortlow book, ``Always Outnumbered, Always
Outgunned.''
</P>
<P>
   In rat-a-tat-tat sentences that shifted and restarted as Mosley
formed his ideas, the author spoke about developing the Fortlow
character and working in television.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What made you decide to develop the Socrates Fortlow
character?
</P>
<P>
   A. I wanted to show exactly how a complex philosophical thought
rose in black communities. When I talked to people (while)
traveling around the country, they never believed me when I said,
``Black people think, they're philosophical.'' Because we're so
brainwashed in America to believe that the only philosophers were
white Europeans and Christians for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   So the notion was to take this very unlikely character, like the
original Socrates: You know, a working-class kind of guy, kind of
ungainly, not ostracized but not part of the center, and show what
his life means.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Did you always know you were going to write a second novel
about him?
</P>
<P>
   A. Ummm. You know that's a hard question to answer. I knew I
could have written another book about him. And I knew I would like
to. For a long time, I didn't know what I wanted to say.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you decide what you wanted to say?
</P>
<P>
   A. Somebody called me from England, a writer there. He was doing
a collection of stories about jazz, and he wondered if I could do
something.
</P>
<P>
   So I sat down one day and ``Blue Lightning'' (the first chapter
of ``Walking the Dog'') came out. And ``Blue Lightning'' is the
template for the whole book. Once I finished writing the story, I
said, ``Wow, this is the next Socrates book.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What was it about that chapter? How did you know it could
turn into a novel?
</P>
<P>
   A. I saw the problem. I saw the issues. Here (Fortlow) is, he's
been offered the job making like $17,000-18,000 a year. All the
other elements of his life come into play at that point.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How did you develop Socrates' character?
</P>
<P>
   A. You know Socrates is a black man in America today, and the
issue of self redemption is a big thing. He's seeking to redeem
himself. And it's an impossible task. (He chuckles.) That
redemption is like the original Socrates' truth: You don't really
get the truth but you try. You try. And some people don't make it,
as is obvious in some of the stories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You start ``Walkin' the Dog'' with a jazz player blowing his
horn. Does jazz influence you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yeah, sure. I think ``Devil in a Blue Dress'' was
informed by jazz. But I don't write about music so much as I write
about the sensibility that that music covers. The music is a
reflection of the people.
</P>
<P>
   So the blues is a reflection of the tragedy of black people in
so-called freedom after 1865. Jazz is that striving for
individuality, for a voice in a world that doesn't want to hear
anything.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will you return to the Socrates character soon?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know about soon, but I think at least there's one
more book out of Socrates. See the first book is him having that
glimmer of thought, like, ``Hey, I'm alive, and I can do something.
I can have an effect on the world.'' The second one is saying,
``There is a purpose.'' And the third one is, ``I have a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   So at least a third (book) and maybe even a fourth. We'll see. I
mean I love writing about Socrates. Socrates is really a wonderful
character. I like him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does he remind you of anyone you know?
</P>
<P>
   A. Not at all. But he does deeply remind me of the black
community where you find people who you love and the rest of the
world is vilifying.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I think black men are wonderful. And I live in a world
where they're vilified all the time even by themselves. . . .
</P>
<P>
   You've got the white community, the prison system, the police
profiling us on the street. Amadou Diallo gets shot down because he
pulls out, like, a telephone. And the (New York City) mayor comes
out and says, ``It's OK. You wanted it to be crime free so we have
to murder a few people.'' It's like what? Please.
</P>
<P>
   And Socrates stands up against that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. You're developing a drama for ABC. Did that project happen
before or after the hubbub about the lack of people of color in the
new fall shows?
</P>
<P>
   A. It was being worked on before. But that's the whole thing:
It's always being worked on. I mean no one ever blamed Hollywood
for not trying to develop black projects. It's just once they
develop it they don't want to do it. (He laughs.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How was the experience of making ``Always Outnumbered, Always
Outgunned'' for HBO?
</P>
<P>
   A. I liked making ``Always Outnumbered.'' I thought it was a
really wonderful movie. I'm really looking forward to the next one
I make because I know we really said something with that movie.
</P>
<P>
   That unrelenting reality that Socrates had to deal with from the
little boy to the dying friend. People saw it, and they had never
seen that before on televison, but they see it in their lives every
day. And it was kind of a shock, My God. (He says the last two
words in a hushed tone.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Won't you also get that effect with Easy Rawlins on ABC?
</P>
<P>
   A. No. No. Because it's going to be commercial television and
commercial television's very entertaining. So you have to have the
guns go off. You have to have the sexual tension. You have to have
all of that stuff, which is going to make people want to watch it.
</P>
<P>
   On HBO they watch it if they want to. On ABC they have to want
to watch it. It's two completely different things.

ROVER MINI AGAIN TO PLAY GNAT TO VW'S BUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, when for many in America big steel was in
and gas was cheap, the cult of the big car thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, out there on the fringe, a true counterculture was nascent
and there lurked a market for small cars. Volkswagen, of course,
became the badge of that fringe and, later, the counterculture that
would emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The VW became the lovable Bug, scuttling across America,
veritably crawling along the roads. But if VW was the Bug, Mini was
the Gnat, a tiny British box of a car, buzzing and darting and
attracting a fringe following of its own.
</P>
<P>
   After time, both manufacturers stopped exporting their little
insects to the United States and the old models left behind became
cherished icons in the lingering cults of their faithful. Now,
Volkswagen, with its New Beetle, is back in a big way. And, now,
there is news on the Mini.
</P>
<P>
   First the good news: BMW, which has owned the British company
Rover and, hence, rights to the Mini since 1994, will produce a new
Mini in 2000. And just as the New Beetle _ though bigger and safer
and better than the old _ evokes the original, so too will the new
Mini.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: BMW is not certain it will sell the car in the
United States. And that would dismay a hardy band of Mini devotees,
says Carl Zack, a Mini enthusiast from Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be crazy not to keep the market alive overseas,'' Zack
says.
</P>
<P>
   This much is known.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mini will be launched next year, according to BMW
spokesman David Buchko. It will be front-wheel drive, just like the
original. Its motor _ 1.6 or 1.8 liters and four cylinders _ will
be a transverse mount.
</P>
<P>
   It will be slightly larger than the original 10-by-4-by-4-foot
box _ with 10-inch wheels _ that arrived on these shores 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Appearance-wise, says Buchko, ``it will be a modern
interpretation of the original Mini concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Read into that: It will still be a box, but the corners will be
rounded a bit.
</P>
<P>
   And modern technology will make it safer, more reliable, and
more sophisticated than the original. We know more about
front-wheel drive and transverse engine mounts than they did in
1959. Suspension systems are far more sophisticated. Just as the
New Beetle really isn't the old, the new Mini will have the aura of
the old with all the benefits of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not that, in its day, the Mini was not a formidable little car.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first British car to win a European Rally
Championship. It won the Monte Carlo Rally three times. In the
United States, it became the terror of rally and gymkhana courses.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of the eccentric Sir Alec Issigonis, the Mini
offered a lightweight auto with front-wheel drive, a rubber
suspension system, and handling and performance in an economy car.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived here in 1960 under Morris and Austin badges, and its
most popular models were the Morris Minor and the Mini Cooper, the
latter being the car that caught the eye of the American sports car
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Other small cars, besides the Volkswagen, had come to these
shores at about the same time: Isettas, Messerschmitts, Goggomobils
_ but none performed like a Mini.
</P>
<P>
   At the base was the Austin 850, imported from 1960-67. It had an
848 cc engine that produced 35 thundering horses and 44 lb.-ft. of
torque.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Mini Van and Countryman, with the same engines as
the 850. The van was a light delivery vehicle for commercial use,
while the Countryman was an Austin wagon with wood trim around the
back of the body and twin rear doors.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Mini Pickup, again with the same engine, and
imported from 1961-67 and so rare it is highly sought after today.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, there was the Mini Cooper, imported from
1961-67 with engines of nearly 1,000 cc, a three-gauge instrument
pod replacing the single speedometer, and a bizarre but effective
(when it didn't leak) suspension system: hydrolastic suspension
with a rubber bag at each wheel filled with an antifreeze-like
liquid. Hoses interconnected the four bags, and as wheels rose and
fell, liquid was displaced from bag to bag to control the pitch of
the car.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Mini Cooper S was introduced with a 1,071 cc engine
and by 1964 a 1,275 cc engine (hey, bigger than Harleys in those
days) had been planted in the little box.
</P>
<P>
   Like standard Coopers, the S models had two-tone paint and a
slanted grill. What gave them away, subtly, were gold or silver
brocade accents on the two-tone seats, and small chrome ``S''
emblems on hood and trunk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the BMW Group introduced a
prototype Mini Cooper to the world. And just as VW did with the
Bug, it is remarkable how the prototype, which will become the new
Mini, evokes the original.

RODDY DOYLE LOOKS AT THE IRISH BIG PICTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Roddy Doyle smiles wryly as he politely _ but firmly _
declines an invitation to visit one of downtown Boston's many Irish
theme pubs. ``I don't like forced Irishness,'' explains the man who
has been hailed as the leading light of the current Irish literary
renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   In novels such as ``The Commitments,'' ``The Woman Who Walked
Into Doors,'' and ``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' Doyle has created a
host of memorable and three-dimensional characters: feisty,
foulmouthed types who are often down but never entirely out.
</P>
<P>
   His characters are Irish to the core, but bear little
resemblance to the lovable, stereotypical ``Paddies'' of stage,
screen, and much Irish-American nostalgia. Instead, his characters
reflect the gritty authenticity of the working-class suburbs of
North Dublin where he grew up and once taught school.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle was in town to launch his new book, ``A Star Called
Henry,'' the first volume in a literary sea change for the author:
It's an ambitious, unconventional trilogy that will sum up the
tumultuous history of 20th-century Ireland through the life and
voice of one character. Doyle's focus is on Henry Smart, a highly
sexed, clear-eyed, ruthless, and more or less indestructible son of
the Dublin slums who moves through the decades in tandem with a
changing Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every book I've written has been different,'' says Doyle, who
still lives in Dublin with his wife and three small sons. ``This
time the storyteller in me wanted to write about big history and
big politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle himself is a far cry from any stereotypes. The affable
41-year-old has a shaved head, wears wire-rimmed glasses, and
sports a silver stud in his left earlobe. He looks like neither the
literary lion nor the former grade-school teacher (English and
geography) that he is. Doyle showed up for an interview at the
Swissotel _ where the somberly elegant decor suggests a bankers'
club in Zurich _ in a rumpled black jacket and an open-necked
bright red shirt.
</P>
<P>
   He could have passed for one of the likable musicians of the
Commitments, the eponymous soul band of his first novel, which was
made into a popular film, one of several of his books brought to
the screen. And the overall impression of Doyle is of the new
Irishman _ a citizen of the European Community who is completely at
ease in both his own country and the wider world. Irish
remorsefulness is not his forte.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a happy man,'' Doyle says, cheerfully. ``I'm doing what I
want to do and making a pretty good living at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his earlier books, ``A Star Called Henry'' has aroused
some controversy in Ireland because of a consistently irreverent
tone regarding the nation's formative history. The book portrays
such icons of Irish nationalism as Eamon De Valera, Michael
Collins, and Padraic Pearse as all too human: frequently vain,
sometimes petty, and often self-serving.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   IRA anger?
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports that the book raised the ire of the
Irish Republican Army, but that possibility doesn't faze the upbeat
Doyle. ``In England, the press are always asking me if I'm afraid
for my life,'' he says, ``and the answer is that I'm not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new novel, Henry, a strapping 6-footer, is age 15 at the
time of the Easter uprising. The son of an alcoholic mother and a
one-legged father who is both a bouncer in a brothel and a killer
for hire, Henry joins the Citizens Army and takes part in the 1916
uprising against British rule in Dublin, an event Doyle depicts as
a combination of farce and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   A block off the old chip, Henry becomes an IRA gunman,
specializing in assassinating informers, policemen, and British
officials. Finally sickened by so much killing and disillusioned
with the rebel leadership, he leaves Ireland. Future adventures
will include a stint in America and a return to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the revered heroes of the Irish war of independence whom
Henry encounters, Doyle implies, were really more interested in
improving their own fortunes than in freeing their country. ``I was
brought up to believe they were all saints, but I did my
homework,'' he says. ``And besides, I'm not the first one to make
fun of them.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are pitfalls to writing about Ireland's past, Doyle
acknowledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing with Irish history is that's it's still happening,''
he says. ``There are lads out there fighting about the same things
they were fighting about in 1916. Irish history isn't safe.'' By
quitting the fight when he does, Henry _ and Doyle _ avoids taking
sides in the bitter civil war that broke out in 1922 between
Republican and Free State factions of the nationalist movement,
still a hot-button topic in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   New Irish self-confidence
</P>
<P>
   Despite the controversy, Irish critics have generbraced
the book, which is selling briskly in Ireland and Britain. ``A lot
has changed in Ireland in the last 10 years, and there's a new
self-confidence now,'' Doyle says, so a book that reexamines the
past is finding a new audience. ``Some of the old statues have
tumbled down.'' The book also is selling well in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle's first three novels _ ``The Commitments,'' ``The
Snapper,'' and ``The Van'' _ were all set in the fictional suburb
of Barrytown and chronicled the fortunes of various members of the
Rabbitte family. ``I thought I was writing three different books,''
he says. ``It was my publisher's idea to call them the Barrytown
Trilogy. Now, they're out in a boxed set.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing wasn't always so good to Doyle. ``The Commitments''
had to be privately published in 1986, when Doyle was a full-time
teacher. After the manuscript made the rounds of publishers _ and
was returned unread by all of them _ he borrowed money from a
friend and published it himself, sending copies to reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't advise writers to do that  &UR; today &LR;  unless they're
prepared to lose a lot of money,'' he says. ``But there hadn't been
any interesting new Irish writing in a long time, and the book
attracted a lot of attention.'' Eventually picked up by a major
publisher, it became a bestseller on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commitments'' launched his career as part of the new wave
of Irish novelists, who include Patrick McCabe (``The Butcher
Boy'') and Colm Toibin (``The South''). ``There's a staggering
amount of quality writing in Ireland now,'' Doyle says.
</P>
<P>
   His 1993 novel ``Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,'' which describes the
disintegration of a marriage through the eyes and words of a
10-year-old boy, won the prestigious Booker Prize, the British
equivalent of the Pulitzer Prize for literature. The book is
already considered a modern classic, a coming-of-age story to rank
with ``Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any book I ever write will sell more copies than
`Paddy Clarke Ha Ha Ha,' '' Doyle says. Far less popular was his
next book,``The Woman Who Walked Into Doors'' (1996), the story of
an alcoholic woman and battered wife trying to pull her life
together.
</P>
<P>
   Although praised by critics, it sold poorly, particularly in
this country. ``More copies were sold in Iceland than in the United
States,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Until ``A Star Called Henry,'' his writing has been cemented in
gritty realism, street-smart humor, and salty dialogue. But
``Henry'' adds fantasy and is peppered with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Henry,'' Doyle slyly drops a few clues about what lies
ahead for his hero, including the fact that he gets shot in
Chicago. To research that part of the second book of the trilogy,
he says, he for a time considered moving there. ``I wanted to write
about the South Side Chicago of the 1920s with its speak-easies and
jazz clubs, but when I visited Chicago I discovered that it was all
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle won't even hint at what kind of trouble Henry Smart will
get into in the Chicago of Al Capone and Dutch Schultz. ``I don't
want to give too much away,'' he says, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   ``And besides, I'm still writing the book.''

TENOR OF THE TIMES: DOMINGO GOES ON LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's this for a new trio _ Placido Domingo, Chuck D., and David
Bowie? Those aren't exactly artists you'd expect to see occupying
the same stage _ or the same sentence, for that matter. But all
three have embraced the Internet to market and promote their music.
Call them the Three Techies, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Bowie and Chuck D., along with pop acts like the Beastie Boys,
were quick to realize the potential of digital music distribution,
but classical artists have been slower to jump on line. Granted,
all of the infamous Three Tenors have their own ``official Web
sites,'' but the Mexican-born Domingo is the first international
opera star to sign an exlusive agreement with an online music
company. This week, he became a board member and ``family artist''
at Global Music Network (www.gmn.com), a portal specializing in
jazz, classical, and opera. Domingo will produce recordings
exclusively for the site.
</P>
<P>
   The Domingo recordings won't be on line until next year, but
right now the site features a small coterie of artists. And it was
recently ranked one of the top five music sites by the British
music magazine Heat. ``We were the only classical site,'' says
Global Music CEO Mike Lubin, ``and we were sandwiched in right
between the Beastie Boys and Public Enemy.'' And who thought the
Net was just for Gen X, Y, and Z?

   Lord knows there's enough pork flying around Capitol Hill, but
late last week the subject wasn't ham, it was spam, unwanted
e-mail. And the distinguished senators and representatives were not
exactly eating it all up.
</P>
<P>
   A new staffer in the office of Representative Alcee Hastings
(D-Fla.) sent out a message hawking diet pills. The aide, Cher
Castillo, says she meant to send the missive (``Lose weight
permanently!'') to five friends, but somehow managed to send it to
every e-mail address on the Hill. Whoops.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Maviglio, chief of staff for Representative Bush Holt
(D-N.J.), was particularly irate. He first reported the offense to
House Information Services. Then he responded to the diet pill mail
with a treatise about the evils of spam and hit ``Reply All.'' He
says he saw only about 40 names on the reply list, but he actually
sent the e-mail to more than 10,000 addresses on the Hill. The
system flooded, in-boxes clogged, and tempers flared.
</P>
<P>
   Holt's office just happens to be sponsoring a bill called the
Can Spam Act, and Maviglio was bombarded with complaints about his
anti-spam spam. ``Some people thought it was an elaborate plot to
promote the bill, but I'm not nearly that creative,'' says
Maviglio. And some people blamed Maviglio for the original diet
pill e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look like a complete idiot, but if that's what it takes to
move the bill forward, I'll take it,'' Maviglio says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the original spammer, Castillo is not supposed to talk
about the incident. Reached at her office, she sheepishly admitted
that she did, in fact, send the errant e-mail. Was it an accident?
Yes. Was she reprimanded? Yes. Can she elaborate? Well, no. ``I'm
not allowed to answer any questions from the press,'' she explains.
Her title? ``I'm the press secretary.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Artists ranging from Bono and Bowie to Sheryl Crow and the
Counting Crows took the stage in London, Geneva, and the
Meadowlands, N.J., to promote a Web site that advocates social
activism. Sponsored by the United Nations Development Programme,
the site (www.NetAid.org) provided a one-stop resource center for
global activism. The NetAid concerts were Webcast live on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, far from the spotlight, a computer programmer in
Bloomington, Ind., has found a way for ordinary folks to fight
world hunger without leaving their desks. Thehungersite.com is an
innovation developed by John Breen, a Boston native and Harvard
graduate. Here's how it works: You press a button to ``donate''
food for the hungry. The names of several corporate sponsors appear
on the screen; the sponsors agree to donate half a cent to the
United Nations World Hunger Program every time the donation button
is pushed. Users can click the donation button only once a day, but
many return day after day to do their part. ``I give a lot of
credit to the people who spend five or ten seconds going to the
site every day,'' says Breen.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was launched in June, the site has raised more than
$100,000 and is pulling in about $15,000 in donations a week.
``It's a very unique way to raise funds,'' says Francis Mwanza,
spokesman for the World Hunger Program in Rome. ``We feed about 75
million people in 80 countries worldwide, and at every moment, we
need all the help we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some folks are using the Internet to raise money, while others
are just giving it away. CBS has joined forces with a small
Internet company to launch www.iWon.com, a portal similar to ABC's
go.com and NBC's Snap.com. To attract users, the site is giving
away cold cash, with a daily prize of $10,000, a monthly prize of
$1 million, and an annual prize of $10 million. Now, there's a neat
trick to drive up traffic; if we pay them, they will come.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Just in time for the unveiling of the new Smiley face postage
stamp, a friend sent along the URL of a Web site that's worth a few
giggles on a particularly depressing day. Www.mrznet.com/mambo.html

FORD JOINS GROWING GROUP   OF INEXPENSIVE, COMFORTABLE MODELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In these times of a good economy, and ever-better automobiles,
there has been a seemingly voracious appetite for mid-luxury
automobiles, a segment that has split itself into several levels
and where the challenge for the consumer has become one of asking
if $44,000 Luxury Car X is really worth $14,000 more than Luxury
Car Y, or even $20,000 more than Luxury Car Z.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, but effectively, another segment, one of very good,
comfortable but inexpensive cars, has been inexorably expanding.
Long in this class were the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla; then
the Chevrolet Cavalier, Saturn SL and Wagon, and Dodge/Plymouth
Neon.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Ford, with its new 2000 Focus, and its goal of
building a small car that is roomy, economical, and bordering on
sporty.
</P>
<P>
   With the Focus, Ford has done it.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus comes in three basic models: three-door, four-door
sedan, and station wagon. They also offer the top-end ZTS four-door
sedan. Prices range from just over $12,000 to just under $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sedans are almost van-like in their aura. The hood
rolls up sharply to a massive windshield, which continues that edge
to a high roof line, drops down to a smaller rear window, and ends
abruptly at a high, chopped rear. Ford calls the design ``New
Edge,'' and by substituting sharper lines for the awful ovals of
recent years, it has built a car that is sporty looking.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, it may look like a tight little car. But no. Inside,
the feeling of spaciousness is grand.
</P>
<P>
   The doors are tall and the glass in them is big. The roof is
quite high, and as you look out the windshield you do not see the
hood _ again it is almost van-like in feel.
</P>
<P>
   The trunk, because of the car's rear height, is long and deep.
Fold down the 60/40 split rear seats and you turn the Focus into a
virtual hatchback.
</P>
<P>
   The two front seats are broad and quite comfortable, if a bit
soft. The wide back seat holds three comfortably; leg room is
plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   For the driver, all instrumentation is straight ahead behind the
wheel: tachometer and speedometer each big at the center; at either
end of the elongated oval cluster are the fuel and temperature
gauges; and climbing in arcs from each end of the cluster are the
warning lights.
</P>
<P>
   To the left of the driver are controls for mirrors, lights, and
door locks. In the center of the dash, audio and climate controls
are wonderfully simple.
</P>
<P>
   The glove compartment is big, a surprise these days since many
manufacturers have given this space over to air bags (the Focus has
front air bags, with side bags an option). There are also
respectable storage slots in each front door.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus has two engine options: an SOHC in-line 4-cylinder
that puts out 110 horsepower and 122 lb.-ft. of torque, and a
16-valve DOHC in-line four that produces 130 horsepower and 135
lb.-ft. of torque. Both engines use plenty of aluminum _ cylinder
heads, pistons, oil pan _ to keep weight down, and these are light
cars, ranging from 2,551 for the three-door to just 2,717 for the
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Four-speed automatic and five-speed manual transmissions are
available.
</P>
<P>
   I drove the ZTS, which has the more powerful engine, with a
five-speed manual transmission.
</P>
<P>
   It is a surprisingly supple and quiet car, cruising at 55 m.p.h.
at just 2,100 rpms and 75 m.p.h. at 3,000. For passing, a quick
drop into fourth gave a steady surge even at higher speeds, and if
you don't need to get by someone quickly, fifth does just fine.
There seemed to be little loss of torque from takeoff right up
through 6,000 rpms, and the car moved nimbly in and out of highway
traffic, slower only than those who were traveling way too fast and
wanted the Focus out of their way in too much of a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Hauling kids to soccer, trash to the recycling center, and
myself along the interstate to work, the Focus ZTS got just over 26
miles per gallon, a figure that likely would go up after the engine
is broken in.
</P>
<P>
   As with any front-wheel drive, there was some torque steer, but
at the horsepower levels of the Focus engines, that is not a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   On corners, I found the car a little softer than it needs to be
_ almost a big-car feel _ and that's not necessary. Ford seems to
have gotten caught between sporty stiffness and soft comfort and I
would have erred toward stiffness in a car so light and tall.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension up front is struts, coil springs, fully
independent dampers and antiroll bar. There is fully independent
rear suspension with separate damper units and antiroll bar.
</P>
<P>
   Brakes are discs all around (ABS is an option, standard on the
ZTS).
</P>
<P>
   So Ford has accomplished what it set out to do. Built a
front-wheel-drive car (think snow), that is inexpensive, roomy, and
sporty enough to attract young buyers.
</P>
<P>
   And they've also gone a bit European in letting drivers use
lifestyle options to ``customize'' their Focus: a sports package
that includes racks for gear and backpacks that slip over the rear
of the front seats; pet packages that include bed and bowl; an
``express yourself'' package that includes seat covers of fleece,
neoprene, or jersey; and a professional package for the business
traveler that includes a voice recorder, illuminated notepad
holder, and mobile work station.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The V-shaped, dedicated vents built into the far corner of
each end of the dash. They are dedicated to defrosting the side
windows and they do it very well.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The emergency brake handle between the seats takes up space
where a large storage console could have been placed. They could
have split the space with a shorter handle, or moved the handle and
gained a big bin.
</P>
<P>
   --The windshield wipers just did not do a good job of handling
the rain. On glass that big, you need bigger, heavier blades.
</P>
<P>

ROVER MINI AGAIN TO PLAY GNAT TO VW'S BUG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, when for many in America big steel was in
and gas was cheap, the cult of the big car thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, out there on the fringe, a true counterculture was nascent
and there lurked a market for small cars. Volkswagen, of course,
became the badge of that fringe and, later, the counterculture that
would emerge.
</P>
<P>
   The VW became the lovable Bug, scuttling across America,
veritably crawling along the roads. But if VW was the Bug, Mini was
the Gnat, a tiny British box of a car, buzzing and darting and
attracting a fringe following of its own.
</P>
<P>
   After time, both manufacturers stopped exporting their little
insects to the United States and the old models left behind became
cherished icons in the lingering cults of their faithful. Now,
Volkswagen, with its New Beetle, is back in a big way. And, now,
there is news on the Mini.
</P>
<P>
   First the good news: BMW, which has owned the British company
Rover and, hence, rights to the Mini since 1994, will produce a new
Mini in 2000. And just as the New Beetle _ though bigger and safer
and better than the old _ evokes the original, so too will the new
Mini.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: BMW is not certain it will sell the car in the
United States. And that would dismay a hardy band of Mini devotees,
says Carl Zack, a Mini enthusiast from Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd be crazy not to keep the market alive overseas,'' Zack
says.
</P>
<P>
   This much is known.
</P>
<P>
   The new Mini will be launched next year, according to BMW
spokesman David Buchko. It will be front-wheel drive, just like the
original. Its motor _ 1.6 or 1.8 liters and four cylinders _ will
be a transverse mount.
</P>
<P>
   It will be slightly larger than the original 10-by-4-by-4-foot
box _ with 10-inch wheels _ that arrived on these shores 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Appearance-wise, says Buchko, ``it will be a modern
interpretation of the original Mini concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Read into that: It will still be a box, but the corners will be
rounded a bit.
</P>
<P>
   And modern technology will make it safer, more reliable, and
more sophisticated than the original. We know more about
front-wheel drive and transverse engine mounts than they did in
1959. Suspension systems are far more sophisticated. Just as the
New Beetle really isn't the old, the new Mini will have the aura of
the old with all the benefits of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not that, in its day, the Mini was not a formidable little car.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first British car to win a European Rally
Championship. It won the Monte Carlo Rally three times. In the
United States, it became the terror of rally and gymkhana courses.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of the eccentric Sir Alec Issigonis, the Mini
offered a lightweight auto with front-wheel drive, a rubber
suspension system, and handling and performance in an economy car.
</P>
<P>
   It arrived here in 1960 under Morris and Austin badges, and its
most popular models were the Morris Minor and the Mini Cooper, the
latter being the car that caught the eye of the American sports car
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Other small cars, besides the Volkswagen, had come to these
shores at about the same time: Isettas, Messerschmitts, Goggomobils
_ but none performed like a Mini.
</P>
<P>
   At the base was the Austin 850, imported from 1960-67. It had an
848 cc engine that produced 35 thundering horses and 44 lb.-ft. of
torque.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Mini Van and Countryman, with the same engines as
the 850. The van was a light delivery vehicle for commercial use,
while the Countryman was an Austin wagon with wood trim around the
back of the body and twin rear doors.
</P>
<P>
   There was the Mini Pickup, again with the same engine, and
imported from 1961-67 and so rare it is highly sought after today.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, there was the Mini Cooper, imported from
1961-67 with engines of nearly 1,000 cc, a three-gauge instrument
pod replacing the single speedometer, and a bizarre but effective
(when it didn't leak) suspension system: hydrolastic suspension
with a rubber bag at each wheel filled with an antifreeze-like
liquid. Hoses interconnected the four bags, and as wheels rose and
fell, liquid was displaced from bag to bag to control the pitch of
the car.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, the Mini Cooper S was introduced with a 1,071 cc engine
and by 1964 a 1,275 cc engine (hey, bigger than Harleys in those
days) had been planted in the little box.

   Like standard Coopers, the S models had two-tone paint and a
slanted grill. What gave them away, subtly, were gold or silver
brocade accents on the two-tone seats, and small chrome ``S''
emblems on hood and trunk.

   In 1997, at the Frankfurt Motor Show, the BMW Group introduced a
prototype Mini Cooper to the world. And just as VW did with the
Bug, it is remarkable how the prototype, which will become the new
Mini, evokes the original.

 HARVARD IS UP FOR REBOUND
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Harvard was on the verge of taking command in the Ivy League in
the final minutes of last week's game against Cornell in Ithaca,
N.Y. Though the Crimson lost, 24-23, coach Tim Murphy is optimistic
about the ability of Harvard (2-2 overall, 1-1 Ivy) to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any question that, when all is said and
done, Cornell will lose a game in the Ivy League,'' Murphy said
while preparing for Saturday's game at Fordham (0-5). ``They had
two miraculous comebacks and they can't do that all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't remember a game we controlled so much and didn't win
it. We were up by 13 points and playing quality football. But we
had a chance to put them away and we didn't, and you can't do that
against a good team. There were two penalties on fourth-down plays
and the game's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell defeated Brown, 33-28, the previous week despite
trailing by 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Fordham will be Harvard's final nonleague game. The
Rams have lost three successive games against Ivy League opponents,
the closest result a 35-18 defeat at Penn last week.
</P>
<P>
   In other Ivy League games, Brown (2-1, 3-1) meets Rhode Island;
Columbia (0-1, 2-2) plays Penn (1-0, 2-2); Cornell (3-0, 4-0)
visits Colgate; Dartmouth (0-1, 0-4) travels to Yale (0-1, 3-1),
and Princeton (0-2, 1-3) meets Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard took the lead against Cornell behind the rushing of
Chris Menick and Chuck Nwokocha and passing of Brad Wilford.
Menick, who has gained 273 yards, is expected to lead the attack
this week. Fordham has surrendered 262 rushing yards per game and
has been outscored, 202-63.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fordham is playing extremely hard,'' Murphy said. ``Even
though they are winless, they are well-coached, and we have to
forget what their record is and play our game and continue to play
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's a fairly wide-open offense and very aggressive
defense. I think we are a good team and I'm happy with how hard we
played against Cornell. When you lose, it creates a greater sense
of urgency. We have to maximize the opportunities we have left. I
don't think we needed to be woken up. We were up by 13 points and
with a fourth-down situation against a quality team, so we had to
be doing a lot of things right.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown recovered from its loss to Cornell by defeating Princeton,
53-30, as James Perry passed for 432 yards and three touchdowns and
moved within seven completions of the career record of 613 held by
John Witkowski of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Brown leads the league in scoring and is last in defense with a
141-115 differential overall and a 106-87 differential against Ivy
opponents.

MAY YOUR E-MAIL REST IN PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suicide notes will soon be popping up all over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These aren't messages from people who don't want to live.
Actually, they're from people who don't want their messages to
live. A couple of start-up firms have come up with ways to generate
e-mail messages with a limited lifespan. After a few days, weeks or
months, the messages are transformed into unreadable gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention has centered on San Francisco-based
Disappearing Inc., largely because they picked such a cool name.
But another company, QVTech Inc. of Colorado Springs, Colo., is
rolling out a similar product.
</P>
<P>
   Both rely on encryption _ the art of using computers to scramble
messages so completely that they're virtually impossible to
unscramble, unless you have a digital key. For years, people like
me have said that the day was coming when most e-mail would be
encrypted, in order to protect our privacy.
</P>
<P>
   We're still waiting for that day, because even the best mail
encryption systems are too hard to use. Many rely on a system that
creates two separate keys _ one to encrypt messages and one to
decrypt them. Both sender and recipient must have a key, and the
same brand of encryption software as well. This makes it very hard
to send encrypted messages to total strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The new suicide mail systems use simpler but still powerful
encryption systems with just one key to worry about. Everything is
managed behind the scenes. For instance, the Disappearing system
requires the sender to add a special software plug-in to his
existing e-mail program. This program connects to a server, which
creates the key used to scramble the message.
</P>
<P>
   The recipient uses a piece of free software to decode the
message. This software goes to the Disappearing server, picks up
the key, and uses it to read the message. If somebody doesn't have
the decoding software, they can also open the message inside a Web
browser that links to a decryption server.
</P>
<P>
   So how do these messages commit suicide? Simple. They're
encrypted, and can't be read without a key. So the sender tells the
Disappearing server to discard the key after a certain date. The
message doesn't really disappear; it's just permanently reduced to
nonsense. The QVTech system, though different in detail, works on
the same principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been able to shred paper documents for a long
time,'' says Dave Marvit, co-founder of Disappearing. ``Now you can
shred e-mail documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the thing for disposing of those embarrassing e-mail
messages from Microsoft Corp. chief executive Bill Gates that
turned up years later, during the company's antitrust trial. ``I'm
sure Mr. Gates would have preferred to say, any e-mail I send you
evaporates overnight,'' says Dan Geer, former head of security at
Burlington e-commerce firm Open Market Inc., and an advisor to
QVTech.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, then, that Disappearing and QVTech think corporate
e-mail users will be their first big customers. But they also think
Internet service providers will sell it to ordinary consumers as a
premium service.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the idea goes far beyond privacy, and into a new
realm of ``e-mail sender rights.'' Today, when you send an e-mail,
it's forever beyond your control. Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the QVTech system lets you prevent the recipient
from forwarding a copy to others, or from printing out a copy. The
Disappearing system has a feature that lets you kill a message even
after it's been received. If you change your mind about that
insulting e-mail you just sent, you can go to a Web site and delete
its encryption key. The target of your insults will still get the
e-mail, but won't be able to read it.
</P>
<P>
   Sensible Internet users know that their every keystroke is
likely to be on file somewhere. Your old Usenet messages are
stashed at Deja.com, while Alexa Internet tries to archive every
single Web page. And your long-gone e-mails might still be alive,
on a backup tape at your Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure-fire defense is never to use e-mail for sensitive
communications, but that'll soon be impractical as e-commerce
sweeps the planet. Disappearing and QVTech offer the next best
thing _ e-mail with a death wish.

EUROPE IS BECOMING MORE COMPATIBILE

 ? -BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had some free time this past weekend and found a cheap air
fare, so I decided to hop on a jet and spend the weekend with my
friend Mike, who works at a large computer company in Grenobole,
France.
</P>
<P>
   Mike is an American, and he's been living the life of the
high-tech expatriate for the last four years. As with a growing
number of Americans living overseas, it's a lifestyle that's helped
out, in no small part, by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   I showed up at Mike's house with a small overnight bag and my
laptop. Although we had planned a heady weekend of fancy French
restaurants and hang-gliding, I also had a lot of work that I
needed to do. So on Saturday morning I sat down at Mike's
dining-room table, took out my laptop, and plugged the power supply
into the wall. Then I took out my Ethernet card and plugged it into
Mike's local area network.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, just blindly plugging US electrical equipment
into European sockets was a surefire recipe for disaster. That's
because France, and most other European nations, deliberately built
incompatibilities into their consumer technologies as a way to
promote national interests. Europenas use different voltages for
residential power than the States, a different television format
(more than one, in fact), and even different telephone plugs.
</P>
<P>
   For years, international travelers had to carry a collection of
transformers, plugs, and other adapters to make their US gadgets
work overseas. And travelers could forget about bringing a
videotape from the United States and showing it on a French or
British television: whereas US videotapes are mastered in the NTSC
format, France uses a video standard called SECAM, and Britain uses
a system called PAL.
</P>
<P>
   Today these intentional technical incompatibilities have largely
been overcome. My laptop, as well as Mike's desktop computer, has a
multivoltage power supply that can run on the 100-volt electricity
that is common in Japan, the 115 volts that is standard in the
United States, and the 230-volt current that dominates Europe. Mike
also has a multiformat VCR that can play videotapes in NTSC, PAL or
SECAM formats.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the Internet's engineers were never forced by their
governments to build incompatibilities into the system. had to
worry about incompatibility. From the beginning, the Internet has
stressed compatibility. The Ethernet we have in the United States
is exactly the same as the Ethernet in Europe; the RJ45 plugs are
the same; the signaling voltages on the Ethernet wires are the
same, and the protocols are the same. When I plugged in my laptop,
my computer asked Mike's computer for an Internet address, learned
the address of Mike's gateway, and put me on the Net. His ISP
connection (the equivalent of $12.50 a month for unlimited access)
gave me faster access to my e-mail on Martha's Vineyard than many
dial-ups I've used from California.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, while the Internet's designers have done a great
job building a global network, software vendors and Web site
designers in the United States still build many of their systems
for a domestic audience, not an international one.
</P>
<P>
   Consider advertising. Most Americans don't seem to mind the ads
on the Internet _ after all, banner advertisements have brought us
free Web search engines, free e-mail, and free online references.
But Mike hates banner advertisements, because he has to pay France
Telecom for the time his computer spends downloading the images.
That's because in France, as in the rest of Europe, the telephone
system has no such thing as unlimited local calling. France Telecom
charges Mike roughly $3 an hour for a call (ISDN or otherwise)
during the day, and $1 an hour evenings and weekends. Overall, his
connection to the Internet can cost $50 per month in addition to
his ISP _ and even more when he has friends like me visiting from
America and downloading huge files.
</P>
<P>
   Mike does most of his banking over the Internet, using Quicken
and his broker's Web site. He bought his copy of Quicken over the
Web and downloaded it electronically, which saved both time and
shipping. But he ran into problems when he tried to register the
program. Intuit, the publisher of Quicken, demanded that he give a
US address with a state, a five-digit ZIP-code, and a 10-digit
phone number. In Grenoble, Mike has a six-character postal code
that starts with the letter ``F'' and a nine-digit phone number
(although it does run to 10 digits, beginning with a zero, if you
dial it in France). He ended up registering the program using his
father's address back home.
</P>
<P>
   This problem isn't unique to Quicken. Many sites on the Web
require people to register before using them. Mike and other
Internet users in Europe can't help but feel offended when a Web
site demands city, state and ZIP.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is widely popular among Mike's fellow ex-pats, he
says. They use it to keep in touch with friends at home and keep up
with their hometown news. But it's less popular among the French.
When Mike's auto mechanic told him that new brake pads would cost
$120, Mike asked the man why he didn't go on the Internet and find
a better price. ``He said that the Internet is all in English, and
he doesn't read English,'' Mike told me.
</P>
<P>
   So Mike went online himself, found a Toyota dealer in the United
States that would sell him the pads for $27 plus $20 for
international shipping, and ordered a set. He had them in less than
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Things are changing, of course. For example, the hang-gliding
school where I went flying Saturday afternoon now its own Web site
which is attracting so many students that the site pays for itself.

CORPORATE FAMILY TREE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bob Sullebarger decided to have a reunion party for the
people who used to work at Cascade Communications, he put a picture
of the tree of life on the front of the invitation. Over the root
of the tree he wrote Cascade, and on the branches he put the names
of the many firms that have been created by Cascade alumni.
</P>
<P>
   Sullebarger's tree of life was the perfect metaphor. Cascade, a
Westford technology company that was sold in 1997, has given birth
to a whole new generation of local high-tech companies. Call them
``Cascade's children.''
</P>
<P>
   By our count there are at least 11 Massachusetts firms that can
trace their lineage to Cascade. The young companies have set up
shop in the towns around Westford and have gone into the same basic
business as Cascade, building state-of-the-art telecommunications
equipment. In this case, the apples didn't fall far from the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The companies are all small. They each employ 50 to 100 workers.
All have the word ``networks'' or ``communications'' in their
title. Some actually have a product for sale. In most cases, the
product is still on the drawing board. But all have great ambitions
and a desire to duplicate the success they experienced at Cascade.
</P>
<P>
   The alumni say they learned much of what they know about
technology at Cascade. But they also learned other lessons _ like
how to recruit people, build a team, and create an aura of
excitement in a fledgling company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up every day and think about what I can do to translate
that ethos to my new company,'' says Sullebarger, director of
marketing at Spring Tide Networks, a Boxborough start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Cascade was created in 1991. Desh Deshpande was one of the
founders. The following year Dan Smith was recruited to be chief
executive. The pair proved to be a winning combination. At a time
when most of the Massachusetts high-tech community was in the
dumps, they turned Cascade into a hot business. When the company
went public in the summer of 1994, its stock climbed 50 percent on
opening day. Within a few years, its market value topped $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company was in the right place at the right time. The
telecommunications industry was in the early stages of an upheaval
and Cascade made a switch that the phone companies needed.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the alumni remember other things about their Cascade
experience. ``I think the management team showed people there is a
right way and a wrong way to run one of these companies,'' says Jim
Dolce, who co-founded Redstone Communications in Westford after
leaving Cascade. Dolce sold his company to Siemens in March for
$500 million.
</P>
<P>
   What did the Cascade leadership do right? Alumni say it created
an atmosphere that inspired people to do their best work. They also
distributed stock broadly throughout the company, a common practice
now but one that was unusual at the time. One venture capitalist
estimates that 100 Cascade employees ultimately became millionaires
thanks to their stock ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Sullebarger recalls that Cascade people were encouraged to make
their own decisions, no matter where they sat in the company
hierarchy. ``It was better to ask for forgiveness than ask for
permission,'' he says. That kind of responsibility encouraged risk
taking, says Sullebarger, and may explain, in part, why so many
Cascade people have become entrepreneurs themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Ascend Communications, a California company, bought
Cascade for $3.7 billion. Disappointing earnings in early 1997
knocked down Cascade's stock price and made a deal almost
inevitable. In January 1999 Lucent Technologies bought Ascend for
$19.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Cascade made some people rich, but also sent many to
the exits. Having seen what a great start-up could do, ambitious
executives left for greener pastures. ``Cascade was a model for
people like me,'' says Bing Yang, a former Cascade engineer and one
of the founders of Convergent Networks in Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   The Cascade connection has proved valuable to would-be
entrepreneurs looking for cash to start new companies. In the world
of venture capital, success begets success. Matrix Partners, a
Waltham venture capital firm that originally invested in Cascade,
has put money into many of ``Cascade's children,'' on the theory
that Cascade's former executives have the right stuff. ``Their
track record makes the companies more backable,'' says Tim Barrows,
a general partner at Matrix.
</P>
<P>
   All of the companies have recruited former Cascade engineering
talent. Many have recruited fellow alumni as board members and
advisers to their new firms. Think of it as networking among
networking companies.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the post-Cascade companies _ Cadia, Castle Networks,
Redstone Communications, and Omnia Communications _ have already
been sold for prices that range from $150 million to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the bar may be about to be raised. Deshpande and Smith have
created a Cascade child, Sycamore Networks, that is generating
plenty of buzz in the networking community. Analysts say when the
Chelmsford company goes public _ an initial public offering is
expected in the next few weeks _ Sycamore could wind up with a
market value of more than $5 billion. None of the other Cascade
spinoffs has yet to go public.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of his fellow alumni, Yang will be watching the
Sycamore IPO with keen interest. After leaving Cascade, Yang and
some colleagues created a new company, Cadia Networks, that was
sold after just six months for $150 million. ``That was the
benchmark a few years ago,'' says Yang. ``By  &UR; today &LR; 's standards it
is peanuts.''

METHODIST GROUP OPPOSES BOY SCOUTS' BAN ON HOMOSEXUALS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An important board of the United Methodist Church has taken a
stand against the Boy Scouts' ban on gays, intensifying the rift
over homosexuality in one of the nation's biggest denominations.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodists already are deeply divided over the church
decision three years ago to punish ministers who perform holy union
ceremonies for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   The church's General Board of Church and Society, meeting in
Washington, D.C., on Sunday, voted to call on the Boy Scouts of
America to change its policy of excluding gays as members and
le
</P>
<P>
   The General Board said in a statement that the exclusion of
homosexuals from the Scouts is discriminatory and violates church
principles affirming the human rights and civil liberties of gay
people.
</P>
<P>
   Some two-thirds of the more than 75,000 Scout troops are
sponsored by churches of 31 denominations, many of which are under
pressure to treat gays equally.
</P>
<P>
   The Methodist Church provides meeting space, resources and
leadership for more Scouts than any other organization, religious
or otherwise. More than 400,000 Scouts in at least 11,000 packs and
troops meet in Methodist churches around the country, and scouting
often depends on church volunteers to serve as troop leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The General Board's vote does not change the United Methodist
Church policy on homosexuality. That is up to the church's General
Conference, a gathering of delegates from all over the country,
which meets next May in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote adds a powerful voice within the church in its
debate of its own policies toward gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The action on Sunday came in response to the Aug. 4 New Jersey
Supreme Court ruling that the Boy Scouts are illegally
discriminating by excluding gays.
</P>
<P>
   Another church group, the Commission on United Methodist Men,
already has taken the opposite stance, supporting the Boy Scouts in
their appeal of the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Shields, a Boy Scout spokesman in Irving, Texas, said of
the Methodist board's vote: ``We've got a lot of support for our
position within the United Methodist Church. It's substantial and
it's growing. We hope we can continue that relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The Methodist Church, like other major religious denominations,
is deeply split over homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   While its Social Principles call for equal treatment of gays and
lesbians, other policies prohibit homosexuals from serving as
clergy and, as of 1996, outlaw holy unions for same-sex couples.

   The lead character might be an insomniac, but ``Fight Club'' is
wide awake, and it's going to ruffle the feathers of a lot of
people who would rather their slumber remain undisturbed. It
doesn't seem likely that a movie featuring repeated scenes of men
gthe stuffing beaten out of them could work on so many
levels, but it does: emotionally, physically, viscerally and
intellectually, while providing an interesting take on Y2K
paranoia. It's also often very funny, in the most blistering ways.
</P>
<P>
   To call the nameless narrator and protagonist (Edward Norton) an
insomniac would be putting it charitably. This guy's an automaton
by day, a zombie by night. He toils at a well-paid but dull and
morally questionable job, then goes home to his condo, which he's
stocked with as much yuppie-friendly merchandise as he can handle
(this may be the first movie in which a guy gets an erotic charge
from an IKEA catalog). Then he stays up in a state of ennui-induced
catatonia, too shellshocked even to zap the infomercials off his
blaring TV.
</P>
<P>
   Our, um, hero is so desperate for connection in his disaffected
world that he begins hanging out in a variety of support groups,
where the links come automatically, and chats up strangers on
airplanes _ ``single-serving friends'' who require only temporary
effort. It's on an airplane that he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt),
a soap salesman who apparently doesn't use his own product and has
some interesting ideas about what's wrong with society. It's at a
testicular-cancer survivors' support group that the narrator meets
Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a punked-out, chain-smoking
young woman who may be his soul mate. One will bring him to the
brink, the other will keep him from jumping over.
</P>
<P>
   It's Tyler, though, who helps the narrator erase some of his
alienation by co-creating Fight Club, in which men with meaningless
and menial jobs take some control of their lives by staging
bare-knuckled bouts in which they knock one another senseless. The
object isn't so much to win as it is to feel, because pain beats
the numbness these guys experience every day. Even when they're on
the losing end, they're in control, because one of the rules of
Fight Club is that when someone says stop, you stop. One of the
problems is that Tyler, especially, doesn't know when to stop, and
the underground group starts waging a larger war on our culture.
Their enemy isn't the government; it's the corporations that
control everything.
</P>
<P>
   Judged on cinematic terms alone, ``Fight Club'' is one of the
year's best movies. Director David Fincher, who gave us the rainy
bleakness of ``Seven'' and the glitzy paranoia of ``The Game,''
continues to show his skill for creating whole other worlds that
exist inside our own. Norton, the narrator (who has given out so
many aliases that he's forgotten his own name), gives a performance
that's nothing short of amazing _ a combination of wired and
fatigued, drone and dervish, catalyst and conscience.
</P>
<P>
   As Tyler, Pitt gives his best performance in years _ maybe ever;
he's so hot-wired it's as if he stored up energy while he
sleepwalked through his roles in ``Seven Years in Tibet'' and
``Meet Joe Black.'' Carter, as Marla, finally manages to execute a
contemporary role with a tough, sad performance that might help her
escape the period-film trap she's often ensnared in. The Dust
Brothers provide a pulsing score that drives things along, and the
cinematography and editing, remnants of Fincher's music-video days,
move this lengthy film at a fast-lane clip.
</P>
<P>
   It's when your conscience enters the picture that ``Fight Club''
becomes a problem. Although I've long believed that art reflects
society's violence and not vice versa, I wondered about the movie's
copycat potential. But you'd have to be pretty nearsighted not to
see that things get worse for Norton's character as the movie goes
along. But doubtless there are people who will see the movie only
for its action and not for what it has to say. It seems destined to
inspire overreaction at the other end of the spectrum as well; it's
already being seen as an apology for fascism, although it could
just as easily be seen as a satire of it. It is interesting,
though, that the men of ``Fight Club'' are overwhelmingly white _
and not too smart _ and that one of the few guys in the movie who
doesn't fall for it is the black detective who's trying to find out
just why the narrator's condo exploded.
</P>
<P>
   Selective perception is a powerful thing, though, and people
tend to take away from movies what they want to. ``''Fight Club''''
is cannily designed to play to that; it's a movie so crammed with
ideas that it uses both sides of its mouth to express them. It's a
macho movie that becomes a male-on-male love story (it's funny to
see Pitt and Norton bicker over Pitt's driving in one scene),
that's about wusses becoming tough by beating one another up. A
movie that uses a woman to help its hero get back in touch with
himself, but all but ignores her until it needs to call her off the
bench. A movie that laughs at us for wearing Gap khakis, then
shoves its Krispy Kreme product placement in our faces so hard that
we can taste the doughnuts. An anti-consumerist movie made by a guy
who made his name with a Madonna music video, an anti-corporation
movie made for a studio owned by Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, it gets away with it, spending more than two hours
dancing on your nerve endings and leaving your senses heightened
and your adrenalin buzzing as you leave the theater. If it takes
off _ and given its enormous potential for repeat business, its
success appears guaranteed _ it will wind up being reviewed on the
editorial pages, where pundits will ignore its style and see only
part of its content. It's a movie that makes you think, though, and
stays with you for days, a refreshing sight when so many films want
to spoon-feed you. You'll be talking about it the next morning,
after you put on your Gap khakis, buy your Starbucks coffee and
step back onto your 9-to-5 treadmill.

 WASHINGTON:we have been.''

<P>
   Detroit Medical Center, a seven-hospital system affiliated with
Wayne State University, lost $106.1 million in 1998 and $93.2
million in the first seven months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Another Hunter Group client, the Detroit system in January cut
2,000 positions from its workforce of 18,600.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of so many employees has had a devastating impact on
the hospitals, according to workers and officials of Local 79 of
the Service Employees International Union, which along with another
union represents 2,800 workers there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very short staffed,'' said Deborah Clark, a housekeeper
at the center's Sinai-Grace Hospital. Because of layoffs, Clark
worked 28 straight days in August and September and now sometimes
cleans up to 27 rooms and bathrooms daily, double the pre-layoff
number.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, about 18,000 teaching hospital jobs _ eight
percent of the total in the city _ were lost between 1994 and 1998,
according to the Greater New York Hospital Association.
</P>
<P>
   A statewide study by the group found that New York's teaching
hospitals and medical colleges spend $21 billion annually and
employ over 250,000. They generate $1.85 billion in tax revenues
for New York state and $1 billion for New York City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching hospitals to New York are the same as oil wells to
Texas and silicon to California,'' said the association's
president, Kenneth Raske.
</P>
<P>
   Many large institutions have been forced to merge, including
Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital and New York Hospital in New York
City and the teaching hospitals of the University of California at
San Francisco and Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   Some universities are getting out of the hospital business.
George Washington University, which runs a medical school in
Washington, sold its hospital to Universal Health Services Inc., a
for-profit hospital chain. Other teaching institutions such as
Mount Sinai Medical Center-University Circle in Cleveland are
canceling residency programs altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for teaching hospitals say that if the cuts continue,
the hospitals might not be able to put the genie back in the
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like a light switch,'' said Cohen of the AAMC.
``You can't turn these places off and then say `Oh, we went too
far, let's turn them back on.' You lose staff, you lose the
expertise, and you lose the ability to sustain the momentum for
these very complex and important programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The AAMC is spearheading a joint lobbying effort in Congress to
support Moynihan's bill that would freeze cuts to Medicare's
Indirect Medical Education funding at current levels.
</P>
<P>
   The group is sponsoring an advertising blitz. ``If Medicare cuts
continue,'' one ad warns, ``about the only place you'll find a
teaching hospital with the latest advances in medicine will be on
`ER,''' the popular television show.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the AAMC is playing what it considers to be its
trump card: Enlisting medical school deans and hospital CEOs to
plead the case of teaching hospitals before key senators and House
members from their home states.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, A. Wallace Conerly, dean of the medical sc
the University of Mississippi Medical Center, has flown to
Washington to visit his old family friend and fellow Mississippian,
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   The AAMC has no organized political action committee, the legal
apparatus for groups and corporations collecting and disbursing
candidate donations. But its chief ally, the American Hospital
Association, is a major player in the campaign finance world. The
AHA's PAC forked over $1.07 million to candidates in the 1998
election cycle, the 12th largest amount among trade groups,
according to Federal Election Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   During the same time period, the AHA also gave $103,000 in
``soft'' money to Republican Party committees, and $64,600 to
Democrats, according to Common Cause, the campaign finance watchdog
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not chopped liver,'' said AHA vice president Richard
Pollack, the group's chief lobbyist. ``We're trying to pull as many
levers as possible. Do PACs provide access? Yes. Do they buy votes?
No.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollack said the group is investing over $10 million to get
hospitals a break out of this year's congressional budget tussle.
The effort includes the advertising campaign, flying groups of
hospital executives and employees into Washington, and making sure
the issue is publicized in key primary states such as New Hampshire
and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The AHA's lobbying effort emphasizes issues of concern to all
hospitals, not just teaching hospitals. But the two coordinate
their efforts closely along with the National Association of Public
Hospitals, the Federation of American Health Systems (which
represents for-profit hospitals) and other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Arrayed against them are a potent alliance of health system
skeptics and key members of Congress, many of them conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   In their view, teaching hospitals _ especially the larger
academic medical centers _ are dinosaurs that haven't adjusted to
the managed care era. They question whether taxpayers should
subsidize all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the questions you have to ask is does it make sense for
a single metropolitan area to have six academic medical centers?''
said Gail Wilensky, chair of the Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission, established by Congress in the Balanced Budget Act to
advise it on Medicare issues.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how much of teaching hospitals' problems stem from
Medicare cuts, and how much from managed care, said Wilensky.
Either way, she added, they have resisted market pressures that
have affected all other elements of health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teaching hospitals hired a lot of faculty and expanded
aggressively in the 1980s,'' she said. ``They haven't done very
extensive, aggressive audits (to trim waste). It's certainly very
hard to say there isn't more they could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, whose health subcommittee oversees Medicare,
characterized the typical major teaching hospital as ``a big
downtown `ER' hospital that doesn't represent the direction in
which medical care is going.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he added that he has no problem with some teaching
hospitals getting help from the government, possibly separate from
Medicare.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Already battered by the transition to
cost-conscious managed care in the 1990s, the nation's 400 premier
teaching hospitals could lose their life support if Congress fails
to restore diminishing Medicare payments, their advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   Affiliated with 125 medical college residency programs, these
hospitals are centers of cutting-edge medical research as well as
training grounds for future generations of physicians. Their
history is rich with medical breakthroughs such as organ
transplants and open-heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the largest academic teaching hospitals make up 5.5
percent of the nation's 5,000 hospitals, they host 40 percent of
the neonatal intensive care units, 53 percent of the pediatric
intensive care units and 70 percent of the burn units. They provide
44 percent of all care for the most impoverished patients.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals are at the vortex of a pitched battle in
Congress over whether to restore some of the $112 billion in
Medicare cuts that were made by the landmark Balanced Budget Act of
1997. That law was acclaimed for eliminating the federal budget
deficit for the first time since 1969. It also succeeded in halting
the rise in Medicare spending, which rose just 1.5 percent last
year, compared with 11 percent annual growth since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But it came at a price.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare provides federal health insurance to 34 million senior
citizens and five million disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress and the White House grapple over plans for federal
spending for fiscal year 2000 that began Oct. 1, they appear likely
to restore at least some of the Medicare cuts. The questions are
how big any restoration would be and which programs would benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals are not alone in seeking a Medicare
transfusion from Congress. Home health care agencies, nursing
homes, managed care health plans, and occupational, physical and
speech and hearing therapy groups all are vying for the same
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Competing priorities _ defense, agriculture and Social Security,
for instance _ make the size of any ultimate ``give back''
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   The final details are likely to be hammered out by the end of
the month.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has proposed spending $7.5 billion over 10
years on a Medicare fix. Last week, Rep. William Thomas, R-Calif.,
chairman of the House Ways &AMP; Means health subcommittee, put forward
a plan for $15 billion over five years. Also last week, Senate
Finance Chairman Sen. William Roth, R-Del., proposed spending $10
to $15 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospital advocates are pinning their hopes on
legislation introduced by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.,
which has been rolled into Roth's proposal. It would prevent
further cuts from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has become part of Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate
campaign in New York _ home to 57 teaching hospitals and 12 medical
schools, more than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   At its core, the debate over teaching hospitals is a case study
in what happens when politics and social policy collide in
Washington. It also raises broader questions over how far the
federal government should go in shoring up the U.S. medical
education system at a time when managed care is leveling health
care costs and when medical economists worry about an over-supply
of some medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have teaching hospitals, you're certainly not
going to have cutting edge state-of-the-art medicine,'' said Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., among those leading the charge on
Capitol Hill. Failure to shore up teaching hospitals will lead to
``more deaths and we'll have a sicker population,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Balanced Budget Act, the basic Medicare formula for
payments to all hospitals was cut $71 billion over a five-year
period, 1998 to 2002. Among the cuts that hit teaching hospitals
the hardest:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Indirect Medical Education,'' worth aboullion
annually, was slashed 29 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Disproportionate Share'' payments to hospitals with a heavy
caseload of the poorest patients were reduced 5 percent over five
years. Two-thirds of those payments went to teaching hospitals and
were worth $4.5 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Association of American Medical Colleges, which is urging
Congress to freeze the Medicare reductions, says about 30 percent
of teaching hospitals are now in the red. By 2002, if Congress does
nothing, 50 percent wiosing money, the AAMC says.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are huge, huge hits,'' said Dr. Jordan Cohen, the
association's president.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Medicare cuts compounded a teaching hospital financial
problem already very much in gear. Managed care plans view teaching
hospitals as overly expensive. These plans drive hard bargains in
terms of payment rates and sometimes steer patients away from major
academic medical centers altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As teaching hospitals began feeling managed care's pinch, they
came to rely more heavily on Medicare's special funding streams.
Once those began drying up last year, many hospitals faced deep
financial losses.
</P>
<P>
   Some academic medical centers have turned to the Hunter Group, a
St. Petersburg, Fla.-based consultant group for help in cutting
costs, often resulting in unpopular staff layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One Hunter client, the University of Pennsylvania Health System,
which runs four teaching hospitals in Philadelphia, lost $90
million in 1998 and expects to lose at least $150 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the gigantic hospital and medical school system with
18,000 employees eliminated 1,100 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Kelley, Pennsylvania Health System CEO, said the
hospitals were being eaten away by an ``invisible cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make it break even,'' he said. ``But we won't be the
creators of the future of medicine the way we have been.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The French melodrama ``Romance'' uses sex purely for suffering.
Its heroine, Marie (Caroline Ducey), has a blank-faced sincerity
even when she cries, which is almost all the time. She sacrifices
herself on the altar of love, to her pretty-boy corpse of a
boyfriend, a male model who's utterly uninterested in having sex
with her. Instead, she submits to a series of affairs that further
dehumanize her. She wants to turn herself into an object, prove
herself to be unworthy of any male attention, because her live-in
lover won't deal with her.
</P>
<P>
   When we meet Marie and her boyfriend, he's telling her that he
always loses interest in the women he sees. And after a few months,
he has no physical need for her. As she notices him, smiling as he
reads and eats alone at a restaurant, she realizes he's actually
happier on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Their sterile apartment _ no one capable of pleasure could
choose to live in an environment so chic and pale (it looks like
one of those Evian billboards) _ mirrors the hollowness of their
existence. And her narration, an attempt to provide rich insight
into the emptiness of her existence, sounds like a series of
position papers written by someone who's seen ``Last Tango in
Paris'' way too many times.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Romance'' itself is undergrad-ironic. There's not
much resembling romance, or even affection, in Marie's life, as she
plods from one dehumanizing liaison to the next. If the kind of
psychological degradation she puts herself through weren't so
punishing, the movie could be viewed as a parody of anti-pleasure
art-house porn like ``In the Realm of the Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the movie is pretty laughable. She takes herself so
seriously, you're not sure if she'd recognize a good time if she
stumbled over it. (Director Catherine Breillat's previous wrestling
with female sexuality, ``36 Fillette,'' was grim going, too.)
``Romance'' mistakes glum tawdriness for existential truth. All the
poking and prodding take place as Marie's bland narration _ meant
to show that she's distant from the sexual adventures, including
prostitution and rape, that she subjects herself to _ drops morsels
of philosophy that roll across the floor like ball bearings. And
``Romance'' is about as compelling. When Ducey is seen
participating in the sordid activities, you can tell it's an art
film; she never has any fun _ you may not either.

MCCARTNEY CELEBRATES ROOTS OF ROCK 'N' ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next century approaches, the Y2K problem is upon us (or
maybe not) and what is Paul McCartney doing?
</P>
<P>
   Strapping on his bass and bashing out protean rock 'n' roll and
R&AMP;B from the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   One take. Maybe two. Over and out. And on to the next song.
</P>
<P>
   Makes sense, if you ask me.
</P>
<P>
   This is how McCartney cut ``Run Devil Run,'' the new 15-song
tribute to the music that inspired him and the Beatles to pick up
the torch of American music way back when.
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in just seven days this past spring at, yep, Abbey Road
in London, ``Run Devil Run'' is one heck of a good old-old-school
rock 'n' roll record that harks back to the days when the Beatles
were young and hungry and absorbing all the Buddy Holly, Gene
Vincent, Larry Williams and Little Richard that they could find.
</P>
<P>
   As detailed in the CD's liner notes, McCartney simply picked an
oldie such as Carl Perkins' ``Movie Magg'' or Chuck Berry's ``Brown
Eyed Handsome Man'' and banged it down with the help of a backing
band that included Mick Green and Pink Floyd's David Gilmore on
guitar, keyboardists Pete Wingfield and Geraint Watkins and drummer
Ian Paice (Deep Purple) and Dave Mattacks (Jethro Tull). He did
well-known stuff, such as Rick Nelson's 1958 pop hit ``Lonesome
Town'' and Elvis' ``All Shook Up'' as well as obscurities such as
``Coquette,'' a Fats Domino B-side.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain abandon and joy in working so quickly,
learning a song and recording it all within perhaps half an hour,
and McCartney and friends have captured it. Raw, and at times
rocking very hard indeed _ check his version of ``All Shook Up''
against Elvis' _ ``Run Devil Run'' has the immediacy (and the
volume) of a set in a small, packed bar.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney was and is a great rock 'n' roll singer, and the band
performs impeccably behind him, whether it's on a raver such as
Larry Williams' ``She Said Yeah,'' or the ballads _ ``Lonesome
Town'' is darned near perfect.
</P>
<P>
   The three McCartney-penned tunes _ the title track, ``Try Not To
Cry'' and his tribute to Linda, ``What It Is'' _ are all upbeat.
None is as strong as the oldies he covers here, but then again,
several of those are among the great rock 'n' roll songs of all
time. Paul McCartney has decided to bid farewell to the old year
and ring in the new by paying tribute to his youth, and ``Run Devil
Run'' is the excellent result. You could do a lot worse for a
soundtrack for your New Year's Eve party.

 &HT;    CHINA WARNS NOBEL COMMITTEE AGAINST REWARDING POLITICAL
DISSIDENTS
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Rumors that a Chinese dissident may win the Nobel
Peace Prize Friday stirred a flurry of diplomatic warnings from
China's edgy communist government.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare governmental effort to head off a Nobel award, China
has made a series of calls to the Nobel committee in Oslo,
reportedly called in the Norwegian ambassador to complain, and
issued a stinging statement on Thursday warning against Western
aggrandizement of Chinese dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Such a Nobel award would be ``flagrant interference'' in China's
internal affairs, said Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue.
She was responding to reports that exiled dissidents Wei Jingsheng
and Wang Dan, both of whom served time in Chinese prisons for their
political activity, might win the prestigious prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these people win the prize, that is unacceptable to the
Chinese people and the Chinese government,'' Zhang said at a
ministry briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan had been sentenced to prison terms
by the judicial departments of China because of their engagement in
activities that jeopardized national security and overthrowing the
government,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now some people in Western countries have gone so far as to
nominate these people as candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize. This
constitutes a flagrant interference in China's internal affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   China is clearly nervous that the two are among possible
favorites to win the prize, which will be announced at 11 a.m.
(Oslo time) on Friday (5 a.m. EDT) at the Norwegian Nobel
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   China is especially sensitive now to such an implied critique of
its human rights policies, since this year it is touting the range
of achievements scored in 50 years of communist rule. It doesn't
want the continuing celebration tarnished by a Western anointment
of two men it
</P>
<P>
   considers domestic saboteurs of the Chinese system.
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of Oslo quoted the Nobel committee secretary as
saying he received several worried telephone calls from Chinese
officials. And Norway's foreign ministry spokesman said Chinese
officials summoned Norway's ambassador and made other contacts to
express concern, according to the Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian officials emphasize the Nobel committee is not a
government agency, but a private organization.
</P>
<P>
   China well understands the impact a Nobel peace prize can have
in generating support for a recipient's cause. After Tibet's Dalai
Lama won the Nobel prize in 1989, the crusade for Tibet's
independence from China gained new momentum with support from movie
stars and other prominent figures from Western nations, and two
movies were made about Tibet portraying China's actions there in
sinister light.
</P>
<P>
   A more formidable result came in nearby Indonesia, after East
Timorese activists Jose Ramos-Horta and Catholic Bishop Carlos Belo
won the prize in 1996. Their independence movement, not widely
known round the world, got an energy boost. Enough international
pressure was generated that Indonesia's central government called
for a self-determination vote this year. East
</P>
<P>
   Timorese overwhelmingly chose independence, and deadly violence
ensued.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The dissident Wei Jingsheng has been mentioned as a possible
peace prize recipient for each of the last six years. He spent 18
years in Chinese prisons for pro-democracy activities before being
released to exile on medical parole in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His actions since then have been considered especially damaging
here, as he has lobbied for economic sanctions and other tough
policies that would hurt China.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Dan came to prominence as a student leader during the
Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, which led to his arrest and
three-and-half years in prison. On release he continued agitating
for political reform in foreign publications and ended up spending
another three years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 he also was released for medical reasons, but from
America has conducted a more low-key campaign than Wei for change
in China. He has pressed for release of political prisoners and for
China to reassess its official stand on the events related to the
Tiananmen crackdown.

CHAMBER GROUP SEES NO LINK BETWEEN PATAKI TRIP, TOBACCO MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIELLE FURFARO and EDWARD FITZPATRICK  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The head of the Hungarian-American Chamber of
Commerce U.S.A. defended the group's sponsorship of two trips Gov.
George Pataki took to Hungary, saying she has no idea why a giant
tobacco company donated $10,000 to the chamber before each of those
visits.
</P>
<P>
   In her first extensive interview since the donations came to
light, chamber President Monika Szarka-Elling on Wednesday
dismissed questions about whether Philip Morris was trying to buy
influence with the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not privy to their strategies. We don't think about
it,'' Szarka-Elling said. ``We have a tiny chamber of commerce.
It's not up to us. Frankly, none of these issues are important to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, which often lobbies in Albany, contributed
$10,000 to the chamber one week before the governor's first trip to
Hungary, in September 1995, plus another $10,000 a few weeks before
Pataki's second trip, in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Szarka-Elling said Philip Morris had never before contributed to
the chamber, which was founded in 1992. She attributed the
donations to a mass mailing the chamber sent to companies doing
business in Hungary, including the cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't targeted them before,'' she said. ``But we were
expanding our activities and we were looking to reach out to more
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Szarka-Elling declined to say how much the trips cost the
chamber or whether the money from Philip Morris was used to pay
those costs. She said the chamber paid for the governor's plane
tickets, which were discounted as part of an agreement with the
Hungarian airline, Malev, but again she declined to give the price.
</P>
<P>
   She said she cannot understand why anyone is questioning the
sponsorship of a trade delegation by a trade organization. ``To us,
it's a non-issue,'' Szarka-Elling said.
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, legislative director of the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said the issue is whether the donations
may have violated state ethics rules. The law prohibits state
officials from directly or indirectly accepting or receiving gifts
of $75 or more from companies with business before the state if the
gifts ``could reasonably be inferred'' as attempts to influence
those officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that niggling concern about the law,'' Horner said.
``That's a powerful reason people should care.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Philip Morris, two other big corporations with business
before the state _ the PepsiCo soft drink company and the
pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb _ made donations to the
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think people who have business interests before
government should be paying for top policy-makers' trips,'' Horner
said. New York Public Interest Research Group and two other
government watchdog organizations _ the League of Women Voters and
Common Cause _ have filed a complaint, asking the State Ethics
Commission to investigate the Hungary trips.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's spokesman, Michael McKeon, emphasized the trips
did not cost the taxpayers anything, and before the visits, the
State Ethics Commission ruled that the trips would not violate
ethics rules because the chamber had no business before the state.
</P>
<P>
   Horner argued that the State Ethics Commission should now look
into whether the companies were merely funneling gifts to Pataki
through a third party. ``That's the issue,'' he said. ``Was this
really just the companies' effort to give the governor a gift and
escape scrutiny of the Ethics Commission?''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said the governor had no idea who was contributing to the
chamber and how they were paying for the trips.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether executives at Philip Morris knew about the
governor's upcoming trip when they made the donations, K. Richmond
Temple, manager of corporate communication at Philip Morris, said
Andrew Whist, former president of the tobacco giant, made the
decision to join the chamber and make the $10,000 contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no way of knowing what his intentions were,'' Temple
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whist is retired and could not be reached for comment.

</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, one of the biggest corporations in the country,
is ``very active, very vocal and very visible'' when it comes to
lobbying state officials in Albany over tobacco-related
legislation, according to Timothy Nichols, director of government
affairs for the American Lung Association of New York State.
</P>
<P>
   The donations to the chamber raise questions about how much
influence Philip Morris has had on recent tobacco legislation,
Nichols said. ``It's disturbing because so many good measures don't
become law,'' he said. ``It makes one wonder if this is all
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   McKeon said state funding for anti-tobacco initiatives has
increased by more than 400 percent since Pataki took office in
1995. That funding increased from $2 million in 1994 to $8.4
million this year. ``The governor has demonstrated an unprecedented
commitment to reducing smoking among New Yorkers,'' McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said, ``From our point of view, the tobacco industry has
been very successful in recent years in stopping effective
anti-smoking bills from becoming law.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, he said, the industry has blocked measures that
would have banned self-serve cigarette displays and increased
penalties for selling cigarettes to minors.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki visited Hungary and Italy to both explore his family's
heritage and to promote business. Szarka-Elling said that while in
Hungary, Pataki made contacts that led to the opening of a glass
manufacturing plant in Geneva, N.Y. The Guardian Industries plant
now employs 300, company officials said.

TO MANY READERS, BOSTON POST PET WAS THE CAT'S MEOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: For at least 30 years, my husband has had a picture of Hindy
the Boston Post cat. What's the history of this paper, and how did
it get this adorable cat?
</P>
<P>
   _ V.A.L., E. Templeton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Hindy was a feral cat who made its home in the Boston Post
building after World War I, said Herbert A. Kenny, author of
``Newspaper Row,'' an out-of-print book about early Boston papers.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny devotes a chapter of his book to Hindy. After first being
considered a nuisance, the cat was adopted by the city-room staff
and ``spoiled silly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they didn't have anything else to do, all the guys would
write fake stories about the cat,'' Kenny said. ``The readers went
nuts for Hindy.''
</P>
<P>
   When the paper offered to send a free picture of the cat to
readers, expecting a small response, it was overwhelmed by
thousands of requests. ``It was bedlam _ they had to hire a firm to
print them,'' Kenny said. ``At that moment, the Post had the
largest circulation of any standard-size newspaper in America _
over 300,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining circulation led to the paper's closure in 1956 after
125 years of publication.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can I contact Moxie Firecracker Films, the film company
owned by Rory Kennedy and her husband, Mark Bailey?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.T., Worcester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to the company at Moxie Firecracker, 180 Varick, Suite
1302, New York, NY 10014.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 29, the Moxie documentary film ``American Hollow'' will
air on HBO as part of the ``America Undercover'' series. The film
details the extreme poverty in rural Appalachia as Kennedy and her
crew follow a local family for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had gone down there in the 1960s,'' Rory Kennedy
said at a March showing of the film during a Housing and Urban
Development seminar. ``His experience there had a very profound
impression on him and it was something that was talked about in my
family often.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxie also has produced ``Different Moms,'' a documentary about
mentally retarded mothers that aired on Lifetime, and the AIDS
prevention film ``Fire in Our House.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was the woman who plays the mother on ``Second Heaven''
actually pregnant, and are the twins on the show her children?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.K., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Actress Catherine Hicks, who has a 6-year-old daughter named
Catie with director Kevin Yagher, was not pregnant last season.
</P>

DOCUMENTS FROM DUTCH ERA TO BE RESTORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN WECHSLER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For four hundred years, the pages of this city's
history have survived multiple fires, years in a damp ship's hold,
age, theft, neglect and hungry rats.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 12,000 fragile pages minutely describing life in Dutch
America will be cleaned and made sturdy enough to be handled by the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just wonderful,'' V. Chapman-Smith, in charge of
the New York state archives, told a news conference Wednesday.
``This is a rare opportunity for us to make sure those records will
be available.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Archives and Records Administration has received
$160,000 in grants for the work. The archives recently received an
$80,000 grant from a White House project called Save America's
Treasures. That grant was matched by the Archives Partnership
Trust, a fund-raising group for the archives.
</P>
<P>
   The documents include government council minutes, land titles,
laws and estate contents. For a historian, the faded and burned
papers provide a window to a 400-year-old past.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 25 years, the nonprofit New Netherlands Project has
been busy translating these documents into English. More than a
dozen historians and students make their way to Albany each year to
research them, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch history in the New World dates back to 1609, when Henry
Hudson, an English captain working for the Dutch, reached what is
now New York. Five years later, a trading post named Fort Nassau
was built where the Port of Albany now stands. By the mid-1650s,
this area _ then known as Beverwyck _ was a thriving town of as
many as 1,800 people, according to some historians.
</P>
<P>
   In 1664, the British took over, but many of the Dutch stayed
behind. The papers in question, originally manufactured from boiled
rags, contain historical documents dealing with all areas under
Dutch rule. They survived wagon trips between Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   During the Revolutionary War they were loaded on ships to
protect them from fire, but were then damaged by dampness and rats.
In the next century, papers were stolen and sold to collectors.
Then there were several fires, including one blaze in 1911 that
nearly totaled the state Capitol and destroyed priceless
Revolutionary War documents.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the public is rarely allowed to handle the documents
because they are so fragile. This will change. When
preservationists get their hands on the paper, they will wash it in
special chemicals and affix the pages to a medium that can be
handled.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the 17th-century handwritten documents is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a particular skill you have to acquire,'' said Charlie
Gehring of the New Netherlands Project.

<P>
   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The month begins creepily enough. Nightfall finds Scorpius the
Scorpion slithering downward into the southwestern horizon. Draco
the Dragon hangs high in the northwest, and low in the west stands
Bovtes (pronounced boo!-o-teez). The sky's eeriest props are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the celestial object most intimately connected with devils
and witches waits until mid-month to rise at nightfall, so that by
Halloween it's well up when darkness comes. It's the Pleiades.
</P>
<P>
   What? That close-knit cluster of young suns better known as the
Seven Sisters? What have they to do with sinister things?
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, everything. Halloween revolves around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Halloween, other cultures attached significance to
the Pleiades. The Brahmans of ancient India visualized those stars
as the sparks of Agni, the god of fire. In Greek legend they were
the daughters of Atlas. The Pleiades are even mentioned in the Book
of Job:
</P>
<P>
   Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
bands of Orion?
</P>
<P>
   A ``sweet influence'' is hardly scary. But some cultures
associated the Pleiades with more ominous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs, for example, linked the date when the constellation
reached its highest point, or culminated, at midnight with the end
of the world. The Aztecs believed that every 52 years, when their
365-day sun calendar and 260-day ritual calendar came into
coincidence, the possibility existed that the heavens would cease
to move and demons would fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that this catastrophe wouldn't befall the cosmos? When
the Pleiades reached their zenith at midnight (almost straight
overhead in Mexico City) and then continued harmlessly across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztec ceremony associated with this event involved a human
sacrifice. That's certainly creepy but has nothing to do with
Halloween. For that, we must look to the Celts.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe Halloween is the modern-day remnant of a
Celtic celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the
Celtic year and the transition from summer to winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Celts believed that during Samhain, the border between this
world and the supernatural world cracked open, granting free
passage to sinister fairies from the land of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Samhain fell at the midpoint between the autumnal equinox and
the winter solstice, and the Celts originally knew when that was
because it took place at the same time that _ you guessed it _ the
Pleiades culminated at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition, developed in the Middle Ages, of the Witches'
Sabbath on Oct. 31 is probably rooted in the old Celtic observance.
That date was upheld into modern times as All Hallows' Eve, which
became, of course, Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Now is your chance to get closer to the power behind the goblins
and mischief of October's final night. The Pleiades are striking to
the unaided eye, but they become stunning through binoculars.
Instantly the six to 11 naked-eye stars grow to hundreds of
sapphire jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy clubs periodically hold observing nights for the
public. Perhaps some will set up instruments on Halloween, so
families _ already outdoors on their diabolic rounds _ can bravely
meet October's ghostly apparitions face-to-face.

MATTERS OF SEX AND DEATH: PLAYWRIGHT MICHAEL CRISTOFER STEPS BEHIND
THE CAMERA

 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Michael Cristofer is a long way from Broadway.
 &HT;    The Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ``The Shadow Box'' (1978),
which subsequently became an award-winning television movie in
l980, directed by Paul Newman and starring Joanne Woodward, has
split his time between Hollywood and New York ever since.
 &HT;    If you don't think of him as a screenwriter, that's
understandable. He wrote ``The Witches of Eastwick'' (l987) and
co-scripted Brian De Palma's legendarily disastrous ``The Bonfire
of the Vanities'' (l990). But most of his script work, while it
earned him millions of dollars, never made it onto the screen.
 &HT;    It was frustration over a long string of abortive movies that
led Cristofer to try a new career in 1998, when he directed
Angelina Jolie in the award-winning ``Gia,'' an HBO movie about the
short, sad life of the drug-addicted supermodel.
 &HT;    Having enjoyed the experience, Cristofer is now venturing onto
the big screen, as director of ``Body Shots,'' opening on Oct. 22.
 &HT;    Not necessarily what you'd expect from a Pulitzer-winning
playwright, ``Body Shots'' is a 20-something saga about the
tormented, sex-soaked relationships of four gorgeous women and
their equally handsome male partners amid the often-tawdry world of
disco Los Angeles. It's a darker take on the same world covered by
HBO's comedic ``Sex and the City,'' with a bunch of privileged but
lonely people drowning themselves in booze in search of intimacy,
sex and maybe even love.
 &HT;    The cast includes a bunch of-up and-coming young actors, none of
them household names _ Amanda Peet, Sybil Temchen, Tara Reid and
Emily Proctor are the women, with Sean Patrick Flanery, Jerry
O'Connell, Ron Livingston and Brad Rowe as the men.
 &HT;    ``When I first read the script I turned it down _ I thought it
was a generational thing,'' the 49-year-old Cristofer says.
``Although I had strong opinions about it, I thought if they wanted
a kid movie they should get a kid to direct it.''
 &HT;    Coincidentally, however, he had been collecting interviews of
people talking about sex for an HBO special, which he'd dropped in
order to do ``Gia.''
 &HT;    ``I thought of adding elements of those interviews to the script
I'd read, and suddenly they sounded different,'' he says. ``I was
inside them a little more. I felt this sense of desperation behind
their behavior.''
 &HT;    Essentially, he says, the film depicts an end-of-the-century
emotional wasteland.
 &HT;    ``It's about people who feel they should connect sexually in a
desperate attempt to connect intimately in a period extending into
a new, post-AIDS era,'' the director says. ``This absence of
intimacy in their lives, however, is brutal.''
 &HT;    With thinning hair, slightly silvered at the edges, wearing a
gray suit, open-necked shirt and sensible brown brogues, Cristofer
sits in his suite in a Beverly Hills hotel and explains that it was
disillusionment with the New York stage that drove him back to
movies, and disillusionment with the Hollywood movie that led him
to directing.
 &HT;    Born in New Jersey, Cristofer once toyed with the idea of
becoming a priest. Instead he became an actor, and was appearing in
``The Cherry Orchard'' on Broadway opposite Meryl Streep when ``The
Shadow Box'' opened on the Great White Way.
 &HT;    ``I was very lucky,'' he says. ``It was all a bit of a fairy
tale for me. I thought it would be that way every year from then
on.''
 &HT;    It wasn't. His later plays, including the controversial ``Ice,''
have failed to find so large an audience, so he was ready for
something new when he got a call from Jack Clayton, veteran
director of ``Room at the Top'' (l959) and ``The Great Gatsby''
(l974).
 &HT;    ``Jack Clayton, one of the all-time-great directors, pulled me
out of New York and said, `Come write a screenplay for me,'''
Cristofer recalls. ``I had no idea what a screenplay was. In London
he used to sit there with a bottle of brandy in one hand and a
pistol in the other ... and get pages out of me every day. And he
taught me how to write a screenplay.''
 &HT;    The 1980s were a good time to look westward, the playwright
says.
 &HT;    ``Broadway was failing in terms of new plays,'' he explains.
``When `Shadow Box' was on Broadway, the Tony nominations were six
plays _ all of them American. You don't find that anymore. The
whole Broadway scene has faded badly. It's become commercial and
crass, like Hollywood.
 &HT;    ``So I kept bringing a new play into New York every few years
and subsidizing this filthy habit by writing screenplays,'' he
says. ``Then gradually I shifted over to films.''
 &HT;    He found, however, that he'd simply traded one set of
frustrations for another.
 &HT;    ``I was earning more money than I'd ever earned in my life,'' he
says, ``and never got a picture made. I was furious and living with
anger about that. The frustration was immense _ two or three years
on projects, with big directors like Paul Verhoeven, earning over a
million a year, but the picture was not done. Huge salaries, and
nobody's making a movie.''
 &HT;    As a result, he says, his interest as a director lies not in the
megabudget ``event picture,'' but in reasonably priced films which
have more of a chance of actually getting made.
 &HT;    ``I think the whole business is skewed,'' Cristofer says.
``You're working with all these $20 million babies we've created,
and they have far too much power and not enough intelligence to
really be in those kind of power positions. I don't want to make
movies with them, because you really just serve their egos and
their ideas about how to make a movie and what it should be about.
 &HT;    ``There are really fine actors who are in their 30s, 40s and 50s
who are not that kind of star.''
 &HT;    Next up for Cristofer is a reteaming with Jolie for ``Dancing in
the Dark,'' a period movie about sexual obsession.
 &HT;    ``It's considered risky by Hollywood,'' he says sarcastically,
``because it takes place before the '70s. That makes it a period
piece and they're terrified of those.
 &HT;    ``They don't realize that the last two Oscar-winning pictures,
`Shakespeare in Love' and `Titanic,' were period films,'' he says
with an air of resignation. ``The perception is that period
pictures means it will eliminate a good share of the movie-going
market and nobody will go see it.''
 &HT;    At his age, Cristofer says, he's not interested in most of the
things that contemporary films are usually about.
 &HT;    ``If I'd started directing when I was younger,'' he says, ``I
would have pursued a lot of different areas. From writing for the
stage and film it's come down to two subjects for me: sex and
death.''
 &HT;    He pauses.
 &HT;    ``Why does everyone laugh when I say that?'' he says with mock
irritation. ``Those are the subjects I'm most interested in
exploring.''
 &HT;    And indeed, both ``Gia'' and ``Body Shots'' reflect those
preoccupations.
 &HT;    But Cristofer had better watch his step _ exploring the subject
of sex, especially where young, attractive characters are
concerned, is a good way to end up commercial in spite of himself.

SMALL CANCER SURGERY ON THE FACE LEADS TO BIG SHOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If I had to pick a low point, it would be Day
Two when I took off the bandages and realized I looked like one of
the horribly deformed pig people in a classic TV episode of the
``Twilight Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   (Remember the shocker where the ``abnormal'' plastic surgery
patient turns out to be gorgeous and _ whoa! _ all the
``attractive'' doctors and nurses have pig-like faces that look as
if they've been smashed by steamrollers?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Who,'' I asked myself ``would ever go through something like
this if they didn't absolutely have to?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' was the bruised and swollen aftermath of some
relatively minor facial surgery. No, not for wrinkles or age spots.
It was for the real epidermal bummer among an aging Baby Boom
population: skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 1 million Americans were diagnosed with some form of
skin cancer. The odds are that one in seven will develop the
disease, and that 90 percent of the cancers will be facial.
</P>
<P>
   Mine was a tiny basal cell carcinoma, the mildest and most
easily treated type of skin cancer. But, hey, it's still cancer,
which means some form of slash-and-burn to treat it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the little spot was just below my nose _ and because my
primary care physician asked sooo nicely _ my HMO approved a
refined form of slash-and-burn called ``Mohs.''
</P>
<P>
   Named after the University of Wisconsin surgery professor who
invented it four decades ago, Dr. Frederic Mohs, the procedure is
also known as ``microscopic controlled excision.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike run-of-the-mill skin cancer removal, which often
resembles home carpentry (measure twice, cut once), Mohs requires a
specially trained dermatologist and lots of time. With the aid of
microscopes, dyes and tissue-freezing technology, the doc goes
after the tumor in painstaking, minute fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Because Mohs is so precise, it is tedious and time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   But it has two big things going for it: Surgeons get to minimize
the amount of mess they must make, so the patient ends up with a
kinder, gentler scar. More important, Mohs has a 97-99 percent cure
rate. In standard skin cancer removal, tumors return 30-to-50
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   The downside: Even microscopic, precise surgery is no day at the
beach for skin that is as sensitive as facial skin. Thus, after
more than four hours of injections, slicing, dicing, cauterization
and one very careful stitch-up, I looked like a pig person.
</P>
<P>
   My response to temporary disfigurement was to hide out in my
house for five days. The physical pain was inconsequential; a
couple of regular Tylenol pills knocked it out. But I could not _
you should excuse the term _ face the merciless stares of strangers
and that predictable but irritating query from acquaintances:
``What in the world did you do to yourself?''
</P>
<P>
   An editor pal, who had Mohs done the same week on his cheek,
made me feel like a wimp. Despite a black eye and mounds of
bandages, he not only showed up at the office, he addressed a
public gathering of 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   When I mentioned this difference to another friend _ a guy who
sports more than his share of scars _ he told me not to feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a man isn't always the greatest thing,'' he said. ``We
die earlier and do some really stupid stuff. But there ARE two
things about beingthat are undeniably an advantage: You can
pee standing up and, the more maimed you are in public, the better
everybody thinks you look. It's not the same for women.''
</P>
<P>
   That wisdom, and a reduction in the swelling have lifted my
spirits. Besides, when I went in the other day to have the stitches
taken out, I got a look at the Polaroid they shot after the tumor
was removed but before the doc did his magic sewing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the visible part of the cancer had been just a little
bigger than the head of a pin, the hole left from excavating the
entire thing was the size of a contact lens.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Mohs, and a fine doc, the scar I'll have will be a
wisp.
</P>
<P>
   If only the pig people had been so lucky.

SUBVERSIVE `FIGHT CLUB' IS A BRUISING LOOK AT BASER INSTINCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The role of the male in our society and culture has come under
tremendous scrutiny lately. There has been a cover story in
Harper's, a book called ``Stiffed: The Politics of Confrontation''
by feminist Susan Faludi, and pieces in Newsweek and other
magazines and newspapers that dare to trespass into that forbidden
zone of the physical, primal and primitive world of noble savages
called men; traits that have, according to these authors, slowly
been wrung from the masculine gender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' brilliantly explores this secret territory. It
assaults us with violence, brutality, sexual confusion and anarchy
and has enough bruising, punishing humor to keep us laughing with
relief. In this initially ultra-civilized realm of corporate
conformity and control, the film's narrator, played by Edward
Norton, is introduced. He calls his existence ``oblivion, dark and
silent and deep.'' Chuck Palahniuk, upon whose novel the film is
based, is quoted as saying ``we've become a nation of physical
animals who have forgotten how much we enjoy being that.''
</P>
<P>
   Director David Fincher (``Alien 3,'' ``Seven''), with his dark,
brooding eye, revels and lolls in that covert netherworld that
boasts ``it's only after we've lost everything that we're free to
do anything.'' Indeed for the narrator, an insomniac chained to his
job, who must attend meetings for guys with testicular cancer and
addicts of every kind who are in worse shape than he is, in order
to sleep, the prospect of liberation seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Until he meets the charismatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on one
of his many job-related ``single serving member'' flights. Tyler
allows his new friend to move in after the narrator's beloved
IKEA-shrine of a condominium is mysteriously blown to bits by
arson. Relocating provokes spectacular changes in this
mild-mannered, diligent worker ant. With Tyler as his guide _ and
Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a ``tourist'' he met at his addict's
groups as his antagonistic sexual itch (``If I had a tumor,'' he
says, ``I would name it Marla''), the Fight Club is birthed. It's a
place for men to choreograph and perform their most elegant, bloody
and private ballet (``First rule of fight club is don't talk about
Fight Club'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' is a difficult film to describe because it has
layers of conscious and unconscious sedition beneath its gritty,
elegantly dirty surface. It's a dangerously seductive and
subversive work that, in its messianic intensity and insanity,
speaks volumes about the way we live, the material things we think
will make us happy and the denial of our baser instincts which
ultimately cripples us and makes us ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' confirms Edward Norton's ascent into the pantheon
of actors like Robert DeNiro and Robert Duvall. He is not only
lithe, agile, accessible and volatile, he disappears into his
characters and makes them both scary and sympathetic. While Brad
Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter ignite onscreen as well, it's
Norton's movie all the way. He gambles everything to inhabit a
character who is ignorant of his real nature and who must find
balance between his split selves or self-destruct.
</P>
<P>
   Fight Club. Directed by David Fincher. Written by Jim Uhls.
Cast: Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter. 20th Century
Fox. 145 minutes. Rated R for violence, language, sexual content.

HEALTH WORKERS TRY TO CRACK CULTURAL BARRIERS TO BREAST EXAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The young Hispanic mother was stricken with
breast cancer, and although she had access to good health care, she
initially turned down treatment because her husband could not stand
the idea of his wife being examined by a male doctor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time her family angrily pressured him into letting the
woman get help, it was too late. About a month after getting
treatment, she died at age 38, leaving behind four young children.
</P>
<P>
   The anecdote points up the struggles in reaching out to
minorities of all kinds, many of whom have cultural roadblocks that
prevent them from seeking both preventive care and medical
treatment for breast cancer. The cultural divide cuts across an
array of ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   But by using creative approaches that have proved to be
successful in a medical profession still male- and white-dominated,
traditionally ignored groups are slowly responding to outreach.
</P>
<P>
   A conference at the University of California at San Francisco on
ways to prevent and treat breast cancer by integrating Western
medicine with traditional healing practices will emphasize
inclusion of underserved minorities.
</P>
<P>
   One way doctors are successfully reaching out to minorities is
by using the lay community for door-to-door programs that both
contact women directly and provide medical professionals with
sensitive approaches to cultural issues.
</P>
<P>
   One of the groups attending Saturday's conference is Companeras
En Accion, a federally funded organization that helps recruit and
train health advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The advisers tend to be of the same ethnic origin as the groups
they are targeting and often are empathetic to the cultural
differences and barriers that prevent them from getting the help
they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women who give education classes on breast cancer go over the
myths,'' said Claudia Sandoval, who works with the San Diego-based
Companeras, which started out targeting Hispanic women but has
since expanded to other minorities. ``A lot of (Hispanic) men say,
`I don't want my wife to be seen by another man,' that kind of
machismo thing. We're telling them you need to get away from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   From women whose culture dictates modesty, it also may be hard
to face examination, Sandoval said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tell them you have to change that attitude,'' she said.
``Would you rather be embarrassed or dead?''
</P>
<P>
   Irene Lopez, who coordinates the educators, said many educators
have experienced the same cultural barriers as the women they
teach. Because of that women tend to trust them more than
establishment doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gain their trust and confidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said language is another ongoing barrier because although
interest is expressed in reaching out to minorities, most
information is still in English.
</P>
<P>
   To combat that, Stephen McPhee, a UC-San Francisco professor of
medicine, and his colleagues waged an all-out media campaign in
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've been able to show that it just takes targeted
education and using language and role models, as well as culturally
appropriate methods. You have to respect the culture of the
women,'' McPhee said.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Jenkins, a breast cancer survivor and outreach worker in
Southern California, found that African-American women felt fearful
of screenings and exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fear of the unknown. What they don't know they don't want
to know,'' said Jenkins, who turns 60 in December, and was stricken
with breast cancer at age 36.
</P>
<P>
   She tells women not to be afraid, and that her early discovery
of a breast lump ultimately saved her life. She also tells them
that any relationship that's lost over breasts wasn't worth having
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   And she tells them how glad she is that she got to raise her
three children, hoping her experience will permeate any cultural
barriers women might face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I wanted out of the deal: to live and raise my
children,'' Jenkins said.

DESPITE STAR POWER, `STORY OF US' DISAPPOINTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   That complex and high-maintenance state of mind called marriage
is comedically, often cloyingly _ and not near cynically enough _
examined in Rob Reiner's newest feel-good film, ``The Story of
Us.'' Reiner has directed equally clean-cut cinematic excursions
into the workings of the human heart in ``When Harry Met Sally''
and the much better ``The American President,'' which at least had
some subtextual depth, dimension and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's its short running time but ``The Story of Us''
doesn't delve very deeply into the emotional mayhem that reigns _
and is ruining _ the 15-year relationship between Ben (Bruce
Willis) and Katie (Michelle Pfeiffer) Jordan. They have a great
house, two perfect children, jobs to die for and the requisite
``best friends'' with whom they discuss their wedded woes.
</P>
<P>
   So why is this once-blissful world falling apart? This is the
family who plays together and each evening at the dinner table,
blurts out the highs and lows of each members' day. In ``The Story
of Us'' the culprit is the tics and quirks and personality traits
that initially brought Ben and Katie together in the first place
but which have built up over the years into a maelstrom of anger,
silence and mis-communication.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner uses the device of the actors talking to the screen (much
like Woody Allen utilized in his more abrasive story of marriage,
``Husbands and Wives'') and looks at Ben and Katie's life through
flashbacks and thoughts after they have separated. But Reiner never
strives for much more than platitudes, nifty one-liners and surface
skimming in telling us about the journey Ben and Katie have made
together _ and apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all illusions,'' remarks one friend to Ben about
marriage. And indeed, ``The Story of Us'' is mostly illusion as
well. It may be that there is humor in pathos, tragedy and sadness
after a certain amount of time has passed, but while Reiner
purports to reveal truths about relationships in general, it's
almost as if he's afraid to look at this couple's darkest interior
and their real disenchantment, disappointment and dismay.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately this ``tell me, not show me'' movie works as a
crowd-pleaser but dissipates into an easy, accessible ending sure
to make couples go home feeling happy because they've just seen
gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer and cool Bruce Willis go through the
same carping and picking that they have. But in truth, these
star-powered actors never really strike many sparks together (and
in fairness the script doesn't really give them the opportunity)
though each is affecting in individual scenes.
</P>
<P>
   What starts as an energetic, vitriolic joust between spouses
inevitably winds up a low energy, contrived film that tidily ties
up its loose ends, makes so few waves and has so little insight
into how tough relationships are that I scratched my head in wonder
as to why this pair of one-dimensional characters couldn't find
happiness in such a shallow story.
</P>
<P>
   The Story of Us. Directed by Rob Reiner. Written by Alan
Zweibel, Jessie Nelson. Cast: Bruce Willis, Michelle Pfeiffer.
Universal Pictures. 92 minutes. Rated R for language, sexual
content.

 &HT;    WRITING ATLANTA'S NIGHTMARE
 &HT;    Morrison and Bambara's literary friendship leads to posthumous
publication of novel on child murders
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 17
 &HT;    By Valerie Boyd
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toni Morrison had a problem. She was editing her late friend
Toni Cade Bambara's masterwork _ a challenging novel set in
Atlanta. But she was missing something.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Bambara's death in 1995, Morrison, along with
Bambara's daughter, decided to publish ``Those Bones Are Not My
Child,'' the novel Bambara had worked on for 12 years. Morrison was
delighted to find ``this huge thing of well-typed stuff,'' she
recalls in a phone interview from her home on New York's Hudson
River. No illegible paper-clipped notes to decipher. No ``penciled
sentences that curl up and down the page and wind around.'' A
former editor at Random House, Morrison wasn't even daunted by the
manuscript's 1,800 pages.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was, a page was missing _ the first page.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can fudge a lot as an editor,'' Morrison says, ``but you
cannot fudge the first page.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison had always admired Bambara's ``extraordinary wit,'' she
says. ``So I just thought, `What kind of trick is she pulling on
me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Bambara's daughter, Karma Bene Bambara, and to friends
and associates yielded nothing. After about eight months of
desperately seeking the first page, Morrison recalls, she resorted
to the things that had sustained her friendship with Bambara for
nearly a quarter-century: talk and laughter. Though Bambara was no
longer physically present to answer, Morrison asked her for help:
``I said, `Toni, puuh-leeeaz, what is this about?'''
</P>
<P>
   A short while later, Morrison was rooting through old boxes and
file cabinets at her home. Though she'd lost a devastating amount
of material in a 1993 fire, Morrison was amazed to find an early
version of Bambara's book in progress. ``It was not even a
version,'' she says. ``It was just 50 pages, but it included the
first page,'' she says, her easy laughter rumbling through the
phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   With that problem solved, Morrison got down to the arduous
business of cutting the massive manuscript to a more manageable _
and more commercially sellable _ size. That task presented its own
problem: Morrison was ``seduced'' by Bambara's writing. ``I'd get
caught up in it,'' she explains, ``which is a marvelous sign of the
power a book has. But at the same time, you're not doing your work,
which is to look at it with a surgeon's eye, or to look at it
coldly and be unimpressed, unseduced. If you start loving it,
you're not gonna cut it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having sold Pantheon on the idea of publishing the book _ with
all money going to Bambara's daughter _ Morrison asked for an
in-house copy editor to read the book and to make initial
corrections and cutting suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   Then Morrison took up her red pen again. Cutting Bambara's
writing must be done ``in an elegant way,'' Morrison says, because
``she's very, very intricate, and almost cunning, in her
structure.'' One excised sentence could unravel a crucial thread in
the story. Yet Morrison, the author of seven novels of her own
(``Paradise,'' ``Beloved'' and ``Sula'' among them), managed to
edit Bambara's book rather seamlessly. The reader never gets the
sense that Morrison's distinct voice is intruding on the narrative.
Always, Bambara's voice is telling this story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to say that I'm very good at that,'' says Morrison, who
teaches at Princeton. ``Editing is, I suppose, like teaching in a
way, because you really are trying to make certain that the
author's voice is clear and it's what the author wants, what the
text is demanding _ in that style, in that fashion. What would this
author say if she had her lifetime to do this? How would she say
it?''
</P>
<P>
   In editing ``Those Bones,'' Morrison carefully read the novel
more than a dozen times. ``Every time I read it,'' she says, ``I
felt better, even though I had looked into those terrible, dark
places.''
</P>
<P>
   Those places are the very ones where terror skulked in the late
1970s and early '80s, when more than 40 black children were
murdered in Atlanta, then marketing itself as ``The City Too Busy
To Hate.''
</P>
<P>
   A riveting fusion of fact and fiction, ``Those Bones'' begins on
a Sunday in July 1980, when Zala Spencer discovers that her oldest
child, Sonny, has not come home from a Boys' Club trip. At first,
she believes her 14-year-old is pulling some kind of defiant act.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played her. He depended on her fear being stronger than
anger,'' Bambara writes from inside Zala's head. ``So he could come
home when he got good and ready, saunter in, the crooked grin, that
chipped tooth in front a prize he would flash. And she, relieved,
would let him outtalk her. But she was not going for it, not
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, Zala and her estranged husband, Spence, a Vietnam
War veteran, are frantically searching for their son. Meanwhile,
their younger children, 9-year-old Kofi and 7-year-old Kenti,
helplessly witness their family's implosion.
</P>
<P>
   Listen as Bambara writes from the perspective of the little girl
lamenting the loss of normalcy:
</P>
<P>
   ``All week Kenti had been waiting for Sunday. She wanted her
ruffled petticoat pulled down over her head. She wanted to lean her
back against Mama's chest and step into her good dress noisy with
starch and warm from the iron. She wanted to stand up in big
people's church and give the lesson from her Sunday-school group.
... Every time they were supposed to go somewhere, Mama would pull
the stop bell before they got there. And they'd have to get off the
bus and trot after her while she tacked up Sonny's picture on a
pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a multilayered portrayal of black life is rare in American
literature, Morrison notes. ``There's the negative image and then
there's the positive image, and neither one holds anything that is
like a complicated, interesting black life.'' Eliciting such
complexity from her characters, however, was one of Bambara's
strong suits. ``She loathed, as I do, the sort of simplistic
reduction of black people,'' Morrison says. ``And she loathed, as I
do, that notion that all black people are good, and everybody can
eat off their grandmother's floor.''
</P>
<P>
   When you read Bambara's fiction, Morrison says, you see real
black people, in all their courage, confusion _ and complexity. As
Morrison puts it: ``You laugh, you weep, you disagree, but you
recognize.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Morrison says, ``you want to slap Zala because she's
not paying attention to her kids, but you understand this is what
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Spencer family is fictional, their story, Morrison
points out, ``has got to rest on publicly verifiable information.
Otherwise, it doesn't work.'' Thus, many Atlanta landmarks _
MARTA's Five Points station, Paschal's restaurant, Bowen Homes _
are important settings in the novel. Likewise, some of the book's
supporting characters come straight from the headlines of the '80s:
Atlanta's then-Police Chief Eldrin Bell and former Mayor Maynard
Jackson even make appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And, despite its horrific subject matter, ``Those Bones'' is
rife with unexpected, often irreverent, humor. Here's how Bambara
describes Jackson, as he prepares to address a crowd of black
residents:
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Himself, the Mayor, Big M, ... the Chief, the
Silver-Tongued Emperor who knew just how to enliven dull newsprint,
telling the good ole boys of big biznis to kiss his royal yellow
behind while he ushered in the Second Reconstruction. And yeah,
sure, people reminded each other, he'd messed up on occasion, the
man's human and give me a break, like his handling of the garbage
workers' strike, yeah, yeah, but chalk that up to that diet Dick
Gregory put him on without adding the postscript that in case of
emergency brainwork to grab a fish sammich. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the novel, Bambara glides in and out of the
vernacular, the novel's language shifting subtly to suit each
character's perspective. ``Her ear is flawless, her instincts, her
observations _ she really can go there,'' Morrison says. ``And you
know it's not even a question of authenticity. It's just right.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, a Nobel laureate and a Pulitzer Prize winner, met Toni
Cade Bambara in the early 1970s, while Morrison was working as an
editor at Random House and actively looking to publish black female
authors. Bambara _ who had edited a groundbreaking 1970 anthology,
``The Black Woman'' _ strode into Morrison's office and engaged her
in a ``very funny, fun, interesting conversation.'' Soon, Morrison
remembers, Bambara ``turned in these stories which were amazing to
me. They were so sophisticated, so far beyond the kind of
literature that was being published at that time. It wasn't
harangue, you know. It was beautifully political without being
pedestrian.''
</P>
<P>
   With Morrison as her editor, Bambara became the critically
acclaimed author of two short-story collections, ``Gorilla, My
Love'' and ``The Seabirds Are Still Alive.'' In 1980, she published
a novel, ``The Salt Eaters,'' which Morrison calls ``a brilliant,
magical work.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison laughingly recounts the ``editorial meetings'' she and
her friend had while conjuring ``The Salt Eaters.'' Morrison had
just moved into her home on the Hudson when Bambara came to visit _
and to write _ for several days while Morrison unpacked. ``It was
total chaos. She would go upstairs and work, then she'd run down
the stairs and say, `What about this?''' Morrison recalls. ``Then I
would sit down and go over that, then she'd run back up the stairs.
It was the most amazing _ but certainly extremely efficient _ way
to do it, because she was so clear. She could focus in immediately.
I would just have to grunt and point and she knew exactly what I
was suggesting.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Bambara, also a documentary filmmaker, was living
in Atlanta _ partially at the suggestion of a seer who had advised
her that Atlanta was part of her destiny, Morrison says.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I lived in Atlanta, I was a community scribe,'' Bambara
recalled in the early 1990s. ``People in the neighborhood would
knock on my door. `You the writin' lady? Listen, the telephone
company has screwed me again. Can you write a nasty letter?' Then
they would pay me with Jell-O with fruit in it,'' Bambara said in
an interview published posthumously in ``Deep Sightings and Rescue
Missions,'' a 1996 collection of Bambara's work that Morrison also
edited.
</P>
<P>
   Like that book, ``Those Bones Are Not My Child'' did not have
the benefit of a series of meetings between Bambara and Morrison.
There were ``no hilarious title struggles,'' as Morrison puts it.
No ``cloaked suggestions for ways to highlight, to foreground.'' No
``trips uptown for fried fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison left her editing job at Random House more than a decade
ago, but she still felt it was her duty to make sure her friend's
``magnum opus'' was published. ``I know that was my work, and I
know she gave it to me, and I know she wanted me to do it. That I
know. ... I didn't really have to ask her. It was as clear as
daylight to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison doesn't expect ``Those Bones'' to receive the same kind
of criticism that met recent posthumous publications of novels by
Ralph Ellison and Ernest Hemingway. Unlike those authors' works,
Morrison says, Bambara's novel wasn't culled from partial
manuscripts. ``Toni's book had its own shape _ its beginning, its
middle and its end. It had everything. It was just too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morrison is concerned about the book finding a
substantial readership, given its difficult subject matter. ``Most
people read not to confront anything like that, but to escape,''
she points out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, though the novel is haunting, it's ultimately not a downer.
Bambara ``did not want, and never did want, any of her work to end
in despair,'' Morrison explains. ``That was extremely important to
her. She wanted not just survival at the end of her work, but kind
of a refreshment at the same time.'' Amazingly, she manages to
achieve that, even in a book that looks unblinkingly at the Atlanta
child murders.
</P>
<P>
   That achievement is a testament to her friend's
``wide-spiritedness,'' Morrison says, and to her absolute
commitment to giving black people voice in ``stories that save our
lives,'' as Bambara herself put it.
</P>
<P>
   Says Morrison: ``Her respect and her love and her seriousness
about us is so overwhelming and is so irresistible that she brings
you up to her level. She never plays down. If the reader wants to
be played down to, he should read something else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Bones Are Not My Child,'' Morrison says, ``is as large
as the events that took place'' in Atlanta during the
missing-and-murdered siege. ``And I thought, `If this book is not
published, that whole period would just be a little anecdote in the
history of the country.' But now it's not.''

 &HT;    Famous critic finds meaning in friend's death
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``We were getting calls from people hundreds of miles
away, people who couldn't even pronounce his name,'' Emory's
(University) Claire Nouvet said moments before he would walk
unassumingly from the wings and begin to speak. ``We even got
e-mails from New Zealand.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not every day that star power is given to a philosopher,
but this was Jacques Derrida, pied piper of literary criticism for
20 years or more, enfant terrible of the strange phenomenon known
as deconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The name (pronounced dairy-DAH) ignites impassioned dispute and
dismissive parody. There is scarcely a corner in the humanities,
notably literary criticism, that hasn't been touched, and in some
cases redefined, by Derrida and the analytical technique known as
deconstruction. Within literary studies, deconstruction has lost
ground over the past decade, but it has found a footing in such
disparate undertakings as architecture and anthropology, law and
psychoanalysis, public education and decision-making in business.
Even everyday speech and popular culture have picked it up: Woody
Allen deconstructed Harry, a blues magazine refers to
deconstructive techniques of guitar playing, people are commonly
said to be ``marginalized'' _ echoes, in each instance, of Jacques
Derrida.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-nine years old, born and reared in French Algeria, living
now in Paris, Derrida came to Atlanta recently to give the keynote
lecture at Emory University's International Symposium on
Jean-Francois Lyotard, professor of philosophy and French at Emory
before his death in April 1998. They were old friends, and Derrida
made it a point that he had come not to be interviewed but to honor
Lyotard, a pioneer in postmodernism.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there was no mistaking the singularity of Derrida's
presence. Tan in a way that suggested his Mediterranean origins, he
cut a striking figure, a healthy head of snow-white hair atop a
handsomely chiseled face. We tend to think of philosophers as dour
pedants, an unfortunate caricature drawn from prints of G.W.F.
Hegel or Immanuel Kant. Granted, not many resemble Billy Crystal or
Michael J. Fox. But Derrida, in a photo from half a lifetime ago,
has the cool rebellious air of James Dean in that famous
windbreaker shot.
</P>
<P>
   Derrida is nothing if not a rebel, although what precisely his
cause might be is less than clear. He was never taken seriously in
philosophy and found his flock instead in the English department,
which was ready for whatever Jim Jones came along. Derrida not only
had charisma but he wrote impenetrably, and the two could not be
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   By deconstruction, Derrida and his disciples refer to
disassembling surface features _ language, for example _ to reveal
what is below. It might be customary to write that ``deconstruction
means ...'' But that is just the point: We assume a ``text'' (the
obligatory term for literary critics) has one meaning or a
hierarchical set of meanings, which can be arrived at by reason.
But in fact, according to deconstruction, a close parsing of the
words reveals not just -- meaning but multiple meanings, some
contradicting others.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s and '80s, once it became clear that Marxism was
in rigor mortis, this idea had enormous appeal for intellectuals on
the political left. Since objective truth was bound up in a culture
they rejected, deconstruction offered the means of attacking it
from within. They would undermine trust in reason. Meaning, and
therefore truth, is never stable because the words in which it is
encased cannot be pinned on a slide like butterflies. They can be
shown to contradict what the author presumably intended. In such a
way does the ``text'' subvert meaning. It says many things at once,
and the reader determines what those meanings are (the schools call
a variant of this technique critical thinking). By the nature of
language itself, the author has lost control of his own words.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to most people this is sheer hokum, a perverse sophistry
masquerading as ``rigor.'' If nothing more were at stake than
literary criticism, no one would care. But the dagger concealed
within deconstruction is that words cannot be trusted, that one
standard of beauty or excellence is no better (or worse) than
another, that objective truth is unknowable. Thus the charge of
nihilism.
</P>
<P>
   It is a difficult one to refute, but less damaging than the
contradiction inherent in the entire project that Derrida wrought:
If words are suspect and meaning a mirage, then what is the point?
Life is short, and deconstruction can go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours and 15 minutes Derrida parsed a single sentence
Lyotard had written before he was found to have leukemia. The
sentence was: There Shall Be No Mourning. Derrida explicated it
this way and that, and did so with a didactic charm that had many
hanging onto every word.
</P>
<P>
   Not all, to be sure: There were a few nodding heads and a more
than a few fish-eyed expressions of vacuity. But in the end Derrida
was able to construe from his friend's words something he was
willing to settle upon, something he might even be willing to call
its meaning: In the face of genocide, in the face of death, we do
not stop to pity ourselves for those we have lost, but rather we
carry on and fight injustice with justice. Hardly a profound
thought, but an admirable one all the same, and the 900 who came to
Emory to hear it must have left with the hope that it be
deconstructed no further. It was fine, just fine, as it was.

 &HT;    `Happy' days in a Texas town
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget your troubles, c'mon, get happy. ``Happy, Texas,'' that
is.
</P>
<P>
   This sunny crowd pleaser captivated audiences at this year's
Sundance Film Festival with its cheerful zaniness and flyweight
gender-bender humor. Think ``La Cage aux Folles'' mixed with ``Some
Like It Hot'' and a dash of the beauty pageant spoof ``Smile.''
</P>
<P>
   So as not to mislead anyone, ``Happy, Texas'' isn't nearly as
accomplished as any of those movies, but it heads in the same
genial direction. Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne
Wayne Jr. (Steve Zahn) are petty crooks who, through a lucky break,
become escaped convicts. On the lam, they steal an RV and find
themselves mistaken for the owners: a gay couple who stage beauty
pageants for little girls and have been hired to put on the Little
Miss Fresh Squeezed Contest in nearby Happy, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Happy's residents are unhappy that their little girls have been
routinely weeded out of the finals. So Harry and Wayne are welcomed
as a source of professional expertise, even if they are ... well,
you know. ...
</P>
<P>
   As for our guys, they plan to lay low, play up to the locals
(especially the sheriff, played with sly, dewy-eyed aplomb by
Willam H. Macy) and rob the bank. But Harry finds himself drawn to
the bank's owner (Ally Walker), while Wayne discovers a
long-dormant talent for staging cheesy dance numbers for little
girls in sunflower costumes. That wins him the admiration of the
girls' teacher (Illeana Douglas). Meanwhile, Harry attracts his own
altogether unexpected admirer.
</P>
<P>
   The last-minute plot device weakens the picture, as if filmmaker
Mark Illsley couldn't come up with a good ending and so, quite
literally, he cuts to the chase. But by then the movie has built up
so much good will that you can't help but go along.
</P>
<P>
   Kudos to the cast for maintaining just the right touch of
amiable silliness. Northam, who could probably act in Jane Austen
adaptations for the rest of his life, proves he can do much more.
He might end up claiming some of Hugh Grant's territory. As for
Zahn, he continues to carve out his peculiar yet irresistible niche
as the Michael J. Pollard of the 1990s. He has that stoned,
one-beat-off thing combined with a kind of nervous belligerence
that's hilarious in its total impotence. Best of all is the
aforementioned Macy, who has a few secrets of his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' strikes a sweet-natured tone that may not be
realistic but cozies up to you like some friendly puppy. Plus, it's
just plain funny. When the pair finally figure out who they're
supposed to be, Harry shrugs, ``So we're gay. How hard can that
be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe not for you, Rock Hudson,'' snarls Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   It may not equal the John Wayne walking lesson in ``La Cage,''
but it's darn close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
Directed by Mark Illsley. Rated PG-13 for sexual situations and
profanity.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A genial, unassuming crowd pleaser with a few
welcome quirks.

 &HT;    Terrence Stamp's imprint all over `The Limey'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the beautiful Brits who invaded American movie theaters
in the 1960s, perhaps the most beautiful was Terence Stamp, who
made his mark in such films as ``Billy Budd'' and ``Far From the
Madding Crowd.'' These days, he's probably best-known for his
astonishing performance as a flamboyant drag queen in ``The
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.''
</P>
<P>
   As we see in Steven Soderbergh's new film, ``The Limey,'' the
shards of Stamp's beauty remain intact. He's not a desiccated
wraith like Peter O'Toole or gone to fat like Albert Finney. Still,
something in his eyes has changed. There's more there now than the
self-confident glisten of a gifted pretty boy. Stamp has paid his
dues, and it shows _ in his work and his face.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, ``The Limey'' seems a waste of both Stamp's
cheekbones and his talent. It's like one of those cheesy '70s
B-movies that Quentin Tarantino keeps inflicting on us. But slowly,
steadily, the movie finds itself _ a strange self, no question, but
a fascinating one as well.
</P>
<P>
   The plot, which is the least important element here, concerns a
Cockney ex-convict named Wilson (Stamp). When his daughter is
killed in a mysterious car accident in Los Angeles, Wilson decides
to investigate. Or, more to the point, to avenge her death. With
the help of her friends _ a gone-straight barrio boy (Luis Guzman)
and an acting coach (Lesley Ann Warren) _ he homes in on Terry
Valentine (Peter Fonda), a wealthy record producer with whom his
daughter was romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   Since the sensational success of ``sex, lies, and videotape''
made him a paradigm for the young, gifted and independent,
Soderbergh has had a checkered career. For every hit such as ``Out
of Sight,'' there's been a misfire like ``Kafka.'' For mainstream
moviegoers, ``The Limey'' may fall a little too near the ``Kafka''
camp, especially in the way it toys with time and narrative
structure. But those interested in more challenging work will find
the film a unique meditation on the nature of Hollywood, especially
what's left of '60s Hollywood as it demands attention from an
increasingly uninterested '90s Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the movie is defined by the iconography of its two
stars: Fonda, the flower-power insider, and Stamp, the Carnaby
Street invader. (Soderbergh uses scenes from Stamp's 1967 flick
``Poor Cow'' as flashbacks from Wilson's past.)
</P>
<P>
   Stamp represents something that Fonda can't understand, let
alone handle. He doesn't want a record contract, a drug contact or
entree to the party A-list. He just wants Fonda dead, and all the
bodyguards in Beverly Hills aren't going to stop him. (In one
hilarious throwaway, Stamp mistakes a cadre of valet parkers at one
of Fonda's parties for security guards.)
</P>
<P>
   Steely-eyed and unstoppable, Stamp anchors the movie; his work
is a pungent, subtly ironic comment on the essence of
Arnold-Sly-Bruce heroics, right down to the killing-machine
nobility. But Fonda nearly steals the film, giving a smart, cruelly
nuanced portrait of what happened to all those aging Hollywood
hipsters from the '60s. They became sellouts. They became corrupt.
Worst of all, they became banal.
</P>
<P>
   Driving to Big Sur with his 30-years-younger girlfriend, Fonda
launches into yet another war story from the '60s. ``You told me
this story before,'' she says with a luscious, forgiving smile.
``But I'll hear it again if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by Steven
Soderbergh. Rated R for violence and profanity. At Phipps Plaza. 1
hour,
</P>
<P>
   37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A challenging, offbeat revenge movie that's
actually a meditation on the nature of Hollywood.

 &HT;    Knockout film takes bare-knuckled look at the battered male
psyche
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first rule of ``Fight Club'': You will love ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   The second rule of ``Fight Club'': You will hate ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   The third rule: Whether you see the movie or not, you'll hear a
lot about it. Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio
release, the Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people
loathing it as liking it.
</P>
<P>
   Either reaction is justifiable. The film is violent, nihilistic,
intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor, and it's just about your
worst choice if you're looking for something to watch on date
night. A ``guy movie'' in the best and worst ways, the latest from
David Fincher, director of ``Seven'' and ``The Game,'' is also a
brutally funny mind trip with timely (if exaggerated) things to say
about late-millennial masculinity. Though it sags in its last act,
and its Big Surprise Twist isn't nearly as clever as, say, the
sucker punch in ``The Sixth Sense,'' the audacity of the movie's
first half overcomes the slack bits.
</P>
<P>
   Norton stars as our unnamed narrator, a burned-out drudge for a
car manufacturer who investigates fatal mechanical failures. When
he isn't traveling from one wreck site to another, he spends time
online, furnishing his condo. ``What kind of dining set defines me
as a person?'' he asks himself, the film's pithy way of
encapsulating the evolution (or is it diminution?) of the male
species: once hunter-gatherers, now Ikea shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   In his alienation, he finds emotional release by crashing
12-step programs and support groups, for everything from leukemia
to testicular cancer. Into one of these walks the soon-to-be bane
of his life, Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), puffing a cigarette and
asking brusquely, ``This is cancer, right?''
</P>
<P>
   But the newcomer who changes his world is Tyler Durden (Pitt), a
snaky guy's guy who manufactures homemade soap and spouts aphorisms
such as ``It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to
do anything.'' After one of the movie's typically surreal plot
twists, Norton's character moves in with him. Living in a leaky,
ramshackle mansion, they're a couple of Peter Pans. Their
nicotine-stained Wendy is the sardonic Marla, with whom Tyler
begins a gymnastic sexual relationship that almost makes the house
collapse, literally.
</P>
<P>
   So what is Fight Club? It's the guys-only society that Tyler and
the narrator create to measure their manhood. The point? To beat
the teeth out of an opponent in a bare-knuckled battle in the
basement of the local bar. Word spreads, and this secret cult grows
nationwide. (It's one of the movie's paradoxes that, for all this
machismo, the clandestine male bonding and the coded rituals recall
closeted gay societies of the past.)
</P>
<P>
   Tyler's actions lead to pranks, then mischievous terrorist
activities. Some pundits may condemn the movie for irresponsibility
in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing and the epidemic of school
and office shootings. In the film's defense, it is holding up a
funhouse mirror to modern reality, not endorsing the characters'
actions. ``Fight Club'' underscores both the silliness and the
dangers of any nascent fascist mentality, as the soldiers in
Tyler's army infuse their leader's every statement with holy
significance.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher directs with his usual visual flair. Like much of the
movie, the fights are shot with a mixture of glamour and grime _
chiaroscuro paintings splashed with sweat. The editing has the
slam-pow rhythm appropriate for the movie's muscular comic book
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The film indulges in the same sort of adolescent acting-out as
its characters. It gleefully offers gross-out scenes, such as one
that has Norton splattered by a bag of human fat, filched from a
liposuction clinic. Fincher and screenwriter Jim Uhls (adapting
Chuck Palahniuk's novel) don't hesitate to mock support groups and
their members, including a dying woman who wants to have sex one
last time, and burly Bob (Meat Loaf Aday), a cancer survivor whose
treatments have caused him to grow enormous breasts. ``Fight Club''
also winks knowingly at the fact that it's a movie. One scene
simulates the wobble of a strip of celluloid about to rip off its
sprockets, and in another, Norton punctuates one dramatic speech
with the voice-over, ``I'd like to thank the academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, ``Fight Club'' is the sort of button-pushing,
in-your-face flick the aging Academy Award voters probably won't
get. Too bad. Along with the superior technical work, the movie
shows off its three leads at their best. Norton and Pitt do expert
variations on previous work, while Bonham Carter's sexy black widow
performance should pry her out of period-movie corsets for good.
</P>
<P>
   Love it or hate it, you won't forget ``Fight Club.'' Like ``Blue
Velvet,'' ``A Clockwork Orange'' and ``Brazil,'' it's one of those
rare movies that creates an electrifying alternative universe
on-screen _ even while it's examining the splintered male psyche of
our everyday world. It's a KO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter.
Rated R for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent antisocial
behavior, sexuality and profanity. 2 hours, 21 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A knockout social satire, and the kind of movie
you're going to love or hate.

 &HT;    Hot `Romance' has never been so dull
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What do women in movies always do when they're having a crisis
of some sort _ be it spiritual, emotional, artistic or whatever?
</P>
<P>
   Why, they go have lots of sex. Rough sex, indiscriminate sex,
hot sex, quickie sex. Sort of like Emily Watson in ``Breaking the
Waves.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Romance,'' a dull little French film with an undeserved
``hot'' reputation (it is, however, graphic), Marie (Caroline
Ducey) is having a crisis because her boyfriend, a passive,
perfect-looking male model, won't have sex with her. We're never
told why, exactly, but maybe it's because she keeps nagging him all
the time about their sex life. Or maybe it's because she throws a
hissy fit when he wears a T-shirt in bed. Or maybe it's just that
she routinely says things like, ``You despise me because I'm a
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, Marie is in crisis, so she starts having sex. Lots of
it. Everything from consensual sex to rape. She even has sex with
the principal (Francois Berleand) at the elementary school where
she teaches. He claims to have seduced 10,000 women, despite the
fact he's no stud muffin, looks-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why me?'' he asks rhetorically. ``Because I talk to them.''
(He also, in Marie's case, ties them up, a process that takes so
long that not only does it drain bondage of any possible erotic
charge, it also becomes unintentionally comic.)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, romance is the absolute last thing on ``Romance's''
mind. Director Catherine Breillat, who made the repulsive ``36
Fillette'' a few years ago, launches her heroine on a ludicrous
I-can't-get-no-satisfaction sexual odyssey that's as pointless as
it is pretentious (though she does seem to have more fun than Tom
Cruise in ``Eyes Wide Shut'').
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the early encounters are vaguely erotic, but they turn
increasingly idiotic. Yes, there's genitalia galore, male and
female. And yes, there are all kinds of sexual acts on view (hence
the unrated status). But none of it is, um, stimulating _
physically, emotionally or dramatically. After a point, all the
on-screen groping becomes so borderline absurd and over-the-line
boring that you wish the guys from ``Mystery Science Theater 3000''
were on hand to provide a running commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Here's proof positive that explicit isn't always synonymous with
titillating. If anything, ``Romance'' is about as much of a turn-on
as flushing a dead roach down the toilet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Starring Caroline Ducey. Directed by Catherine Breillat.
Unrated, but contains graphic sex, full frontal nudity, bondage and
violence (a rape). In French with sub-
</P>
<P>
   titles.1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   36 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: About as sexy as going to the gynecologist.

 &HT;    Eye-popping Imax magic in 3-D
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried and Roy _ those hocus-pocus Las Vegas glam guys _ have
a 3-D Imax movie, and it isn't hype to say you have to see it to
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   For a full 51 minutes, this duo is in your face in ``Siegfried &AMP;
Roy: The Magic Box,'' doing their sleight-of-hand thing. Making
elephants disappear. Having furry white tigers leap over your head.
Waving 6-foot wands near your ears. Trotting out a lineup of Vegas
babes tarted up in golden armor.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dumbfoundingly watchable movie, girded like some weird
Wagnerian opera with giant metal dragons spewing fire and
long-haired male assistants strutting their stuff in chiseled body
suits. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't die with Liberace.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Las Vegas stage, ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy'' gives a couple
of peeks inside their lavish private digs. Their home is crammed
with tapestries, Thai statues and beveled glass. Roy seems to like
to sprawl on a huge, cushiony bed with one of his powder-puffy
white tigers, both surrounded by dozens of lighted candles.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more.
</P>
<P>
   This movie also looks back, pulling Siegfried and Roy's life
stories from some magical neverland. We see scenes of a young
Siegfried dazzling his father in Germany with a simple magic trick
using a coin, a handkerchief and a glass. Roy got his start working
at a zoo in Bremen, frolicking with a cheetah in and out of its
cage.
</P>
<P>
   These two apparently hooked up on an ocean liner, doing
eye-popping magical bits and eventually being lured to Vegas by an
entrepreneur mesmerized by their act.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Magic Box,'' these magicians have fashioned for
themselves the perfect mash note. Why else do we keep seeing
audiences leap to their feet for standing ovations and shouts of
bravo?
</P>
<P>
   The film's content is all mirrors, illusions and smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Just beware that in 3-D, smoke sure gets in your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   In 3-D. Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
Narrated by Anthony Hopkins. Directed by Brett Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   51 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Verdict: Glitz and glam hocus-pocus.

 &HT;    Meaning of the Beats eludes hip documentary
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're down with the Beat poets, you'll get a kick from this
documentary's mixture of old photographs, home movies and dramatic
readings by celebrities Johnny Depp, Dennis Hopper and John
Turturro. Even if you have only a marginal knowledge of the artists
involved, the first half-hour of ``The Source'' is a flavorful
glance back at the important 1944 meeting of Jack Kerouac, Allen
Ginsberg and William S. Burroughs in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Workman's film documents how they changed not only the way
America wrote, but the way we lived, with their works ``On the
Road,'' ``Howl'' and ``Naked Lunch'' injecting psychedelic color
into the black-and-white 1950s world of ``Ozzie and Harriet.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the film bebops from film clip to dramatic reading to
off-the-cuff quote from other counterculture cronies (Timothy
Leary, Ken Kesey and the peevish Gregory Corso), its jazzy,
improvisatory approach becomes wearying. Sure, Workman may have
wanted to capture the restless energy of writers who were pushing
boundaries. But after a point, this method of montage seems to be
designed to distract us from how little useful information the
movie conveys about who the Beats really were.
</P>
<P>
   It's not enough to show Neal Cassady dancing around shirtless
and have an old crony say, ``He himself was the art.'' What does
that mean, exactly? The film explains that Cassady was the guiding
force of the other writers, but he's elusive, just a guy with a big
skull and a goofy smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Source'' is not only stingy with providing context and
facts, it stretches itself too thin, trying to cover 40 years in
less than 90 minutes. It doesn't help that the celebrity readings
bite into that running time and wear out their welcome quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, the movie amusingly shows that no one _ even the
writers themselves _ can pin down the exact meaning of the name
``Beat.'' Less amusingly, ``The Source'' never tries to pin down
what it's going after. It's just a hep hodgepodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Source''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Chuck Workman. Unrated. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   29 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An impressionistic look at the Beats, best
appreciated by those already in the know.

 &HT;    `Story of Us': 15 years of marriage played for fun
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever wonder what happened after Harry met Sally?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' is sort of the flip side of director Rob
Reiner's mega-date movie ``When Harry Met Sally... ,'' in which
Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan hilariously pondered whether men and
women can just be friends. In ``Us,'' the question is whether a
couple can stay together after 15 years of wedded hit and miss.
</P>
<P>
   Us is Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer. As Ben, a writer of
romantic stories, and Katie, a creator of crossword puzzles,
they're as good-looking a pair as you may see on-screen. But in
Reiner's breezy, laugh a lot, cry a lot, big hankie of a movie, us
ain't doing so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Us don't talk so much, especially when the two kids aren't
around. And when the youngsters are, communication usually descends
into steely-eyed glances or nighttime shouting matches. You don't
connect with me. You don't stop blaming me.
</P>
<P>
   It may not sound like fun, but actually, at times, it is. Just
like in the director's ``The American President'' and ``When Harry
Met Sally ...,'' Reiner rarely keeps the camera focused on the
intense pain of relationships teetering toward collapse. Ingmar
Bergman has no place here.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get a steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes, guy
and gal pals dispensing weak-willed truisms (``The Ten Commandments
were easier to keep when you only lived to 35'') and a lineup of
therapists whose quacky musings are easily _ and sometimes
amusingly _ made fun of.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two people go to bed, there are actually six people in
that bed,'' one therapist spouts. It's an intriguing image, and
Reiner scores by immediately shifting to an otherworldly scene that
places his troubled twosome in their king-size sleeper with their
parents (played by Red Buttons, Betty White, Tom Poston and Jayne
Meadows). Both moms and pops naturally have a lot of marital
advice.
</P>
<P>
   But this gamesmanship, like so many scenes in this movie,
ultimately takes the easy way out. Let's just say it will be a
shock when a movie has the plucky White do more than spew profanity
to generate laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Moviegoers won't necessarily find answers to real-life marital
woes in ``The Story of Us.'' But they should be entertained. As
when Reiner pops a visual montage of Ben and Katie's marriage
on-screen, punctuated by the feel-good strummings of ``Classical
Gas.''
</P>
<P>
   It's their marriage quickly flashing before their eyes:
childhood chickenpox, birthdays, euphoric dancing, bitter ``I hate
you's'' and unrestrained ``I love you's.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, love really does mean having to say you're sorry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Rob
Reiner. Rated R for profanity and brief sexuality. At metro
theaters. 1 hour,
</P>
<P>
   38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A not-too-serious take on marital survival.

 &HT;    Colorado's Black Canyon of the Gunnison presents a monumental
challenge for hikers, fly-fishers
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By Susan Abramson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTROSE, Colo. _ There's only one way into this canyon by car.
We shift down and go as slowly as possible. A sign tells us what we
already know: This is one steep drive. The grade is 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The last time my friend Eddie Moore drove this road, his brakes
went out halfway down. He and his fishing buddies prayed they'd be
able to stop before plunging into their destination _ the Gunnison
River. Somehow they managed. This time, Eddie suggests we take the
rental car, with its new brakes.
</P>
<P>
   No disagreement there.
</P>
<P>
   Along with our friend Kim Wessel, Eddie and I had contemplated
hiking into the Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Monument. The
brochure says to plan an hour and a half down and two or more back
up on the Gunnison Route, the path that is most used by day hikers.
It's just one mile, but it drops 1,800 feet. Calling it a path is
generous _ there are lots of loose rocks and no marked trails. The
National Park Service has thoughtfully provided an 80-foot-chain to
help ease you down.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the easiest of the hikes into the inner canyon. The
longest drops 2,660 feet. For any of them, you must get a
backcountry permit. That's so park rangers can keep track of who
goes in. A pamphlet on hiking the inner canyon offers this chipper
bit of advice: ``Hikers are expected to find their own way and be
prepared for self-rescue.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-rescue?
</P>
<P>
   Of the 220,000 people who visit the monument each year, only
about 3,000 accept the challenge to hike in, says Paul Zaenger, a
supervisory ranger at the monument. ``It's a very demanding
thing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   After scoping out the canyon from the rim, we spy a buff-looking
young woman with a fly rod in her hand, all aglow from effort. We
ask about the hike.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken her about an hour each way. We brighten at the
news. But that was for a person in really good condition, she says,
casting doubtful glances in our direction. As if her point hadn't
been made, she adds, ``And that was for someone who lives at 9,000
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Any way you choose to go, a descent into the Black Canyon is a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The car ride down, while not as harrowing as Eddie's first trip,
is dizzying. Tall poles line the road _ to mark it so snowplows
won't plunge over the edge in winter. In a short time we drop
nearly 2,000 feet, in low gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several western canyons exceed the Black Canyon in overall
size,'' Wallace Hansen wrote, after surveying much of the region
for the U.S. Geological Service in the 1950s. ``But no other canyon
in North America combines the depth, narrowness, sheerness and
somber countenance of the Black Canyon of the Gunnison.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon, the big daddy of gorges, is twice as deep as
the Black Canyon. But it is five miles wide, allowing hikers a more
gradual descent. The Black Canyon, in contrast, is far more steep _
it's only a quarter of a mile wide at its narrowest point.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, sunlight doesn't penetrate the canyon for long.
Much of it lies in shadow for most of the day, giving it the
ominous look that inspired its name.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape was formed by the action of water and rock
scouring through hard crystalline rock. It took the river 2 million
years to carve its way through rock to an average depth of 2,000
feet in the canyon. The jagged walls of layered rock look almost
surreal against the blue, blue Colorado sky. You half expect to see
Wile E. Coyote plummeting from the top.
</P>
<P>
   We weren't the only ones a little daunted by the descent.
Archaeologists believe that prehistoric man, and later the Ute
Indians, avoided the inner canyon, choosing instead to stick close
to the rim. The first white men to see it were members of the
Hayden expedition of 1873-74. Even the group led by Capt. John W.
Gunnison, whose name the river bears, skipped the gorge itself in
its search for a river crossing. The Hayden expedition and later
surveying parties for the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad all
declared the canyon inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't fly-fishers.
</P>
<P>
   And they didn't have a rental car.From the rim, the ribbon of
river is bottle green. From the bottom you can see that it's also
fast. It's been running high, we are told, as many of Colorado's
rivers have after late spring snows and afternoon rains. But this
stretch of the Gunnison is classified by the state of Colorado as
Gold Medal water based on the number and size of fish it contains.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's where your best chances are to catch lots of big fish,''
says Geoff Tischbein of the Colorado Division of Wildlife. ``It's
where you go for the best fishing experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, it's a river worth trying even in less than
perfect conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On our Colorado tour, my friends and I fish the Frying Pan River
at Basalt, the Taylor and the Rio Grande. All are stunning. But the
most dramatic, by far, is the Gunnison in the Black Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Kim and I have been fly-fishing for about three years. Eddie was
one of our first teachers. Separately and together we have visited
beautiful rivers in many states. This is a large part of the draw
of the sport. Trout have impeccable taste in surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Canyon is no exception.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bureau, a metro Atlanta high school biology teacher and
author of ``The Angler's Guide to the Atlanta Chattahoochee
River,'' often poses the Gunnison in sharp contrast to the Hooch
when he gives talks. The Gunnison is one of his favorite examples
of a nutrient-rich river teeming with insect life and well-fed
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between the rivers is, of course, the
fertility,'' he says. The Chattahoochee is basically a sterile
river, because its water is pulled from the bottom of a lake. The
Gunnison, in contrast, has a high level of dissolved calcium
carbonate, which boosts its fertility. ``It's unbelievable what
they have,'' Bureau says.
</P>
<P>
   President Herbert Hoover recognized the magnificence of the
river and gorge when he proclaimed Black Canyon a national monument
in 1933. A bill recently approved by Congress would make it a
national park, which Zaenger says would further protect it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, for example, would provide scenic easements that would
prevent some types of development on the private land that
surrounds the park. It also would expand the park from about 21,000
acres to about 31,000 acres. The president is expected to sign the
bill this month.
</P>
<P>
   The vulnerability of surrounding private land caused park
officials to seek the designation. ``There's been so much rapid
development over much of Colorado,'' Zaenger says. ``It's of great
concern to the park service.''
</P>
<P>
   The river, too, is vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   As breathtaking as it is, with its sheer cliffs and fat trout,
it is not the fishery it once was. Its population of rainbow trout
has declined dramatically, the victim of whirling disease, a
parasite that affects a young fish's nervous system and causes it
to swim erratically when it is frightened. The parasite can kill a
fish outright or make it more vulnerable to predators.
</P>
<P>
   Many famed Western rivers have experienced the same sort of
decline. Brown trout are not seriously affected by the parasite and
have continued to thrive. Colorado plans to gradually supplement
the Gunnison's rainbows with a variety it hopes is resistant to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Even with its problems, the river holds one of the best
populations of trout anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Wading into the 53-degree river, I cast to the seam that
separates the fast and slow water. My expectations aren't high. I'm
too awed by my surroundings to believe that I would actually catch
a fish here, too, regardless of the river's reputation. I work the
seam and am surprised to hook a trout.
</P>
<P>
   The fish takes off into the current. I let him take the line,
knowing that if I put too much pressure on him, it will break. He
keeps going, downstream. Kim and Eddie arrive just in time to see
this. Eddie grabs his camera and starts shooting. Kim cheers me on,
but the fish keeps going. He takes every inch of my fly line,
taking me right into the backing _ the line that connects the fly
line to the reel. Clearly he is big. I start to ease him toward the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   My heart pounds. I try to remember to breathe.
</P>
<P>
   An eternity passes.
</P>
<P>
   He darts in my direction, and I gently reel in.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in an instant, the line goes slack.
</P>
<P>
   He's gone.
</P>
<P>
   I stand there for a minute, staring blankly at the spot where
the big fish once was. Then I stamp my foot like a 6-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A little while later, I get another chance. This time I ease the
trout out of the fast current more quickly, so he can't use it
against me. A few minutes later, I hold a fat 16-inch brown trout
just long enough for Kim to take our picture. Then I return him to
the water and watch him swim away.
</P>
<P>
   The fish I didn't catch was bigger, no doubt about it. I imagine
him to be the largest trout I've ever (almost) caught. But of
course there's no way to know. Not that it really matters. Just
standing in this river, in this canyon, is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we did take the car down.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: The Black Canyon of the Gunnison National
Monument is 250 miles southwest of Denver, 15 miles east of
Montrose via U.S. 50 and Colo. 347. To get to the South Rim from
Montrose, go east on U.S. 50 for eight miles; north on Colo. 347,
then six miles to the park entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Fly United and America West Airlines (via Phoenix or Las Vegas,
respectively) to Montrose for $404.50 round trip. Delta offers one
daily nonstop to Gunnison, about an hour east of Montrose, for
$498.50 round trip. Or fly United to Gunnison (via Denver) or
American (via Dallas) at $438.50. Rules for all these flights:
21-day advance purchase and two-day minimum stay required; travel
permitted to Colorado on Sundays-Wednesdays; return
Tuesdays-Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Park details: The entrance fee is $7. Be sure to stop at the
South Rim Visitor Center, 970-249-1915, Ext. 23, which offers
stunning views as well as exhibits about the park's history, flora,
fauna and geology. A video is also available for viewing.
</P>
<P>
   For those not brave enough to hike into the inner canyon, there
are plenty of short hikes from the rim that offer spectacular
sights. These hikes are rated easy, but park officials caution that
even these are at 8,000 feet, so if you haven't had time to adjust
to Colorado's higher elevations, take it slow.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to stay: The park has two campgrounds, one on each rim.
Campsites are available on a first-come, first-served basis. The
south rim campground has 102 sites and is rarely full. The north
rim campground has 15 sites. Park officials ask visitors to use
water sparingly, because it must be hauled in by truck. Each
campsite has its own fire ring or grill and a table. Wood gathering
is not permitted, so bring your own. Fee is $8 per vehicle.
Reservations are not accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Campsites are also available within the canyon. Backcountry
permits are required, and no wood fires are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   For motels, hotels, cabins or other campgrounds outside the
park, call the Montrose Visitors and Convention Bureau at
970-249-6360 or 1-800-873-0244; the Delta County Tourism Office at
1-800-436-3041; or the Gunnison Chamber of Commerce at
970-641-1501. The park's Web site is www.nps.gov/blca/.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  If you plan to fish: A valid Colorado fishing license is
required, and Gold Medal water restrictions apply: artificial lures
only, only four brown trout may be kept, and only one of those may
be 16 inches or longer. All rainbow trout must be released. To
arrange for a guided trip, call Gunnison River Outfitters in
Montrose, 1-800-297-4441. Owner Hank Hotze has been guiding people
in the canyon for 18 years. His clients have included accomplished
fly-fishers Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. A walk and wade trip is $275
for one angler, $300 for two. Cost includes lunch. Float trips of
two to four days can be arranged. Cost is $600 per day, per raft
(each raft holds two fishermen), including lunch and camping
arrangements. The river through the gorge features class II through
IV rapids.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The park in winter: The park is open year-round, but
visitation slows after Thanksgiving. In an average fall, people can
typically expect to hike the routes down to the river until early
November. Park officials say visitation picks up again in February
and March.

high-profile museums seem to have slept through that development,

It's just brand equity. Two ball teams. But no. Ever since Dr.
Margaret Mead and the sports pundits who also considered themselves
anthropologists proclaimed the Yankees and Mets irrevocably rival
tribes, their fans have been made to define themselves by the
choice. When it merely leads to bar fights over who would win a

   BBA-YANKEE-LUCK (New York) _ For the second time in four years,
the Yankees have benefited from a bad call by an umpire to win Game
1 of a playoff series on a Bernie Williams extra-inning home run.
In 1996, it was young Jeffrey Maier reaching over the right-field
wall to turn Derek Jeter's long fly ball into a home run, with
umpire Richie Garcia failing to call fan interference. Last night,
it was umpire Rick Reed ruling that Chuck Knoblauch had held onto a

hadn't. By Buster Olney.

against Atlanta on Friday night and no doubt hoping that the

need against the Braves. By Judy Battista.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-CHASS-COLUMN (Undated) _ The heart of the Mets' batting
order _ John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura _ has gone 1 for
21 in this series. But that's nothing new; the same three players
batted a combined .194 against Atlanta during the regular season.
By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES (Undated) _ Atlanta has a 2-0 lead over the Mets in
the NLCS and has beaten the Mets 11 out of 14 over all in 1999. Do
they have anything to fear in this series? Maybe raucous taunts
from Mets fans on Friday night, but even that is unlikely to affect
this polished and poised Atlanta team. By Steve Popper.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-PEREZ (Undated) _ Feature on Eddie Perez, the Atlanta
catcher who has hit key home runs in both games of the Mets-Braves
series. Perez was a backup until All-Star Javy Lopez was lost for
the season with an injury. Lopez used to kill the Mets; now Perez
is doing it. By Clifton Brown.

<P>
   October can be eerie, all right. Down on Earth the chill winds
blow and the fall colors vanish, replaced by stark, barren
branches.
</P>
<P>
   In the sky too, it's a perfectly spooky month _ the ideal
backdrop for the autumn night when the most people roam beneath the
stars: Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The month begins creepily enough. Nightfall finds Scorpius the
Scorpion slithering downward into the southwestern horizon. Draco
the Dragon hangs high in the northwest, and low in the west stands
Bovtes (pronounced boo!-o-teez). The sky's eeriest props are in
place.
</P>
<P>
   But the celestial object most intimately connected with devils
and witches waits until mid-month to rise at nightfall, so that by
Halloween it's well up when darkness comes. It's the Pleiades.
</P>
<P>
   What? That close-knit cluster of young suns better known as the
Seven Sisters? What have they to do with sinister things?
</P>
<P>
   In the Western world, everything. Halloween revolves around
them.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Halloween, other cultures attached significance to
the Pleiades. The Brahmans of ancient India visualized those stars
as the sparks of Agni, the god of fire. In Greek legend they were
the daughters of Atlas. The Pleiades are even mentioned in the Book
of Job:
</P>
<P>
   Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
bands of Orion?
</P>
<P>
   A ``sweet influence'' is hardly scary. But some cultures
associated the Pleiades with more ominous occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztecs, for example, linked the date when the constellation
reached its highest point, or culminated, at midnight with the end
of the world. The Aztecs believed that every 52 years, when their
365-day sun calendar and 260-day ritual calendar came into
coincidence, the possibility existed that the heavens would cease
to move and demons would fall from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The sign that this catastrophe wouldn't befall the cosmos? When
the Pleiades reached their zenith at midnight (almost straight
overhead in Mexico City) and then continued harmlessly across the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The Aztec ceremony associated with this event involved a human
sacrifice. That's certainly creepy but has nothing to do with
Halloween. For that, we must look to the Celts.
</P>
<P>
   Many historians believe Halloween is the modern-day remnant of a
Celtic celebration called Samhain, which marked the end of the
Celtic year and the transition from summer to winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Celts believed that during Samhain, the border between this
world and the supernatural world cracked open, granting free
passage to sinister fairies from the land of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Samhain fell at the midpoint between the autumnal equinox and
the winter solstice, and the Celts originally knew when that was
because it took place at the same time that _ you guessed it _ the
Pleiades culminated at midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The tradition, developed in the Middle Ages, of the Witches'
Sabbath on Oct. 31 is probably rooted in the old Celtic observance.
That date was upheld into modern times as All Hallows' Eve, which
became, of course, Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Now is your chance to get closer to the power behind the goblins
and mischief of October's final night. The Pleiades are striking to
the unaided eye, but they become stunning through binoculars.
Instantly the six to 11 naked-eye stars grow to hundreds of
sapphire jewels.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomy clubs periodically hold observing nights for the
public. Perhaps some will set up instruments on Halloween, so
families _ already outdoors on their diabolic rounds _ can bravely
meet October's ghostly apparitions face-to-face.

ONLY AN ALIEN MIGHT ENJOY LOUSY `MATING HABITS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has rarely been a movie about the ``mating ritual'' _ inthis case, a polite term for lots of simulated screen sex _ that's
as dumb as this one.
</P>
<P>
   It's told from the point of view of an extraterrestrial (the
voice of David Hyde Pierce of TV's ``Frasier'') who is making a
documentary about human courtship and copulation for other
galaxies. His handbook of human rituals focuses on a male and
female, following their progress from first meeting to inevitable
mating _ and more mating.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmakers can dress up such silliness any way they'd like,
but they can't disguise the fact that ``The Mating Habits of the
Earthbound Human'' is a pedestrian, cliched movie that is inanely
dumb and utterly predictable. There's hardly a whit of invention in
it despite the alien point of view, which comes across instead as a
stilted reworking of ``Wild Kingdom'' or a tepid National
Geographic special.
</P>
<P>
   Billy (Mackenzie Astin) is a nice, average guy who's looking to
have sex. Jenny (Carmen Electra) is the gorgeous gal who catches
his eye. They meet at a Los Angeles disco (called a ``sacred
meeting ground'' by their ET narrator) and drink ``fermented
grain'' in order to muster up the courage to chat. Soon they're
dating, dining and doing it; meeting each other's friends and
parents and dealing with the dilemmas and complexities of safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds ho-hum it certainly is. TV writer Jeff Abugov
(``Cheers,'' ``Roseanne,'' ``Grace Under Fire'') makes the leap
from small to big screen with this directorial debut and it's
certainly not as inspired as any of the television series he may
have helped script. In fact, following this film, he went back to
TV and began working on ``Caroline In the City.'' An even bigger
surprise is that the film's associate producer is Sam Irvin, a
filmmaker who was co-executive producer of last year's evocative
and smart ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mating Habits of the Earthbound Human'' borrows bits from
Woody Allen's 1972 film, ``Everything You Always Wanted To Know
About Sex But Were Afraid to Ask'' (human sperms run around wildly
looking for their target egg) and desperately hopes that someone
out there will find it clever. But the actors plod almost
sheepishly through their paces and by choosing to study a couple's
sexual proclivities through the eyes of an alien, this clunker
ironically emphasizes the fact that the only creatures who might
think it creative would have be from outer space.

ZAHN, MACY MAKE `HAPPY, TEXAS' A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a breath of fresh air to review a film that, having
received an award from the Sundance Film Festival, actually
deserves the accolade. Sundance, which was conceived by Robert
Redford 20 years ago as an antidote to the elitist, expensive
mainstream studio system, provided a safe haven for filmmakers to
show their small movies. But for the past decade, it's become known
more as a bidding war marketplace for distributors and as a forum
which hands out its prizes rather undiscerningly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' won the Special Jury Prize for Comedic
Performance for actor Steve Zahn and, thankfully, he deserves it.
An additional prize should have been given to co-star William H.
Macy as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' is a fresh, well-written comedy that doesn't
lag, casts its actors against type and has a real love for its
characters. It's tolerant and full of sweet-natured sensibilities
that allow its small-town inhabitants a great deal of dignity while
making us laugh at the folly life throws their way.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Sawyer (Jeremy Northam) and Wayne Wayne Wayne, Jr. (Zahn)
are escaped convicts. They steal a motor home to assist in their
flight, not knowing it belongs to a pair of gay, professional
beauty pageant directors who are headed toward a small town called
Happy, Texas. Happy is sad over the fact that they haven't won the
Little Miss Squeezed Pageant for at least 25 years and in
frustration, the town has hired the real thing in order to ensure
they'll qualify for the finals.
</P>
<P>
   But Wayne and Harry are hardly the type of guys who know
anything about a beauty pageant _ much less being gay. What they do
know after sizing up Happy is the sheriff (Macy) is a softie and
the bank is ineptly secured. It's a perfect setup for a pair of
imposters who need to make a quick hit and get out of town fast.
But sometimes life has other plans even for the least hardened of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Director and co-writer Mark Illsley may have learned a few
tricks from working as a second unit director for director Kevin
Reynolds, who reportedly barely survived collisions with his former
pal and frequent star, Kevin Costner, while making ``Robin Hood,
Prince of Thieves'' and ``Waterworld.'' Illsley opted to make a
low-budget, labor of love comedy instead of a whopper-budget movie
star vehicle. He joyously avoids many of the pitfalls his mentor
endured working within the studio/star system.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, ``Happy, Texas'' gives Macy space to steal the film
and create another memorable movie character after his
Oscar-nominated role in ``Fargo.'' He also allows Northam to break
free from his priggish English period piece persona. The end result
is a movie that revels in _ and loves _ its idiosyncrasies and
generously allows the audience to revel in them too.
</P>
<P>
   Happy, Texas. Directed by Mark Illsley. Written by Mark Illsley,
Ed Stone, Phil Reeves. Cast: Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn, Ally
Walker, Illeana Douglas, William H. Macy. Miramax Films. 90
minutes. Rated PG-13 for language, minor sexual content.

   Sports stories from The New York Times News Service for FRIDAY,
Oct. 15
</P>
<P>
   BBA-ANDERSON-COLUMN (New York) _ Sports Column on David Cone,
who starts for the Yankees in Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series Thursday night at Yankee Stadium. This is
Cone's first appearance in the postseason, and it could be one of
the last appearances he makes as a Yankee, since the prevailing
wisdom is that he will not be back with the team next season. By
Dave Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-ARATON-COLUMN (Undated) _ Sports column on the Yankees and
the constant physical vulnerability that makes them more attractive
than a dominating world champion might ordinarily be. Right now,
you have Paul O'Neill in right field with a fractured rib, Darryl
Strawberry, a cancer victim, as the sometimes designated hitter;
Joe Torre, cancer victim, managing in the dugout. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-LIPSYTE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Why shouldn't choosing between
the Yankees and the Mets be as easy as choosing between the Beatles
and the Stones, Apple and IBM, Lancaster and York, Good and Evil?
It's just brand equity. Two ball teams. But no. Ever since Dr.
Margaret Mead and the sports pundits who also considered themselves
anthropologists proclaimed the Yankees and Mets irrevocably rival
tribes, their fans have been made to define themselves by the
choice. When it merely leads to bar fights over who would win a
subway series, there is no harm done. But when cultural, class and
economic divisions are perpetuated, we have trouble here on River
Avenue. By Robert Lipsyte.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKEES-REDSOX (New York) _ Red Sox at Yanks, Game 2,
American League Championship Series, 8:17 p.m. David Cone vs. Ramon
Martinez, Pedro's older brother. By Buster Olney.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKEE-LUCK (New York) _ For the second time in four years,
the Yankees have benefited from a bad call by an umpire to win Game
1 of a playoff series on a Bernie Williams extra-inning home run.
In 1996, it was young Jeffrey Maier reaching over the right-field
wall to turn Derek Jeter's long fly ball into a home run, with
umpire Richie Garcia failing to call fan interference. Last night,
it was umpire Rick Reed ruling that Chuck Knoblauch had held onto a
throw to second base in the top of the 10th inning, when he clearly
hadn't. By Buster Olney.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-METS (Undated) _ The Mets work out at Shea Stadium,
preparing for Game 3 of their National League Championship Series
against Atlanta on Friday night and no doubt hoping that the
sellout crowd at Shea might give them the inspiration they clearly
need against the Braves. By Judy Battista.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-CHASS-COLUMN (Undated) _ The heart of the Mets' batting
order _ John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura _ has gone 1 for
21 in this series. But that's nothing new; the same three players
batted a combined .194 against Atlanta during the regular season.
By Murray Chass.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES (Undated) _ Atlanta has a 2-0 lead over the Mets in
the NLCS and has beaten the Mets 11 out of 14 over all in 1999. Do
they have anything to fear in this series? Maybe raucous taunts
from Mets fans on Friday night, but even that is unlikely to affect
this polished and poised Atlanta team. By Steve Popper.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-PEREZ (Undated) _ Feature on Eddie Perez, the Atlanta
catcher who has hit key home runs in both games of the Mets-Braves
series. Perez was a backup until All-Star Javy Lopez was lost for
the season with an injury. Lopez used to kill the Mets; now Perez
is doing it. By Clifton Brown.

   EAMES-EXHIBIT (New York) _ Those who think that there is too

   TRENTON-REBIRTH (Trenton, N.J.) _ The reborn War Memorial is

<P>
   NY-LATINO (New York) _ The recent blast of popular enthusiasm
for Latino music and culture has yet to find serious resonance in
the mainstream New York art world. People of Hispanic descent now
make up nearly 30 percent of the city's population, but most of its
high-profile museums seem to have slept through that development,
and only a handful of galleries regularly show Latino artists. This
situation automatically makes El Museo del Barrio an indispensable
public resource. By Holland Cotter.

UNDER-AGE DRINKING AD CAMPAIGN CAN'T GET COVETED BILLBOARD SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREA WOO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Eller Media, one of the largest billboard
companies in the world, has refused the Contra Costa County Health
Department request to display an advertisement that discourages
underaged drinking.
</P>
<P>
   After using the promotional ads in nearby Oakland, the company
declined to lease space to the Contra Costa Health Department
because the promotions poke fund at a client, Anheuser-Busch.
</P>
<P>
   The ad had a one-month contract on 20 billboards in Oakland and
depicts three frogs croaking ``Big Lose R'' with the center frog
sitting on a ``Not Wiser'' can, allusions to Anheuser-Busch's ads
for its Budweiser beer brand.
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Meyer, president of Eller Media, said the company had a
policy not to place any billboards that offended existing clients.
</P>
<P>
   But the Marin Institute for the Prevention of Alcohol and Other
Drug Problems is calling the matter a violation of First Amendment
rights. Diana Conti, president of the Marin Institute, said it was
important to have such popular icons as the Anheuser frog or R.J.
Reynolds' Joe Camel seen in a negative light so children would not
find the real ads glamorous. And Contra Costa County has a right to
use the promotions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't use the images to debunk the myths, then there's
no point in the campaign,'' Conti said. ``We do consider this
censorship. Their profit-driven motives undercut the importance of
public health.''
</P>
<P>
   The Shareholders of Anheuser-Busch for Advertising Reform, a
group founded by the Marin Institute to try to make alcohol
advertising child-proof, originally had the idea for a billboard
campaign against under-aged drinking. It sponsored a contest in
April for fifth- to 12th-grade students to depict the problems of
alcohol advertising from the perspective of a young person's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, Tramaine de Senna, now a freshman at the University
of California at Berkeley, drew the parody of the Budweiser frogs.
De Senna said she would see peers imitating the frogs, and knew it
was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   The ads soon caught the eye of Mildred Carlton, a Richmond
resident, who contacted the Contra Costa County Health Department
and offered to arrange similar ads in the county. She called Eller
Media. She said the company initially had agreed to display the ads
for the cut-rate price of about $1,000 per billboard. Carlton said
the company had promised to mail her information and find
appropriate sites for the ads. But she said she never heard from
Eller Media again. When she phoned to ask why, she said a
representative said the company had changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton said Eller Media had told her that Anheuser-Busch had
complained about the ads. Furthermore, Eller Media said it wouldn't
display the signs in Oakland once the contract with the Marin
Institute was up.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, Anheuser-Busch officials said the
company had ``no role in the decision to either put this sign up or
take the sign down.'' They declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have been working with the Marin Institute, Contra
Costa County's Substance Abuse Services and other county officials
to try to change Eller Media's position.
</P>
<P>
   County health educator Fatima Matal Sol, however, said the
billboard ad might be a dead end. Outdoor Systems, another big
billboard company, also declined to display the ads, to avoid what
they believed was copyright infringement, said Steve Shinn,
director of public affairs for Outdoor Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, residents and officials are looking to place smaller
posters of the ad outside and inside county buses.
</P>
<P>
   Contra Costa County Supervisor John Gioia said he would take the
issue before the Board of Supervisors next week. Gioia said he was
not sure what measures the board might take, but it could involve
legal action or encouraging businesses to boycott the two billboard
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertisers are targeting young people, and we need to respond
in kind,'' Gioia said. ``It's unfair for the billboard company to
deny us. It's a First Amendment issue. ... This is not an issue
we're going to let get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said he would do whatever he could to help the county's
under-aged drinking campaign, as long as the image in the ad was
changed. Meyer has offered the Marin Institute the use of his
award-winning creative staff to design new ads for free. He said
his staff could create more effective ads because they were trained
to design eye-catching billboards for passing motorists.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he noted, Eller Media has displayed many public
service billboards, including ones for Mothers Against Drunk
Driving. And Meyer said he was not afraid to make the ad
hard-hitting, just as long as it didn't attack specific alcohol
companies.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino and Jill
Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Adventures of Elmo
</P>
<P>
   in Grouchland'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elmo (voice by Kevin Clash), Mandy Patinkin and Vanessa
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A kind of extended episode of ``Sesame Street,'' this movie is
recommended to the very, very, very young. Essentially, little Elmo
(voice by Kevin Clash) must go to Grouchland to rescue his blanket
from a meanie named Huxley (a hammy Mandy Patinkin). Vanessa
Williams appears as the Queen of Trash. Fill in your own joke.
(ERG)1 hour, 10 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's
</P>
<P>
   Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this Imax film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM)40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Alaska:
</P>
<P>
   Spirit of the Wild'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Narrated by Charlton Heston.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, it's bold, it's big ... The sheer size of the latest
Imax offering sometimes makes it an eye-opening experience.
Otherwise, this visit to the far, brrr-cold reaches of our biggest
state is just another Discovery Channel-style nature flick. The
film spans millenniums _ and throws in bits and pieces about the
ice age, the Klondike Gold Rush, caribou hunting and bears. (Bob
Longino)40 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, nudity, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   A beaut. The ever-more-remarkable Kevin Spacey leads a stellar
ensemble cast (Annette Bening, Thora Birch, Chris Cooper) in this
scarily disturbing, daringly hilarious comedy-drama in this fin de
siecle tragifarce centering on Spacey as a man caught in a midlife
limbo. The movie is a hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the
Beautifully Screwed Up. (ERG)1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue Streak'' PG-13 (profanity, violence
</P>
<P>
   and crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   A decent, disposable Martin Lawrence vehicle. He's a crook
posing as a cop to recover a $17 million diamond he stashed years
ago. Basically a series of quick skits, there's enough action
scenes to mollify audiences who can't get enough of gunfire and
breaking glass. While it doesn't exactly streak along, at 93
minutes ``Blue Streak'' gets the job done. (SM) 1 hour, 33 minutes.
C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thierry Lhermitte
</P>
<P>
   and Jacques Villeret.
</P>
<P>
   A feast of foolishness. Snotty Paris yuppies hold a weekly
dinner to see who can bring the biggest idiot as a guest. Publisher
Thierry Lhermitte thinks he's got a sure thing when he meets
Jacques Villeret, who builds scale-model monuments out of
matchsticks. Fate intervenes when Lhermitte throws out his back and
is forced to spend the evening with Villeret who systematically
wrecks his life. (ERG) 1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Double Jeopardy'' R (profanity, sexuality, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ashley Judd
</P>
<P>
   and Tommy Lee Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Judd plays a woman out to wreak justice on the husband
who framed her for murder, and Tommy Lee Jones is the parole
officer on her trail in this action flick with a gender twist. For
better and for worse, the movie is as professional, efficient and
aloof as Judd's performance. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Drive Me Crazy'' PG-13 (profanity, teen alcohol
</P>
<P>
   and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adrian Grenier
</P>
<P>
   and Melissa Joan Hart.
</P>
<P>
   A '90s ``Odd Couple'' teen romance, dragged down by out-of-it
jokes and by-the-numbers plotting. Adrian Grenier and Melissa Joan
Hart are pleasant enough as the leads, but the story is tired and
after the first few minutes the direction settles into a comfy
snooze. (Steve Whitty, Newhouse News Service) 1 hour, 43 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story Imax
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM)44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' R (violent anti-social behavior, sexuality
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Edward Norton,
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Bound to be this fall's most controversial studio release, the
Brad Pitt-Edward Norton flick will have as many people loathing it
as liking it. Either reaction is justifiable. The film, about a
pack of guys beating each other to bloody pulps, is violent,
nihilistic, intoxicated by its own bad-boy humor. But it's still
one of those rare films that creates an electrifying alternate
universe onscreen. (SM)2 hours, 21 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``For Love of the Game'' PG-13 (sexual situations, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Costner and Kelly Preston.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how hard it tries to hit, Kevin Costner's baseball
flick whiffs a lot. Costner plays Billy Chapel, a Detroit Tigers
pitching god in his waning years who first learns his team is being
sold and he'll be traded and then that his girlfriend is dumping
him. As he pitches what could be a perfect game, he flashes back
over his life. (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 18 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Guinevere'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Sarah Polley
</P>
<P>
   and Jean Smart.
</P>
<P>
   A college grad (Sarah Polley) moves in with a 50-ish bohemian
photographer (Stephen Rea) who's made a career out of introducing
much younger women to the joys of sex, Sartre, jazz, art, etc. But
what sounds like grist for a feminist diatribe against our
culture's wink-wink approval of such liaisons is actually a sweet,
rueful love letter. The writing and direction is sharp as a tack
and the acting is gorgeous. (ERG)1 hour, 47 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy, Texas'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeremy Northam,
</P>
<P>
   Steve Zahn and William H. Macy.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon get ``Happy.'' This sunny crowd-pleaser stars Jeremy
Northam and Steve Zahn as escaped convicts who hide out in a small
town by posing as a gay couple who stage beauty pageants for little
girls. A last-minute plot device is a bad idea, but by then the
picture has built up so much good will you can't help but go along.
The cast is excellent, especially William H. Macy as the sheriff.
(ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``In Too Deep'' R (profanity, sensuality, some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps and LL Cool J.
</P>
<P>
   A decent undercover-cop thriller highlighted by some smart
performances. Omar Epps is quite good as the detective, but LL Cool
J is a revelation as the ruthless drug kingpin, a monster made all
the scarier by his seeming benevolent charm. (SM) 1 hour, 50
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Jakob the Liar'' PG-13 (violence and disturbing images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin
</P>
<P>
   and Armin Mueller-Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a Polish Jew who inspires his neighbors in
a Nazi-controlled ghetto by pretending to own a radio that's
broadcasting news of German defeat. While you'll be grateful that
Williams avoids his mawkish, laughter-through-tears routine, you
keep wanting him to do something memorable. Ultimately, it's what a
film like this should never be: dull. (SM) 1 hour, 54 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Terence Stamp
</P>
<P>
   and Peter Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   A Cockney ex-con (Terence Stamp) comes to L.A. to avenge the
supposedly accidental death of his daughter. He hones in on a slimy
record producer (Peter Fonda). Plot-wise, this is a revenge movie,
but thematically, it's an off-beat meditation on the nature of
Hollywood, especially what's left of '60s Hollywood as it demands
attention from an increasingly disinterested '90s Hollywood. Both
stars are superb. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Mumford'' R (profanity, sex-related images,
</P>
<P>
   drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis,
</P>
<P>
   Jason Lee and Alfre Woodard.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Lawrence Kasdan delivers a sunny, low-key
crowd-pleaser about a therapist named Mumford (Loren Dean) whose
effect on his clients changes the mood of their whole town (also
called Mumford). With a crack supporting cast, it's a gentle
vacation from the high-concept bangs and lowbrow laughs found
elsewhere in the multiplex. (SM) 1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mystery, Alaska'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe,
</P>
<P>
   Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers but fairly pleasant David-vs.-Goliath comedy,
on ice. Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria and Burt Reynolds star in TV
whiz David E. Kelley's tale of small-town hockey lovers taking on
the New York Rangers. The movie piles on raunchy jokes and is a
soggy series of bite-sized vignettes and spoon-fed emotions. For
all that, it's still pretty watchable. (SM) 1 hour, 58 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Random Hearts'' R (violence, sexuality and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Harrison Ford
</P>
<P>
   and Kristin Scott Thomas. A meandering mystery/drama/romance
that never hits the right groove. Harrison Ford is a cop and
Kristin Scott Thomas a congresswoman who discover their spouses,
both killed in a plane crash, were having an affair. The stars'
ensuing romance never taps beneath the surface. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Romance'' Unrated, but there is sex, nudity,
</P>
<P>
   bondage and a rape.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Caroline Ducey.
</P>
<P>
   A dull little French film with an undeserved ``hot'' reputation.
Upset because her boyfriend has stopped having sex with her, Marie
(Caroline Ducey) starts having lots of sex. Rough sex,
indiscriminate sex, quickie sex. Even bondage sex with her boss who
takes about an hour to tie her up (guess they don't have Boy Scouts
in France). The movie is very explicit and absolutely unerotic. In
French with subtitles. (ERG)1 hour, 36 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Runaway Bride'' PG (profanity and sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Richard Gere.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning, alas, doesn't strike twice in this reunion of
``Pretty Woman'' stars Julia Roberts and Richard Gere. However, the
film isn't a fiasco and it does well by its intended audience,
i.e., anyone who wants to see Roberts galloping on horseback in
full wedding regalia. She's a bride who's already choked at the
altar three times and is about to try again. He's a cynical
journalist who's betting she'll run. (ERG)1 hour, 56 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Siegfried &AMP; Roy:
</P>
<P>
   The Magic Box'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring Siegfried Fischbacher
</P>
<P>
   and Roy Uwe Ludwig Horn.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Cirque du Surreal. Siegfried and Roy _ those
hocus-pocus, Las Vegas glam guys _ star in this dumbfoundingly
watchable 3-D Imax that's girded like some weird Wagnerian opera.
Elephants disappear. Furry white tigers leap over your head. Giant
metal dragons spew fire. Obviously, the concept of garish didn't
die with Liberace. (Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sixth Sense'' PG-13 (intense thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and violent images)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising, spine-tingling gem. Eight-year-old Cole (Haley
Joel Osment) can see ghosts, not the Casper variety but restless
phantoms with their skulls blown open. It's a fascinating, odd film
that speculates on what the relationship between the restless dead
and a liaison to the living world might be. Plus, this film has the
best, and loveliest, last-act twist of the year. (SM) At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 47 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Source'' Not rated.
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by Chuck Workman.
</P>
<P>
   An impressionistic look at the Beats, it's best appreciated by
those in the know. Chuck Workman's film documents how the Beat
poets changed not only the way America wrote, but the way we lived,
with their works ``On the Road,'' ``Howl'' and ``Naked Lunch.'' But
as the film be-bops from film clip to dramatic reading to
off-the-cuff quote, its jazzy, improvisatory approach becomes
wearying. (SM) 1 hour, 29 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stigmata'' R (profanity, sexuality, intense violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Patricia Arquette
</P>
<P>
   and Gabriel Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   Let it bleed without you. This mishmash of ``The Exorcist,''
``The Omen,'' etc. stars Gabriel Byrne as a Vatican investigator
sent to examine a young woman (Patricia Arquette) who's showing
signs of the stigmata, the wounds suffered by Christ on the cross.
Unfortunately, the movie prefers sensationalism to making sense.
It's enough to make you long for the good ol' days of pea soup and
spinning heads. (ERG) 1 hour, 42 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Stir of Echoes'' R (profanity, sexual content
</P>
<P>
   and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
</P>
<P>
   A ghost story with too many echoes of other flicks. It might
have seemed intriguing had it landed in theaters before ``The Blair
Witch Project'' and ``The Sixth Sense'' gave us new twists on the
spooky movie genre. A little boy sees ghosts and his hypnotized dad
(Kevin Bacon) goes wiggy while hunting what happened to a teen girl
haunting their home. (SM) 1 hour, 50 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' R (profanity and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Willis
</P>
<P>
   and Michelle Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Director Rob Reiner's breezy, laugh-a-lot, cry-a-lot, big hankie
of a movie with Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfeiffer as a couple
wondering if they'll survive after 15 years of marriage. It's a
steady stream of sex jokes, butt jokes and guy and gal pals
dispensing weak-willed truisms. It may not be deep, but it is
entertaining. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 38 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstar'' PG-13 (sex-related humor and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Molly Shannon,
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell and Elaine Hendrix.
</P>
<P>
   Whaddya know _ a ``Saturday Night Live'' big-screen transfer
that doesn't bite. As the ebullient Catholic schoolgirl Mary
Katherine Gallagher, Molly Shannon delivers a memorable mix of
adolescent brazenness and self-mortification. It's clear Shannon
loves this character, but she's never afraid to push the envelope
of outrageousness, whether talking baby talk to her breasts, or
fantasizing that a tree is her lover. (SM)1 hour, 22 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``The 13th Warrior'' R (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, cheesy movies can be great fun. That's true of this
rip-roaring yarn about a medieval Arab poet (Antonio Banderas)
who's drafted by a roving gang of rowdy Vikings to help rescue a
Norse village from a mysterious enemy that comes from the mist,
kills everything in sight and leaves a trail of headless corpses.
This flick hits the ground running and never stops. (ERG) At metro
theaters. 1 hour, 43 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierce Brosnan and Rene Russo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Windmills of Your Mind'' is still on the soundtrack, but
lots of other gimmicks from the 1968 original have been excised.
That's good. This remake is a guilt-free summer diversion. Pierce
Brosnan is an appealing billionaire gentleman rogue, stealing
priceless paintings. But it's really Rene Russo's film. As the solo
investigator hot on his trail, she prowls the screen savoring a
smart, sexed-up character. (SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Three Kings'' R (graphic war violence, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring George Clooney,
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube play three U.S.
soldiers in the Persian Gulf War who go after Saddam Hussein's
stolen Kuwaiti gold. Their consciences are tested when they see
anti-Saddam civilians rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. While the
film's script cynically bashes George Bush's political stance, its
visuals pop with energy. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 51 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``trick'' R (sexuality, profanity
</P>
<P>
   and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Campbell
</P>
<P>
   and John Paul Pitoc.
</P>
<P>
   In this sturdy and well-acted gay romantic comedy, two guys
spend a night looking to make love in all the wrong places. Gabriel
(Christian Campbell) and Mark (John Paul Pitoc) pick each other up,
both clearly intending a mutually gratifying one-night stand. But
as the evening wears on, they're still on the street. The obstacles
become more contrived as the movie goes on. But, overall, ``trick''
is a minor treat. (ERG)1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Twin Falls Idaho'' R (kinkiness and adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark and Michael Polish.
</P>
<P>
   Eerie. Intriguing. Identical twins, Mark and Michael Polish,
play conjoined (the popular term is Siamese) twins. Moving at its
own slow, surreal pace, the picture shows what happens when a young
hooker (Michele Hicks) falls for one of the twins, thus creating a

<P>
   For those of you who wax nostalgic over the days when several
generations were all under one roof, look no further than your
office.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, Grandpa, Mom, Sis and even grandsons are all
working there. And any one of them could be the boss.
</P>
<P>
   They may not be your relatives, but you are more likelyto
be working with a mix of generations than at any other time in
American history, three workplace consultants suggest in a new
book.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the industrial era, when each generation was
sequestered from the others in a hierarchical organization, with
the most senior at the top and the youngest at the bottom, these
days it could be the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no previous time in our history have so many and such
different generations with such diversity been asked to work
together shoulder to shoulder, side by side, cubicle to cubicle,''
write Ron Zemke, Claire Raines and Bob Filipczak.
</P>
<P>
   Given the distinct upbringing and value system of each
generation, this meeting of minds is creating yet another potential
for conflict in the workplace, but also the chance to promote even
greater creativity, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The authors discuss the trend and how companies are dealing with
its problems and opportunities in ``Generations At Work: Managing
the Clash of Veterans, Boomers, Xers, and Nexters in Your
Workplace'' (Amacom, 280 pages, $25).
</P>
<P>
   First, the authors set about defining the four generational
groups, based on conclusions drawn from their research. They don't
always follow the traditional definitions of the generations,
instead factoring in the ``feel'' and the ``face'' of each:
</P>
<P>
   _ Veterans were born between 1922 and 1943 and number 52
million. Obviously influenced tremendously by the Great Depression
and World War II, ``their mind-set has so dominated our culture
that every other set of beliefs is weighed against theirs,'' the
authors write. They make up about 25 percent of the work force and
hold a whopping 75 percent of all the financial assets in the
United States, with a net worth of more than $7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   On teams, veterans are strong when most team members are
veterans and when the team leader takes a directive role, the
authors write. But if a younger team leader did not enforce rules,
policy, and mutual agreements consistently, such a team would come
apart, they add. Motivating a veteran can be done with traditional
perks, such as a good parking spot. Handwrite notes to them.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 73 million baby boomers were born between 1943 and 1960.
During 19 years in that time period, a new baby was being born
every 17 minutes. They are one-third of all Americans and account
for 53 percent of the work force. They advocated turning the
traditional corporate hierarchy upside down, but often are not
strong in their conviction on participatory and inclusive
management.
</P>
<P>
   The authors observe that boomers tend to be good team members,
but at times are very political, protecting their own turf and
plans for self-promotion. They will not suffer mismanagement in
silence. Show them how they can be a star and you will have their
productivity, the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   _ The 52 million Generation X'ers were born between 1960 and
1989 and suffer being in the shadow of the boomers as much as
second and third children in a family might. To X'ers the job is
``just a job,'' as opposed to the boomers, who ``saw their careers
as great melodramas and heroic endeavors that could consume their
lives,'' the authors write. Fortunately for them, the labor
shortage hit full stride in 1997, and Gen X can finally start to
cash in. Multi-tasking and technological skill are high among that
generation's abilities, but don't give them repetitive tasks;
they'll crater.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the ``nexters,'' born between 1980 and 2000, have yet
another way of approaching work. They may mirror the boomers in
number, with about 72.9 million projected, and destined, like the
boomers, to be one-third of the total population. A generation
dominated by the Internet, that group is surprisingly leaning
toward the same outlook as the veterans. Managers will need to
provide structure and attention similar to the old ways, but at the
same time take on the concept of treating employees as customers,
the authors say.
</P>
<P>
   These insights and more are found in this interesting look at a
cross-section of the work force. Multi-generational work forces are
becoming a strong trend for managers to address.

<P>
   By David J. Lieberman

   St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95
</P>
<P>
   This bestseller is now out in paperback. Written by popular
psychologist David Lieberman, a regular on television, radio and
the lecture circuit, the book describes in great detail ways to
detect lies, as well as what to do about being lied to. Lieberman
comes up with 46 clues in body language alone to determine whether
or not someone is lying to you. The book also provides ways to
attack and/or get the truth out of the person. Helpful for anyone
in business.

</P>
<P>
   Coaching a manager may lead to a better person, but not
necessarily better performance, conclude consultants David Dotlich
and Peter Cairo. Hence, their take on the management consultant
lexicon is ``action coaching.'' They say that they can turn a
manager who is a ``pleasant but unconfident leader'' into a
``decisive, charismatic visionary.'' Their book is the blueprint
for how to create such a manager.

By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the saucy thriller ``The Limey,'' Terence Stamp makes his
turn as Wilson, a cockney ex-con who has come to Los Angeles to
avenge the death of his daughter. This gutter rat, who has spent
most of his daughter Jenny's lifetime in jail, manages to appear as
if he's looking down his nose at the thugs and trolls on LA's
streets, as if he's acting on divine inspiration. As staged by
director Steven Soderbergh (''Out of Sight''), ``The Limey'' is as
merciless and swift as Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also, in the oddest of ways, a sequel. ``Limey''
picks up after the dead-end social drama of ``Poor Cow,'' the 1967
Ken Loach film that was notable at the time for showing a live
birth, and the drab day-to-day lives of Londoners living on welfare
with no prospects. Stamp played the cocky cockney Dave Wilson, who
scampered from one small-time caper to another. Footage of the
lean, handsome young Stamp from ``Poor Cow'' is used for flashback
sequences in ``The Limey.''
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, though, trying to connect ``The Limey'' to
``Poor Cow'' is like laboring to find a pair of Guccis at Kmart.
The Wilson of ``Limey'' is all lethal intent, a career hood who has
spent so much time in jail that the excesses of LA wealth don't
make a lick of sense to him. He finds a friend of his daughter, a
hustler (the always dependable Luis Guzman) who studied acting with
her, who agrees to help the taciturn Brit find the well-guarded
music-biz millionaire with whom Jenny lived at the time of her
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' is stylish and inexorable, like its protagonist.
What it possesses that its hero does not is a sense of humor; it
toys with what its director calls ``'60s baggage.'' Peter Fonda is
the music-business vermin who may have murdered Jenny (Stamp is
convinced of Fonda's guilt, even before we get any evidence. It's
almost as if Soderbergh is carrying on Ken Loach's socialist tenet;
anybody as rich as Fonda has to be guilty of something.)
</P>
<P>
   Fonda is, while not exactly a revelation, something entirely new
here. Rather than the stern, stoic hero he has often played _ a
second-generation Xerox of his father, Henry _ in ``The Limey,''
Peter Fonda is a smug yet affectionate daddy figure. You can see
why Jenny would end up with him; Fonda cares, even though his
concern is a type of self-absorption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Limey'' is about culture clash as much as anything else.
Stamp and Fonda are survivors _ in real life and in this movie _
and the film admires their indomitability. This minor, bloody
valentine to European noir glides handsomely.

`FEVER PITCH': SOCCER FAN, BUT AN UNFIT TEAM PLAYER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Paul Ashworth, a mild-mannered English teacher in London, loves
a good soccer game. ``You see all those thousands of faces
contorted with fear and hope,'' he explains to his new girlfriend,
Sarah Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just for those few minutes you're at the center of the whole
world. And the fact that you care so much, the noise you've made
has been such a crucial part of it, is what makes it special.'' Not
only that, but ``the great thing is that it comes around again and
again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just what Sarah is afraid of.
</P>
<P>
   Paul (Colin Firth) and Sarah (Ruth Gemmell) are the protagonists
of ``Fever Pitch,'' a curious, somewhat awkward film based on Nick
Hornby's best-selling memoir of the same name. Proving yet again
that just because a first-person analysis of a sociocultural
phenomenon is fascinating in print, it should not necessarily be
turned into a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Hornby's explanations of the psychology and sociology of sports
fandom are interesting, but they aren't integrated into the action
and emotion of the story. ``Fever Pitch,'' the movie, is a
standard-issue love story between two characters with different
tastes and personalities.
</P>
<P>
   He's too devoted to soccer (when they go house-hunting, he even
wants to live near the field), and she's bored by it. He has, in
fact, been a fan of a particular London team, Arsenal, since he was
a boy (shown in numerous flashbacks to the late 1960s and early
'70s), and that team now has a chance at the championship. Will the
team win? Will Paul's obsession drive him and Sarah apart?
</P>
<P>
   When the championship game ends and people take to the streets
to express their feelings, the filmmakers seem to think they've
captured some intense communal experience that moviegoers will feel
strongly about.
</P>
<P>
   But the fans haven't developed or lost greater moral character.
They haven't been tested; the team has. If you don't know the team,
and the film keeps its distance from Arsenal, what's to cheer or
cry about?
</P>
<P>
   ``Fever Pitch'' is at its best when it's analyzing. ``Maybe
there's a big bit of you that's gone missing,'' Paul tells Sarah
after she has essentially told him to get over his childhood dream
about the team's success. ``Maybe everyone should want something
they've always wanted.'' But even a 90-minute string of
affirmations wouldn't add up to an affecting film. &QL;

`THE STRAIGHT STORY:' AN UNLIKELY FILMMAKER TAKES ON A G-RATED
CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end) 
(dw) 
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994 an elderly man named Alvin Straight undertook a long
Midwestern journey riding on a lawnmower. It was an arduous feat,
but not nearly as daunting as what David Lynch sets out to do in
``The Straight Story'': make a slow-moving, folksy-looking,
profoundly spiritual film that can hold an audience in absolute
thrall. As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off
such a G-rated miracle, Lynch rises to this challenge with
exhilarating vigor. Switching gears radically, bravely defying
conventional wisdom about what it takes to excite moviegoers, Lynch
presents the flip side of ``Blue Velvet'' and turns it into a
supremely improbable triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Of course this film's wholesome radiance and soothing natural
beauty are distinctly at odds with the famously unwholesome Lynch
imagination. The chasm between the ghoulish malevolence of the
filmmaker's previous ``Lost Highway'' and the decent, forthright
tone of ``The Straight Story'' is almost too huge to fathom. But
the same bellwether quality that left ``Blue Velvet'' looking so
prescient, and ushered in a whole cinematic wave of
taboo-shattering, is at work once again. When a born unnaturalist
like Lynch can bring such interest and emotion to one man's simple
story, the realm of the ordinary starts looking like a new
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that ``The Straight Story'' is as precise and
technically adept as Lynch's other work, and that its effects are
achieved with the same exacting care. The classic opening images of
``Blue Velvet'' are echoed at this film's start, as the camera
takes in a seemingly ordinary house and lawn and Lynch uses sound,
music and staging to build unnerving suspense. The house becomes
eerily quiet and isolated until a sudden event introduces Alvin
Straight, played without a trace of artifice by the veteran actor
Richard Farnsworth. ``The Straight Story'' would not have been
possible without Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its
heart.
</P>
<P>
   For a notion of just how far removed most American movies are
from actual experience, consider the startling effect that
Farnsworth has on screen. This actor, rancher and former stunt man,
enough of a film veteran to have driven a chariot in ``The Ten
Commandments,'' cuts a startling figure as an unabashedly old man.
Unshaven, infirm, scraggly-haired and without makeup, he
automatically frees the film from any sense of artifice and
delivers an amazingly stalwart performance that will not soon be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Alvin lives with his daughter (played by Sissy Spacek) in
Laurens, Iowa, a town where there's never any trouble finding a
parking space on Main Street. His health is failing, and he knows
that his life is about to change. A straightforward sequence in
which Alvin visits a doctor, quietly sizes up the ominous medical
equipment and listens to dire predictions about his health, is
enough to explain his subsequent behavior. Faced with a choice
between aging helplessly in Laurens or having one more meaningful
taste of freedom, Alvin decides to hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, he is on his way to Mount Zion, Wis., in hopes of
finding his estranged brother, who has had a stroke. (The less a
viewer knows about where this journey will lead, the better. The
film builds real suspense about its outcome, and becomes extremely
moving in its final scene.) But in fact Alvin's journey isn't much
about a destination. Lynch, working from a lovely and succinct
screenplay by John Roach and Mary Sweeney, invests each phase of
the trip with resonance about Alvin's life and the lives of those
he meets, so that each encounter takes on an unforced larger
significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Straight Story'' has the curious disadvantage of being
spoken in English and steeped in Americana. Its eloquent,
contemplative spirit is much more indigenous to films from other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the many haunting images here finds Alvin moving along an
open road on his mower, which he rides because he has no driver's
license _ and because he wants to make this one last voyage in his
own way.
</P>
<P>
   The camera pans up, and Angelo Badalamenti's beautiful
folk-influenced score rolls along, until the camera moves down
again _ and finds Alvin almost exactly where he was. ``The Straight
Story'' is more about gazing at the sky, about experiencing each
encounter to the fullest, than it is about getting anywhere in a
hurry. It's been too long since a great American movie dared to
regard life that way.

`THE BOYS': A BOY'S STRUGGLE WITH DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the lethargy that's appalling. Yes, the house that the
Spragues live in is unremittingly ugly and uncared for, from the
dirt-brown air-conditioning unit to the red-tile bathroom walls to
the empty, misshapen wire hangers.
</P>
<P>
   And the family's criminal tendencies _ the police always seem to
be dropping by to question one of them _ is hardly admirable. But
what stays with the moviegoer, after seeing the gloomy, somewhat
plodding but still arresting Australian drama, ``The Boys,'' is the
maddening inertia of its characters, their seeming inability to
take even the smallest action.
</P>
<P>
   The Spragues don't have jobs; they clearly don't read, decorate,
cook or garden a lot; they don't even seem to enjoy the bliss of
leisure. Instead, they spend their days wandering through the
house, a little dazed, or sitting on the sofa, as if waiting for
someone to arrive, for something to start. Nothing ever does.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of ``The Boys,'' which won a batch of awards
from the Australian Film Institute and the Film Critics' Circle of
Australia, is Brett (David Wenham), the oldest son, who has just
returned from prison.
</P>
<P>
   When he brings his mother (Lynette Curran) a Parsons table he
has made and she just stares at it, without a thank you or any
comment at all, it's clear that we are dealing with severe
emotional illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic at work is Brett's return and his re-establishment
as the alpha male in the household. (Dad is nowhere to be seen, and
Mom has a new live-in boyfriend whom the sons look down on because
he is half-Aboriginal.)
</P>
<P>
   One brother, Stevie (Anthony Hayes), has a pregnant live-in
girlfriend, a waif called Nola (Anna Lise), who looks as if she
could bolt at any moment. The other brother, Glenn (John Polson),
has done the unspeakable: he has taken a job, under the influence
of his wife, Jackie (Jeanette Cronin), who thinks he should stop
seeing his bad-influence brothers altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Brett's own love interest is the enthusiastically sensual
Michelle (Toni Collette, whom Americans have seen in films from
``Muriel's Wedding'' to ``The Sixth Sense''). She has waited for
him loyally but _ like his family _ never bothered to visit him.
</P>
<P>
   There is mistrust in the air, no sense of family in a positive
sense and a pervasive coldness that explains a good deal about the
characters' mentality.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sewell, who wrote the screenplay (based on the stage
play ``The Boys'' by Gordon Graham), and Rowan Woods, the director,
have created a believable world down to the last emotional detail.
That is the film's strength. Maybe its weakness, a lack of energy
that mirrors the characters' own, was intentional. &QL;

`JOE THE KING': NOT THE GREATEST FAMILY TO GROW UP IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its stronger moments, Frank Whaley's sincere but wobbly first
film, ``Joe the King,'' conveys the panic, embarrassment and
sinking despair of growing up in a poor, strife-torn household in
upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   This dour little movie, set in the 1970s at the height of the
roller disco craze, is especially good at capturing the mixture of
shame and longing that its adolescent protagonist, Joe Henry (Noah
Fleiss), feels toward his embattled parents, Bob (Val Kilmer) and
Theresa (Karen Young).
</P>
<P>
   As Joe shambles around his bleak working-class neighborhood,
with its cheap restaurants and shabby houses guarded by chain
fences, you empathize with this morose young man drifting through
life, his head hung, searching for signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   You're also reminded that whatever feelings of well-being and
entitlement we carry around tend to originate from our parents'
sense of self-worth. But what if those parents are too
disappointed, harried and angry to provide more than cursory love
and support?
</P>
<P>
   Bob, whom Kilmer plays with a bleary-eyed pugnacity, is a
grade-school janitor who, after losing his job, floats around town
in a state of drunken belligerence.
</P>
<P>
   One of the daily humiliations Joe has to endure is being
accosted by impatient creditors asking him to remind his father
about the money he owes them.
</P>
<P>
   Theresa, whom Ms. Young plays with a curt, whiplash intensity,
is so frazzled from her day job that she has neither the time nor
the energy to feed the family properlyor explosion erupts
one evening when Bob arrives home to discover his dinner consists
of two-day-old spaghetti.
</P>
<P>
   But Theresa has a soft-hearted streak symbolized by her
attachment to the weepy Johnnie Ray hits of her youth. (``The
Little White Cloud That Cried'' emerges as the movie's theme song.)
When Bob, in a fit of rage, destroys those records, you have a
sense of a flickering inner light being extinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Amid this desolation, no wonder Joe resorts to petty thievery.
His first bold heist involves breaking into a car and stealing
jewelry, which he sells to a pawnbroker. His career in crime
culminates with the robbery of his abusive, drunken boss, who owns
the greasy spoon where he works as a dishwasher.
</P>
<P>
   As a first-time screen director, Whaley, an actor best-known for
playing Kevin Spacey's assistant in ``Swimming With Sharks,'' is
adroit at creating an atmosphere that reeks of cooking grease and
motor oil. And he has elicited performances from Kilmer (who
developed a protuberant beer belly for his role) and Ethan Hawke
(as a gawky, ill-dressed high-school guidance counselor) that strip
these actors of their glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Camyrn Manheim also appears in an early flashback as a sadistic
grade-school teacher who traumatizes Joe with a classroom spanking,
and John Leguizamo has a flashy turn as a co-worker in the diner.
</P>
<P>
   But dramatically ``Joe the King'' feels unglued, as if crucial
sequences had been left on the cutting-room floor. Joe has an elder
brother, Mike (Max Ligosh), but the movie barely begins to explore
a deep fraternal bond that has its own set of complications.
</P>
<P>
   A subplot involving Mike's running feud with a bully is
introduced, then abandoned. While individual monologues bring the
characters to life, they seem oddly disconnected. ``Joe the King''
leaves us suspended in the void of its central character's
impoverished imagination.

GILLIAN ANDERSON GETS ANIMATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to Inside Trek, a
weekly science-fiction column with color and black-and-white art.)
 (FOR RELEASE THE WEEK OF MON., OCT. 25, 1999) 
 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Gillian
Anderson with Mitch Pileggi in a scene from ``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Gillian Anderson is unusually animated.
 &HT;    No, not about the seventh and presumably final season of ``The
X-Files,'' though she seems reasonably upbeat about that. But it
would take an alien invasion force to suppress her excitement about
two upcoming films, the animated feature ``Princess Mononoke'' and
the live-action drama ``The House of Mirth.''
 &HT;    ``I just loved the idea of working on a Hayao Miyazaki film,''
Anderson says, referring to the revered Japanese anime director
whose ``Mononoke'' emerged as Japan's highest-grossing home-grown
film. Miramax Films will release an English-language ``Mononoke''
on Oct. 29, featuring the voices of Claire Danes, Billy Crudup,
Minnie Driver and Billy Bob Thornton, with Anderson voicing the
formidable wolf god, Moro.
 &HT;    The complex story follows the adventures of young warrior
Ashitaka (Crudup), who _ despite a curse soon to spell his doom _
strives to restore the fragile balance that once allowed humans to
co-exist with nature and the forest gods.
 &HT;    ``The aspect of almost all of Miyazaki's films that appeals most
to me is the spiritual aspect,'' Anderson says by cellular
telephone after wrapping a day of ``X-Files'' shooting in Los
Angeles. ``Miyazaki films take the environment, nature and respect
for nature as entities in and of themselves. I think it's important
that audiences view that and see nature being so appreciated.
 &HT;    ``Miyazaki's films also have really strong messages,'' she says.
``They're messages that we see now and again, but he delivers them
in a different way, in a more complex and kind of elusive way than
you usually see. He makes you think, and it's not in an immediate
way that you react.
 &HT;    ``The messages strike you subversively and in a very powerful
way.''
 &HT;    This past summer, during her ``X-Files'' hiatus, Anderson filmed
``The House of Mirth.'' Based on Edith Wharton's novel of the same
name, Terence Davies' film stars Anderson as Lily Bart, a
turn-of-the-century woman raised solely to attract and marry a
fabulously wealthy man, and features ravishing cinematography by
Remi Adefarasin, who also shot ``Elizabeth'' (1998).
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, her morals are too high and she just can't bring
herself to commit to men purely for money and not out of love,''
Anderson says. ``Those particular morals end up causing her
downfall.
 &HT;    ``It's a film about paying attention to your instincts, about
honesty and about being true to yourself,'' the actress says. ``If
nothing else, given the way Terence Davies shoots his movies and
the work of Remi Adefarasin, the film will be visually stunning.''
 &HT;    While waiting anxiously for ``Mirth'' to find a distributor,
Anderson is back on the ``X-Files'' set. Season seven kicks off on
Nov. 7 with ``The Sixth Extinction, Part I.''
 &HT;    Written by series mastermind Chris Carter and directed by
``X-Files'' veteran Kim Manners, the episode picks up where the
sixth-season cliffhanger, ``Biogenesis,'' left off.
 &HT;    ``I'm still in Africa,'' Anderson says. ``Mulder's still crazy.
I find some more answers about what is written on the ship and
about the origins of mankind and ... alien-kind.''
 &HT;    Anderson laughs at her own cryptic description. While she's
gotten used to the show's out-there conspiracy/alien/supernatural
mumbo-jumbo and outlandish plots, sometimes she can't help doing a
double-take at herself.
 &HT;    ``You know what's very funny?'' she says. ``Every once in a
while someone will ask me something and I'll say, `I'm sorry, I
can't do that right now _ I'm just about to chase a zombie.' I'll
literally find myself in midsentence, describing something
absolutely ludicrous as if it's the most natural thing in the
world.''
 &HT;    Her conversation may get more normal before long, however.
Though her contract contains an option for an eighth season,
Anderson does not plan to return _ a bombshell which she refuses to
elaborate upon.
 &HT;    ``It's actually impossible for me, for private reasons,'' the
actress says. ``Hopefully they will end up respecting that. But
it's not something I can do.''
 &HT;    Is Anderson at least open to reprising Agent Scully in future
``X-Files'' films, should they come to pass?
 &HT;    ``Absolutely,'' she says.

`THE STORY OF US': TAKE MY HUSBAND, PLEASE, ALONG WITH HIS APRON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Production notes at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Story of Us'' offers such an arthritic vision of
middle-aged marriage that it feels like the first Jack Lemmon
comedy made expressly for the baby boom generation. Perhaps that
would explain the casting of Bruce Willis as a jokey but sensitive
suburban Dad and Michelle Pfeiffer as his beleaguered spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The stars, variously directed by Rob Reiner to kid around, look
wistful or scream so hard that their necks turn red, are not helped
by the film's elbow-in-the-ribs humor or its overbearing tactics.
Though it sets out to explain why this marriage is worth saving,
``The Story of Us'' could prompt even single members of the
audience to file for divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The ``us'' of the title are Katie and Ben Jordan. They have been
married long enough to regard concern about the level of windshield
wiper fluid in the family station wagon (she's careful, he isn't)
as a revealing character trait.
</P>
<P>
   They have two young teen-age children and at family meals
everybody chimes in and makes a game of listing the high and low
points of the day. ``Dinner and dancing'' is Mom and Dad's idea of
a great way to spend their anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   If an air of unreality accompanies this, it should. Katie and
Ben are actually all but estranged and just keeping up appearances
for the children's sake. Then, while the children go to summer
camp, the parents separate and have a chance to review all the
highs and lows of their life together.
</P>
<P>
   This is accomplished with the help of flashbacks involving a
criminal set of wigs and hairpieces (never has Willis' pate been
crowned by anything that looks less like human hair) and such kicky
memories as the time Ben ran around the kitchen wearing nothing but
an apron. The camera is mercifully discreet.
</P>
<P>
   As written by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson, and larded with
references to sigmoidoscopy, prostate trouble, orthodontia, tree
surgery and the caulking of bathroom tile, ``The Story of Us''
means to illustrate the workaday realities that hold the Jordans
together. That would be harmless enough if the film didn't insist
on trumpeting its insights at top volume, relying on heavy shtick
and turning its characters into clowns.
</P>
<P>
   One especially horrible scene finds Katie having lunch with two
other wives, played by Julie Hagerty and Rita Wilson, who are eager
to talk about how to avoid sex with their husbands. When Ms.
Wilson's character suggests that if one husband had behaved better,
his wife ``would have sounded the trumpets, opened the gates and
welcomed the troops home for Christmas,'' she personifies the
film's light touch.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the film's characters sound like aging Catskills
comedians. (Tim Matheson, as a dentist and single father, remarks
about sending his son to camp: ``Oh, please! The minute my Kevin
gets off that bus it's goodbye bite plate!'') Many also play their
roles with Reiner's familiar hand-waving mannerisms, which are
funnier when they come straight from him.
</P>
<P>
   The score by Eric Clapton and Marc Shaiman features a light
samba that would not be out of place in a Las Vegas lounge act.
Sets of married friends imagine one another as Fred and Ethel
Mertz.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the whole film is at its creakiest, Willis and Ms.
Pfeiffer are joined in one scene by Tom Poston, Jayne Meadows,
Betty White and Red Buttons as their parents. (The latter two sing
``Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree With Anyone Else but Me.'') Not
even in this company do Ben and Katie seem young at heart. &QL;

RED SOX-YANKEES FIGHT IS MUCH MORE COMPELLING THAN GOP VS. DEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is the time of year you're a damn fool
Philistine if you're doing anything but watching baseball.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a New Englander or a New Yorker and you're not
watching baseball, you should be forced to stand in the corner and
say ``Nomar Garciaparra'' 500 times without pronouncing any Rs.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are playing the Yankees for the right to take their
curse to a higher level, and perhaps lose a World Series to the
Mets. That is a more compelling struggle than you'll ever see
between Republicans and Democrats or between San Francisco Mayor
Willie Brown and the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   The drama is all the greater because Red Sox fans really think
their team can win the World Series. They really do, despite all
the publicity about New Englanders' baseball fatalism.
</P>
<P>
   My dad was born three years after the Sox won their last Series
in 1918 and watched games from the roof of his father's wool
warehouse next door to Fenway Park. Optically speaking, he could
see only three-quarters of each game, but optimistically speaking
he has been a Red Sox believer all these years.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox fans such as my dad (or me, if the Sox are still playing
after the Giants' season) are like Giants fans. They always
complain and grouse, but they always believe.
</P>
<P>
   This is a glorious time for New Englanders, even we reformed
ones who never had that wicked accent. The leaves are turning back
home, and the team hasn't turned on us yet. These are the days
before we lose.
</P>
<P>
   I admit it. We're realistic optimists, or hopeful pessimists, or
whatever that son-of-a-Connecticut Yankee George W. Bush would call
it.
</P>
<P>
   But the question is why we here become mentally distant from the
San Francisco Bay area when the Yankees are playing the Red Sox in
the playoffs. We don't want to live in New England or New York.
</P>
<P>
   We go back and visit just to see how good we have it in San
Francisco, and to stay in hotel rooms cheaper than our apartments.
</P>
<P>
   It's been weird to sit in the placid, food and fitness-obsessed
bay area and watch the crowds at Jacobs Field in Cleveland and
Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   I've lived in both of those towns, would never live in either
again, but I have the strangest pangs for them whenever their
baseball teams are in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   People are genetically nuts about their sports teams in those
kinds of towns. The most frightening riot I ever saw in the '60s
was in Kenmore Square in 1967 when the Red Sox won the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of people were almost trampled when the word flashed
through the crowd that the police had released the dogs. It's the
dogs who should have been scared.
</P>
<P>
   There's too much to do in San Francisco and the bay area. You
can have multiple lives, and never have to live it through a team _
although many do, and good luck to them with the Niners.
</P>
<P>
   A civic life that revolves around a team can be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The team may be composed of high-priced mercenaries and owned by
a profiteering jerk, but the fans own them with their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   They and their parents and grandparents made the payments over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   Giants fans are like that, but all of San Francisco doesn't
revolve around the team. It's good to have lots of things to do
besides live vicariously through the adventures of men in tight
pants. But a serious American city has to shake, rattle and roll
during a World Series without an act of God or plate tectonics.
</P>
<P>
   For further evidence that San Francisco may not be an entirely
serious city (as if anyone would argue it is), consider Willie
Brown's wavering campaign to take shopping carts away from the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   First he is. Then he isn't. The homeless advocates claim the
shopping carts are works of art, in a blatant attempt to
Giuliani-ize Brown. But Willie Brown is no Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
of New York.
</P>
<P>
   He's not nearly decisive enough. Nor is he a down-to-earth Mayor
Thomas Menino of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It's a great week to forget San Francisco's bush-league politics
and watch some major-league real life in Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
   In other news that proves life is the toy department of sports:
Wilt Chamberlain died and what a legend. Does it matter that most
people will remember him for his achievements on the percale rather
than on the parquet?
</P>
<P>
   The basketball great claimed he slept with 20,000 women, which
works out to about more women in an year of his adult life than
there are days. Right now probably half a million women are
claiming to have slept with him. Or maybe none.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the amount of time he spent taking off and putting on
his shoes alone.
</P>
<P>
   That was a man, and maybe his physical efforts off the court
explain his inability to conquer Bill Russell of the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Loved that 1993 line of Chamberlain's: ``I could believe in
abstinence, but I don't know how long I could sustain it.''

`FIGHT CLUB': SUCH A VERY LONG WAY FROM DUVETS TO DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JANET MASLIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the two current films in which buttoned-down businessmen
rebel against middle-class notions of masculinity, David Fincher's
savage ``Fight Club'' is by far the more visionary and disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``American Beauty'' hinges on the subversive allure of a
rose-covered blond cheerleader, Fincher has something a good deal
tougher in mind. The director of ``Seven'' and ``The Game'' for the
first time finds subject matter audacious enough to suit his
lightning-fast visual ication, and puts that style to
stunningly effective use.
</P>
<P>
   Lurid sensationalism and computer gamesmanship left this
filmmaker's earlier work looking hollow and manipulative. But the
sardonic, testosterone-fueled science fiction of ``Fight Club''
touches a raw nerve.
</P>
<P>
   In a film as strange and single-mindedly conceived as ``Eyes
Wide Shut,'' Fincher's angry, diffidently witty ideas about
contemporary manhood unfold. As based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk
(and deftly written by Jim Uhls), it builds a huge,
phantasmagorical structure around the search for lost masculine
authority, and attempts to psychoanalyze an entire society in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Complete with an even bigger narrative whammy than the one that
ends ``The Sixth Sense,'' this film twists and turns in ways that
only add up fully on the way out of the theater and might just
require another viewing. Fincher uses his huge arsenal of tricks to
bury little hints at what this story is really about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' has two central figures, the milquetoast narrator
played by Edward Norton and his charismatic, raging crony played by
Brad Pitt. The narrator has been driven to the edge of his sanity
by a dull white-collar job, an empty fondness for material things
(``I'd flip through catalogues and wonder what kind of dining set
defined me as a person'') and the utter absence of anything to make
him feel alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tormented by insomnia, he finds his only relief in going to
meetings of 12-step support groups, where he can at least cry. The
film hurtles along so smoothly that its meaningfully bizarre
touches, like Meat Loaf Aday as a testicular cancer patient with
very large breasts, aren't jarring at all.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator finds a fellow 12-step addict in Marla, played with
witchy sensuality by Helena Bonham Carter and described by the
script as ``the little scratch on the roof of your mouth that would
heal if only you could stop tonguing it _ but you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   As that suggests, Marla's grunge recklessness makes a big
impression on the film's narrator, and can mostly be blamed for
setting the story in motion. Soon after meeting her he is on an
airplane, craving any sensation but antiseptic boredom, and he
meets Pitt's Tyler Durden in the next seat. Surveying the bourgeois
wimp he nicknames Ikea Boy, Tyler asks all the hard questions.
Like: ``Why do guys like you and I know what a duvet is?''
</P>
<P>
   Norton, drawn into Tyler's spell, soon forsakes his tidy ways
and moves into the abandoned wreck that is ground central for
Tyler. Then Tyler teaches his new roommate to fight in a nearby
parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The tacitly homoerotic bouts between these two men become
addictive (as does sex with Marla), and their fight group expands
into a secret society, all of which the film presents with the
curious matter-of-factness of a dream. Somehow nobody gets hurt
badly, but the fights leave frustrated, otherwise emasculated men
with secret badges of not-quite-honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fight Club'' watches this form of escapism morph into
something much more dangerous. Tyler somehow builds a bridge from
the anti-materialist rhetoric of the 1960s (``It's only after we've
lost everything that we're free to do anything'') into the kind of
paramilitary dream project that Ayn Rand might have admired.
</P>
<P>
   The group's rigorous training and subversive agenda are as
deeply disturbing to Norton's mild-mannered character as Tyler's
original wild streak was thrilling. But even when acts of terrorism
are in the offing, he can't seem to tear himself away.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kevin Smith's ``Dogma,'' ``Fight Club'' sounds offensive
from afar. If watched sufficiently mindlessly, it might be mistaken
for a dangerous endorsement of totalitarian tactics and
super-violent nihilism in an all-out assault on society.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a much less gruesome film than ``Seven'' and a
notably more serious one. It means to explore the lure of violence
in an even more dangerously regimented, dehumanized culture. That's
a hard thing to illustrate this powerfully without, so to speak,
stepping on a few toes.
</P>
<P>
   In an expertly shot and edited film spiked with clever
computer-generated surprises, Fincher also benefits, of course,
from marquee appeal. The teamwork of Norton and Pitt is as
provocative and complex as it's meant to be.
</P>
<P>
   Norton, an ingenious actor, is once again trickier than he
looks. Pitt struts through the film with rekindled brio and a
visceral sense of purpose. He's right at home in a movie that warns
against worshiping false idols.
</P>

ROOKIE `RYAN' ANOTHER MEDIOCRE ATTEMPT BY FOX TO COLLAR YOUNG MEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A baby-faced Ryan struts through the pilot episode of ``Ryan
Caulfield: Year One'' with this cheesy grin stapled to his face, as
content as any carefree fellow with a PlayStation, a rent-free
environment and no pressure from college exams. We learn early on
what's really behind Ryan's glee: He's a cop. He's a 19-year-old as
wide-eyed and cocky as they come, until the first day, when bullets
whiz past his head and into the body of a suspect holding a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Played with charming naivete by Sean Maher, Ryan quickly learns
that this isn't like the movies, that people die, that real blood
flows.
</P>
<P>
   ``A month ago, it was PlayStation games,'' Ryan's teary-eyed
mother says to him as he poses in the mirror in full blue. ``Now
it's your nightstick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, turning and flashing that wide grin, utters: ``It's cool,
huh?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm not completely sold on this show's coolness, but its
demographic game plan is certainly airtight. Fox is continuing the
young audience hunt by putting a young face on an old genre. Making
it a male face and firing bullets at it is an all-out counterattack
on the female-friendly ``Providence'' racking up viewers on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The early minutes of ``Ryan Caulfield'' _ when a gunman mows
down a half-dozen people, including a cop _ serves notice that this
is more ``NYPD Blue'' realism than ``Nash Bridges'' inanity.
</P>
<P>
   As Ryan and his partner arrive on the scene, dead people are
everywhere, and the rookie is frozen. ``It's not real unless you
smell it,'' Ryan says in a voice-over. ``It's like blood mixed with
sweat and oil. This guy's really dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Ryan is in a tux attending his girlfriend's
sorority bash, but he can't get those dead faces out of his head.
He leaves, wondering how these people can have such a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you had a bad day,'' his peeved girlfriend says when
confronting him later. ``But that was no reason to blow off the
formal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Caulfield,'' arriving late to a Friday lineup that's off
and running, wants to show how a young cop balances two worlds: the
harsh reality of being a police officer and the often-carefree
existence of being a young adult. Friday's opening episode
introduces this premise, and next week's installment rolls it out
big time, with messy results.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that Ryan's lifelong buddies are supposed to show
that he's got a foot in the other world, but they merely get in the
way. Vic (James Roday) is supposedly something of an academic wiz,
yet he works at a gas station, spewing intellectual whatevers about
his disdain for organized education. Vic's musings are merely
annoying, particularly next week, after he's robbed at gunpoint and
freaks out. ``H'' (Chad Lindberg) is another slacker who'd rather
be anywhere than working in his family plumbing business, where he
complains about getting hit on by lonely homemakers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Susser (Michael Rispoli) is Ryan's partner, a veteran
cop with an affinity for Donna Summer and no life whatsoever
outside the precinct.
</P>
<P>
   Where Kim Veras (Roselyn Sanchez) fits in is harder to detect.
She's also a rookie but is five years older than Ryan. At one
point, Ryan strolls into the locker room and catches Kim in bra and
underwear. She doesn't flinch, instead telling Ryan to chill, that
she grew up with brothers, that this wasn't a big deal. But the sly
grin on her face said flirtation to me; next week, she informs Ryan
that her dress for the police social ``has a slit on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   The drama series is produced and written by the same people who
gave us ``The Negotiator,'' which explains the talky, tense feel,
and that film's poster on Ryan's wall. ``The Negotiator'' director
F. Gary Gray, whose work includes the female shoot-'em-up ``Set It
Off,'' directed the pilot, which has its edgy moments but relies
too much on coming-of-age dialogue that sounds far too touchy-feely
for a hard-boiled guy like Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``On one of those good days,'' Ryan reflects after ending a day
frolicking in a mud puddle with his buddies, ``I can set things
right in both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Ryan Caulfield'' opens with some gripping scenes, so
far its characters are sketchy and lack spark. In a season in which
one comedy (''The Mike O'Malley Show'') has been axed after two
episodes and another show (''Manchester Prep'') was benched even
before it aired, ``Ryan Caulfield'' simply doesn't have the luxury
of growing up on the job.

`GORE VIDAL, A BIOGRAPHY': LONG AND SHORT OF GORE VIDAL'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accompanying Gore Vidal and his lifelong companion Howard Austen
to the cemetery in Rock Creek Park in Washington to visit their
chosen grave sites, Fred Kaplan notes ``the irony of the biographer
being consulted about the burial circumstances.'' Earlier,
consenting to Vidal's request to write his biography, Kaplan had
observed that ``I prefer my subjects dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The exchange makes a whimsical, even a charming prelude, but
Kaplan, author of biographies of Dickens, Carlyle and Henry James,
was dead right in his preferring.
</P>
<P>
   True, he has avoided the obvious pitfall in treating a subject
who is still alive, who has chosen him to record his life and who
has made himself, his friends and his papers almost unstintingly
available. Vidal agreed not to interfere with the writing; he also
agreed not to read the result prior to publication _ just about
now, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in ``Gore Vidal, a Biography'' is a different one.
Living accessibility seems to have substituted ``because it is
there'' for a more searching answer to the why that must underly
any biography and determine its approach, voice and dimension. As
to the last: at 850 pages with photographs and notes, the book
joins the contemporary fashion for megalography: cutting the
biographical suit too large for the subject and with cloth yards to
spare.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal is a valuable writer but a minor one: most valuable for
his trenchant and elegant essays up-ending both received and
contrarian American wisdoms; most minor in a fiction that ranges
from several skillful historical novels to others which, lacking
the crutch of fact, call for a fictional autonomy and artistry that
the writer has tried for all his life though never very
successfully.
</P>
<P>
   There can be major biographical and autobiographical writing,
long or short, about relatively minor subjects. Think of Samuel
Johnson's ``Life of Richard Savage'' (short) or Henry Adams'
``Education'' (medium long) or for that matter his letters (six
volumes). The point is not the size of the figure but the size of
the life the writer is able to find or, to put it differently, the
distance the writer travels finding it. With so much material so
easily at hand (though an unconscionable amount is social
chitchat), Kaplan settled for a short journey expounded at length.
</P>
<P>
   The facts are all there. Vidal was born to various kinds of
privilege and one horrendous deprivation. His maternal grandfather,
Thomas Gore, was a senator from Oklahoma and both a populist and a
defender of oil interests. His father was an airline pioneer, the
country's first director of civil aviation.
</P>
<P>
   Brought up in Washington, where his family had strong social and
political connections, Gore attended the posh St. Albans school and
later Phillips Exeter Academy. The deprivation _ detailed painfully
and well by Kaplan _ was his mother, Nina: beautiful, alcoholic,
promiscuous and sometimes violent. She left Gore's father for the
first of several husbands: the wealthy Hugh Auchincloss, later
stepfather to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis.
</P>
<P>
   From his school days he wrote assiduously. His first novel,
``Williwaw,'' received good reviews. In 1948 ``The City and the
Pillar,'' with its outspoken homosexual theme, sold well while
causing some critical dismay. Kaplan writes of these books and the
many that followed with general admiration but little effective
evocation or critical insight.
</P>
<P>
   One page about a book will be followed by six about Vidal's
travels in intersecting worlds: high and cafe society, literary and
artistic cohorts, jet-setters and expatriates, Hollywood and a gay
network extending from celebrities to processions of hired boys
(topolini) through his apartment in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Names are dropped: the Kennedys, connected through Jackie (Jack
encouraged an unsuccessful race for Congress from Gore's Hudson
River home), Tennessee Williams (hilarious travel companion and
fellow topolino hunter), William F. Buckley and Norman Mailer
(celebrated feuds), Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward (buddies and
housemates), Princess Margaret, the Partisan Review and New York
Review of Books crowds and a slew of British and American writers.
</P>
<P>
   Residences are bought and cherished (Hudson River, Rome and
Gore's present house in Ravello, Italy). A great deal of money is
earned from television drama, screen writing, two successful
Broadway plays and the big sales of his historical books and the
sensational ``Myra Breckenridge.'' It allowed luxurious travel and
living and psychological altitude. Vidal needed to shoot his
literary darts from above. (I like the darts; the acrophilia
somewhat less).
</P>
<P>
   From his youth, Gore was torn between writing and a delusional
hope of matching the political career of his grandfather. It was
the least serious of his splits. He craved celebrity and was good
at it; at the same time he aspired to be a real artist. He divided
his writing between what he succeeded with and seemingly despised,
and what he failed with and seemingly loved. ``I want to keep the
separation distinct, as much as possible, between my hack writing,
however charming, and the serious novels, no matter how dull.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan expounds the contradictions plausibly, but it is the
plausibility of dedicated celebrity journalism and, at such length,
dismayingly flat. He can't pierce Vidal's skillful mask-making, nor
does he much try. The friends he interviews couldn't either: they
were variably fond or dazzled, and invariably puzzled.
</P>
<P>
   Vidal gives his biographer lots of surface and few openings. His
several romantic attachments to women _ Claire Bloom, Anais Nin,
the actress Diana Lynn _ were, to bowdlerize and reverse Erica
Jong, sexless zips. Sex has been almost exclusively with men, but,
Vidal insists, it has been divorced from sentiment. ``I am
depressed,'' he has an alter ego character say, ``partly at time's
passage . . . and at the glum realization that I forgot to arrange
to have sex today.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan recognizes the posturing but doesn't get past it. He
makes no attempt to sound out Gore's lifelong relationship with his
companion and domestic manager, Austen. Except at the start, there
was apparently no sex; clearly there is something deeper, but we do
not learn what it is. The biography has much more detail than
Vidal's own semimemoir, ``Palimpsest,'' and some is scandalous.
Making the facts freely available, though, Vidal keeps successful
control of the insights. His openness is pre-emptive: a tour of a
shrewdly arranged Potemkin village.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan had warning. He notes that ``Palimpsest'' is ``a
nonintrospective memoir without a center of consciousness.'' Early
in their talks Vidal told him: ``I don't know how you are going to
do this because there isn't anything there.'' It was a red flag, if
you like, but biographers _ particularly with the prospect of
unlimited access _ are bulls. It is Kaplan, though, who has been
Gored.

IT SEEMS TO BE BROSIUS' TIME OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the Yankees' old Mr. October were a brash,
spotlight-loving superstar, consider it a twist of fate that their
new Mr. October is a soft-spoken, aw-shucks kid out of Oregon who
came to the big city by way of the sleepy Oakland A's franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Surely you remember Scott Brosius, 1998 World Series MVP. The
ex-Athletic is well on his way to stirring memories of Reggie
Jackson _ and ALCS MVP honors _ if he keeps up his 3-for-4,
two-RBI, two-runs-scored performance from Game 1's 4-3, 10-inning
win over the Red Sox on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I l postseason,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously.
</P>
<P>
   It was Brosius who lit a fire under stunned Yankee Stadium by
closing a 3-0 Boston lead to 3-2 when he pumped a Kent Mercker
changeup over the left-field wall in the second inning. And it was
Brosius who churned home from second base _ after doubling _ on
Derek Jeter's RBI single in the seventh inning, his magic aura
almost the reason why Boston catcher Jason Varitek muffed the relay
that would have rung him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had nowhere to go on the play,'' Brosius said, making
his safe arrival at the plate that much more vexing to the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   This postseason is especially meaningful for Brosius, who
endured the death of his father on Sept. 12 from colon cancer. He
missed five games in late August and early September to visit with
his father in Oregon, to say his goodbyes and then return to his
job playing third base for the defending champions. Many of his
teammates after Game 1 spoke of Brosius' loss, and Yankee manager
Joe Torre praised Brosius' steely focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a tough year emotionally,'' Torre said. ``Nobody else
had to live with what he did. And he was still the same guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brosius: ``When this whole thing is said and done, I think
that is when it will really affect me. But this time of year I'm
not supposed to be away. I am out playing baseball.''

   There's a lot of wit in the Eameses' work. The California-based
couple clowned around with Good Design even as they personified it.
But there is nothing doubled-edged, sardonic or arch about their
work. Toward the end of their careers, when irony did overtake
them, it was because the times had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Donald Albrecht, adjunct curator for special
projects at Cooper-Hewitt, the show offers a first-rate look at a
fantastic subject. Besides highlighting the work of two major
designers, the show examines the vision of postwar America that
they imagined. More than 500 objects, arranged on two floors,
document the tables, chairs, fabrics, environments, movies and
other artifacts produced by the Eames office from 1941 to 1984. The
show is a shrine to the belief that the world really can be changed
by good design.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was first mounted earlier this year at the
Library of Congress, holder of the vast Eames archives. Here, as in
Washington, the show is presented within a fine installation
designed by the Los Angeles architects Craig Hodgetts and Ming
Fung. This is a happy meeting of minds.
</P>
<P>
   No one has replaced the Eameses, but Hodgetts and Ms. Fung are
the closest we have to their heirs among the rock-and-roll
generation. This husband-wife team, based in Los Angeles and
equally blessed with that city's sunny disposition, has also
distinguished itself in the field of exhibition design with
intelligence and verve.
</P>
<P>
   Husband-wife design teams are thick on the ground these days,
but the Eameses invented the type. They met in the late 1930s at
the Cranbrook Academy of Art, outside Detroit, where Charles Eames
was an instructor and Ray Kaiser a student. They married in 1941
and headed for Los Angeles that summer, settling in what was then
the country's major center of munitions production. The Eameses set
their sights on developing a utopian vision of American life after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The vision crystallized in 1949 with the completion of their own
house in Pacific Palisades. Set in the lush, sloping landscape of a
eucalyptus woods, the two-story house was fashioned from
prefabricated industrial hardware. It was one of a group of what
were called Case Study Houses, low-cost prototypes commissioned by
John Entenza, editor of the groundbreaking Arts and Architecture
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   With its open plan and its integration of structure with
landscape, the Eames house translated into high-tech forms the
democratic ethos Frank Lloyd Wright had earlier explored in his
prairie houses. With the Eameses, as with Wright, the Japanese
influence is pronounced, evident not only in the simple, tatami
matlike rhythm of walls, floors and ceilings, but in the attempt to
displace Western ideas of art with the Eastern art of living.
Pottery, flowers, the arrangement of food on a plate, shells,
pebbles and antiques were embraced in the Eameses' effort to adapt
an Eastern esthetic for Western use.
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht was also the curator of ``Building the American
Dream,'' a show presented several years ago at the National
Building Museum in Washington. One of the most important design
exhibitions in recent years, that show analyzed the mythology of
the postwar suburban consumer society as a tool for keeping
peacetime production at wartime levels.
</P>
<P>
   At Cooper-Hewitt we see a rosier view of the same material. Out
there, on the Pacific Rim, emerged Homo California, a
hunter-gatherer species that lived in clean machines surrounded by
eucalyptus trees and posed no threat to nature, ho ho ho.
</P>
<P>
   One item was featured in both shows: a leg splint of molded
plywood designed by the Eameses for military use in 1942. The
following year Ray Eames turned one of the splints into a se
of Noguchi-like contour. This fusion of can-do resourcefulness with
sensuous appeal is quintessentially Eamsian. Come on now, shake a
leg! They do, in a selection of the plywood, fiberglass and
metal-wire chairs with which the Eameses furnished America at
mid-century.
</P>
<P>
   Neurasthenic types will head for La Chaise, a molded fiberglass
chair designed in 1948. With its Arp-like biomorphic shell, its
asymmetrical curves, this is the modern equivalent of a Victorian
fainting couch. Pass the lavender salts, please.
</P>
<P>
   Those not ashamed to settle into shopworn cliche will want the
leather and molded rosewood lounge chair, paired with a matching
ottoman, that the team designed for Herman Miller in 1956. Albrecht
says this was not the Eameses' own favorite among their works. The
chair is wildly comfortable but has never freed itself from the
Junior Executive status it acquired in the 1960's.
</P>
<P>
   Albrecht describes the well-known plywood side chair as a
brilliant failure. Starting in 1941, the couple had tried to
develop a chair from a single piece of molded plywood, but they
never found a form that gave sufficient strength to the curving
section between seat and back. What they lost in simplicity they
gained in figurative charm. These are like domesticated animals,
four-legged creatures with smooth coats.
</P>
<P>
   The wire chairs are incomplete Saul Steinberg cartoons, needing
only an overweight adult to deliver the punch line.
Three-dimensional objects made from precisely shaped black lines,
they come as close as furniture gets to drawing in space. Combining
voluptuousness and austerity, they are a statement of moral faith
in American power. Since they don't block light, views or
reflections, these chairs are ideal for people who live in glass
houses.
</P>
<P>
   The chairs are presented amid a background of molds, prototypes
and photographs depicting the manufacturing process. The effect is
to make the process equal in importance to the product. Like
conceptual artists, the Eameses gained hold of the tools of modern
industry and proceeded to play them like instruments.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Peter Smithson, the British architect and planner, observed that
the Eameses had the sensibility of an ad man. Since Smithson was a
fan, I assume the comparison was kindly intended. Two displays in
the show suggest that the Eameses were indeed Renaissance
cut-and-paste people. On the ground floor Hodgetts and Ms. Fung
have recreated bulletin boards from the designers' studios.
Christmas cards, photographs, art show invitations and other
ephemera convey the wide-ranging curiosity of these designers and
their talent for drawing the world around them into their work.
</P>
<P>
   On the second floor a light table presents a selection of images
from the Eameses' slides, pictures gathered on travels, in the
street, the backyard, the kitchen. The table is an Information Age
mosaic, an altar to the everyday.
</P>
<P>
   The second floor traces the Eameses' transition from industrial
production to information management, a field that dominates design
today. Working with the U.S. government, and with major corporate
clients like IBM and Polaroid, they sent their work on the road
with elaborate, multimedia promotional shows.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 Moscow Fair is best remembered as the site of the
``Kitchen Debate'' between Richard M. Nixon and Nikita S.
Khrushchev. But the fair was also distinguished by ``Glimpses of
the USA,'' a startling piece of cinematic propaganda created by the
Eames office. The film was projected on seven screens mounted
inside a dome designed by Buckminster Fuller. In the Cooper-Hewitt
show, a photograph of Charles Eames' head inside a model of the
dome suggests a Western version of Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   To an extent the Eameses were Cold War casualties. ``The World
of Washington and Jefferson,'' presented at the Metropolitan Museum
of Art in 1976, turned out to be their Waterloo. This elaborate,
mixed-media salute to the Founding Fathers, underwritten by IBM,
was the work of two smart cookies who had fallen conspicuously out
of touch. By the Bicentennial year the liberal consensus culture
had been dead for nearly a decade; Vietnam, ``Silent Spring'' and
Watergate had intervened, and the collaboration between art and
industry no longer seemed so benign.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not in the Eameses' nature to walk away from the
optimistic frame of mind they had helped to construct. Problems
would always arise in democracy, and they could always be solved,
by design.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   By chance the Eames show coincides with the Whitney Museum of
American Art's presentation of the second in its two-part survey of
20th-century American art. A comparison is instructive. At the
Whitney a wall plaque informs us that the leading theme of the art
on view is the desire to bring art into closer proximity with life.
While the Whitney show doesn't begin to prove its case, the Eames
show conveys this idea with precision and depth.
</P>
<P>
   In the process it suggests that the Eameses' work prefigures the
art movements that came later. Ideas from Pop, Minimalist,
Conceptual, Process, Povera and Media Art are all present in the
1949 house, even as the building's strong, rectangular lines
mirrored the geometric abstraction of the designers' own
generation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Apart from irony, the New York art movements of the 1960s, '70s
and '80s could add little to what the Eameses had already achieved
by 1950. Artists could only subtract, isolating this or that facet
of the whole: popular culture, industrial process, media power.
This isolation had its uses, but bringing art into closer proximity
with life was not one of them. In fact the reverse was true.
Relocating a soup can from a supermarket to a gallery only
reinforced art's privileged place outside life.
</P>
<P>
   The Eameses' nomadic esthetic worked for them because they
worked for it. They were artists and designers. The spaces, objects
and images they created had nothing to do with consumption. Rather,
the esthetic resulted from an ongoing, humanist process of
self-creation. Their work was all action, perhaps especially when
it demanded contemplation. Their power was the power to be moved.

   A Big Increase In DVD Outlets
</P>
<P>
   It's taken a while, but Blockbuster has opened its doors _ all
of them _ to DVD. Since the digital videodisc was introduced in
1997, the country's largest video chain has been gradually giving
DVD a try, increasing the number of stores carrying the format to
900 of 4,500 wholly owned and franchised outlets. By the end of the
year nearly all of the stores will carry about 200 titles for rent
and an additional 50 for sale.
</P>
<P>
   About 4 million households are expected to have DVD players by
the new year, and Blockbuster cites industry projections that the
number will grow to 40 to 50 million by 2007. ``We've been
following consumer demand,'' a company spokeswoman said. For the
last two years, DVD supporters have called on Blockbuster to help
create demand, not follow it, but with VCR sales continuing to be
very strong, the big chains have taken their time with the disc.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason is that, DVD or cassette, Blockbuster stresses
movie rental over sales while the studios favor selling the discs
to consumers. Nevertheless, the DVD tide has begun to flow in the
big rental establishments. ``It's the medium of the future,'' said
Joe Malugen, chairman of Movie Gallery, the country's third largest
video chain, with about 1,000 stores. ``Probably in five years
we'll be about 50-50 DVDs and VCRs.''
</P>
<P>
   Malugen sees a gradual transition. ``Our stores tend to be in
more rural and suburban settings, so the rollout for DVD will be a
little slower than it would be in New York City,'' he said. As with
Blockbuster, there is no inclination to push matters. ``We'll be
providing it as the demand is there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, how long will the cassette or DVD go before there is
significant competition from cable, satellite and other methods of
delivery? ``Ten years from now I can't tell you what the technology
will be for watching movies, but over the next five years, home
video will be a very strong medium,'' Malugen said.
</P>
<P>
   `Shoah' Returns  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``La fin du voyage'' reads the caption as the railway tracks
lead into the concentration camp at Auschwitz. After seven years
out of circulation, ``Shoah'' (in Hebrew, ``Annihilation''), Claude
Lanzmann's monumental 9-hour, 22-minute documentary about the
Holocaust has returned to video in a new four-cassette edition from
New Yorker, to be released Oct. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Not a documentary in the conventional sense, the film puts
together eyewitness accounts of survivors and perpetrators and all
manner of individuals caught in between. ``The unspeakable is
spoken,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker bought the rights to ``Shoah'' in 1985 and sold them
to Paramount which released the film on video until it was
discontinued. A New Yorker spokesman said that increased interest
in the Holocaust warranted a reissue. For now the set is priced as
a rental title at $299.98, though it can be bought from Amazon.com
and various stores. After about a year, he added, there could be a
reduction. &QL;

   After a bizarre attempt on her life, Allegra Geller (Jennifer

virtual-reality game, escapes into her own creation. Melding ideas
about an artist and her creation with stomach-turning psychological
horror, David Cronenberg's film has all the throbbing, ghoulish
hallmarks of his other fever dreams. For company in hiding, Allegra
has her prototype meta-flesh game pod, a lump with several nipples.
Eating something ghastly in a Chinese restaurant, an admirer (Jude

hippie (Viggo Mortensen), whom she meets at the colony. As a woman
caught in a sexual dilemma, Ms. Lane movingly captures the problem
of someone married at 17 yearning for freedom. Even when it turns
turbulent, Tony Goldwyn's film ``sustains its warm summer glow, and
makes itself a conversation piece about the moral issues it means
to raise'' (Maslin).

London in the '70s and he can only envy his friend Toni (Lee Ross),
who writes poetry and roams the world. Philip Saville's film is

JULIUS NYERERE, FOUNDING FATHER WHO LED TANZANIA FOR 24 YEARS, IS
DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: An abridged version will follow) 
(jt) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julius K. Nyerere, the idealistic, principled and some would say
naively misguided founding father of Tanzania, died Thursday at St.
Thomas' Hospital in London. The man who led his country into
independence and guided it for nearly three decades was 77 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere was being treated in London for chronic leukemia and
suffered a major stroke last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, an uncharacteristically humble and modest national
leader whose preferred honorific was Mwalimu, the Swahili word for
teacher, was in the first generation of politicians to lead newly
independent African states as colonialism ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   He also used East Africa as a stage on which to play a leading
role in the debate over economic inequalities between the Northern
ad Southern Hemispheres, spreading his intensely socialist
philosophy worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When he guided what had been the British Trust Territory of
Tanganyika into sovereignty in 1961, he was the youngest of the
continent's triumphant nationalists, a group that included Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia
and Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   When he stepped down as president 24 years later, he was only
the third modern African leader to relinquish power voluntarily on
a continent that by then included 50 independent states. He went
neither to jail nor into exile, but to a farm in Butiama, his home
village, on the shore of Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere ascended to power without a single shot being fired,
becoming prime minister and then president of a land that at the
time contained 9 million people affiliated with more than 120
tribes, stretching from Lake Victoria and Lake Tanganyika down to
the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the poorest countries in the world. Its mostly
illiterate citizens were scattered over remote regions, often
unable to find a common language, though they shared ample rigors
as they wrested a meager subsistence from the soil or the sea.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Nyerere gave up the last vestiges of political power
in 1990, when he retired as chairman of the single political party,
Tanzania had undergone staggering, often traumatic, changes.
</P>
<P>
   The population had doubled, to more than 20 million. It had
merged with Zanzibar in 1964. Almost 70 percent of the people had
been prodded to move from traditional lands into paternalistically
planned villages _ ujamma _ in what became Africa's largest and
most debated example of social engineering.
</P>
<P>
   After vast investment in education, literacy rose phenomenally,
and 83 percent of Tanzanians were able to read and write. Nyerere
also succeeded in promoting Swahili so that it superceded dozens of
tribal tongues to become a true national language.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western countries, notably the Scandinavians, were so
impressed that they provided billions of dollars, making Tanzania
one of the 10 largest recipients of foreign aid per capita.
</P>
<P>
   But it was still one of the poorest countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The year he left his party post, the World Bank reported that
Tanzanians were surviving on a per-capita income of $200 a year,
and that the economy had shrunk on average half a percentage point
a year between 1965 and 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Nyerere's leadership extended beyond his tenure,
with academics, politicians and development strategists often
dividing sharply over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   His domestic and international defenders, generally people of
the left, praised his emphasis on social investments and his
egalitarian economic policies, crediting them with creating a
culturally cohesive nation that had avoided ethnic conflict while
life expectancy, literacy and access to water increased.
</P>
<P>
   His Tanzanian supporters took pride in Nyerere's reputation as
one of the most prominent proponents of a ``New Economic Order''
that would benefit the developing south in economic relations with
the industrial north.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere also gained international prestige for his principled
support of the struggles for majority rule in South Africa,
Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Angola, and for Tanzania's
military counteroffensive against Idi Amin of Uganda, which routed
the dictator and sent him into exile. The Third World honored him
and he won the evident respect of such Western leaders as Olaf
Palme, Pierre Trudeau, Willy Brandt and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his critics, who included free-market liberals and
conservatives, condemned him for adopting paternalistic and
coercive policies like the ujamma. They deplored his insistence on
one-party rule and price controls, which they said stultified
Tanzania's economy, shrank agricultural production, encouraged
corruption and led to vast squandering of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   The distance Nyerere traveled from his birth to political power
and to the center of an international polemic on development was
enormous, spanning ages as well as years.
</P>
<P>
   He was born into the Zanaki people, a small tribe of 40,000 in
the hills southeast of Lake Victoria. His mother, Mugaya, was 15
years old. She had been the fifth wife of Burito Nyerere, a village
headman, who was 61 years old when the boy was born. Later, as the
village chief prospered, he took more wives, and when he died at
81, he had 22 wives and 26 surviving children.
</P>
<P>
   Mugaya's son was named Kambarage for a rain spirit, for it had
rained on the day of his birth (though the year is uncertain, 1922
or '23). Years later, after he attended mission schools, he became
a Roman Catholic and chose Julius as his baptismal name.
</P>
<P>
   He lived the life of a Zanaki child, weeding his mother's garden
and going off on bow-and-arrow hunts with the older men. But all
that changed when the village chief, with some reluctance, agreed
to send his child to board at a school at Musumo, 30 miles from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, as he learned Swahili and English, he was spotted as an
exceedingly bright child by the White Fathers who ran the school,
and in 1936 he placed first in the entire territory on an entrance
exam for a school in Tabora. At the school, which was patterned on
private schools in Britain, a native elite was to be trained to
help administer their homeland under British rule.
</P>
<P>
   He spent six years at Tabora, in central northwestern
Tanganyika, graduating in 1943. He went on to Makarere University
in Uganda, and after being baptized a Catholic and teaching for two
years in a church school, he won a scholarship to Edinburgh
University, where he earned a master's degree in history and
economics.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he first went away to school, his father had paid
lobola, a bride price, to the family of a girl from his home area
as a traditional deposit on a future marriage. But at Makarere,
Nyerere met a Christian girl named Maria Magige. In 1948 he asked
her to marry him, and when she agreed, the six cows that his father
had given to the family of the prospective child bride were
returned to the Nyerere family and were passed on to Maria's
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Magige Nyerere bore him five sons and a daughter. Mrs.
Nyerere and the children were in London when he died, according to
Reuters. A state funeral is expected to be held in Dar es Salaam
next week befre Nyerere in his home village.e
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nyerere served as the head of the country's major women's
organization and she ran a poultry business for some years while
her husband was president. But she gave it up when Nyerere imposed
a leadership code that forbade government officials from
involvement in a private business in order to discourage
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   On his return from Scotland, Nyerere worked as a teacher in a
government school. He also won election as president of the
Tanganyika African Association, an elite social organization that
he quickly transformed into a political party that later led the
struggle for independence.
</P>
<P>
   That new group, the Tanganyika African National Union, was
formed on July 7, 1954, a date now celebrated as a national holiday
known as Saba Saba, the seventh day of the seventh month.
</P>
<P>
   When Tanganyika became independent on Dec. 9, 1961, Nyerere
became its first prime minister, but six weeks later he suddenly
resigned. He remained president of his party, TANU, and spent nine
months traveling throughout the country, meeting ordinary people
and preparing a document that he issued under the title ``Ujamma _
The Basis of African Socialism.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the first of two defining proclamations by which
Nyerere sought to blend the major influences of his life: the
cooperative forces he had observed in tribal life, with their
emphasis on a constant search for consensus; the ideal of a
Christian brotherhood, to which he had been exposed at school, and
the goals of welfare-state socialism that he had absorbed from
British Labor Party teachings while he lived in an Edinburgh
housing project.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Ujamma'' he declared: ``In acquisitive societies, wealth
tends to corrupt those who possess it. It tends to breed in them a
desire to live more comfortably than their fellows, to dress better
and in every way to outdo them.''
</P>
<P>
   He then depicted traditional African society as providing
sustenance to all members of a community. He wrote that in contrast
to Europe, where socialism had arisen in opposition to capitalism,
Africa had never known either class division or class struggle. He
then concluded: ``Ujamma, or `familyhood,' describes our socialism.
It is opposed to capitalism, which seeks to build a happy society
on the basis of the exploitation of man by man, and is equally
opposed to doctrinaire socialism, which seeks to build its happy
society on the philosophy of inevitable conflict between man and
man.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first anniversary of independence, Tanganyika became a
republic. Portraying ujamma as the national goal, Nyerere was
easily elected president.
</P>
<P>
   One element of his position paper that he adopted quickly and
adhered to for the rest of his public life was his disavowal of
pomp and perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   He never received more than $8,000 a year as president. A slight
man, standing 5 foot 6 and weighing 125 pounds, he appeared both
abroad and at home wearing a gray or black safari shirt over his
trousers and a white crocheted skullcap of the sort worn on
Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to many African leaders, who often raced through
their capitals in motorcades with phalanxes of motorcycle
outriders, he moved around Dar es Salaam in an old car with just
his driver, who stopped for red lights. In his spare time he had
translated ``Romeo and Juliet'' and ``Julius Caesar'' into Swahili.
</P>
<P>
   The second of Nyerere's proclamations was delivered in 1967 and
came to be known as the Arusha Declaration, after the northern town
near the Serengeti plains where Nyerere read it to party leaders.
It called for a commitment to self reliance and established the
leadership code, which obligated government and party officials to
give up all sources of income but their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But the most most important provisions established rural
development as the country's chief priority.
</P>
<P>
   In the following months, in town and village meetings, Nyerere
expounded on this, calling upon peasant farmers to voluntarily
relocate and pool their labors in collectively harvesting common
fields. As he repeatedly explained, Tanzanians were too scattered
for services to be brought to them. Only if they gathered in
villages would they be able to benefit from schools, clinics,
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Befitting the teacher he was, he often resorted to didactic
slogans, which party stalwarts were quick to paint all over the
country. Decades later the fading mottos can still be read on
public buildings or small village shops: ``Work Is the Foundation
of Progress.'' ``A Poor Country Cannot Rule Itself if It Relies on
Foreign Help.'' ``We Must Run While Others Walk.''
</P>
<P>
   All too often, the slogans faded in an atmosphere of lassitude.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years after the Arusha Declaration, only some 1,000 ujamma
villages had been established and only 2 million of Tanzania's then
14 million people were living in them. Virtually none involved
successful collective farming.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere displayed growing impatience, and in December 1973 he
addressed his countrymen on the radio in a scolding tone.
</P>
<P>
   He said that while the government had abolished poll taxes,
ended school fees and extended water supplies and health clinics in
rural areas, the people had done almost nothing in return. While
the government could not turn people into socialists by force, he
said, it could insure that everybody lived in a village, and he
wanted the entire country to be living in planned settlements by
1976.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were campaigns of persuasion, intimidation and
coercion. People were told that famine relief would be provided
only to those who moved peacefully. Because transport was provided
by militias and the army, party stalwarts told peasants that if
they did not pull down their houses and load them on government
trucks, the houses would be demolished. Many homes were burned, and
there were a few cases in which people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere deplored the violence, attributing it to overly zealous
local officials, but he insisted that such mistakes should not
obscure the success of a program that, he said, had led more than
13 million people to move into ujamma communities by 1976, a
movement of close to 70 percent of the population in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The evaluations of more detached observers were far less
enthusiastic. James C. Scott, a Yale agronomist, studied the
Tanzanian experience for a book titled ``Seeing Like a State: How
Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed'' (Yale
University, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Scott noted that in contrast to Soviet collectivization, the
Tanzanian campaign was not conceived as an all-out war of
appropriation. He wrote: ``The disruptions and inhumanities of
Nyerere's program, however serious for its victims, were not in the
same league as those inflicted by Stalin. Even so, the ujamma
campaign was coercive and occasionally violent. It proved,
moreover, a failure, ecologically as well as economically.''
</P>
<P>
   With people moved from their traditional fields, food production
plummeted. Moreover, according to outside scholars, 60 percent of
the new villages were on semi-arid land unsuitable for long-term
cultivation.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts were made to dictate the growing of certain crops,
notably fire-cured tobacco, to be sold at what villagers saw as
confiscatory prices set by government agencies. Peasants resisted
this, and they also ignored annual work plans and production
targets. With people having left their old cashew trees behind, a
huge share of that once important crop went ungathered.
</P>
<P>
   Scott concluded that the failure of ujamma was virtually
guaranteed ``by the high modernist hubris of planners and
specialists who believed that they alone knew how to organize a
more satisfactory, rational and productive life for their
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be noted,'' he continued, ``that they did have
something to contribute to what could have been a more fruitful
development of the Tanzanian countryside. But their insistence that
they had a monopoly on useful knowledge and that they impose this
knowledge set the stage for disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dar es Salaam in the late '70s, tales of such willful and
miscalculated planning were widely exchanged by the same diplomats
who complimented Nyerere for his concern and decency:
</P>
<P>
   _ After a state agency was organized to market fish, fish
disappeared from the market because fisherman no longer found it
worth their while to go out.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Norwegian-backed training project to establish coastal
shipping was not permitted to carry cargo so it would not compete
with the state trucking company.
</P>
<P>
   _ A regulation banning doctors from treating patients privately
in their homes after their work in government clinics and hospitals
led to the emigration of many doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _ An Italian agronomist developing export crops promoted
strawberries, for which there was a strong market in Europe, but a
party official declared that unlike beets and potatoes,
strawberries were not a socialist fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years Nyerere would sometimes acknowledge that
government mismanagement, particularly its abolishment of
functioning producer cooperatives, had contributed to sharp
declines in staple crops.
</P>
<P>
   But he placed much more blame on an international economy in
which agricultural prices had dropped sharply while the cost of
oil, machinery and other imports had risen. He noted that for
Tanzania to purchase a seven-ton truck in 1981, it had to produce
four times as much cotton, or three times as much coffee, or 10
times as much tobacco as it had five years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the accuracy of those calculations, it was also
true that farm production was tumbling, with sisal harvesting, for
example, dropping to 33,000 tons in 1985 from 250,000 in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately needing credit, Nyerere turned to the International
Monetary Fund and in 1980 began a five-year struggle with the fund,
resisting its dictates that he divert funds from education and
emphasize export crops while allowing domestic food prices to rise.
</P>
<P>
   In this skirmishing, Nyerere became the third world's most
assertive exponent of a ``new economic order'' in which the
economic imbalance between north and south would be overcome
through international law and obligation rather than through
markets or charity.
</P>
<P>
   But he was never able to reach an agreement with the IMF, and in
1984, when Tanzania could not meet interest payments to the United
States, the Reagan administration suspended all aid but emergency
food allocations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such economic setbacks, Nyerere remained popular and
unchallenged in Tanzania throughout his years in office (though the
one-party system did make challenges difficult).
</P>
<P>
   He also reinforced his reputation abroad by his steadfast
support of liberation movements in African countries where majority
rule had not been achieved. He provided training camps for the
African National Congress from South Africa and provided diplomatic
support for national movements fighting in Mozambique and Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1978, after Uganda annexed a 700-square-mile section of
Tanzania, Nyerere angrily denounced Idi Amin, the Ugandan despot,
as a man who had killed more people than either Ian Smith, the
white leader of Rhodesia, or John Vorster of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   With startling bluntness, he added: ``There is this tendency in
Africa to think that it does not matter if an African kills other
Africans. Had Amin been white, free Africa would have passed many
resolutions condemning him. Being black is becoming a certificate
to kill fellow Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, who as a youthful pan-Africanist president had
considered doing without an army, reasoning that such a force would
be useless against great powers and therefore could only fight
African neighbors, sent Tanzanian soldiers and Ugandan exile
volunteers to push back Amin's forces. They routed the Ugandan
dictator, who fled into exile in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired, Nyerere was often asked whether he had any
regrets. In a typical interview, he said he was pleased that
``Tanzanians have more sense of national identity than many other
Africans,'' and he expressed pride in the nation's high rate of
literacy. As for the poor economy, it had resulted from an ``a
hostile international environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I have changed if I had my time again? Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   The white-haired farmer, the Mwalimu, then turned to his
attempts to instill his idea of African socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying you've failed,'' he mused. ``But what is
wrong with urging people to pull together? Did Christianity fail
because the world isn't all Christian?''

<TEXT>
<P>
   During the late 1940s, right after World War II, there was a
rich cultural life in Trenton, N.J., including opera, ballet and
symphony, that centered on the theater in the War Memorial
building, completed in 1932 to commemorate local citizens who died
in World War I. Unlike the sprawling performing arts centers that
succeeded this compact genre, War Memorial buildings were designed
to house numerous civic events. Half town meeting house, half
theater, the civic auditorium as a civilizing force in the
community had an architectural presence akin to museums, banks,
courthouses and city halls.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton's War Memorial building exuded a sophisticated opulence
and grandeur that made the audience dress up to attend
performances, but like many civic structures during the great
catastrophe of urban renewal that obliterated downtowns, the War
Memorial, despite its proximity to the State Capitol, slipped into
dowdiness as the downtown area shifted away. Gov. Tom Kean took
notice in 1988 (it has been the site of all gubernatorial
inaugurations since its opening) and announced that the building
would be renovated. Earlier this year, after going dark for five
years, the War Memorial reopened and is more splendid than ever.
But best of all, it once again has a full program of performances.
</P>
<P>
   The reborn Trenton War Memorial Theater is only one of several
cultural and historic places in Trenton to visit for special
reasons this fall, all in what is known as the Capitol Complex, the
buildings clustered around the State House along the Delaware
River. In addition to attending a matinee or evening performance in
the theater, one can visit the New Jersey State Museum; the
restored 19th-century rotunda under the Capitol dome; the Old
Barracks Museum, reconfigured to its 18th-century military period,
and the 1719 Queen Anne-style mansion of William Trent, after we city is named.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton's limestone and granite War Memorial is a blend of
neo-Italian Renaissance and Art Deco styles with a high parapet and
an Ionic colonnade leading to the Memorial Court, the main
entrance, with its blue, green and gold terra-cotta ceiling and
dedication plaques.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946 and 1947 the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo performed
dances there choreographed by George Balanchine before he helped
found the New York City Ballet. Among the works were ``Concerto
Barocco,'' the first ``Mozartiana'' and ``The Night Shadow'' (now
``La Sonnambula''), the latter with Alexandra Danilova and Maria
Tallchief, who had danced at its premiere in New York in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1948, before starring in ``South Pacific'' on Broadway,
Ezio Pinza sang Mephistopheles in Gounod's ``Faust,'' and his
daughter, Claudia, sang Marguerite in the Trenton Opera
Association's production. In addition to being performed by invited
stars, the opera repertory was presented by local singers in the
minor roles and the Trenton Opera Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton at that period had a cultural life unto itself, not
necessarily dependent on Philadelphia or New York. What's more, the
theater would hold a graduating class of more than 1,000 from
Trenton Central High School. Dance teachers held their student
recitals in the ballroom. And when John F. Kennedy ran for
president, he stood between the Ionic columns during an autumn
twilight and spoke to thousands standing in the plaza below.
</P>
<P>
   While the War Memorial's interior remained intact during the
renovation, every marble and painted surface and all the bronze
light fixtures and railings had to be revitalized to restore their
gleam and glitter. The Vitetta Group, architects and engineers
based in Cherry Hill, N.J., and Philadelphia who undertook the
renovation, had the advantage of the original drawings by the
building's architect, Louis Kaplan. Kaplan had been the chief
draftsman for William Klemann, the architect for the preliminary
plan, who died during the process. An analysis by Matthew Mosca, a
historical paint consultant, revealed the bright colors that gave
the theater its fantasy environment.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman Myers, the director of historic preservation for Vitetta,
sees the 1,800-seat theater, in its new raiment, fulfilling its
role as ``a spaceship to an imaginary dream world,'' with updating
to enhance the acoustics and improve the stage machinery.
</P>
<P>
   Architecture Grand as Opera
</P>
<P>
   What delights the eye are the decorative surfaces of rose and
saffron further embellished with gilded plaster; the newly polished
marble walls and terrazzo floors of the corridors, and bronze
classical motifs like the image of Terpsichore, the muse of the
dance in her diaphanous garb. An immense ceiling medallion
festooned with garlands and smaller medallions in the same warm
palette glows in soft illumination. Even the rust-colored stage
curtain was reproduced down to the last gold tassel from a
photograph in the archives of the Greater Trenton Symphony
Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   A performance last spring of ``Rigoletto'' by the War Memorial's
resident company, Boheme Opera N.J., took full advantage of the
broad stage with one architectural set that seemed to turn inside
out depending on the scene. The hall was filled, and those with
years in the know found the balcony seats the best for a complete
overview of the theater, the stage and the recent addition of
supertitles.
</P>
<P>
   The company's artistic director and conductor, Trenton-born
Joseph Pucciatti, founded Boheme Opera 11 years ago with his wife,
Sandra Milstein-Pucciatti, a concert pianist who is managing
director and assistant conductor. One hour before the ``Rigoletto''
performance, the couple gave their customary cogent and amusing
precurtain talk in the War Memorial's blue, mauve and silver Art
Deco ballroom. These talks are usually packed, and as in earlier
times, it was heartening to see many children in attendance. While
Pucciatti gave the background of the characters, describing the
real Duke of Mantua, and of Victor Hugo's 1832 play ``Le Roi
S'Amuse,'' on which the opera is based, his wife played the
relevant themes on the piano.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   A Link to Russia
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986 Trenton has been a sister city to the Central
District of Moscow. Out of this relationship and under the
sponsorship of the American-Russian Cultural Cooperation
Foundation, Trenton was selected as the only East Coast site for a
major international touring exhibition: ``Unseen Treasures:
Imperial Russia and the New World,'' which includes 300 art objects
and artifacts from the Russian State Historical Museum and the
State Archive of the Russian Federation in Moscow. Its opening,
which had been scheduled for this weekend, has been postponed
because of delays in shipping the works from Russia; it is now
expected to open in November.
</P>
<P>
   Commemorating the founding in 1799 of the Russian-American
Company, the exhibition will document the little-known story of the
Russian colonization of what is now northern California and Alaska,
an effort motivated by the fur trade.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Pfeifer Swezey, the guest curator of ``Unseen
Treasures,'' describes the exhibition as ``a trip from imperial
Russia across Siberia to the New World, and back for the coronation
of Alexander II in 1855.'' This unusual and sumptuous display
combines objects from the imperial courts, including paintings,
costumes, jewelry and furniture, with those of the world of
Siberian merchants and voyages to the New World. An important
segment of cultural history incorporating the role of the Orthodox
Church is being shown in the United States for the first time, Ms.
Swezey said.
</P>
<P>
   A Restored Rotunda
</P>
<P>
   While the museum is in a 1960s building, the State House is the
second oldest state capitol in continuous use. Completed in 1792,
four years behind the one in Annapolis, Md., there were several
additions and demolitions due to fire over the years. The present
north wing and rotunda, reflecting the French style of the Italian
Renaissance, was built in 1889 and is the work of a Jersey City
architect, Lewis Broome. Recently regilded with Florentine gold
leaf, the dome, which symbolizes representative government in the
United States, has once again become a gleaming beacon over the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Under the dome, the 105-foot-high, three-tiered rotunda has also
been restored. Completed this summer, it equals the War Memorial's
in its richness of decor, as Mosca was on board again to discover
the original paint pigments. Venetian-red walls and a salmon
ceiling from the 1895 period once again offset the marble
wainscoting trimmed in bronze and the gleaming balcony railings
supported by cast-iron brackets in the form of fire-breathing
dragons. On walls between stained-glass windows hang the portraits
of New Jersey's governors, beginning with its first, William
Livingston. It is a dignified and exhilarating space.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Barracks
</P>
<P>
   Around the corner, going back even earlier to the Colonial
period, is the Old Barracks. It has also seen many transitions
since it first quartered British soldiers in 1758, when the local
residents no longer wished to house them. When it was built, it was
the largest building in Trenton. It probably housed Tory
sympathizers and Hessian military scouts before Gen. George
Washington routed them out in the Battle of Trenton, the day after
Christmas in 1776.
</P>
<P>
   For many years in this century the Old Barracks was a museum of
Colonial curios. Since 1985, archaeologists, architects and
historians have put the fieldstone building back into its original
configuration, trimmed with cantilevered wooden balconies and
staircases. The Georgian-style officers' house at one end shows
clearly that the upper ranks lived in more genteel conditions than
the soldiers, who slept four to a two-tiered bunk in the barracks.
The parade ground in front reinforces the military air.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who truly set a stylish tone for the early township
was William Trent. His brick house built in 1719, the oldest
surviving dwelling in Trenton, is surrounded by a little park and
once again has a view of the river now that the surrounding streets
have been cleared away during urban renewal. A merchant and ship
owner from Scotland who was a partner with William Penn in
Philadelphia, Trent settled at his country estate on 800 acres
along the Delaware in New Jersey and became the state's chief
justice.
</P>
<P>
   The house, mostly intact from the period and furnished with
paneling and William andurniture described in a 1726
inventory taken two years after his death, resembles on a smaller
scale a fine Baroque mansion in England. It not only demonstrates
that early Colonial leaders were in touch with current English
taste, but also represents the high standard that Trent set for
Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being the state capital, Trenton gained
prominence as an industrial town in the 19th century from the
production of Roebling wire cable for suspension bridges and from
the manufacture of ceramics and fine china. And with this
prominence came a motto emblazoned across one of the bridges over
the Delaware River that can be seen from trains running between
Philadelphia and New York. Now, as the city makes a comeback with
its reputation for cultural life, the motto still applies:
``Trenton Makes, the World Takes.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early Thursday afternoon, Hurricane Irene, armed with maximum
sustained winds of 75 miles per hour, jogged to the northeast over
the Isle of Youth south of Cuba. Such a jog, if it were to persist,
would put southern Florida at risk. However, steering winds over
the western Caribbean and the eastern Gulf of Mexico will continue
to be weak and capricious Friday, placing uncertainty on the timing
and eventual path of Irene.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, heavy rains will invade southern and central parts
of the Florida peninsula as tropical moisture streams northeastward
into the region. Rains may be enhanced by additional moisture
carried inland by winds off the Atlantic circulating around a broad
expanse of high pressure over the Eastern seaboard. Rainfalls in
excess of two inches or more will douse some areas. Street and
flash flooding will occur in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another southward surge of chilly Canadian air will
follow on the heels of a cold front across the upper Middle West.
Showers will be limited along and ahead of the cold front over the
upper Mississippi Valley, given the slow return of moisture from
the south. However, splotches of chilly rain will develop behind
the front across the northern Plains. Father west, snow will fall
on high ground in parts of Wyoming and Montana as moist cold, winds
from the east glide up the sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will be very chilly to start, but the afternoon
will be milder. Saturday will be warmer, with afternoon
temperatures cresting near or slightly above seasonal levels.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Restricted Air Force &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, the Hurricane Hunter Aircraft was unable to
determine the precise center of Hurricane Irene because Air Force
regulations prevent any flight near the coast of Cuba. As a matter
of policy, reconnaissance aircraft do not fly into tropical systems
over land. Turbulence in thunderstorms around the centers of
tropical storms and hurricanes often is more intense over land.
Winds blowing over island mountains also generate turbulence.
Moreover, reconnaissance aircraft do not fly over land so as not to
jeopardize people on the ground in the event of a crash landing. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the colonists of Boston in the 1700s, the height
of high style was japanning, a Western technique invented in the
17th century to imitate ancient Oriental lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most dazzling examples of American japanning is a
William and Mary high chest that Sotheby's is selling Friday. Made
in Boston between 1712 and 1725, the black chest, Lot 107, sits on
a tablelike base fitted with drawers.
</P>
<P>
   The base has turned baluster legs and curved stretchers. The
tapered conical legs and bun feet are characteristic of the William
and Mary style, named for the English monarchs of the late 17th
century.
</P>
<P>
   While the chest has painted birds and flowers on its legs and
sides, what makes it remarkable is the silver and gold chinoiserie
decoration on the drawer fronts. Borrowing from Chinese porcelains
and silks, the japanners employed such Oriental motifs as Chinese
figures arranging flowers, showing off pet birds, sailing sampans
and flying kites. There are poetical arched bridges, bamboo-garden
pavilions and soaring butterflies. In one charming vignette, a
crouching dog teases a rooster.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are made of gesso, a gypsum composition, that has
been colored with paint pigments and particles of gold, silver,
bronze and copper. The glittering figures have silver faces and
golden gowns accented in vermilion red and royal blue. The black
moldings are sprinkled with golden flecks.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, visitors gravitated to the glamorous high chest the
moment Sotheby's opened its doors for the preview of its American
furniture sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``William and Mary high chests are very scarce,'' said Albert
Sack, the dean of American furniture dealers in New York. ``Boston
seems to have been the only place japanning was so popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Sack sold a similar high chest to the Virginia Museum of Fine
Arts in 1991 for $1.5 million, according to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece is rare,'' he said. ``It's a good one. Anyone would
be lucky to have it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Trace, a dealer from Cortlandt Manor, N.Y., was
similarly smitten. ``It has a nice verticality,'' he said. ``It has
such a lift to it.'' A friend, Paige Inslee, added, ``All the
decoration is there, and the colors are still vibrant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other visitors pulled out the drawers and looked inside with
flashlights. The backs of some drawers are signed ``Park,'' the
name of the cabinetmaker.
</P>
<P>
   While the piece has pleasing proportions and elegant decoration,
it is important for other reasons as well. It has been handed down
through the family of President John Adams. In 1788, before he
became president, John Adams apparently owned two japanned Boston
high chests.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has not learned how or when Adams obtained them, but
he would have been familiar with japanned furniture from his years
of diplomatic service in France and Britain in the 1770s and '80s,
when it was in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's reports that Adams' wife, Abigail, was close to her
sister, Mary Smith Cranch, and it is thought that the Adamses gave
the chest to Mary Cranch to thank her for looking after their home
when the Adamses were abroad. Both families lived in Quincy, Mass.,
and Mary's husband, Richard, was a financial backer of the future
president. It is Mary Cranch's California descendants who are now
selling the chest.
</P>
<P>
   That the chest has remained in one family for 200 years probably
accounts for its excellent condition. ``It is remarkably
untouched,'' said Deborah Anne Federhen, a furniture scholar based
in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Federhen, a former curator at the Winterthur museum, pointed
out that although the chest does not have its original drawer
pulls, it does have its original imported escutcheons, the
expensive, shield-shaped brass plates that protect the keyholes.
</P>
<P>
   The chest was actually made during the reign of Queen Anne; it
took years for new British furniture styles to reach the American
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston was the closest port to London, and Boston set the pace
for style in the first half of the 18th century,'' Leslie Keno,
director of American furniture at Sotheby's, said. ``The chest is
one of the earliest examples of the William and Mary style in the
Colonies. It would have been one of the most elaborate and
costliest things you could have bought. It would have been
cutting-edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Keno said that the chest, which is made of pine and maple
instead of oak, was much lighter than most Pilgrim furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Federhen said that there are only six known examples of
William and Mary flat-top japanned high chests made in Boston. Five
are in museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Historic
Deerfield, Winterthur, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and the
Adams house in Quincy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sotheby's chest is the only one I know in private hands,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Japanning should not be confused with ebonizing, which is
staining wood black to look like ebony or lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   As Judith Miller spelled out in the 1999 Antiques Encyclopedia,
lacquering is a technique used on furniture produced in the East,
whereas japanning refers to the attempt to copy that technique in
the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the West could make lacquer,'' Ms. Federhen said.
``It is formed from the sap of a tree that doesn't grow in Europe
or North America.''
</P>
<P>
   She explained that japanners painted furniture ``lamp black,''
then decorated it with gesso. The powdered pigments and metals were
laid on the wet black paint or glued to the gesso figures. The
pieces are vulnerable to changes in temperature.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Federhen put it, ``Gesso is an immovable material, which
is then put on wood, which is always moving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the chest was made specifically to be japanned,'' she
said, ``because the drawer fronts are American maple, a
hard-grained wood that is more stable and less porous than pine,
the wood used on the sides and top.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimate, $700,000 to $900,000, is based on condition,
rarity, provenance and its being American.
</P>
<P>
   Less patriotic browsers might consider a rare and equally
show-stopping pair of 17th-century William and Mary japanned
writing tables from London that will be in Sotheby's English
furniture sale next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate for the pair is $40,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Regency Silver Gilt
</P>
<P>
   Silver enthusiasts should note that Alan and Simon Hartman,
private dealers in New York, are selling their private collection
of exceptional Regency silver-gilt candelabra, chargers, salt
cellars and wine coolers at Christie's on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 210 lots, which go on view Friday, include examples from the
workshops of Paul Storr, Digby Scott and Benjamin Smith II, and
Robert Garrard II, most of them made during the Regency
(1811-1820).

WHEN A BELOVED BLANKET MEANS MORE THAN SECURITY

   THE ADVENTURES OF ELMO IN GROUCHLAND &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vanessa Williams, Mandy Patinkin; voices of Kevin Clash, Carroll
Spinney, Martin P. Robinson, Frank Oz, Fran Brill, Steve Whitmire &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Linus of ``Peanuts,'' Elmo of ``Sesame Street'' is grafted
to his blanket, which one day gets away from him and goes down a
pipe into Oscar's home territory in Grouchland. Sliding after it,
Elmo finds himself amid a mob of assorted grouches (not bad folks
actually) and a world of gleeful dirtiness.
</P>
<P>
   From there the blanket has proceeded into the hands of Huxley (
Patinkin) of Huxley Castle, a kind of Bela Lugosi of consumerism
who prances about a lair full of possessions, many of them other
people's, that he wouldn't surrender or share with others on pain
of death.
</P>
<P>
   Huxley is evil. Take a weed whacker to those eyebrows, someone
suggests. ``All I see I give to me,'' he sings with relish.
</P>
<P>
   Relieving him of the blanket seems impossible, but Elmo is
encouraged by the vampy Queen of Trash (Ms. Williams), who
teasingly tests his mettle by making him perform 100 raspberries in
30 seconds. Thus armed with a new can-do attitude, he marches on
Huxley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX None. &QL;

<P>
   For Which Children  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-7 Amazingly small moviegoers are having an uproariously
good time at this film, which is fine because there are no pitfalls
whatever. This is a completely sweet little tale with familiar,
unfailingly cheerful and resilient characters extolling such
virtues as sharing and being nice to people. (Don't worry about
Huxley.) &QL;

<P>
   Conditions are bizarre immediately after Operation Desert Storm
in Iraq. ``Are we shooting people or not?'' an American soldier
asks. Iraqi troops have turned their attention to rounding up
dissidents and terrorizing their own population, virtually ignoring
the invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the sands in vast reinforced bunkers lie fleets of
luxury automobiles and oceans of other goods plundered from Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing around terms like ``clear moral imperative'' and
invoking ``orders from President Bush,'' three American musketeers
and their little D'Artagnan, a slightly crazed and appealing Texan
named Conrad ( Jonze), commandeer a Humvee and jump into the local
Iraqi political imbroglio in an effort to steal gold bars worth $23
million stashed amid the other swag in the subterranean maze.
</P>
<P>
   At first two of them, Sgt. Troy Barlow ( Wahlberg), a new
father, and Staff Sgt. Chief (Ice Cube), a reservist on a
``four-month paid vacation from Detroit,'' are reluctant. Perhaps
they prefer their day jobs, says their fast-talking leader, the
special forces officer Archie Gates ( Clooney).
</P>
<P>
   An airport baggage handler by trade, Chief knows that 200 pounds
of gold will tear the bottom out of an ordinary suitcase. Efforts
to remove the bars get increasingly complicated as do the
Americans' relations with the Iraqi rebels living directly above
the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Offered an opportunity to help these people escape Saddam
Hussein, Gates and the others find themselves acting on their own
moral imperatives. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE Graphic and extreme. At one point a man's head is blown
off in startling detail; at others, wounds are examined
anatomically to demonstrate what bullets do to internal organs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX Gates has rambunctious sex with a television reporter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Much. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDER AGE 11 Many children will be attracted to a big action
film, but considering the nature of the violence, it's not the best
idea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12-14 Russell's film makes an interesting case since it has
all the action elements _ stars, explosions, wisecracking repartee
_ but also an innovative look and an unusually fey style to project
a sharp and strong point of view about the events it depicts.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, the gore may seem unreasonable, but it may
make it harder to rule the film out on those grounds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 15 AND UP They'll go if they want to, of course, and as
action films go, there are far worse. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DRIVE ME CRAZY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Joan Hart, Adrian Grenier, Mark Webber, Gabriel
Carpenter, Ali Lartner &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by John Schultz &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PG-13 93 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to another high school movie, where the romantic
maneuvers more or less jibe with those in the last high school
movie. Nicole (Ms. Hart, star of the television series ``Sabrina,
the Teen-Age Witch'') and Chase ( Grenier) are next-door neighbors
who used to be pals until about junior high school, when she turned
scrubbed achiever and he began riding around in supermarket
shopping carts and calling pep rallies fascist.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's the head of the centennial dance committee and is
angling for a date with a basketball star named Brad. Chase stands
up for animal rights, hangs out in scuzzy clubs and holds steamy
trysts with Dulcie (Ms. Lartner) in vacant classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But Nicole and Chase are bright and mature for their ilk and,
with liaisons in their own circles falling short of expectations,
it's not long before they decide to give each other a whirl.
</P>
<P>
   That calls for a makeover on Chase's part. ``You can't wear
anything you own,'' Nicole tells him. Escorted through the Gap, he
emerges looking the part of high school star, and with a fluid line
of patter he's soon working the upper social reaches.
</P>
<P>
   It should not be altogether surprising, however, that there are
many second thoughts by both parties, which, along with treacheries
by jealous so-called friends, prolong total surrender to the
relationship until the final fade-out. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VIOLENCE None. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SEX There is some teen-age necking and groping, but outright sex
is implied rather than performed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PROFANITY Just enough to avoid a G rating, which would turn off
teen-agers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Which Children?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 3-9 Pretty much a dud with the youngest viewers, who
wouldn't be all that interested. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 10-11 Parents should be aware that sexual activity lurks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AGES 12 AND UP They're the audience, and there really are no
problems.

doesn't seem likely that a movie featuring repeated scenes of men
getting the stuffing beaten out of them could work on so many
levels, but it does: emotionally, physically, viscerally and
intellectually, while providing an interesting take on Y2K
paranoia. It's also often very funny, in the most blistering ways.

JULIUS NYERERE, FOUNDING FATHER WHO LED TANZANIA FOR 24 YEARS, IS
DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: A full-length version, OBIT-NYERERE, has been sent.) 
(jt) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Julius K. Nyerere, the idealistic, principled and some would say
naively misguided founding father of Tanzania, died Thursday at St.
Thomas' Hospital in London. The man who led his country into
independence and guided it for nearly three decades was 77 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere was being treated in London for chronic leukemia and
suffered a major stroke last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, an uncharacteristically humble and modest national
leader whose preferred honorific was Mwalimu, the Swahili word for
teacher, was in the first generation of politicians to lead newly
independent African states as colonialism ebbed.
</P>
<P>
   He also used East Africa as a stage on which to play a leading
role in the debate over economic inequalities between the Northern
and Southern Hemispheres, spreading his intensely socialist
philosophy worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   When he guided what had been the British Trust Territory of
Tanganyika into sovereignty in 1961, he was the youngest of the
continent's triumphant nationalists, a group that included Kwame
Nkrumah of Ghana, Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia
and Felix Houphouet-Boigny of Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   When he stepped down as president 24 years later, he was only
the third modern African leader to relinquish power voluntarily on
a continent that by then included 50 independent states. He went
neither to jail nor into exile, but to a farm in Butiama, his home
village, on the shore of Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Maria Magige Nyerere, bore him five sons and a
daughter. Mrs. Nyerere and the children were in London when he
died, according to Reuters. A state funeral is expected to be held
in Dar es Salaam next week before Nyerere is buried in Butiama.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over Nyerere's leadership extended beyond his tenure,
with academics, politicians and development strategists often
sharply divided over his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   His domestic and international defenders, generally people of
the left, praised his emphasis on social investments and his
egalitarian economic policies, crediting them with creating a
culturally cohesive nation that had avoided ethnic conflict while
life expectancy, literacy and access to water increased.
</P>
<P>
   His Tanzanian supporters took pride in Nyerere's reputation as
one of the most prominent proponents of a ``new economic order''
that would benefit the developing south in economic relations with
the industrial north.
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere also gained international prestige for his principled
support of the struggles for majority rule in South Africa,
Namibia, Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Angola, and for Tanzania's
military counteroffensive against Idi Amin of Uganda, which routed
the dictator and sent him into exile. The Third World honored him
and he won the evident respect of such Western leaders as Olaf
Palme, Pierre Trudeau, Willy Brandt and Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his critics, who included free-market liberals and
conservatives, condemned him for adopting paternalistic and
coercive policies like the planned paternalistic villages known as
ujamma. They deplored his insistence on one-party rule and price
controls, which they said stultified Tanzania's economy, shrank
agricultural production, encouraged corruption and led to vast
squandering of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   Despite economic setbacks, Nyerere remained popular and
unchallenged in Tanzania throughout his years in office (though the
one-party system did make challenges difficult).
</P>
<P>
   He also reinforced his reputation abroad by his steadfast
support of liberation movements in African countries where majority
rule had not been achieved. He provided training camps for the
African National Congress from South Africa and provided diplomatic
support for national movements fighting in Mozambique and Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1978, after Uganda annexed a 700-square-mile section of
Tanzania, Nyerere angrily denounced Idi Amin, the Ugandan despot,
as a man who had killed more people than either Ian Smith, the
white leader of Rhodesia, or John Vorster of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   With startling bluntness, he added: ``There is this tendency in
Africa to think that it does not matter if an African kills other
Africans. Had Amin been white, free Africa would have passed many
resolutions condemning him. Being black is becoming a certificate
to kill fellow Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyerere, who as a youthful pan-Africanist president had
considered doing without an army, reasoning that such a force would
be useless against great powers and therefore could only fight
African neighbors, sent Tanzanian soldiers and Ugandan exile
volunteers to push back Amin's forces. They routed the Ugandan
dictator, who fled into exile in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired, Nyerere was often asked whether he had any
regrets. In a typical interview, he said he was pleased that
``Tanzanians have more sense of national identity than many other
Africans,'' and he expressed pride in the nation's high rate of
literacy. As for the poor economy, it had resulted from ``a hostile
international environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What would I have changed if I had my time again? Not much.''
</P>
<P>
   The white-haired farmer, the Mwalimu, then turned to his
attempts to instill his idea of African socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``They keep saying you've failed,'' he mused. ``But what is
wrong with urging people to pull together? Did Christianity fail
because the world isn't all Christian?''

SPOTLIGHTING A NEW ALBUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STEREOLAB: ``Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky
Night'' (Elektra).
</P>
<P>
   Stereolab has built its music on unexpected affinities: Steve
Reich's Minimalism and 1960s French ye-ye pop, serene female voices
and goofy analog synthesizer sounds, lounge exotica and art-rock,
funk drumbeats and odd-meter 1950s jazz, dialectical musings and
nonsense syllables.
</P>
<P>
   All of it resolves, sooner or later, into patterns that are both
insouciant and orderly, creating a bustling stasis with a clarity
that's reassuring. ``Out of chaos a creation binding into one
form,'' a new song explains.
</P>
<P>
   On its 11th album, Stereolab throws still more sources into its
mesh. Perking up after its last album, the languid ``Dots and
Loops,'' Stereolab starts the album with a swing beat out of Gene
Krupa and what sounds like a big band cracking up before the voices
arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Other songs gaze toward the gently undulating ballads of Brian
Wilson, placing brass and string sections alongside the
synthesizers while trading his expansive melodies for ones that
circle back on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Stereolab's sound world is still a meticulous refuge from
disorder, but it keeps letting in new possibilities.

 &HT;    Rescuers' safety stirs concern
 &HT;    By Ben Sutherly
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELIZABETH TWP., Miami County _ Dr. Jerri Nielsen, stranded at
the South Pole with a lump in her breast, isn't the only person
dominating her brother Eric's thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   The family's worried about the pilot and the other men involved
in the rescue effort, said Eric's wife, Diana Cahill.
</P>
<P>
   Miami County resident Eric Cahill and his brother Scott of
Richmond, Va., are in Christchurch, New Zealand, where they hope to
reunite with their sister in a few days. Hostile polar weather has
so far delayed any possibility of rescuing Nielsen, who has been
using medical supplies dropped during a daring mid-July flyover to
self-administer chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers are currently poised to launch a rescue attempt from
McMurdo, a scientific station on the Antarctic coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're risking their lives to save his sister,'' Diana Cahill
said. ``Of course, (Eric) wants them to do it on the one hand, but
on the other hand, he wouldn't want anything terrible to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   But the chances of rescuing Nielsen, the only doctor among a
41-member international research crew at the Amundsen-Scott South
Pole research station, are good, according to a spokesman for the
pilots who will fly the hundreds of miles from McMurdo to the pole
station and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our confidence level is quite high on this mission. If the
weather is within our limits, there's no reason why this mission
should not be successful,'' said Major Bob Bullock, spokesman for
the 109th Air Lift Wing of the New York Air National Guard, the
unit undertaking the rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock said the minimum temperature needed to make the 6
1/2-hour round trip is minus 58 degrees. Flying at lower
temperatures could result in fuel-starved engines and
malfunctioning hydraulic systems as fluids vital to aircraft
operations thicken.
</P>
<P>
   The LC-130 Hercules cargo plane prepared to rescue Nielsen is
the largest ski-equipped plane in the world, with two 22-foot main
skis and another 10-foot ski beneath its nose. Should the plane
land successfully on the South Pole research station's ice-carved
runway, its four propellers will remain running as Nielsen boards
and her replacement doctor exits before the plane departs for
McMurdo _ all within 20 to 30 minutes, Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the risk is associated with a landing,'' Bullock said.
``When the aircraft is on the ground, the part of the aircraft
that's on the ground conducts cold up into the rest of the
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   One of only seven of its kind, the LC-130 Hercules cargo plane
that will attempt to rescue Nielsen can carry up to 60 people, or
about 45,000 pounds of cargo, Bullock said. Only six air crew
members and two or three medical personnel will make the flight, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The Cahills have remained in touch with Nielsen via e-mail
during the long Antarctic winter, which is only now beginning to
break. Temperatures at the pole station were minus 69 degrees
Wednesday, forcing crews to wait until at least today to make the
rescue attempt.

SUPERVISOR DECLARES WRITE-IN CANDIDACY FOR MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RACHEL GORDON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano
announced he is running for mayor as a write-in candidate, a move
that livens up the campaign and raises the question how, or even
if, his candidacy will affect the outcome of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is the most liberal elected leader in San Francisco,
with strong ties to the gay community, tenant activists and labor
unions.
</P>
<P>
   He decided in early August not to run. On Wednesday he changed
his mind after what he described as a strong push from supporters
to jump into the race.
</P>
<P>
   A recent San Francisco Examiner poll showed that the three
leading candidates in the race _ Mayor Willie Brown, former Mayor
Frank Jordan and former political consultant Clint Reilly _ all
have higher unfavorable ratings than favorable ones and may be
vulnerable to a high-profile challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to run for mayor for two reasons,'' Ammiano said
in explaining his initial decision to stay out. ``I didn't relish
entering a race that promised to become truly negative, and I was
concerned about having enough time, as of August, to raise the
money to compete against extremely well-financed opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   He reconsidered because ``the tone of the campaign and the
record-setting spending to date have surpassed my worst
expectations,'' he said. ``The result is a strong feeling of
disaffection among voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano believes that voters are hungry for an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Reilly, Jordan and Brown, 11 others, considered
dark-horse contenders, are on the ballot for the Nov. 2 election.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has to settle for being a write-in candidate because the
deadline to get his name on the ballot passed two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, city rules require that he has to officially declare he
is a candidate if his votes are to be counted.
</P>
<P>
   He said he does not plan to actively campaign or raise money
``at this time.''

 &HT;    EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS BLAMED FOR DALAYS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington and Financial categories
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Necessary updates in air traffic control systems
may have played a role in delaying airline passengers earlier this
year, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told federal lawmakers on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Airline delays reached record highs during the summer. The FAA
reports that delays in April alone were up 51 percent from 1998. In
July, the FAA estimates that on average more than 100,000
passengers were delayed every day, and that an average delay was
nearly 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey told the House subcommittee on aviation that some of the
delays were caused by improvements made to the federal government's
air traffic control system designed to better display air traffic
information at control centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA is willing to do whatever is within our power to
improve the efficiency of the air traffic system, so long as safety
is not compromised,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's technological improvements were not the only culprit
in the recent delays, Garvey said. She added that bad weather, as
well as airports and airlines, should share responsibility for
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hallett, president and chief executive officer of the Air
Transport Association of America, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These delays are insignificant in comparison with the numerous
instances this summer where aircraft were delayed over six hours by
the FAA and an inadequately managed air traffic control system,''
Hallett told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Hallett added that the transition to the new equipment this
summer sparked the delays when the FAA slowed the air traffic in
its Cleveland Center airspace to give air traffic controllers time
to learn the new system. Hallett added that these transitions
followed in New York and Chicago, creating more delays.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in a report released by the Air Transport Association on
Thursday, the FAA's systems of weather management was also blamed
for contributing to the delays. According to the report, the FAA
restricted many flights because of early weather forecasts, then
delayed the flights even when bad weather didn't follow.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for an ``immediate and extensive'' overhaul of
the FAA air traffic control system and warned that unless the air
traffic control system was fixed, passengers could expect to see an
increasing rise in the number of delays.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the FAA met representatives from the Air
Transport Association and the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association to evaluate 33 of the FAA's air traffic control
facilities and its command center in Herndon, Va. As a result the
FAA introduced several reforms aimed at reducing the number of air
traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said that the federal government's air traffic control
command center will now have a greater role in air traffic
management. Garvey added that the FAA is also currently working on
updating aging equipment to combat delays and develop more
efficient air traffic routes.

 &HT;    EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL SYSTEMS BLAMED FOR DALAYS
 &HT;    Moving in Washington and Financial categories
 &HT;    BY SUE SCHULTZ
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ Necessary updates in air traffic control systems
may have played a role in delaying airline passengers earlier this
year, FAA Administrator Jane Garvey told federal lawmakers on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Airline delays reached record highs during the summer. The FAA
reports that delays in April alone were up 51 percent from 1998. In
July, the FAA estimates that on average more than 100,000
passengers were delayed every day, and that an average delay was
nearly 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey told the House subcommittee on aviation that some of the
delays were caused by improvements made to the federal government's
air traffic control system designed to better display air traffic
information at control centers throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FAA is willing to do whatever is within our power to
improve the efficiency of the air traffic system, so long as safety
is not compromised,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA's technological improvements were not the only culprit
in the recent delays, Garvey said. She added that bad weather, as
well as airports and airlines, should share responsibility for
delays.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Hallett, president and chief executive officer of the Air
Transport Association of America, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These delays are insignificant in comparison with the numerous
instances this summer where aircraft were delayed over six hours by
the FAA and an inadequately managed air traffic control system,''
Hallett told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Hallett added that the transition to the new equipment this
summer sparked the delays when the FAA slowed the air traffic in
its Cleveland Center airspace to give air traffic controllers time
to learn the new system. Hallett added that these transitions
followed in New York and Chicago, creating more delays.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in a report released by the Air Transport Association on
Thursday, the FAA's systems of weather management was also blamed
for contributing to the delays. According to the report, the FAA
restricted many flights because of early weather forecasts, then
delayed the flights even when bad weather didn't follow.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for an ``immediate and extensive'' overhaul of
the FAA air traffic control system and warned that unless the air
traffic control system was fixed, passengers could expect to see an
increasing rise in the number of delays.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the FAA met representatives from the Air
Transport Association and the National Air Traffic Controllers
Association to evaluate 33 of the FAA's air traffic control
facilities and its command center in Herndon, Va. As a result the
FAA introduced several reforms aimed at reducing the number of air
traffic delays.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey said that the federal government's air traffic control
command center will now have a greater role in air traffic
management. Garvey added that the FAA is also currently working on
updating aging equipment to combat delays and develop more
efficient air traffic routes.

 &HT;    Politics imperils security
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Clintonphobes in the U.S. Senate couldn't bring down
the president by convicting him on impeachment charges, so they
decided to pursue the next most satisfying course _ to humiliate
him.
</P>
<P>
   What better way to do that than to defeat him on a treaty he had
signed with great fanfare and promised the world he could deliver
with Senate ratification?
</P>
<P>
   Never mind his GOP opponents' protestations that the nuclear
test-ban treaty would have played fast and loose with U.S.
security. The opposite is true. Once the treaty went into effect,
with all nuclear powers signed on, it would have reinforced
America's vast strategic superiority.
</P>
<P>
   To those who worried the U.S. nuclear arsenal might degrade
without any testing to assure its warheads were in working order,
the fact is America is much better equipped to check its weapons
stockpile _ by computer modeling _ than any potential foe. No other
power in the world would be able to match the reliability of our
deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Those who sounded alarms about secret underground nuclear tests
by hostile nations had an even weaker leg to stand on. True, the
CIA says it can't tell a 1-kiloton blast or less from a seismic
event, but military analysts consider tests that small to be
strategically unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the treaty provided for the establishment of a
comprehensive worldwide network of seismic and other sensors that
would have greatly enhanced U.S. ability to detect cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   By their near-perfect party-line vote, Senate Republicans
stripped the U.S. government of any moral authority it might have
had to pressure India and Pakistan not to resume nuclear testing.
It was almost as if this week's Pakistan coup by a military high
command of murky motives went totally unnoticed by Trent Lott &AMP; Co.
An oversight like that is really playing fast and loose with U.S.
security.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Majority Leader Lott and his cohorts in the GOP's
isolationist wing had to vote on the treaty this week. They could
have put it off, as Clinton requested. But, no, they demanded that
he pledge not to bring the treaty up for a vote, under any
circumstance, during the balance of his term _ an unconditional
surrender that would have weakened the presidency. Correctly, he
refused, and GOP senators played out their game of political
chicken to its illogical end.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty may look moribund, but it is not dead. Technically,
it goes back to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, from where
it can be recalled for another vote, but certainly not in this
GOP-led Congress. Democrats are right to vow that the treaty,
supported by a large majority of Americans in national surveys,
will be a major issue in next year's election campaign and a
priority for them should they regain control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Time was when Republicans and Democrats gave lip-service to the
ideal that politics stopped at the water's edge, that they strived
for consensus on foreign policy. It never was quite true, but at
least they tried. Democrats ought to mark well the record of this
deeply partisan congressional leadership _ its attempts to confound
Clinton at every nearly every turn on foreign policy _ and swear
not to behave as the GOP has the next time a Republican is elected
president.

 &HT;    Grand jury did the best it could
 &HT;    (EDs: This is an editorial from Friday's Atlanta Constitution.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Justice may not have triumphed in the JonBenet Ramsey
case, but neither did it err. Despite political and public pressure
to solve this brutal 3-year-old crime, the eight-woman, four-man
grand jury found the evidence insufficient to indict anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Over 13 months, the grand jurors weighed the facts and ignored
the emotions. In the end, they exited their deliberations
empty-handed and a killer went unpunished. For the millions of
people who felt passionate about this tragedy, that's a distressing
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But citizens ought to be equally passionate about protecting
against injustice. When reasonable doubt exists, it remains the far
better course for the guilty to go free than for the innocent to be
wrongly punished.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Constitution understood the gravity of wrongly
convicting someone, which is why its authors built in protections
for defendants. The nation's high courts have followed suit,
setting standards of evidence to safeguard against unsubstantiated
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramsey case suffered from too much speculation and too
little hard evidence. The unexplained DNA and unidentified
footprints never pointed directly at a suspect, and the
circumstantial evidence was so vague that two lead investigators
came up with opposite conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury should not be criticized for its performance. It
did its job well under uncommon strain. The same can't be said of
Boulder authorities. Police bungled the crime scene by allowing
family and friends to run amok on the day of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   As the investigation dragged on, petty squabbling broke out
between police and prosecutors. The chief police investigator
resigned after accusing the district attorney of mishandling the
case and trying to protect JonBenet's parents.
</P>
<P>
   No one can declare that JonBenet's killer got what he or she
deserved. Nevertheless, justice was not trampled in this case, and
sometimes that's the best an imperfect system can do.

ART REVIEW: FROM THE POLITICAL TO THE PERSONAL: A PAN-AMERICAN
FEAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The recent blast of popular enthusiasm for Latino
music and culture has yet to find serious resonance in the
mainstream New York art world. People of Hispanic descent now make
up nearly 30 percent of the city's population, but most of its
high-profile museums seem to have slept through that development,
and only a handful of galleries regularly show Latino artists.
</P>
<P>
   This situation automatically makes El Museo del Barrio an
indispensable public resource. But the museum goes way beyond just
meeting the demands of a statistic. Now in its 30th year, it
consistently offers exhibitions of contemporary and historical art
as stimulating to look at as to think about, by artists who live
hundreds of miles away or just a few blocks east of the museum
itself.
</P>
<P>
   El Museo was established in 1969 in an East Harlem storefront by
artists, teachers and political activists (the categories often
overlapped) as a cultural center for the local Puerto Rican
community.
</P>
<P>
   It has since moved to grander headquarters on Fifth Avenue and
has _ controversially for those who feel it should focus on its
original constituency _ embraced Latino art as a Pan-American
phenomenon, in line with shifts in the city's population.
</P>
<P>
   `Pressing the Point'
</P>
<P>
   This broader perspective is evident in the four exhibitions,
large and small, which fill every inch of floor space for the
museum's 30th birthday fete this fall. But the emphasis falls
squarely on the activist impulses that first brought this and many
other ``alternative spaces'' into being.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the two main shows are devoted to prints.
Inexpensive to produce and distribute, available (ideally) to rich
and poor alike, and suited to combining didactic content with
graphic innovation, they have long been the polemical medium par
excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressing the Point: Parallel Expressions in the Graphic Arts
of the Chicano and Puerto Rican Movements'' brings together dozens
of works produced more or less simultaneously on the East and West
coasts in the agitated 1960s and '70s as various liberation and
protests movements were moving into high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Yasmin Ramirez and Henry Estrada, and selected from
the holdings of El Museo and from the Gilberto Cardenas collection
of Latino art at the Jack S. Blanton Museum of Art at the
University of Texas at Austin, the show is given historical
grounding with the presence of some older figures, beginning with
the seminal Mexican printmaker Jose Guadalupe Posada (1852-1913).
</P>
<P>
   His sardonic riffs on sensationalist news items and popular
religion had a big impact on the art of the Mexican Revolution. And
the cooperative production mode favored by that movement set a
model for future collectives, among them the Taller de Grafica
Popular in Mexico City in the 1930s and '40s (several of its
members, including Luis Arenal, Pablo O'Higgins and Leopoldo
Mendez, are in the show) and workshops in Puerto Rico led by, among
others, Lorenzo Homar, Antonio Maldonado, Rafael Rivera Rosa and
Rafael Tufino (who was born in New York and now lives in Puerto
Rico).
</P>
<P>
   These artists made themselves felt in North America. Tufino,
whose Social Realist linocuts were inspired by Mexican art, was
part of the community that founded El Museo del Barrio. And
Chicago-based Carlos A. Cortez Koyokuikatl served as a hard-hitting
role model for Chicano, or Mexican-American, artists largely
concentrated in California.
</P>
<P>
   The story grows ever more complicated in the 1960s and '70s, or
at least that's the way it feels in the show's sometimes
hard-to-follow arrangement, as political action intensified.
Workshops across the country turned out posters, flyers,
newsletters and journals in response to causes like the Vietnam
War, Puerto Rican independence and the farmworkers' strikes.
</P>
<P>
   La Raza Graphic Center was formed in San Francisco in 1971 (one
of its co-founders, Linda Lucero, is in the show). And Self-Help
Graphics started in Los Angeles in 1972 with such outstanding
participants as Yreina D. Cervantez (represented by some fabulous
work here), Gronk, Daniel J. Martinez and Patssi Valdez.
</P>
<P>
   Among the snazziest images were those turned out by Ricardo
Favela and the collective called the Royal Chicano Air Force,
including a witty, Pop-colored silk-screen poster titled
``Strike!'' in which three guys in guerrilla gear pose outside a
boycotted Safeway supermarket. And individual artists came through
with some great things. Ester Hernandez's ``Sun Mad Raisins,'' with
its skeletal grape picker, and Yolanda M. Lopez's Aztec warrior
holding immigration papers and demanding ``Who's the illegal alien,
Pilgrim?'' are agitprop classics.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, meanwhile, the Taller Boricua, or Puerto Rican
Workshop, was founded in 1969 in East Harlem by members of the Art
Workers Coalition who were trying to crack the color-and-ethnicity
barrier at New York museums and bring art into the community. Pop
Art, indigenous culture and Social Realism came together in their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Warhol lies behind a cool, beautiful silk-screen portrait
of the poet Julia de Burgos by Fernando Salicrup and one of Lolita
Lebron, an icon of Puerto Rican independence, by Marcos Dimas. (
Dimas and Salicrup are the current directors of Taller Boricua,
which is still flourishing in East Harlem.) Symbols associated with
the Taino, the original inhabitants of the Caribbean, crop up in
work by Sandra Maria Estevez, Gilberto Hernandez and Nitza Tufino,
the daughter of Rafael Tufino.
</P>
<P>
   Tufino's expressive linocut style was carried forward by Antonio
Martorell, who divides his time between Puerto Rico and New York.
Martorell's superb prints, bold and delicate, often combine figures
and texts on a monumental scale, as is evident in his two-room
installation on view (only through Saturday, unfortunately) at the
Taller Boricua Gallery, a quick walk east from the museum.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Sanchez
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressing the Point'' confirms that Puerto Rican and Chicano
artists have produced one of the major bodies of American printwork
in the postwar years. And many of its key themes and sentiments are
distilled in the museum's other large fall show, ``Juan Sanchez:
Printed Convictions,'' a survey of prints by Sanchez organized by
Alejandro Anreus, curator of the Jersey City Museum, with Julia P.
Herzberg.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez, best known as a painter, was born in 1954 in Brooklyn
of Puerto Rican parents. He is a political artist to the core, and
in his hands activism assumes distinctly religious overtones. In
fact, the complex, multilayered vision of Puerto Rico embodied in
his prints amounts to a kind of sacred history, populated by
saints, living and dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a tribute to the nationalist hero Pedro Albizu Campos
(1891-1965), Sanchez alternates photographs of the man, elderly,
just out of prison and slumped in a wheelchair, with a popular
print of Jesus crowned with thorns. In a 1990 monotype, he presents
snapshot images of his mother and aunt in a diptych-shaped monotype
resembling a portable altarpiece.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of his largest pieces, he enshrined a photograph of
his daughter, dressed for her First Communion, in a mixed-media
print shaped like an arched church window. Here, along with
Christian symbols, the girl is surrounded by spiral-shaped Taino
emblems emphasizing the other, recessive culture that is part of
her spiritual heritage. As in so much of Sanchez's art, the
political, the social and the personal are inseparable and deeply
felt.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Santos and `Transboricua'
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual cast to his prints finds a counterpart in ``Puerto
Rican Santos de Palo: Sculptures Between Heaven and Earth,'' a
selection from the museum's splendid collection of santos, or
wooden saints and madonnas, many of them carved by self-taught
rural artists for home altars. Accompanying the display, organized
by Fatima Bercht, are photographs by Hector Mendez Caratini
documenting Puerto Rican religious practices.
</P>
<P>
   And Sanchez's commitment to the ideal of community is shared by
the artist Pepon Osorio, represented here by his remarkable
installation ``Transboricua,'' which made its debut last summer
under the museum's auspices in a children's department store in the
barrio. An iconic and atmospheric assemblage, it addresses the
changing complexion of a neighborhood in which various Latino
populations now mix, with Mexicans among the most recent arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   `Viva la Muerte'
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Mexican culture is honored in ``Viva la Muerte,'' a
small sampling of contemporary work inspired by the festival known
as the Day of the Dead. An exuberant blend of Christian and
Mesoamerican traditions, the holiday, which falls on Nov. 1 and 2,
is widely celebrated in Mexico itself and was adopted as an emblem
of cultural identity by the Chicano movement.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the work in the show, organized by Deborah Lawrence and
Eduardo Pineda of the San Franciscan Museum of Modern Art and
Miriam de Uriarte of El Museo, is slight, but it includes a fine
Posada-esque drawing of grinning skeletons by Enrique Chagoya,
hallucinatory computer-generated images by Rupert Garcia and a
flavorful installation by Raul E. Aquilar.
</P>
<P>
   A full-size Day of the Dead altar will be built at the museum on
Oct. 31, and the public is invited to join in by contributing small
offerings. The result last fall was a fantastic array of religious
images, toys, food, candles, marzipan skulls, flowers, personal
mementos and photos of family and friends. The whole idea of this
bountiful, ceremonial gesture, honoring vital spirits past and
those still to come, seems very much in the spirit of El Museo del
Barrio itself in its anniversary year.  &QL;

 &HT;    Kidspeak program promotes infant biligual educationBy Dan
Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hey kids, it's time to play ``Simon dice''!
</P>
<P>
   A game which is even more fun than ``Simon Says'' because, in
the hands of Spanish teacher Estela Flores-Moreno, it's muy loco.
</P>
<P>
   And a good thing it's nutty, too. Because of the dozen
preschoolers sitting in a semicircle around Estela, in the Cross
and Crown Child Care Center in Dunwoody (Ga.), none has yet reached
his or her third birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simon dice: arriba!'' cries Estela, who has the
larger-than-life personality of a standup comedian, jumping up and
throwing her hands over her head. All the kids follow suit,
grinning. They continue to imitate the cherubic, foghorn-voiced
teacher as she shakes her hands (``las manos!''), and collapses on
the floor to simulate sleep (``dormir!'') with a rumbling snore.
Not all the kids repeat the words back _ some of the 2-year-olds
can barely speak, after all _ but they follow and obviously
understand Estela's every move because she herself is no snore.
</P>
<P>
   The class is clearly more fun than work for the tykes _ even
though Estela speaks nothing but Spanish for the full 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the get-'em-young campaign of Kidspeak International.
Based in Atlanta, the 4-year-old program dispatches 20 instructors
of French and Spanish to teach about 900 students in schools and
preschools around metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started this organization because I was impressed by the
scientific evidence that your mind is most flexible before you're
7,'' says Kidspeak president Robert Goldberg. The 39-year-old
ex-Army officer explains, ``There are millions of connections
between brain cells that can only form before age 7. It's a
use-it-or-lose-it situation; at Kidspeak, we use it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a national trend that might be called smarting down, parents
are striving to give their preschoolers, even infants, a structured
educational experience in language, math, arts _ even computers _
for a competitive edge in education and life. Scientific evidence
often, but not always, supports the trend. For instance, the theory
that listening to classical music from the crib could cultivate a
smarter child was recently challenged by new research that claims
it makes no difference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the studies of infant brain development that Goldberg
referred to, widely publicized in 1997, have lowered the age
threshhold for teaching a second language. The Atlanta-based
Primrose Schools Franchising Company, with 70 schools in seven
states, includes Spanish in its core curiculum for 4- and
5-year-olds. The Language Workshop for Children in New York starts
infants at six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every city we go into, there are parents clamoring for more
preschool education,'' says Primrose president Jo Kirchner. ``We
provide that structure, but structure doesn't mean pressure. There
has to be a part of the day when the kids participate only because
they choose to, otherwise you create unhealthy stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed there are parents who worry that a carefree, workfree
childhood is, like the rainforest, a precious vanishing resource.
Goldberg's response is, ``If you make learning fun enough, it's not
an either-or situation. You can have the freedom of play with the
kinds of structure that will enhance learning later in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg regrets learning Spanish so late _ when he was a cadet
at West Point. ``When I finally went to Spain, I was petrified of
carrying on a conversation,'' he says. ``It got me thinking about
the importance of an early start.''
</P>
<P>
   After stewing in an unfulfilling law practice in Michigan, he
headed for Atlanta in 1996 with a hunch that the Olympics would
raise demand for more languages. He and his wife, Kimberley
Goldberg _ whom he met while both were teaching Spanish in Atlanta
that year _ founded Kidspeak, partly on the model of a British
program they had studied.
</P>
<P>
   They have built a healthy roster of clients. Occasionally they
contract with an institution _ for instance, Cross and Crown, which
pays Kidspeak to teach seven classes at various age levels _ but
more often they sell the course directly to parents, typically for
$140-$185 for about 16 weekly sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The 2- and 3-year-old starts may not be right for every child.
At Cross and Crown, one of the 2-year-olds was so unresponsive to
Estela that he was eventually allowed to wander across the room and
investigate an inflatable pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, one of the advantages of starting at a younger age
became clear when Estela hurried down the hall to her 3-year-old
class. When she held up an animal picture and pronounced, ``leon,''
one boy protested, ``That's a lion!'' Later on he insisted on
``fox'' for the picture of ``El Lobo!'' that Estella brought to
hilarious, snarling life in her Spanish version of ``Little Red
Riding Hood.'' The 2-year-olds, on the other hand, often mimicked
Estela's Spanish words perfectly and never countered with English
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Which raises the question: how low can they go?
</P>
<P>
   ``I once started teaching Spanish to an infant six weeks old,''
Estela says, ''And by two-and-a-half he was fully bilingual.''
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ My introduction to soccer came when I was 8 and my
family moved to Oxford for two years. Homesick for America, my
brother and I would head to a local field with our baseball gloves
only to find it consistently occupied by kids kicking around a
volleyball. Or at least that's what it looked like to me.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually realizing that our only other option was cricket, a
game that makes baseball look like nonstop action, we began playing
soccer. By the time I returned stateside, I had not only picked up
the type of English accent that gets one beat up by large fourth
graders, but had also acquired a love of the game. The free-flowing
play, intricate teamwork and athleticism all appealed to me. I
played competitively through high school, but with the exception of
kicking around in the backyard I hadn't played since.
</P>
<P>
   Intent on changing that, I set out recently in search of pickup
soccer games. In many cities this would have been a foolish quest.
Most players drift away from the game after school, choosing to
pursue more practical sports.
</P>
<P>
   But in the great melting pot of New York City, where immigrants
arrive harboring a love of the game, you can always find people
playing. They set up garbage cans and play in the street or throw
down their shirts to create impromptu goals on any grassy surface.
The games in each neighborhood reflect the population: Irish
players at Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, a Caribbean influence
at Prospect Park in Brooklyn and a Hispanic flavor at Flushing
Meadows Park in Queens. I knew they had to be playing in Manhattan,
I just had to find them.
</P>
<P>
   After a few dead ends, I met a couple of players at Chelsea
Piers (which has indoor leagues and occasional open play) who told
me about regular pickup games on a field at 101st Street and
Riverside Drive. I headed up there with my cleats, soccer shorts
and a fair amount of apprehension. It turns out I needed only the
latter two; open grass fields in Manhattan are about as common as
taxi drivers in the rain. As a result, most games are played on
asphalt, dirt or, as in this case, artificial turf. The ``field''
at 101st Street and Riverside Drive is actually an expanse of
tan-colored turf about 60 yards long ringed by trees and a running
track. Two small netted goals about four feet high stand at
opposite ends.
</P>
<P>
   When I arrived in the late afternoon, there was already an
eight-on-eight game under way. I warmed up on the sideline, kicking
around with a local teen-ager and trying to get the hang of playing
in running shoes. Six more players arrived, and the eight of us
took the field to challenge the winning team. All but one of my
teammates were speaking Spanish, a language I once studied but had
not used in years.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, one of my opponents, a regular (and the only woman
playing that day) named Wendy Hollender filled me in. ``We play
first to score or until 15 minutes,'' she said. ``There are no
corner kicks or throw-ins, and the goalie can't use his hands.''
Perhaps noticing my butterflies _ it had been more than eight years
since I'd played game _ she added: ``Don't worry. If you don't mess
up too bad the first time, they'll pass it to you again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass they did. Because of the short field (regulation soccer
fields are 100 to 130 yards long), artificial turf and minuscule
goals, there were no booming free kicks, slide tackles,
crossbar-scraping shots on goal or diving headers. The name of the
game was ball control, with an emphasis on numerous quick passes,
fancy footwork and close-range shots. Success depended on
understanding the angles and nuances. In one sense, it was the
sport distilled to its essence. In another less poetic sense, it
was really frustrating. I felt like the long-hitting golfer John
Daly trapped on a miniature-golf course.
</P>
<P>
   After growing up playing on expansive suburban fields, I was
accustomed to lots of space, long passes and physical tackles: the
traditional American style of play. Forced to play a more refined
finesse game, I found my athletic advantage taken away, and I felt
clumsy and confined, especially against quicker, more lithe
opponents. I made erratic passes, overran the ball and almost
leveled my teammates numerous times.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of our 15 minutes, we were still tied, so they
flipped a coin to decide the winner. We won the toss, and in our
second game a skilled midfielder on our squad nicknamed Maradona
made like his namesake _ the forward from Argentina's World Cup
teams _ and punched in an early goal to give us the victory. My
play improved _ I made a couple of good passes and almost scored on
a header _ but I was still basically a nonfactor.
</P>
<P>
   Our run ended in the third game and I retired to the sideline,
where I sat down beside Richard, a compact man with white hair and
a mustache. Richard is the unofficial commissioner of this field.
He settles disputes, jokes with the children and barks strategy
from his position as goalie. At 49, he has spent more than 20 years
playing soccer on the streets of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until they opened this park last year, we used to play on any
flat space we could find,'' he said. ``We'd head out between
baseball games, play on blacktops, whatever it took.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about soccer in the city is that you play with
everyone from busboys to doctors, whoever loves the game,'' he
continued. ``Out here, the ages range from 15 to 50, and because
there are so many immigrants in New York we get all nations and
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Within an hour or so, the park had filled up with about 60
people, mostly Hispanic men in their 20s and 30s. Along the
sidelines, the waiting players gave impromptu color commentary or
analyzed their previous loss. Behind one net a group of people had
set up a short field using garbage cans for goals. In the distance,
I could see a couple of games starting up on deserted baseball
diamonds north of the park. It was an amazing collection of skilled
soccer players to find in the heart of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   I left the park energized but still itched to play on a big
field. The next weekend I got my chance. A friend and fellow
athletic enthusiast, Istvan Seri, invited me to play a game with
his league team. I packed my cleats and followed him to a local
suburban high school.
</P>
<P>
   We started out strong, attacking well and keeping the
opposition's fast forwards at bay. Seri, who almost played
professionally in his native Hungary (his father told him ``better
to be a mediocre doctor than a mediocre soccer player''),
controlled the midfield. His son Adam, a nationally ranked tennis
player at the University of Georgia, made acrobatic saves in goal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough though; we couldn't generate much offense and
lost 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, I felt my skills returning as I charged up and down the
grass field. With every pass, header or dribble, my muscle memory
slowly creaked back to life.
</P>
<P>
   After the match, I headed home and flopped onto my sofa,
clinging to a 32-ounce bottle of Gatorade. My hamstrings were
tighter than the strings on a concerto violin, my quadriceps
throbbed like twin stereo speakers and my neck felt as if I had
just subjected it to a double feature from the front row of the
movie theater. In other words, I felt great. I was back in the
game.

RIGHTS AGENCY DIRECTOR UNDER REVIEW FOR ALLEGED MISMANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The 11 commissioners of the Human Rights
Commission are conducting a closed-door evaluation of the agency's
director amid accusations of mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   The HRC, which is responsible for administering the affirmative
action and domestic partner benefits programs in San Francisco, has
logged far more complaints than any other city agency, a union
representative said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had contact with a great deal of employees representing
departments all around the city,'' said Harry Baker, president of
the Golden Gate Chapter of Service Employees International Union
Local 790, which represents 1,200 municipal employees. ``I've never
seen a management team as abusive of its employees as that one, and
petty.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioners have focused their evaluation on the executive
director, Marivic Bamba, who was appointed by Mayor Willie Brown in
1996. She was formerly the director of contract compliance for the
city of Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically if you're the head coach, if you're the CEO, you're
the person where the buck stops,'' said Harry Low, a retired judge
who is the chairman of the commission. ``We're doing that
evaluation.''
</P>
<P>
   The volume of complaints _ more than 30 in 2 1/2 years from a
staff of about 40, according to Baker _ led last year to a review
of the agency by the Department of Human Resources, which is
responsible for personnel matters in city departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed a need for improvement in management style,
returning phone calls, open communication,'' Low said.
</P>
<P>
   The confidential report recommended management training and
better people skills, said Low, who is also one of three people
appointed by the mayor to serve on a panel to assess the HRC's
minority contracting program.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he has filed four grievances on behalf of employees
who have been dismissed or demoted in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   All worked in contract compliance at the airport. Other staff
complaints were more informal and mostly involved perceived
mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   Bamba responded to a list of specific questions with a statemenng she has increased the department's staffing and budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``HRC staff continue to work diligently as a team of committed
professionals who firmly believe in the daunting task of
eradicating discrimination,'' she said in the statement.

NFL MATCHUPS FOR WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAME OF THE WEEK (4:05 P.M. SUNDAY)
</P>
<P>
   Seattle (3-1) vs. San Diego (3-1)
</P>
<P>
   This game was not originally considered a matchup that would
determine the early American Football Conference West lead, but the
Seahawks and Chargers are picking up this division's pieces left by
Denver's early swoon. Seattle has won without its holdout receiver,
Joey Galloway, and San Diego has won despite injuries at
quarterback, where Jim Harbaugh recovers from banged ribs and
watches Erik Kramer excel. Kramer is especially good late in games,
having completed 9 of 11 fourth-quarter passes for 77 yards. It
will be a see-saw, entertaining game dripping with drama, one in
which San Diego wins it in the fourth quarter with a stout
defensive stand. Chargers, 23-19.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 1 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (0-5) vs. Jacksonville (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland lost its first two games by an average of 30 points
and then lost its last three by a an average of only 6.7 points.
Improvement, yes, but hollow compared with the bottom line of
winning games. Of course, the Browns are excused, as they gain
experience as an expansion franchise while competing against teams
that view them as a sure victory. Jacksonville sees the same, and
the Jaguars will use this game as a chance to tune an offense that
has toiled while its defense roars. Jacksonville reaches a 5-1
record for the third straight year. Jaguars, 38-16.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis (2-2) vs. Jets (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have problems running, passing, catching and scoring.
Their offense has slumped, and they face a team that leads the AFC
in scoring. Peyton Manning has thrown at least a touchdown pass in
his last 17 consecutive starts (best in the league) and has tossed
a scoring pass to receiver Marvin Harrison in 14 of the Colts' last
16 games. The Jets must figure a way to pressure Manning, who has
only been sacked twice. They hope quarterback Rick Mirer (3
touchdown passes, 7 interceptions) can elevate his play.
Indianapolis has won more games (34) against the Jets than it has
against any opponent and it has won seven of the last nine in this
series. That trend continues. Colts, 20-17.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (3-1) vs. New England (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   Miami makes its second straight divisional road trip, having
tripped Indianapolis, 34-31. This time, the test is tougher. It is
a smart matchup _ the Dolphins' flexible and fast defense against
the Patriots' deep-strike offense. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe has
four 300-yard passing games against Miami, the most he has compiled
against any team, and receiver Terry Glenn has gained at least 92
receiving yards in each game this season. Glenn owns league-bests
in receiving yards (636) and in average yards per catch (17.2).
Bledsoe-to-Glenn and New England's ability to convert third downs
wins it. Watch Dan Marino become the first NFL passer to reach
60,000 yards. Patriots, 24-17.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (2-3) vs. Detroit (2-2)
</P>
<P>
   Both teams lost at home last week _ Minnesota to Chicago and
Detroit to San Diego _ but it is the Vikings who are reeling most.
They are finding it impossible to duplicate the traits, primarily a
circus-like offense, that made them a 15-1 team a year ago. Fewer
points, fewer big plays for the Vikings and a defense that is
allowing an average of 374 yards a game spell trouble. Detroit
needs more big plays, too, especially in the passing game. It is
often not a good sign when a team's leading receiver is its running
back, and that back happens to be Ron Rivers _ not Barry Sanders _
with only 17 catches. Help is on the way for Detroit. Receiver
Herman Moore is expected to return from injury, and Detroit will
benefit. Lions, 17-16.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland (2-3) vs. Buffalo (4-1)
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of two quarterbacks who like to run with the ball and
are as good at it as they are passing it. Rich Gannon and Doug
Flutie have thrown six touchdown passes apiece, but Buffalo has
been more successful as a team because of a better defense. It
features the league's best run defense (62.4 yards allowed per
game). It is allowing 54 fewer overall yards per game than Oakland
and is allowing only a 30.8 percent conversion on third-down plays.
Buffalo shoots for continuation of some nifty streaks _ its fifth
5-1 start of the '90s, its 10th victory in its last 11 home games
and its seventh consecutive victory in October. It gets them.
Bills, 16-10.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia (1-4) vs. Chicago (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   ``The most disgusting thing was when the stretcher came out and
they started cheering again,'' said Eagles receiver Charles Johnson
about his team's fans when Dallas receiver Michael Irvin was
injured in Philadelphia last week. ``It was embarrassing to be on
the sideline. He's lying out there with a restraint on his neck and
you don't even know if he's conscious, and your heart really goes
out to the guy. Not all of our fans were booing, but for the ones
who did, it just wasn't tasteful. Our fans pride themselves on
being tough, but that wasn't tough. That was ignorant.'' OK. Even
with the Eagles on the road, their fans will boo THEM this time.
Bears, 19-12.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (2-3) vs. Cincinnati (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   Akili Smith passed for 221 yards, 2 touchdowns and led the late,
game-winning drive in his first NFL start in the Bengals' victory
over Cleveland. He is supported by Corey Dillon, the league's
leading rusher, and if Dillion finishes the season that way, he
will become the first Bengal to do so since Paul Robinson 31 years
ago. Of course, the Bengals usually have a rough time stopping
Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis; he has gained 615 rushing yards in his
last 6 games against them. Bettis is a bruiser, Dillon is a
slasher. Bettis vs. Dillon? This time, go with Bettis. Steelers,
23-21.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis (4-0) vs. Atlanta (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Rams are amazing. Curt Warner has 14 touchdown passes and is
the first since Don Meredith in 1966 to throw that many in his
first four games. The Rams threw only 12 touchdown passes all of
last year. Warner has three 300-yard passing games and has thrown
at least three touchdowns in each of his four games. Warner throws
to dynamic receivers, chief among them Isaac Bruce (22 catches for
446 yards and a 20.3 average yards per catch along with 6 touchdown
grabs, 4 last week against San Francisco). The Rams finally ended
their losing hex against the 49ers and they will not slip. They
remain hungry, reaching a 5-0 record for the first time since 1989.
Rams, 25-20.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee (4-1) vs. New Orleans (1-3)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee has not reached a 5-1 record in eight years and this
game is dangerous. The Saints may not be so terrible. They are plus
5 in turnover differential. Their six turnovers committed rank
second-fewest in the NFC. Their seven fumble recoveries rank second
in the conference. They have allowed the fewest passing first downs
(33) in the league. They rank second in sacks in the conference.
Those numbers sound like a 3-1 team, not a 1-3 team. Much of it
boils down to timing, not making consistent or big plays in the
game's most excruciating moments. Tennessee slips by. Titans, 10-9.

UNDATED: 10-9.  

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (1-3) vs. San Francisco (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   This is George Seifert's first game against his old team, and he
catches them at a low point. The 49ers are nursing deep wounds
after their whipping at the Rams. They still don't have Steve Young
back at quarterback and, more and more, it looks as if Young's
concussion might keep him out longer. Their pass defense was porous
against the Rams and oftentimes embarrassing. Look for the 49ers to
rebound. But watch Carolina and back Tim Biakabutuka chew them up.
Look for a big game from Beuerlein and his receivers. This is a
victory that Seifert desperately wants. He will cherrish it.
Panthers, 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (3-1) vs. Denver (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   A rematch of Super Bowl XXXII but both teams have different
looks. Green Bay is turning games over to Brett Favre, letting him
work his magic in a variety of ways. Denver is still trying to
solve its problems at quarterback, running back and on defense.
Winning at the Raiders was a start. But the Broncos meet a team
that has jelled much faster than them. One with more talent, too,
especially at the skill positions. Denver offers a fight but Green
Bay's Dorsey Levens (4.4 average yards per carry) runs out the
clock at the end. Packers, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Washington (3-1) vs. Arizona (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   Washington enjoyed a bye and an extra week to prepare for
Arizona. That should serve them well, especially quarterback Brad
Johnson. He has thrown for 1,191 yards in four games and leads an
offense that averages 412.5 yards per game. In 122 pass attempts
this season, Johnson has not thrown an interception. Stephen Davis
anchors the ground game with 400 rushing yards; his career high in
a season is 567. Arizona has won six of the last seven at home
against Washington and its defense is capable; it has the
top-ranked pass defense in the NFC. But look for Johnson to solve
them. Redskins, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (3-1) vs. Giants (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 6-0 against the Giants on Monday nights and last year
in a Monday night game spanked them, 31-7. It was a game where
Deion Sanders ran circles around them, scoring on punt and
interception returns. Dallas swept the Giants last year. The
Cowboys recover from the emotional loss of the injured Michael
Irvin and play confidently against a team they think they can
dominate. They find the Giants offense simple, the Giants defense
tougher, but, overall, believe they are simply a better team. Maybe
so. Cowboys, 23-17.

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY

  (af) 
 By JESSE McKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Contact,'' Susan Stroman and John Weidman's musical
meditation on dance and love, is prompting the type of sales that
make even producers get misty.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which opened last Thursday at Lincoln Center's Mitzi
E. Newhouse Theater, sold $298,000 in tickets the next day, an
exceptional showing for an off-Broadway-size theater. (Top tickets,
it should be noted, are $65, higher than most off-Broadway shows.)
By midday Saturday, it had sold out its entire run, including a
five-week extension through Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Scenarios for moving the show downtown to a Broadway theater
cropped up almost instantly. But in the end, ``Contact'' will stay
close to home, moving from the downstairs Newhouse to the upstairs
Vivian Beaumont, a Broadway-size venue, where the show will be
eligible for Tony nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Performances at the Beaumont begin on March 9. That date allows
a four-week cushion for a possible extension of the new musical
``Marie Christine,'' which opens on Dec. 2 at the Beaumont and has
an official closing date of Jan. 9. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Debut in `Wild Party'
</P>
<P>
   Confirming widespread speculation, the Public Theater said this
week that Toni Collette, the comely Australian actress currently
starring in the film ``The Sixth Sense,'' has been cast in the role
of Queenie in next spring's Broadway production of ``The Wild
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Queenie, you'll remember, was the part played by Vanessa
Williams in an early workshop of the show. Ms. Williams bowed out
of the show in late September just before a surprise wedding
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Collette, 26, has been acting professionally since her
teens, making her breakthrough in 1995 as the Abba-loving,
nuptial-obsessed title character in ``Muriel's Wedding,'' a role
she had to gain weight to play. She's had a steady stream of parts
since, but ``The Wild Party'' will be her Broadway debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done no theater since 1993, so I'm going to be absolutely
petrified,'' said Ms. Collette, who is from Sydney. ``But it's
going to be nice to actually unpack my bags.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Ragtime' Suit
</P>
<P>
   Wilner Advertising, a Broadway advertising agency, has filed a
$500,000 lawsuit against the Pace Theatrical Group, the producer of
``Ragtime,'' claiming that Pace stole an advertising slogan for the
show.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which alleges copyright infringement, concerns an
advertisement that appeared in The New York Times and several other
newspapers on Sept. 19. The ad portrays three beaming children
standing beneath a millennial slogan: ``Before the century ends,
see how it all began.'' Similar ads are also running on television
and radio.
</P>
<P>
   In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court on Oct. 1, lawyers
for the Wilner agency said that the slogan and image had been
lifted from a pitch for the ``Ragtime'' account, which John Wilner,
the agency's founder, presented to Scott Zeiger, Pace's president,
in a meeting in late August.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Wilner showed Pace its storyboards, and the next thing
you know, he saw his line in the paper,'' said Eve Rachel
Markewich, a lawyer for Tenzer Greenblatt, which is representing
Wilner.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pace said it believed the lawsuit was ``without
merit,'' and objected to the naming of Zeiger as an individual
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway advertising community is a small but highly
competitive one. In the mid-1990s, Wilner and his former partner,
Peter LeDonne, handled a series of major shows, including ``Show
Boat'' and ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the company has lost ground to Serino-Coyne,
the industry leader, and to companies like Spotco and Grey
Entertainment. It is currently handling only one Broadway show,
``Saturday Night Fever.'' &QL;

   `Aida' Without Pyramid
</P>
<P>
   The lighting was austere, the costumes were basic black, and
there wasn't a giant, mobile pyramid in sight.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon at the New Amsterdam Theater, Disney staged
its first major group-sales presentation of the new ``Aida,'' a
musical written by Sir Elton John and Tim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The audience was a select crowd of 3,600 close friends and
potential bulk-ticket buyers. The show, which begins a tryout in
Chicago on Nov. 12, opens at the Palace Theater in New York in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The presentation was a first look at how the $15 million show
has evolved from its first incarnation, which stalled in Atlanta
last year _ as did its oft-maligned set centerpiece, a giant
rotating pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   Early indications are that the new creative team, headed by the
director Robert Falls (``Death of a Salesman'') and the designer
Bob Crowley (``The Iceman Cometh''), has revamped the show from
head to toe.
</P>
<P>
   Falls outlined a new beginning, which involves a modern couple
pre-incarnated as the princess Aida (played by Heather Headley) and
her lover Radames (Adam Pascal). He also offered quips about Disney
and Sir Elton _ and himself. ``I did everything I could to slip
musical numbers in `Death of a Salesman,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, meanwhile, showed more than a half-dozen designs, from
a prison scene, with stark black cells in front of a deep blue
backdrop, to his vision of the Nile valley, all yellow and orange,
with palm trees reflected in silhouette. As for that infamous set
piece, it has been replaced by a more minimalist _ and less finicky
_ triangular laser beam.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the nearest thing you are going to get to a pyramid,''
Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ George Wendt, known on television for ``Cheers'' and on
Broadway for ``Art,'' will return to a New York stage in ``An Empty
Plate at the Cafe du Grand Boeuf.'' It will open in March at
Primary Stages.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Another American: Asking and Telling,'' a play by Marc Wolf
about gays in the military, will be the second show in the New
Group's season. Produced in association with David Marshall Grant,
it will begin performances on Dec. 7 at the Theater at St. Clements
. The company's season opener, ``Cranes,'' opens there on
Wednesday.

A NEW COP DRAMA WORTH CARING ABOUT ON FOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' is a cop drama, but Dewey-decimal
devotees may want to categorize it with all the new shows exploring
class polarization. For when 19-year-old Philadelphia police
officer Ryan Caulfield straps on his 9-millimeter, he is as
different from his pals in teen mufti as high school is from
college.
</P>
<P>
   Caulfield, whose dirty-cop father is in prison, eschewed a
college scholarship to attend the police academy. Now on the beat
and eager to do right, he is tormented by his father's legacy, his
mother's mothering, his own insecurity and the allure of the road
not taken.
</P>
<P>
   That's more carry-on baggage than the FAA recommends, but
Caulfield is willing to face the pressure of his fears, his peers
and his seers. He cares enough to make a difference and, despite a
second episode that's overwrought by a sob or two, ``Ryan
Caulfield: Year One'' looks like a cop drama worth caring about.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's premiere, the telegenic Sean Maher establishes
Caulfield as the enthusiastic rookie cop teamed with a seasoned
veteran in one of Philadelphia's most blighted neighborhoods. In
his first day on the job, Caulfield sees more dead bodies than the
average cop probably sees in a career, but, hey, this is prime-time
TV. Caulfield's reaction to it is also fairly standard _ first the
stiff upper lip, then the crumbling facade later on.
</P>
<P>
   But by letting viewers see Caulfield off the job as well as on,
creators James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox (``The Negotiator'') have put
a fresh face on yet another show about big-city cops. The story
lines are equally divided between Caulfield's time behind the badge
and his time behind the scenes, that is, in the privacy of
relationships with his mother, his girlfriend and his two best
buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Fox, given to overexaggeration, calls it the most original
police drama in years. It's an easy claim to dismiss: CBS's
``Turks'' plowed some of the same ground as recently as last
season. Still, ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' is better than its
gestation period might have suggested. Originally titled ``Ryan
Caulfield,'' which sounds like an Aaron Spelling soaper, the show
had the gifted Mary McDonnell in the role of Caulfield's mother.
McDonnell departed after the pilot was shot, ostensibly because the
show was going to be less mom-centric and the producers had renamed
it ``The Badland,'' after a downtrodden district in Philadelphia.
That title was also somewhat misleading, so it was finally changed
to ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One,'' which at least suggests some sort
of story arc involving a fledgling endeavor.
</P>
<P>
   Maher brings credibility to the principal role. But, as is
usually the case in a good show, the strength of the supporting
cast is its keystone. Familiar players such as Michael Rispoli and
Richard Portnow help fill out the police ranks with something more
than station-house cliches, while James Roday and Chad Lindberg
play Caulfield's best friends with a liveliness that makes it
possible to see police officers as regular people.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to embrace another police drama, but if there's still
room on your dance card this late in the new season, it might be
worth giving ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' a spin.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Caulfield: Year One. Hourlong drama series about a
19-year-old police officer in Philadelphia. Starring Sean Maher,
Michael Rispoli, Roselyn Sanchez, James Roday, Chad Lindberg,
Richard Portnow, Clifton Powell and Brenda Bakke. Series premiere
Friday night on Fox. Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

PROPELLED BY DIFFERENT DRUMMERS: SETTING JAZZ'S COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BEN RATLIFF    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ About three years ago I started to notice that I no
longer knew what to expect at a jazz club. The music started
changing. The clunkily drawn opposing territories _ traditional vs.
avant-garde, or swing-centric jazz vs. jazz free with a steady
pulse _ became irrelevant. Lots of bands were coming up with ways
to create spontaneous form onstage.
</P>
<P>
   A huge hybrid area, a kind of adventurous mainstream, began to
assert itself. The music sounded different. And as is always the
case when jazz evolves, rhythm seemed to be at the root of the
change.
</P>
<P>
   I began to notice a rash of young drummers I'd never heard of,
all of them loaded with technique and with at least the seeds of
originality. They were opening up the idea of strict time, making
lots of tempo changes, playing slowly behind a fast solo or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   They were stretching the music's formal elements while keeping
bounce and swing in it, and their playing often seemed to define
the shape of the band's sound. These young drummers were obviously
learning rhythms from other cultures; not just glancing at them but
really learning them.
</P>
<P>
   Marvelous drummers came along in the 1980s, and they're still
playing superbly, refining their craft and wielding influence. They
include Jeff ``Tain'' Watts, Ralph Peterson and Lewis Nash. And in
the early and mid-1990s they were joined by Greg Hutchinson, Matt
Wilson, Jim Black, Brian Blade, Clarence Penn and Leon Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is another new crop, setting the rhythm for jazz's
future. It's a good time to pay attention to the back of the
bandstand.
</P>
<P>
   NASHEET WAITS
</P>
<P>
   Nasheet Waits plays with band leaders like the vibraphonist
Stefon Harris and the saxophonist Antonio Hart, musicians who use
hard swing and come more or less out of the mainstream jazz idiom.
But in each tune, Waits performs as if he's taking a never-ending
solo.
</P>
<P>
   The pulse is always there, yet he moves accents around it,
making rhythm contract and expand, changing his focus for stretches
at a time from cymbals to toms to bass drum and snare. Waits is the
son of Freddie Waits, one of jazz's recent unsung heroes, a drummer
who played all over the aesthetic map, with Kenny Barron and Sonny
Rollins and Cecil Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Nasheet Waits only grew serious about playing after his father's
death in 1989, and he studied with Michael Carvin as well as Max
Roach, whose tendency to break rhythms down to their essence and
slowly build them up again have leaked into Waits' playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did a gig with Hamiet Bluiett at the Vision Festival,'' he
said recently, referring to his appearance with the baritone
saxophone player at a free-jazz festival in May. ``That was nice,
because it let me see that the way that I feel music is valid. You
don't always have to be snapping your fingers, one, two, three,
four.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled seeing the saxophonist David S. Ware play. ``The
audience was swaying,'' he said, ``more like an infinity sign, that
kind of movement. And I said, `Yeah, that's the way I feel when I
play.' I feel it in a circle. You start from a point in the center
and circle around, kind of swirl, like the ocean, the water, that
kind of movement.''
</P>
<P>
   When he's playing, Waits said, he's not just thinking about jazz
drumming, but he proceeds as if he were using an imaginary
instrument of infinite capability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max told me that he used to ride the train and try to deal
with the rhythm of the train,'' he said. ``There are all these
sounds out there that you can incorporate into your flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Waits was talking in a cafe, and outside a bus released its air
brakes and took off. ``You can use that,'' Waits said, gesturing
behind him, ``get that sound like ssss and then rruuuurrr, an
acceleration kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But even here Waits sets rules. ``You can sound like you're
accelerating without actually speeding anything up,'' he said.
``You want to be able to manipulate energy.''
</P>
<P>
   RODNEY GREEN
</P>
<P>
   Two winters ago, when Greg Osby's quartet played a week at Sweet
Basil, musicians came down in droves. The band was particularly
hot, and word had been spreading about its new drummer, Rodney
Green, a teen-ager from Camden, N.J. Some of the music that week
turned into a live album, ``Banned in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just turned 18,'' he said, ``and I didn't even have all
my stuff moved to New York yet. I'd graduated from high school in
June, and that was December. I was scared to death. People were
coming down to the club, and I'm just now starting to realize who
they were.'' Then, awe-struck, he recited a roll call of drummers:
``Lenny White. Billy Hart. Brian Blade. Victor Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   You get a sense of just how young Green is when he speaks of
having ``had the good fortune'' to see, say, Blade, once or twice.
(Blade plays in New York regularly.) But Green is a fearsome
drummer.
</P>
<P>
   From the age of 6 he played drums in church, accompanying his
parents, who are both preachers. He mastered the most recent
incarnation of gospel-funk rhythms, playing behind tremendous drum
sets with racks of tom-toms and a lot of cymbals.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 15, a friend showed him an album-cover photo of
Elvin Jones, whom he'd never heard of, and then played him the
record, which was John Coltrane's ``Transition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvin had this little 18-inch bass drum, toms that looked
really small, and two cymbals, and he was playing all this stuff,''
Green said, looking shattered. The experience challenged him to
find his own sound on a drum kit, rather than letting the kit
define him.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left high school, he was playing with the pop singer
Patti LaBelle, but jazz won out. Now he's a regular member of the
band led by the pianist Eric Reed. Like a lot of young drummers,
he's thrilling at fast tempos, but his grooves are ornate, full of
tone color from the tiny additions of cymbals and toms that he
positions around each beat.
</P>
<P>
   He has been studying with Carvin for about a year and a half.
``He made one of the strangest requests I've ever heard,'' Green
said of his teacher. ``He told me to stop listening to jazz. Listen
to the Nat King Cole trio without the drums, the one with bass,
drums and guitar. Listen to classical music. And then listen to
yourself. Now I can't listen to my favorite drummer and copy all
his ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   JOHN HOLLENBECK
</P>
<P>
   I first heard John Hollenbeck at alt.coffee, a small East
Village cafe that booked music on Monday nights. His bands, the
Claudia Quintet and the Lucy Quartet, are set up for his
compositions, which are slightly academic: he likes to write tone
rows based on telephone numbers and melodies based on the rhythms
of poems. But his light, swinging drumming gives them a feeling of
security and purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The air that night was sticky, and street noises flooded through
the open street-level window. But Hollenbeck responded with even
more noises, subtle ones that were difficult to discern. He'd use
metal bowls, a child's plastic toy, a small box activated by heat
that made cricket sounds, and he'd deftly add them into his
improvisations.
</P>
<P>
   Here was a drummer with marvelous technique. He studied
classical percussion and jazz at the Eastman School of Music, he
has spent time learning Brazilian and Indian drumming, and he
substitutes in the Village Vanguard Monday night big band, reading
the complex music of Thad Jones and Mel Lewis on the bandstand. For
such a player to be performing oddball music in the East Village is
rare enough. But what won me over was his seriousness about it.
</P>
<P>
   Hollenbeck said that his father, who is a mail-order antiques
dealer in Binghamton, N.Y., would pick up anything that had sound
and bring it home for his older brother, who is now a percussionist
in the Boston Pops.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I started playing at alt.coffee,'' Hollenbeck said,
``I had an outlet all of a sudden to try to make some of them legal
instruments.''
</P>
<P>
   Ostentation isn't the point, and Hollenbeck is not looking for
cheap humor. ``I like to take something with a funny context, that
you think of as a toy, but to make something beautiful out of it.
People laugh if they've never seen it before. But I have a really
dry sense of humor, and for me it's not funny. It's part of the
music. It's just there, and nobody has to know what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ERIC HARLAND
</P>
<P>
   ``The new thing is about freer time,'' said Eric Harland, who's
a member of Terence Blanchard's band and has recorded with Jason
Moran, Stefon Harris and Rodney Jones. ``You keep the time, but you
hear different rhythmic elements in the midst of it and play them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take our discussion right now. We're talking, and if you were
to place time in the midst of how we're talking, each word and each
breath forms a rhythmic concept, some type of rhythm. I've
incorporated that into the way I play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like speaking. If I was talking when I was
playing, what would I say? So I wrap that around a pulse, and find
the different rhythmic values of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Harland, in his mid-20s, is from Houston, and he, too, had a
religious background, with parents who sang and played the organ in
church. He studied at the Manhattan School of Music, left to return
to Houston and become a minister, then came back to New York when
Greg Osby hired him for a tour. Apart from the funk rhythms in
gospel music, he was working out jazz technique and questioning it
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to play complex before I learned simplicity,'' he
said. ``I love meter shifting. I was heavily influenced by Tain and
Jack DeJohnette, and also Elvin Jones and Tony Williams and Max
Roach. Back then they couldn't really get away with it as much as
we can now.''
</P>
<P>
   The refinement of his playing came slowly. ``I used to approach
the drums in an angry way,'' he admitted. ``I used them to let out
my frustrations. My practice technique was that I would get on the
drums, put on a John Coltrane CD and play wild. Little did I know
how much that was helping me, because it was conditioning my body
to be able to get around the drums. Eventually I heard a metronome.
I started hearing a pulse in the midst of the wild beats.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Carter, the great singer and trainer of young jazz
musicians who died last year, hired Harland for her last band. He
lived in her basement during some of that time, improving his piano
skills and generally increasing his musicality.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got us to write our own tunes,'' he said. ``She told us:
`Learn who you are. Don't sit around and wait for things to come to
you.' It started showing me a softer side of myself, which
surprised me. She taught me the polite side of music, too, how to
just `tip''' _ drummers' parlance for minimal accompaniment _ ``and
get into the groove of the song and enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never could say I enjoyed sitting there tipping on the
cymbal, just catching the groove. But Betty made it fun, to the
point where now, doing it with other people, I have fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't always have to play a lot of chops. I think jazz is
totally free. You have the establishment of the groove, but it's
about the freedom of improvisation. You can put anything into it.''
</P>
<P>
   DANIEL FREEDMAN
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go to Israel,'' said the 25-year-old drummer
Daniel Freedman, ``I go to the Sinai desert. It's possible there to
study with the Bedouins and the Sudanese. You can get a vibe, being
in the mountains with these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Like more and more jazz musicians, Freedman is in search of an
honest understanding of foreign rhythms. He has taken advantage of
the proliferation of foreign music on CD, and he leaves the country
whenever he can. In Israel he travels with his friend the Israeli
bassist Omer Avital, who has been a part of the New York jazz scene
for five years now. They go in search of musicians: not as
musicologists, but as vibe seekers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know musicians, but there are certain places where
there are Sudanese who play every night,'' Freedman said. ``They
might be working in the kitchen. Even if you sit with a 13-year-old
kid, the way he would feel a rhythm is the real thing. You don't
have to sit with a master drummer to learn the phrasing. That's
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman attended La Guardia High School of Music and Art and
the Performing Arts in Manhattan, along with a lot of other
musicians who are now part of the scene at the West Village jazz
club Smalls, including the drummer Eric McPherson, the saxophonist
Myron Walden and the pianist Jason Lindner.
</P>
<P>
   At Mannes College of Music he often rehearsed in the basement
with Juan Rodriguez, a rumba expert, who worked at the school as a
custodian. And Freedman started performing Latin-influenced jazz
before he knew much about it, when Lindner landed a gig at a
midtown Cuban restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Freedman has since spent a few months in Cuba, where he studied
with the percussion group Yoruba Andabo, and in Mali. But even in
New York he can indulge a lot of his interest in Afro-Cuban
percussion by playing on weekends with rumba groups in Tompkins
Square Park in the East Village.
</P>
<P>
   The point, as he describes it, is not to play music from other
cultures directly, which he says is inappropriate and disrespectful
to its source. Rather, as new knowledge seeps into him, he can
summon different impulses from himself and the bands he plays with.
</P>
<P>
   And the musicians in his circle, including the members of
Lindner's big band, as well as the drummer Jeff Ballard, the
bassist Avishai Cohen and the oud player Amos Hoffman, are
searching, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all learning together, developing a language,'' Freedman
said. ``Sometimes we'll be playing a groove that might be somewhere
between Latin and Arabic. For a long time, if there was a `Latin'
section of a piece, jazz musicians would play a kind of
stereotypical jazz-Latin groove, and the bass player might play a
samba groove. They didn't really know how the parts fit together. I
feel that it's time to learn what those people are doing. Brazilian
music is totally different from Cuban music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all looking for something besides straight-ahead jazz.
It doesn't necessarily express everything we have to say. I'm from
New York City, so in my ear is already Latin and Arabic and Jewish
music. What a lot of jazz drummers play sounds like jazz drums,
which is amazing. But I would like to make the drum set not sound
like a drum set.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm going for. And sometimes I get there, just for
a minute.''

`MR. ROCK 'N' ROLL: THE ALAN FREED STORY'  
 `RYAN CAULFIELD: YEAR ONE' 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes for `Freed' movie at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   J. Edgar Hoover always gets the silliest lines. ``Let's get
everything we can on him,'' Hoover (Aron Tager) says to an FBI
employee in his one scene in ``Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan Freed
Story.'' ``This rock 'n' roll scourge may turn out to be more
dangerous than communism.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Mr. Rock 'n' Roll,'' an NBC movie to be shown Sunday night,
people are always making pronouncements like that. They don't have
conversations; they sum up the situation with the closest cliche at
hand. And just about every word spoken has one purpose: to sanctify
Freed as an advocate and promoter of racial harmony and justice
second only to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and as the founding
father of rock music.
</P>
<P>
   Freed (played by Judd Nelson, who looks a little startled
throughout the two hours), announces at various points: ``This
music can change the world,'' ``Didn't I tell you? This music has
the power,'' and ``Man, what a show!''
</P>
<P>
   If just once in a while Matt Dorff's script (based on John A.
Jackson's book ``Big Beat Heat: Alan Freed and the Early Years of
Rock-and-Roll'') let the action or normal dialogue make his points,
instead of repeatedly stating the obvious, ``Mr. Rock 'n' Roll''
might not be so insipid.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it will probably have no problem attracting
viewers, if only because of the original recordings used. When
Buddy Holly bursts into ``Peggy Sue'' in an office reception room,
the singing voice and the music are Holly and the Crickets.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true of a dozen or so other numbers, including
Jackie Wilson's ``Lonely Teardrops,'' Little Richard's ``Tutti
Frutti'' and Jerry Lee Lewis' ``Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin' On,''
and these performances are potent reminders of just how thrilling
early rock 'n' roll could be. When the actor playing Bo Diddley
sings, a man at the television station naturally says, ``This stuff
sounds like jungle music.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC is also promoting cameo appearances by Fabian, as an
outraged parent, and Bobby Rydell as a narrow-minded network
executive. Both are pretty much unrecognizable. Paula Abdul also
has a small role, as a songwriter who becomes Freed's mistress.
</P>
<P>
   Freed, who died in obscurity in 1965 at 43, was not necessarily
such a great guy. His contention that he invented the term rock 'n'
roll, which is pretty much the basis for his being celebrated in
this film, is challenged by more than a few people. His career went
downhill after the payola scandal, which is given short shrift
toward the end of ``Mr. Rock 'n' Roll.''
</P>
<P>
   The film also leaves out a couple of Freed's wives and children,
keeping him married to a former dance instructor (Madchen Amick,
who looks very pretty in ponytails and angora sweaters) until the
last scenes. And her unhappiness with the marriage seems to stem
from nothing more than his being out of town a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the story is straightforward. As a radio disk jockey
in Cleveland in his early 30s, he learns from a store owner that
white teen-agers are buying rhythm-and-blues records. So Freed
stops playing mainstream music like Patti Page's ``Old Cape Cod''
and starts playing R-and-B on his show instead. Soon he's the host
of huge concerts and dance parties, and New York calls. He becomes
famous as a New York DJ, gets his own television show (``The Big
Beat'') and makes some movies. Then it all falls apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Rock 'n' Roll'' doesn't seem to be bothered by verbal
anachronisms either. After Freed has had a car accident, his doctor
warns him that he needs to give up smoking, drinking and partying.
``In order to fully recover,'' the young doctor says solemnly,
``you're going to have to make some lifestyle changes.'' People may
have had life styles in the 1950s, but nobody called them that.

   `RYAN CAULFIELD: YEAR ONE'
</P>
<P>
   Fox, Friday night at 8
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Caulfield'' is about a 19-year-old police rookie who
lives at home with his mom and gets introduced to the mean streets
in ways that shock his delicate sensibilities. And if you think
that's ridiculous, wait until you see the show itself, which was
briefly going to be called ``The Badland,'' a nickname for the
tough neighborhood he's assigned. The premier episode, in which
during his first hour on the job the title character is sent to a
crime scene where a cop has been fatally shot, has not a moment of
believability. Ryan has to shoot and kill someone before he has
even found out where his locker is. Sean Maher, who plays Ryan, is
very good looking.

BLAIR LEADS CAMPAIGN SUPPORTING BRITISH ECONOMIC INTEGRATION WITH
EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Saying it would be ``madness'' to rule out joining the
European common currency, Prime Minister Tony Blair kicked off a
rare multiparty campaign Thursday aimed at combating widespread
antipathy in Britain to further integration with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   With high-profile figures from the opposition Conservatives and
the third party, the Liberal Democrats, by his side on a stage in a
futuristic movie theater, Blair, who leads the Labor Party, said:
``Europe is not marginal to the British economy. It is fundamental
to it and each day becomes more so.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To quit Europe,'' he declared, ``would be an act of economic
mutilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's appearance, his most overt demonstration to date of
enthusiasm for a British role in monetary union, occurred as the
decadelong battle over Europe has intensified, with British
politicians going on combat alert. The Conservative leader, William
Hague, stiffened his party's stance last week, and his predecessor,
John Major, labeled Blair's policy ``absurd and crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   The two most important members of Major's former Cabinet, Deputy
Prime Minister Michael Heseltine and Chancellor of the Exchequer
Kenneth Clarke, along with the new leader of the Liberal Democrats,
Charles Kennedy, joined in the presentation Thursday in what Blair
called ``a patriotic alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the founding of the group was the start of a
``long-term campaign to change the way Britain thinks about
Europe.'' Clarke warned that his party's tough position was
dangerously isolationist, and Heseltine said, ``Whether we like it
or not, what happens in Europe is inseparable from what happens to
our own trade, employment, investment and industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clarke and Heseltine hit back at claims that they were
``traitors,'' and Heseltine added a warning about quitting Europe
that singled out former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a
particularly belligerent opponent. ``You cannot wield a handbag
from an empty chair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's presentation was to have occurred months ago, but
Blair postponed it, wary of becoming too closely identified with
the euro at a time when the new currency was underperforming and
doubts about it were deepening in the already distrustful British
public. It was only allowed to go forward when promoters agreed to
dilute its pro-euro message into a broader pro-Europe one.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, his' position unchanged by anything said Thursday, backs
a ``plan and decide'' policy whereby Britain encourages the public
and business to prepare for the possibility of adopting the euro
some years from now, but holds off the promised public referendum
on whether to go into monetary union until there is a sounder
economic basis for participation.
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no lobby for Britain's immediate entry,
because by every standard the British economy is outperforming
those on the Continent and would have to stunt its growth to
achieve compatibility. But an individual's identification with a
particular attitude on Europe is so key in British politics these
days that the terms Euroskeptic, Europhobe and Europhile regularly
accompany mentions of public figures in news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   When Hague took the Conservative leadership two years ago, the
party abandoned Major's tolerant ``wait and see'' approach, and
adopted an absolute view that ruled out any consideration of
joining monetary union until at least the end of the next
Parliament, seven years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show the British public resolutely against swapping their
currency for the euro, and the issue is one on which the Tories
hope to contest the next election and work their way back into
power.

CAPSULE REVIEWS OF MOVIES AND SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AMERICAN BEAUTY,'' starring Kevin Spacey, Annette
Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan
Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   With heavenly finesse, Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old
suburbanite who flips his lid for a teen-age cheerleader. And he
never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but
the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry
humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms.
Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads
itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a
devastating finale (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``BOYS DON'T CRY,'' starring Hillary Swank and Chloe
Sevigny. Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story
of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to
create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately
wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into
Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic,
with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the
year's best (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``DOUBLE JEOPARDY,'' starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and
Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In a touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of
Washington State to New Orleans' French Quarter, Ms. Judd plays a
woman who is free to kill her husband because she has already gone
to prison for the crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful
enough to get away with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she
perks up as her character becomes less of a victim.
</P>
<P>
   In this coed homage to ``The Fugitive,'' Jones is on hand as
another weathered sourpuss with a knack for barking orders.
Beresford directs so unremarkably that it takes a line like ``I
feel like I've grown in the last six years'' to signal the passage
of time (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``EARTH,'' starring Aamir Khan, Nandita Das, Rahul Khanna
and Maia Sethna. Directed by Deepa Mehta (not rated, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   It is 1947, and India is about to explode into ethnic violence
as British colonial rule ends and the country is partitioned into
two nations, mostly Hindu India and mostly Muslim Pakistan. These
momentous changes are observed by Lenny (Ms. Sethna), the
8-year-old daughter of a well-to-do Parsi family in Lahore. As
Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs slaughter one another in the streets, old
friends become deadly enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the middle is Shanta (Ms. Das), Lenny's beautiful
Hindu nanny, who has two Muslim suitors. The movie's child's-eye
view somewhat mutes its dramatic sweep (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``GUINEVERE,'' starring Sarah Polley and Stephen Rea. Written
and directed by Audrey Wells (R, 104 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Polley shines as a shy, rebellious 21-year-old involved in
an affair with an older man. Escaping her chilly family, she moves
into the well-populated space beneath the wing of a bohemian
photographer, played with great charm by Rea.
</P>
<P>
   This coming-of-age film takes a knowing, intimate view of the
dynamics of such a relationship and watches its heroine blossom. So
does Ms. Polley, as a luminous, mysterious young actress capable of
exceptionally subtle shadings (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``HAPPY, TEXAS,'' starring Jeremy Northam, Steve Zahn and
William H. Macy. Directed by Mark Illsley (R, 96 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The zany comedy follows two escaped convicts (Northam and Zahn)
who pose as a pair of gay pageant producers in a small Texas town
that is grooming its little girls for the Little Miss Squeezed
Pageant. Macy is poignant as the discreetly gay, doe-eyed sheriff
who shyly pursues Northam (who is only posing as gay). Zahn has his
amusing moments as an oaf improvising ludicrous dance routines.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie is so desperate to be liked that its satire is
risk-free and toothless, and its laughs widely scattered (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``JAKOB THE LIAR,'' starring Robin Williams, Alan Arkin, Liev
Schreiber and Armin Mueller-Stahl. Directed by Peter Kassovitz
(PG-13, 114 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   In a Holocaust story to make Roberto Benigni look like Primo
Levi, Williams plays a man who brightens life in a Polish ghetto
with imaginary good news about the imminent end of the war.
Surrounded by a strong supporting cast (with Arkin giving the
film's only genuinely funny performance), he again indulges that
unfortunate yen to play the clown who cried.
</P>
<P>
   The direction is sincere but sloppy. Watch the microphone make
repeated, unwelcome entrances from the top of the frame (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``JULIEN DONKEY-BOY,'' starring Ewen Bremner, Chloe Sevigny and
Werner Herzog. Directed by Harmony Korine (R, 94 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Working in accordance with the Danish set of directorial
strictures known as Dogma '95, the enfant-terrible director of
``Gummo'' finds creative ways to bend the rules. Inventively and
kinetically shot, this film about a schizophrenic is vastly more
interesting on its visual merits than for its hazy, indulgent
drama.
</P>
<P>
   As the ranting father of the title character, Herzog goes
enthusiastically over the top. The luminous Ms. Sevigny remains
Korine's secret weapon (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE LIMEY,'' starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   From a director for whom the quirky stylistic exercise is
standard style, this is a handsome throwback to the salad days of
its two iconic stars. Stamp, in a stony, magnetic performance
punctuated by flashbacks to his early career, plays an ex-con
seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. He becomes the
nemesis of Fonda's slick Hollywood hipster, in another role that's
piquantly tailor-made.
</P>
<P>
   Soderbergh resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John
Boorman's ``Point Blank'' as he dissects and considers these two
tough customers from every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LUCIE AUBRAC,'' starring Carole Bouquet and Daniel
Auteuil. Produced, written and directed by Claude Berri (R, 116
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   What lifts this taut World War II thriller based on a true story
above the ordinary are the impassioned performances of Ms. Bouquet
and Auteuil as Lucie and Raymond, a married couple who are fighters
in the French Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   When Raymond is arrested by the Nazis and convicted of war
crimes, Lucie conceives an outrageously audacious plan for his
escape. Ms. Bouquet and Auteuil are as romantically intense as
Bogey and Bergman in ``Casablanca,'' but here the woman is the one
who ends up doing the thinking for both of them (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``MUMFORD,'' starring Loren Dean, Hope Davis, Jason Lee,
Alfre Woodard, David Paymer and Mary McDonnell. Written and
directed by Lawrence Kasdan (R, 115 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   An immensely likable semi-screwball comedy from the director of
``The Big Chill,'' ``Mumford'' follows the adventures of an
engaging charlatan psychotherapist (Dean) fleeing a sleazy former
life, who names himself after the town (Mumford) in which he
settles and helps a lot of troubled people, even though he is
without credentials.
</P>
<P>
   His most endearing client ( Lee) is a warm, fuzzy billionaire
computer nerd who loves to skateboard but finds it's lonely at the
top. Mumford's moral ambiguity (he's both a hero and a fraud) keeps
this delightful Frank Capraesque fable of self-invention from
becoming too sappy (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``MYSTERY, ALASKA,'' starring Russell Crowe, Hank Azaria, Ryan
Northcott, Mary McCormack and Burt Reynolds. Directed by Jay Roach
(R, 119 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The king of television drama, David E. Kelley, helped produce
and write the satirically edged meat-and-potatoes story of a
legendary ice hockey team in the small town of Mystery, Alaska,
that is persuaded to play the New York Rangers in a televised
exhibition match. With its skillfully interwoven personal dramas of
assorted townspeople, the movie is a convincingly likable portrait
of a modern pioneer community under siege from the media.
</P>
<P>
   But it begins to lose its punch when the story settles into the
all-too-familiar ``Rocky'' formula. It includes strong performances
by Crowe (as the town sheriff) and Reynolds (as an imperious local
judge) (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``RANDOM HEARTS,'' starring Harrison Ford and Kristin
Scott Thomas. Directed by Sydney Pollack (R, 131 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Pollack's characteristically solid, incisive direction has
become a throwback to the days of subtler movie storytelling. But
it still rivets attention during the first half of this
star-crossed romance, which tells of two people who meet after
their spouses die in the same plane crash.
</P>
<P>
   The plot becomes very thick indeed when it develops that the
dead spouses were having an affair, and the survivors fall into a
bittersweet relationship of their own. Ford is taciturnly forceful,
Ms. Scott Thomas a shade too familiar, as credulity-stretching
complications ensue (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``ROMANCE,'' starring Caroline Ducey, Sagamore Stevenin,
Francois Berleand and Rocco Siffredi. Written and directed by
Catherine Breillat (not rated, 93 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   A solemn, sexually graphic exploration of the nature of a
woman's need for male attention and erotic love, even if its
insights are already familiar to readers of Cosmopolitan and the
Marquis de Sade. And it's doubtful that the film's intellectual
aspects would command the same attention if its camera did not make
the actors' genitals as familiar as their faces.
</P>
<P>
   The carnal and cerebral erotica here have already achieved the
considerable feat of shocking France, but the film is often stilted
and methodical to the point of tediousness. It hovers between
passion and philosophical argument without often achieving Ms.
Breillat's ambition to fuse the two (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE SIXTH SENSE,'' starring Bruce Willis and Haley Joel
Osment. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (PG-13, 107
minutes).
</P>
<P>
   What starts out as a horror movie about a troubled 8-year-old
boy (Osment) who claims to see dead people, and the child
psychologist (Willis) determined to cure him, eventually turns into
New Age mush (think ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Simon Birch'').
</P>
<P>
   When you trace the plot backward after its big secret is
revealed, the story doesn't begin to add up. Willis gives his usual
smirking one-note performance. What empathy the movie generates
comes from Osment's intense portrayal of the tormented child
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``STIR OF ECHOES,'' starring Kevin Bacon and Kathryn Erbe.
Directed by David Koepp (R, 99 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   Another little boy talks to a ghost at the start of this
thriller, but it isn't an instant ``Sixth Sense'' sequel. Instead
it shows what happens when the boy's closed-minded father lets
himself be hypnotized and awakens to find himself receiving
otherworldly stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon gives a grippingly intense performance as a man terrified
by his new extrasensory powers. And Koepp conveys a potent sense of
what it means to unravel. Despite its strong, spooky start and
early momentum, the film winds up with too earthbound an
explanation for the havoc it unleashes (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THREE KINGS,'' starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice
Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   The prodigiously talented writer-director of ``Spanking the
Monkey'' and ``Flirting With Disaster'' has made a much more
ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf
War film has a ``Catch-22'' absurdist edge, but it also has an
oversupply of visual affectations.
</P>
<P>
   Vertiginous music-video camera tricks jazz up the otherwise
straightforward story of American soldiers who have larcenous
designs on Saddam Hussein's captured gold and then develop
conscience pangs about their own roles in Iraq. There are many
clever peripheral touches, but there's something tamely
conventional at the film's core (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   ``DREYER.'' In a career that spanned the 45 years from 1919 to
1964, Carl Theodor Dreyer made relatively few films. His fierce
artistic pride was legendary, and his conflicts with producers,
which led to prolonged inactivity, were frequent. Nor did he often
enjoy the favor of contemporary critics.
</P>
<P>
   But today Dreyer (1889-1968) ranks as a giant of cinema and the
foremost talent in the history of Danish filmmaking. This week, he
is the subject of a retrospective at the Film Forum, and 8 p.m.
Friday, 7 p.m. Saturday and 2 p.m. Sunday bring screenings of one
of his masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   It is ``The Passion of Joan of Arc'' (1928), with a splendid
performance by the Corsican-born stage actress Renee Falconetti in
her only screen role. Filmed over a year and a half at enormous
cost, this intense drama, presented with a live piano
accompaniment, is drawn from the transcripts of the heresy trial of
the Maid of Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreyer'' continues through Tuesday at Film Forum in Manhattan.
Tickets: $8.50; $4.50 for members. Screening schedule and
information: (212) 727-8110 (Lawrence Van Gelder).

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ The trend vultures, those of us sitting in the trees
trying to spot pop-cultural confluences in the movies about to be
released during the crowded holiday season, have already pinpointed
a few.
</P>
<P>
   As noted in this space in recent weeks, we've had a spate of
independent-flavored films released by big studios: ``Three Kings''
from Warner Brothers, ``American Beauty'' from Dreamworks and, on
Friday, ``Fight Club'' from Fox. And there seem to be a significant
number of films coming up that will clock in at 2 1-2 hours or
longer, including ``The Insider,'' Michael Mann's tobacco thriller
with Al Pacino and Russell Crowe; ``Magnolia,'' Paul T. Anderson's
character-filled drama about odd coincidences and dysfunctional
families in the San Fernando Valley, and now ``The Green Mile,''
director Frank Darabont's eagerly awaited follow-up to ``The
Shawshank Redemption,'' which is also set in a prison and is also
based on a Stephen King story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Green Mile,'' just beginning its first round of screenings, is
three hours long and strikingly similar in look and flavor to
Darabont's earlier film, which drew seven Oscar nominations. The
story, set on death row in the 1930s and bookended with modern-day
sequences, involves more of the supernatural elements that King's
readers might expect, but _ except for one blood-curdling execution
sequence _ it could not be described as anything like a horror
film.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hanks stars as a kind-hearted prison guard, but much of the
early industry buzz has surrounded two of the film's supporting
players: Michael Clarke Duncan, who plays a condemned man with odd
powers, and Doug Hutchinson, who plays the villain, a guard who is
a sniveling sadist.
</P>
<P>
   To this, let us add another trend: directors taking on projects
that are different, and in some cases extremely different, from the
work they have done in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Already in release is ``For Love of the Game,'' in which Sam
Raimi, a director who cut his teeth in campy horror films, directs
Kevin Costner in a romance about a baseball pitcher, and ``Double
Jeopardy,'' the fall's first breakout hit, in which Australian
director Bruce Beresford, probably best known for the elegiac
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``Breaker Morant,'' directs Tommy Lee
Jones and Ashley Judd in a big-action thriller about murder and
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are David Lynch, famed for such
eerie-in-the-extreme pieces as ``Blue Velvet'' and ``Eraserhead,''
with ``The Straight Story,'' a very sweet and gentle character
study starring Richard Farnsworth as a man who drives his lawn
mower across the country; Michael Apted, the British director best
known for ``Coal Miner's Daughter'' and ``Gorillas in the Mist,''
with ``The World Is Not Enough,'' the latest mega-installment in
the James Bond series, and Ang Lee, who has made a career out of
high-minded family dramas like ``The Ice Storm'' and ``Sense and
Sensibility,'' with ``Race With the Devil,'' an epic-scale Civil
War movie with battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most dramatic departure of all is ``Music of the
Heart,'' a drama about a violin teacher in East Harlem (played by
Meryl Streep, after Madonna dropped out of the project), who so
inspires her poverty-stricken students that they end up playing
Carnegie Hall. The director? Wes Craven known for his inventive
horror movies in the ``Scream'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street''
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, the significant thing was getting a nongenre
project,'' Craven said during a break in the work on ``Scream 3,''
which he describes as the final installment in that teen-slasher
series. (Originally set for release later this year, it has been
moved to early next year.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``Music of the Heart'' project came about, Craven said,
because he extracted a promise from Miramax back in the flush of
euphoria over the success of the first ``Scream'' movie in 1996.
``They promised me right after that movie came out that I'd be able
to do a nongenre project for them, and they kept their promise,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Craven said he had always struggled to keep down the cost of his
films. ``We always operated much lower than the typical Hollywood
project,'' he said. ``For us, anything approaching $20 million is
really significant.'' And he has tried to keep to that goal, even
when working on a project like ``Music of the Heart'' with a star
like Ms. Streep. ``Even then, it was still under $30 million,''
Craven said. ``I think that's the key to making successful movies,
to keep the bell curve in your favor.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Just the Facts
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of trends, we can list ``Music of the Heart'' in
another one: movies based on true stories that have already had
documentaries made about them. (It was based on a short film called
``Small Wonders.'')
</P>
<P>
   Alongside it is ``Boys Don't Cry,'' which was a major critical
success at both the Toronto and New York film festivals. The film
follows the 1998 documentary ``The Brandon Teena Story'' in telling
the tale of a young Nebraska woman who tried to live as a man until
the ruse was uncovered and she was raped and eventually murdered.
(Of course, we could also list this one as a trend in ``movies
based on true stories,'' which would also include ``The Insider''
and Norman Jewison's ``Hurricane,'' based on the story of Ruben
Carter, the wrongly imprisoned professional boxer.)
</P>
<P>
   Kimberly Peirce, the director of ``Boys,'' was nibbling a bowl
of mixed fruit one morning this week at the Four Seasons Hotel in
Beverly Hills, preparing for a news conference with the Hollywood
Foreign Press Association, which hands out the Golden Globe awards.
``Boys Don't Cry'' was released in New York last Friday and is to
go into wider release on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick for me was, how do I not make Brandon into a
victim,'' she said. ``I didn't want the movie to veer into
gratuitous violence and melodrama.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peirce was still a graduate student when she heard about
Brandon Teena and began researching the story. Eventually, she made
several trips to rural Nebraska to talk to many of the people who
were involved in the case, to attend the murder trial and to get to
know the townspeople. Her concern, she said, was to make sure the
character of Brandon Teena (played in the film by Hilary Swank) was
fully rounded, that audiences understand why she acted as she did,
without simplifying the character too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ended up re-cutting the film seven times,'' Ms. Peirce said.
``I would have a screening and then do a questionnaire about what
they thought. And I'd watch from the back of the theater. It's
amazing what you can sense just from watching a film with an
audience, where it's sagging, how much they understand. You can
feel it. It's so beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem, she said, and the reason she re-cut the film so
often, was that ``there is an awful lot of information to get
across, and I wanted to make sure the audience was understanding
everything at every point.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a dark suit, her pale face framed by crescents of
jet-black hair punctuated with subtle streaks of electric blue, Ms.
Peirce quotes from John Ford, Howard Hawks, Roberto Rossellini and
the Japanese directors she loves (she lived and worked in Japan for
a while) in discussing her storytelling strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Though she was born in Harrisburg, Pa., and brought up in New
York, Miami and Puerto Rico, Ms. Peirce's film has a very rich
sense of the nuances of working-class life in the American rural
Midwest, something she said she picked up during her extended trips
to the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in that town were really great,'' she said. ``They
were actually open and curious about this tragedy that had happened
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Epic Waters
</P>
<P>
   John Waters called from the set of his latest film _ in
Baltimore, of course _ to discuss what he calls ``not my biggest
budgeted movie but definitely the hardest movie I've ever made.''
The film, ``Cecil B. Demented,'' is ``my version of an epic, with
many, many characters, lots of crowd scenes,'' Waters said. ``I
used to call it my `Die Hard' for the Hollywood-impaired.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is about a group of ``guerrilla filmmakers'' who
kidnap a famous movie star, played by Melanie Griffith, and force
her to act in their underground film; at the same time they
undertake acts of mischief and vandalism to punish the movie
industry for making too many sequels, movies based on video games
and poor English-language remakes of European comedies. The title
comes from a name that a critic once used to describe Waters . ``I
read it and thought, I'd like to make a movie with that title, so I
tried to write one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we're shooting a scene where Cecil and his gang are
raiding a luncheon given by the Maryland Film Commission, because
they're opposed to an attempt to film more Hollywood epics in
Baltimore,'' Waters said. ``As you can see, the film's cinema
morals are fine. It's cinematically correct.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to finish shooting the film before Thanksgiving and
have it ready in time for next year's Cannes International Film
Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``After lunch, Melanie is going to jump off a roof,'' Waters
said. ``It's a great way to spend a day.''

RENO CALLS FOR NEW APPROACH TO PAROLEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday called for
a new system for monitoring convicts paroled from state and local
prisons that would require the involvement of local law
enforcement, businesses, churches, counselors and neighborhood
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too often, offenders leave prison and return to the community
without supervision, without jobs, without housing,'' Reno said at
her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
   She said most of the nearly 500,000 people paroled each year
``quickly fall back into their old patterns'' of drug use and gang
activity.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent this from happening, Reno said the Department of
Justice is working with local and state authorities to set up
so-called ``re-entry courts'' that would supervise parolees who
return to their communities.
</P>
<P>
   She said the re-entry courts could be integrated into
already-existing courts. In this scenario, parolees would report on
a monthly basis to the judges who originally sentenced them to
prison. The judges, with help from local law enforcement officials
and community organizations, would construct a plan to reintegrate
the offenders back into the community and then present the plan to
the parolees to follow.
</P>
<P>
   If state judges were too busy to handle the added burden, the
re-entry courts could be headed by such substitutes as retired
judges, magistrates or administrative judges. The substitute judges
would still have the authority to punish or reward the parolees,
the Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work with us, stay clean, stay out of trouble, get a job, and
we will help you in that effort,'' Reno said. ``But if you come
back testing positive for drugs, if you commit further crime, if
you violate the conditions of your release, you're going to face a
more serious punishment every step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the punishment could be spending a night in jail,
performing community service or, in extreme cases, being sent back
to prison.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said the re-entry courts would not be used
with federal parolees because state courts would be in a better
position to work with local organizations and law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the re-entry court proposal was presented to thousands
of state and local officials last week to review. She said the
Justice Department would chose a dozen cities over the next year to
develop ways to implement and fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime has been dropping for years, but if we can find a way to
keep people from returning to prison again and again, you'll see
America's crime rate drop like never before,'' she said.

IT'S NOT EASY BEING A SCHMERD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sometimes it can get lonely being a schmerd.
</P>
<P>
   And that makes it really gratifying when you meet another
schmerd who doesn't mind showing his or her tendencies to the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where'd you find that?'' asked the cashier at one of the
larger southwest Fort Worth supermarkets. She was a small,
beyond-middle-aged woman with grayish-blond hair and sky-blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over near the lawn stuff,'' I said. ``I guess some of my
neighbors will really think I'm a schmerd if they see me sprinkling
it on my lawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a schmerd?''
</P>
<P>
   I explained to her that it was a word I had coined for people
like me who take offense at some of the things that a lot of other
people think quite all right, and even neighborly correct, to do.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff she was asking about was pet repellent in powdered
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm one of those strange folks who detests having dog walkers
bring their four-legged friends around to discharge on my lawn,'' I
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, too,'' she said. ``Nothing makes me madder than to have to
step in or step around dog droppings when I'm trying to cut my
grass.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it loudly, as though she wanted everyone in the store
to hear her.
</P>
<P>
   The woman in the next line with the huge bag of dry canine
morsels stared daggers at us. Of course, that could been just my
imagination. Being a schmerd can make you borderline paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   You feel kind of guilty because you know that if a dog's got to
go, it's got to go. It's just doing what comes naturally.
</P>
<P>
   And it bothers you some to realize that the dog walkers think
you're unreasonable for objecting to it. And they wonder why you
don't like dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do like dogs,'' I told the cashier. ``Over the years some of
my best friends have been border collies and Irish setters, truly
noble beasts. I have a plaque on my wall from the humane society
for my work on behalf of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   But I explained to her that when I owned dogs, I either lived
somewhere with ample open space to allow them to heed nature's call
without decorating someone else's lawn, or I confined their bowel
movements to my own property and cleaned up after them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't own a dog now because I don't have the time or the
inclination anymore to handle the refuse disposal problems they
create. I'm pro-pet; I'm just anti-poo,'' I told the cashier.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed wholeheartedly and said she thought ``it ought to be
against the law, if it isn't,'' for people to take their dogs
around to defecate in other people's yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make them do their business in their own yards,'' she said.
And she pointed out that she has made her feelings on the subject
known to several of the regular dog walkers on her street, up close
and personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them now carry little plastic bags and scoops for the
poop with them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I left the supermarket feeling a little less lonely, knowing
that there must be other schmerds out there fighting the same
lonely battle.
</P>
<P>
   And if there are more schmerds like that around, I reasoned,
there must also be some who share my other pet peeve: visits by
Halloween trick-or-treaters.
</P>
<P>
   There is no lonelier time of the year for this schmerd than
Allhallows Eve, when the little spooks, witches and goblins gambol
from door to door demanding unhealthful booty.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not anti-child. I used to have one. And some of my best
friends over the years have been children. I was once one myself,
for heaven's sake. I'm just anti-Halloween _ both the commercial
vulgarity of it and what I see as its more sinister implications.
</P>
<P>
   It may astonish some to hear thaton like me, of the
fiendish liberal persuasion, harbors serious religious reservations
about something so seemingly innocent, nonthreatening and enjoyable
as Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I do. And I am aware that I risk ruining my
reputation as a sober cynic by admitting that I believe in the
existence of pervasive and infectious evil in this realm of being.
</P>
<P>
   It is my view that parents who glorify Halloween are exposing
their children to that evil and providing gateways for the
intrusion of demonic influences into human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just this schmerd's take on it. I'm not calling for
the abolishment of Halloween. I could be wrong. Maybe Halloween is
just harmless fun, and not (as I see it) satanic revelry.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, I'll keep my lights out as usual until the dark
and shadowy figures stop passing and the living dead return to
their graves.
</P>
<P>
   Then I'll go outside with my flashlight and see if any of them
brought their dogs to poop on my lawn.

`FIGHT CLUB' IS ANOTHER IN A RECENT CROP OF WHITE-MALE ANGST
MOVIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I haven't read ``Stiffed,'' Susan Faludi's new book about ``the
betrayal of the American male.'' I suspect that I'm too busy being
betrayed to plow through her 608-page book, although judging from a
Newsweek excerpt, I'm not the type of guy Faludi's talking about.
She's talking about guys set adrift by corporate culture and lack
of control in their jobs. And yeah, I feel a little of that, but as
someone who writes about entertainment for a living, I have a job
that many people would envy. No, Faludi is writing about guys like
Lester Burnham and Tyler Durden.
</P>
<P>
   Lester is the hero of the celebrated movie ``American Beauty,''
a guy stuck in his beautiful suburban house with a shrill wife, an
alienated daughter and a well-paid but desensitizing job. His
sudden crush on a teen-ager leads him to re-evaluate his life and
take matters into his own hands. Tyler is a key figure in ``Fight
Club;'' he's an influence on the nameless narrator, who, like
Lester, lives well but without meaning and has a desensitizing job.
The narrator's so desensitized that he and Tyler form Fight Club,
in which men beat one another to bloody pulps just so that they can
feel something, even if it's abject pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' _ and an earlier 1999
movie, ``Office Space,'' recently released on video _ share a scene
in which the protagonist finally decides that he's had it with the
job that's making him feel adrift. In each movie, the guy unloads
on his boss, telling him what he really thinks. These scenes are
cathartic for the men _ and the women _ in the audience, because
haven't most of us wanted to speak our minds to a supervisor,
putting our jobs at risk, at least once in our lives? They're
cathartic because we're too smart to do that; most of us value our
paychecks too much to make such a dumb move. By watching somebody
else do it, we can take some vicarious pleasure and say, ``I've
always wanted to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the fuss that these movies are causing _ and
``American Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' are certainly fuss-worthy
movies _ they take an easy way out when it comes to giving the boss
what for. ``Fight Club's'' hero and ``Beauty's'' Lester, portrayed
respectively by Edward Norton and Kevin Spacey in performances that
should fill the first two spots on this year's Oscar ballot, both
have something on their bosses, a bit of blackmail material that
allows them to pull off their stunts without suffering the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' are both beautifully written,
excellently directed and wonderfully acted, but as with with so
many movies, their originality comes not in their content but in
their execution. In their white-male angst, they echo dozens of
movies over the years, most notably ``Happiness'' (in the case of
``Beauty'') and 1992's underrated ``Falling Down'' (in ``Fight
Club's'' case). In ``Falling Down,'' Michael Douglas plays a
defense contractor who exits his car during a traffic jam and
begins attacking head-on the things that bother him; he doesn't
even confront his boss, much less blackmail him, but simply makes a
snap decision to change his life. At the end of the movie, he makes
a white-guy complaint that Faludi must love, plaintively asking a
cop who's tracked him down, ``I'm the bad guy?''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Falling'' wasn't original, either; like ``American
Beauty'' and ``Fight Club,'' it's a more mature, darker, serious
take on that staple of the late '70s and early '80s, the slob
comedy. The difference between the '90s characters and slob
characters played by Bill Murray and John Belushi is that the new
guys are rebelling against jobs that at least provide a chance at
affluence; in a way, they're the guys whom Murray and Rodney
Dangerfield irritated so well in ``Caddyshack.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody ever quit a job better than Murray did in ``Stripes,'' in
which he began the movie as a cabdriver who deals with an annoying
passenger by simply stranding the car on a bridge, getting out and
tossing his keys in the river. No boss, no blackmail, not even a
two-week notice. Murray has played both ends of the spectrum; in
this year's ``Rushmore,'' he's an industrialist who rebels against
a life he hates by getting into a romantic rivalry with a
particularly obnoxious teen-ager. He grew into a guy his younger
characters never wanted to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the Newsweek excerpt, Faludi talks a lot about how men in the
World War II generation and before had more control, how their
masculinity was more appreciated. But she discusses her theory of a
'90s lack of direction as if it were a new thing, as if we were
responding to consumer culture and a corporation-ruled world.
``American Beauty'' and ``Fight Club'' argue that we can fight
back, but that even if we do, the victories will be small.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not forget that ``American Beauty'' comes from a
subsidiary of Disney, a corporation so ubiquitous that it's hard to
go through a day without somehow encountering it, and that ``Fight
Club'' comes from 20th Century Fox, a studio owned by Rupert
Murdoch, who can afford to laugh at the movie's anarchy. We'll make
these movies hits, and we'll respond to other movies in which
someone flips the bird at authority. And then, the next day, we'll
amiably talk about 'em with our bosses.

HOUSTON: reflects that.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a result, the arts lover visiting Houston has perhaps a wider
range of things to choose from than does a visitor to any other
city in the Southwest. On a recent weekend visit, for instance, it
was possible to spend the morning seeing the works of Mexican
superstar artist Diego Rivera (in a touring exhibit at the fine
arts museum), to walk a few blocks to take in the devastating
depiction of Nazi terrorism at the Holocaust Museum of Houston,
then to detour south of downtown to marvel at the Orange Show, a
multilevel folk-art sculpture festooned with tiles, flags and
bright paint, where every visit can be capped off with a glass of
orange juice in the gift shop. That evening, choices included the
ballet's presentation of ``The Merry Widow'' or the Alley's
production of Arthur Miller's ``A View From the Bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Both of those were playing in the downtown theater district, a
17-block area that houses several theaters encompassing 10,000
seats _ the most in a single area outside Manhattan. And although
Houston has long had a thriving performing arts community _ its
opera is noted for mounting such avant-garde, and acclaimed,
productions as ``Nixon in China'' and ``Harvey Milk,'' and the
Alley regularly produces world premieres such as last season's
``The Civil War'' by Frank Wildhorn _ it has boomed over the past
decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that stems from the recent downtown building spree. The
Wortham Center, home to the ballet and the opera, came first, in
1987, joining the 1969-era Alley Theatre across the street and the
nearby Jesse H. Jones Hall, where the symphony performs. This year,
ground was broken on the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts,
which will be built on the site of the old Music Hall and will host
musical theater and other performances. (It's scheduled to open in
2002.)
</P>
<P>
   Barry Mandel, who left a career in business to become the
director of the Theater District Association six months ago, and
his colleagues have more plans. They're embarking on a promotional
campaign tying theater productions to deals at area hotels and
restaurants, for instance. And this winter, Mandel wants to build
an outdoor ice rink on the plaza outside the Wortham Center,
perhaps even staging an ice-skating version of ``The Nutcracker''
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making it my own version of Rockefeller Center,'' Mandel
says. ``I want to raise the profile of the theater district and let
people know the arts are not just this rich person's thing _
they're accessible to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   If Houston has a patron saint of arts accessibility, it would be
the late Dominique de Menil, who, with husband John, was the
namesake for the Menil Collection.
</P>
<P>
   Dominique de Menil opened the museum in 1987 to share with the
public the couple's exhaustive collection of surrealist art
(masterpieces by Salvador Dali and Max Ernst, among others) and
antiquities such as African masks, wooden seal clubs intricately
carved by Canada's indigenous tribes, and hand-woven textiles from
the Oceanic region. The campus also includes a gallery devoted to
American artist Cy Twombly and the de Menil-sponsored Rothko
Chapel, with abstract paintings by Mark Rothko. Admission to all is
free.
</P>
<P>
   The last addition to the de Menil legacy has one of the most
interesting stories: The Byzantine Fresco Chapel Museum houses
13th-century frescoes that Dominique de Menil literally ransomed
from thieves who had removed them from a Cyprus church and chopped
them into pieces. After she negotiated their purchase, she had them
painstakingly restored in London (it took two years) and then had
her architect son design an understated chapel in which to display
them.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like the plot line from a movie-of-the-week. But then
again, true to her adopted hometown, Dominique de Menil loved art
in all its forms. She was one of the first financial backers of
another acclaimed Houston institution _ the Orange Show.

THE ART LOVERS' GUIDE TO HOUSTON
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by HOUSTON-ART-SKED and HOUSTON-ART-HOW) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``You can take your shoes off if you want,'' the
white-haired volunteer called after us graciously as we sat in the
lobby at the Menil Collection, studying the map she'd just handed
us, trying to figure out which gallery to head to first.
</P>
<P>
   We looked up, sure she was being sarcastic. I mean, it wasn't as
if we were entering the jumpy tent at a Discovery Zone. We were in
the Menil, one of the premier art destinations of not just Houston
but the entire Southwest, a priceless repository of works by
Picasso and Warhol and Dali, and of antiquities from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do it all the time,'' she continued, nodding and
smiling. ``Go ahead, make yourself comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Um, thanks, we think we'll wear our shoes (sensible walking
ones, of course). But we liked the message: Houston may be a city
with Serious Art, but it doesn't take itself all that seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston will unveil a
192,000-square-foot, $83 million addition in March that will make
it the sixth-largest museum in the nation. But this is also a town
that counts as one of its beloved art attractions the Orange Show,
a bizarre folk-art salute to the orange, built more than 25 years
by a postal carrier out of odds and ends largely picked up on his
route.
</P>
<P>
   And the downtown theater district likes to call itself the
biggest such district outside Manhattan, and to tout its world
premieres and its Tony-Award-winning Alley Theatre. But the city is
equally proud of what's probably its biggest annual production, the
Art Car parade, where 200,000 people show up every spring to watch
cars decorated like giant bunnies and cows and red high-heeled
pumps roll down the streets.
</P>
<P>
   As Bryan Taylor, education curator at the 2-year-old Art Car
Museum, puts it: ``There's something that's not quite right about
this city.''
</P>
<P>
   He is only partly joking. And that is a big part of Houston's
charm.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   To those who don't know any different, both from within Texas
and from elsewhere, Houston is often lumped in with Dallas _ just
another big, sprawling Sun Belt city built from oil money and
corporate interests. And the two do have their similarities, from
shiny skyscraper-filled downtowns to obsessions with big hair and
big sports.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, however, has been a different kind of place from the
beginning. In 1836, to lure prospective settlers, a pair of
scheming brothers ran a newspaper ad touting the business district
and busy port. Unfortunately, these things did not exist. People
showed up anyway, and the city started growing _ fast and in all
directions. (To this day, Houston has no zoning laws.)
</P>
<P>
   The people who built Houston wanted it to be a world-class city,
and its arts scene has developed accordingly. Houston is one of the
few U.S. cities with full-season resident companies in all the
major performing disciplines: ballet, opera, symphony and theater.
It is home to dozens of museums, including the fine arts museum and
the Menil, which houses perhaps the world's finest collection of
surrealist art, and more than 50 galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the city grew out of a giant con game, though,
its arts scene has always had its lighter side. Take, for instance,
the atmosphere at the Contemporary Arts Museum during the '70s,
when the hippie artists' commune known as The Ant Farm set up shop
in the parking lot, and one notorious exhibit involving the Kilgore
Rangerettes and many loaves of painted bread supposedly devolved
into a bread-throwing riot.
</P>
<P>
   To put it in a North Texas perspective: If someone in Dallas
covered a house in beer cans, the neighbors would make sure it got
torn down. In Houston, the Convention and Visitors Bureau touts it
as a tourist destination. (The so-called Beer Can House, an
aluminum-covered marvel at 222 Malone, is even included on some
tour companies' itineraries.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The folk art tradition here is so strong; it's kind of a part
of the city's identity, and people were doing it for years, before
there was a recognition of folk art,'' explains Dr. Peter Marzio,
the director of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, an encyclopedic
museum that includes respected collections of photography and
American decorative arts, plus pre-Columbian, African and
20th-century art.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all just part of the individual character of the city.
Houston is the freest and most individualistic society I've ever
lived in, and I think the art here reflects that.''

<P>
   HOTELS:
</P>
<P>
   Houston has the standard hotel chains, but these might be
especially suited to the arts tourist:
</P>
<P>
   The Lancaster: Perfect for theater buffs, this luxurious
downtown hotel is steps away from the Alley Theatre, the Wortham
Center and the Bayou Bend, a newish, multilevel urban mall that
features a sushi bar, Italian restaurant and six-screen multiplex.
Weekend rates, $130-$275. 701 Texas St., (713) 228-9500
</P>
<P>
   The Warwick: Though less than 80 years old, it's Houston's most
historic hotel, as downtown's Rice Hotel was turned into lofts and
the Shamrock got the wrecking ball. Finishing touches are being put
on a multimillion-dollar renovation that retained the hotel's
European character but lightened and modernized the interior. Right
across the street from the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. Weekend
rates, $119-194. 5701 S. Main St., (713) 526-1991
</P>
<P>
   La Colombe d'Or: An ultra-small (just six suites),
ultraluxurious hotel housed in a former oil baron's mansion on
trendy Montrose, close to museums and nightlife. Weekend rates,
$195-$575. 3401 Montrose Blvd., (713) 524-7999
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   DINING:
</P>
<P>
   If you're doing the museums, there are plenty of breakfast and
lunch spots nearby, especially on Montrose, Westheimer and Kirby.
</P>
<P>
   For breakfast, we tried a friend's recommendation, Empire Cafe,
1732 Westheimer Road, (713) 528-5282; try the frittatas or the
huge, gooey cinnamon rolls. We liked the fish tacos and the fresh
salsas at casual-but-hip Taco Milagro, 2555 Kirby Drive at
Westheimer Road, (713) 522-1999; it's also a reasonably priced way
to sample the food of Houston's premier chef Robert del Grande, of
the justifiably acclaimed Cafe Annie. Urbana, 3407 Montrose Blvd.,
(713) 521-1086, has a sleek patio on which to enjoy its
Southwestern-flavored dishes, such as potato-and-poblano flautas
and barbecued Gulf shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's downtown has boomed with restaurants in the past five
years, but many theater patrons still head straight for Clive's,
517 Louisiana St., (713) 224-4438, for steaks, seafood and a great
wine list. For Mediterranean fare and live jazz, try the local
incarnation of a Dallas favorite, Sambuca, 909 Texas St., (713)
224-5299. For Spanish-style tapas and paella, there's Solero, 910
Prairie St., (713) 227-2665.
</P>
<P>
   After-theater choices downtown include Cabo, the mothership for
downtown Fort Worth's bar/restaurant of the same name. The original
one here is a raucous hangout with a lively second-story patio;
it's at 419 Travis St., (713) 225-2060. The new hip spot is The
Mercury Room, a sleek club with live music at 1008 Prairie St.;
(713) 225-6372), but others prefer the more established Spy (112
Travis St., (713) 228-0007).

 &HT;    `Waiting' is worthwhile for award finalist Jin
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whenever a new group of writing students enrolls in his class,
Ha Jin tells them that being a writer ``has nothing to do with
glory or fame.''
</P>
<P>
   He may want to reconsider those words. Two years after winning
two prestigious literary prizes, the Emory professor has been named
a National Book Award finalist for his new novel, ``Waiting''
(Pantheon Books, $24), the story of a married doctor who falls in
love with a nurse during China's Cultural Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Jin said after hearing the news. ``There's
a lot of anxiety in writing a book. You don't know how well it will
do. Now at least it will have a longer life.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 43-year-old native of China won the Ernest
Hemingway Foundation/PEN Award for his debut story collection,
``Ocean of Words: Army Stories,'' and the Flannery O'Connor Award
for ``Under the Red Flag.'' The first book deals with Jin's stint
in the People's Army; the second describes life during the Cultural
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Other fiction finalists are Andrew Dubus III (``House of Sand
and Fog''); Kent Haruf (``Plainsong''); Patricia Henley
(``Hummingbird House''); and Jean Thompson (``Who Do You Love?'').
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction finalists are Natalie Angier (``Woman: An Intimate
Geography''); Mark Bowden (``Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern
War''); John W. Dower (``Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of
World War II''); John Phillip Santos (``Places Left Unfinished at
the Time of Creation''); and Judith Thurman (``Secrets of the
Flesh: A Life of Colette'').
</P>
<P>
   Finalists in the Young People's Literature category are Laurie
Halse Anderson (``Speak''); Louise Erdrich (``The Birchbark
House''); Kimberly Willis Holt (``When Zachary Beaver Came to
Town''); Polly Horvath (``The Trolls''); and Walter Dean Myers
(``Monster'').
</P>
<P>
   Poetry finalists are Ai (``Vice: New and Selected Poems'');
Louise Gluck (``Vita Nova: Poems''); Clarence Major
(``Configurations: New &AMP; Selected Poems 1958-1998''); Sherod Santos
(``The Pilot Star Elegies''); and C.K. Williams (``Repair'').
</P>
<P>
   Winners will be announced Nov. 17 in New York at a ceremony in
which Oprah Winfrey will receive an award for her contribution to
reading and books. Steve Martin will act as emcee.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  They've got mail: Long before the Internet and e-mail, people
lamented the decline of correspondence. In a note to his son in
1900, Joel Chandler Harris wrote: ``People no longer write letters.
Lacking the leisure, and, for the most part, the ability, they
dictate dispatches, and scribble messages. When you are in the
humor, you should take a peep at some of the letters written by
people who lived long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   To paraphrase Mark Twain, rumors of the death of letter writing
are greatly exaggerated. Just ask Lisa Grunwald and Stephen J.
Adler. In their new book, ``Letters of the Century'' (Dial Press,
$35), the husband-and-wife team sifted through more than half a
million letters to find 412 that reflect the events and trends of
the past 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real treasure hunt,'' Grunwald said in a telephone
interview from New York. ``We spent a lot of time on the Internet
and in libraries. We didn't want to do a book about letters; we
wanted to do a book about the 20th century. Letters are what
history sounds like when it is still part of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all the letters are historically significant. Some are
simply fun to read, such as Groucho Marx's letters to lawyers at
Warner Bros. who threatened to sue him over the use of the word
``Casablanca'' in ``A Night in Casablanca.'' In one response Marx
writes, ``I am sure the average movie fan could learn in time to
distinguish between Ingrid Bergman and Harpo. I don't know whether
I could, but I certainly would like to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Others include bank robber Clyde Barrow's letter to Henry Ford
telling him ``what a dandy car you make. For sustained speed and
freedom from trouble the Ford has got every other car skinned.''
</P>
<P>
   Letters in general have diminished in number and eloquence, but
Grunwald predicts that the Internet will save the art of letter
writing. ``When I write an e-mail, it's the real thing. And one of
my friends writes such eloquent e-mails, I print them out and save
them. I don't think the Internet has hurt letter writing. It's
taken away from telephoning, and that's just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More award winners: ``A Clashing of the Soul'' by Emory
professor Leroy Davis and ``Colorblind Injustice'' by Caltech
professor J. Morgan Kousser are the 1999 winners of the Lillian
Smith Book Awards.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' book traces the life of John Hope, the first
African-American president of Morehouse College and Atlanta
University, and the problems of black higher education in the early
20th century. Kousser's study examines minority voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Presented by the Southern Regional Council, the awards honor the
late Georgia writer Lillian Smith, author of ``Strange Fruit'' and
other books that dealt with race and sex before they were generally
permissible topics in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented at a noon luncheon Nov. 6 at the
Sheraton Colony Square, 14th and Peachtree streets in Midtown.
Information: 404-522-8764, Ext. 24.

 &HT;    Book recalls WWII scare on Ga. coast
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Long before Tom Brokaw's best seller ``The Greatest
Generation'' recorded memories of Americans during World War II,
Sonja Kinard set out with her sister, Thora Kimsey, to record the
same kind of slice of life, focusing on what then was the tiny port
town of Brunswick in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   They found that, for many residents of coastal Georgia, World
War II really started on April 8, 1942. The 66-year-old Kinard
herself remembers: Shivering survivors of two U.S. merchant ships
sunk just off the Georgia coast early that morning were huddled on
a St. Simons Island boat dock. Some were burned. All were
oil-blackened. St. Simons and nearby Brunswick were in shock,
afraid that the Germans who had torpedoed the ships would invade at
any moment.
</P>
<P>
   The sisters, both originally from the Brunswick area, share
recollections in a new book, ``Memories From The Marshes of Glynn:
World War II,'' published with the support of Atlanta's Callanwolde
Fine Arts Center. Kinard and Kimsey, who died several months ago,
contacted many friends and coastal residents, whose memories paint
a vivid picture of small-town Georgia in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   For example, their brother, Olaf H. Olsen Jr., recalls that
their father, Olaf Olsen, was the first to reach survivors who had
manned lifeboats, bringing 54 ashore. The senior Olsen, the skipper
of a yacht owned by Coca-Cola magnate Asa Candler, was alerted to
the sinkings when a small private plane whose pilot had spotted the
burning ships dropped a note, attached to a wrench, into his yard.
</P>
<P>
   The book contains dozens of poignant accounts of Glynn County
residents who recount their memories of those days when America
seemed on the verge of losing the war. It even contains an account
of an interview with Kapitan Reinhard Hardegan, the skipper of the
submarine that sank the two ships, and many others, along the
coast.
</P>
<P>
   Kinard and many of those whose memories fill the book will be on
hand at 2 p.m. Sunday at Callanwolde, when the book will be
unveiled amid displays of World War II memorabilia, a life-size
model of a USO canteen and 1940s music. The event is open to the
public. The book should be available soon at local bookstores, as
well as at Callanwolde, for $36.50.

 &HT;    At Black Rock Mountain park, forget miniature golf and enjoy the
grandeur
 &HT;    By Clint Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN CITY, Ga. _ Black Rock Mountain State Park is one of
the first places in Georgia that autumn visits. Located north of
Clayton not far from the North Carolina border, the 1,800-acre
parcel of mountaintops is Georgia's highest state park. The summit
of Black Rock Mountain is 3,640 feet above sea level, and most
overnight visitors who camp out or rent a cabin sleep above 3,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Even with autumn just under way, hints of the fall colors to
come can be seen across the park. As the trees begin to lose their
leaves, towering oaks drop acorns by the thousands. They fall like
dark brown hailstones, bouncing off the picnic table, the roof of
our tent and, once or twice, my head. This rain of acorns is good,
though: They provide food for a variety of wildlife, including
squirrels, deer and black bears.
</P>
<P>
   During a fathers-and-sons expedition, the acorn caps provide
amusement for two boys, ages 8 and 9. If you hold the tan top
between your thumbs just so and blow, the boys learn, it makes a
loud, shrill whistle. So much for a tranquil wilderness experience.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the park is big enough that the whistling doesn't
disturb anyone but me. Our walk-in campsite _ one of 11 tents-only
spots _ is a fair piece from another site. We can see the light
from their campfire and little else. The 10 miles of trail that
wind through the highlands also provide some solitude, although the
trailhead parking lot is usually jammed.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular trail, and the one most suitable for whistling
8- and 9-year-olds, is the Tennessee Rock Trail, a 2.2-mile loop.
</P>
<P>
   The James Edmonds Trail, a strenuous 7.2-mile route, provides
access to four back-country campsites designed for backpackers. The
back-country sites, says Anthony Lampros, the park superintendent,
``are real popular and becoming more and more so.''
</P>
<P>
   The sites, two of which opened last spring, include fire rings,
benches ``and a whole lot of real estate between you and your
neighbor,'' Lampros says.
</P>
<P>
   The back-country sites fit well with the management philosophy
of the park. Just 5 percent of the property is developed and,
unlike some state parks, there is no beach, no miniature golf
course. While there's a 17-acre fishing lake, it isn't the
centerpiece. In fact, you must drive out of the main park entrance
to get to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't entertain you,'' Lampros says. ``The big attraction
here is nature and scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   And the views. Bring your binoculars, because this mountaintop
park offers dozens of stunning vistas across the southern
Appalachians. Ridge lines running through North Carolina and South
Carolina are always part of the skyline here. Haze-free days mean
views of Mount LaConte and Clingman's Dome, landmarks of Great
Smoky Mountains National Park, more than 50 miles away in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see tall buildings in Greenville, S.C. (58 miles away),
when it is real clear,'' Lampros says.
</P>
<P>
   Wooden deck overlooks along the roads and trails winding through
the park capitalize on the vistas. Park literature rates the view
from each of the 10 cabins _ cabins numbered 3, 4 and 6 are rated
excellent. Each cabin has cable television and a fireplace or wood
stove. Everything is provided expect food and firewood.
</P>
<P>
   The park, sadly, is also a good place to see the effects of the
drought gripping northeast Georgia, where rainfall for the year is
running about 20 inches below normal. Ferns covering the dark
forest floor are brown and brittle. Black leaves on the massive
rhododendrons are evidence of stress from the dry spell. Ada-Hi
Falls, the payoff at the end of a steep, quarter-mile trail, is
little more than a trickle. The drought has dried up springs and
slowed the flow of wells that provide water for the park. Two of
the three comfort stations that offer flush toilets and showers for
campers have been closed.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend will offer visitors something for the ears as well
as the eyes. The Georgia Mountain Fall Festival is under way at the
Georgia Mountains Fairgrounds in nearby Hiawassee, with the State
Fiddler's Convention coming up Friday and Saturday. Members of the
bluegrass gospel band Never Fade camp at the state park when
they're in the area for concerts and contests, and they usually
make their way to the porch of the campground trading post after
supper to make a little music.
</P>
<P>
   Find yourself an acorn cap and join in.
</P>
<P>
   If You Go
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Getting there: Black Rock Mountain State Park is just off U.S.
441 and is less than a two-hour drive from most of metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rates: Campsites with water, electrical and cable TV hookups
are $15 to $17 per night. Walk-in tent campsites are $8 per night.
Cottages are $70 to $85 per night during the week and $80-$95 on
weekends, with a two-night minimum for cottage rentals.
Reservations are essential.

 &HT;    Furnishings take cue from global view
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   High Point, N.C. _ Ready or not, here comes the much-hyped year
2000, when stores were expected to roll out Space Age furnishings
designed for ``homes of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's La-Z-Boy, known for its ever-more-inventive recliners,
pitching for next spring?
</P>
<P>
   Try a wooden folding chair.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the electric coolers, the massage mechanisms, the
built-in phones of its newest recliners. Thursday, as the world's
largest furniture market opened in High Point with a preview of the
newest designs, this chair represents bare-bones comfort. It's the
only kind manufacturers knew back in 1928 when the company
introduced its original wood-slatted recliner, limited
reproductions of which are being offered for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first chair was not even upholstered,'' company
spokeswoman Kay Degenhardt said. ``But it's still beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   The chair, expected to retail for about $400, is just one of the
new offerings that will be shown by 2,500 manufacturers during the
weeklong event, expected to draw 75,000 retail buyers, interior
designers and media from 106 countries. Furnishings sold here
should arrive in stores early next year, and already several themes
are emerging _ none even close to the mid-century predictions that
had our homes looking much like George and Jane Jetson's.
</P>
<P>
   Trend watchers say they believe the next century's interiors
will become more eclectic than ever, reflecting the collectibles
homeowners pick up in their travels. At the same time, while
comfort will dominate choices, young consumers will seek something
elegant for making a statement among the mass produced.
</P>
<P>
   Trends aside, the buzz at this market are the celebrities _
authors, artists, fashion designers and even a publishing magnate _
lending their names to new collections.
</P>
<P>
   Even members of the cast of ``Ally McBeal'' will be on hand
Saturday to help Lane Furniture kick off new lines.
</P>
<P>
   Take supermodel, actress Kathy Ireland, who's created a line for
Vanguard Furniture. ``When I was 8, my family took a trip to
England, and we visited Windsor Castle. I was just awestruck by the
elegance and beauty of it all, but it wasn't family-friendly,''
said the mother of a 5- and 1-year-old from her southern California
home.
</P>
<P>
   So Ireland came up with a eclectic collection of living room,
dining room, bedroom and accent pieces, priced from $500 to $2,200,
that can be used in formal as well as casual rooms. The pieces can
be interchanged much like the women's ensembles she creates for
Kmart.
</P>
<P>
   Another big name tapping into the world-traveler theme is
Forbes. Harden Furniture and six other manufacturers have created
the Forbes Collection of traditional furnishings inspired by the
publishing family's famed estates in London and Normandy. Marquetry
inlay and fabrics feature scenes of ballooning and Faberge eggs _
two longstanding family passions, said Christopher Forbes, son of
the late publisher Malcolm Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Other celebrity brands include trends guru and ``cocooning''
queen Faith Popcorn, with a home office collection for Hooker
Furniture; costume designer Bob Mackie of Cher and Carol Burnett
fame, with additional pieces for Clayton Marcus; and fashion
designer Alexander Julian, with new upholstery groups produced by
BenchCraft. Even members of the cast of ``Ally McBeal'' will be on
hand Saturday to help Lane Furniture kick off new lines.

IS THE MAN IN BLACK REALLY BACK? 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Ala., N.C.)  By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's not on a winning roll like Jeff Gordon. And he's not making
a championship run like Dale Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're looking for the Dale Earnhardt of old, who hasn't
really been showing up a lot lately, you can still find him at
Daytona, Fla., and Talladega, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   While the Intimidator, as he's called, may be just a memory at a
lot of other tracks, he definitely remains larger than life at
NASCAR's two biggest ovals.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Earnhardt won the first Talladega race April 25. He
backed that with seconds in the Daytona 500 in February and July's
Pepsi 400, also at Daytona International Speedway. This weekend
he'll be back in Talladega for the Winston 500.
</P>
<P>
   The superspeedway surge has enabled Earnhardt to stop a dramatic
skid that has seen him in a downward slide since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   While that, by itself, is no guarantee that Earnhardt can again
become competitive on a weekly basis, it is a start, and something
for the legions of Earnhardt fans, and Earnhardt's team, to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps part of the reason for Earnhardt's success at Daytona
and Talladega is that even with all the technology that goes into
today's race cars, Talladega in particular and Daytona to a lesser
extent suit Earnhardt's foot-to-the-floor driving style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy racing on the big tracks,'' Earnhardt said. ``It used
to be more fun than it is now, because we could run wide open with
no restrictor plates. You would carry so much speed going into the
corners that you had to lift to make it around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Earnhardt said, ``it's straight leg, foot to the floor
all the way around the track, and the first one who lifts goes back
to the end of the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's performance at Daytona and Talladega, plus another
win at Bristol, Tenn., have made him the most competitive he's been
since 1996, when he started to fall off.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, there has been a lot of turnover on his team, major
changes in the cars and increased competition. When those points
are factored in with Earnhardt's many outside interests, which pull
him away from the car, some wonder if the team can ever again
achieve the cohesiveness needed to perform at a championship level.
</P>
<P>
   While Earnhardt admits it is difficult to find time to spend at
the shop, he doesn't believe that puts him at a disadvantage. He
says he still remains in close contact with his team, even if he
isn't around as much physically as he used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to jump on a helicopter and get there and try to get
everything done that we have to do,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's home and his shop are both in North Carolina but he
lives in the Charlotte metro area, while his team works near
Winston-Salem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you don't have to change anything on the race car, you
go up there and go through the shop and visit and make sure
everybody is excited about what's going on and what's happening and
let them know that you're interested in what's going on,''
Earnhardt said. That's a big part of it. It makes a difference when
I go to the shop. It's always good to go up there and catch up on
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dale comes to the shop maybe once a month or more if needed,''
crew chief Kevin Hamlin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have plenty of capable people,'' Hamlin said. ``If he
communicates with me and tells me he would like something or wants
something different, then we can work on it without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as him being at the shop, it's not a necessity,''
Hamlin said. ``He likes to stop by and say hey to all of the guys
and tell them they're doing a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that helps, but Earnhardt still isn't what he used to
be. This week though, returning to Talladega, it should be like old
times.
</P>
<P>
   For one race at least, the man in black is back.

   THE REBIRTH OF DALE EARNHARDT: Most thought Dale Earnhardt was
past his prime a couple of years ago. He wasn't winning, and there
were some bizarre incidents -- like going to sleep in his car
moments before the race, then wrecking on the first lap without
contact. But just when it appeared safe to write him off, he
returns with a vengeance, moving to No. 7 on the points list.

   THE REBIRTH OF DALE EARNHARDT: Most thought Dale Earnhardt was
past his prime a couple of years ago. He wasn't winning, and there
were some bizarre incidents -- like going to sleep in his car
moments before the race, then wrecking on the first lap without
contact. But just when it appeared safe to write him off, he
returns with a vengeance, moving to No. 7 on the points list.

Mets this season and Game 3 starter Tom Glavine has won all three

are not overconfident against the Mets and one of the newest

BOND YIELDS CLIMB FOR 3RD STRAIGHT DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Driven by some investors' concern that strong
economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to raise short-term
interest rates, bond yields climbed higher Thursday for a third
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of Treasury securities, which move in the opposite
direction from yields, fell again on fresh evidence that consumers
are buying more and paying more for imported goods. By late in the
day, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was down
20/32, to 97 13/32. Its yield rose to 6.32 percent from 6.27
percent on Wednesday, the highest level since Oct. 22, 1997, when
it reached 6.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported Thursday that retail sales were
up last month, but not as much as expected, while the Labor
Department stirred market fears with a report saying that prices of
imported goods kept rising last month.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts argued that Thursday's figures had proved
counterproductive for the bond market because they did not really
suggest that the trend of strong consumer spending had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee,
Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management, said,
``The bond market has been in a heightened state of alert for signs
of inflation now that the FOMC is officially biased toward
tightening, particularly in light of upcoming data that are not
expected to be market-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``While the Fed specifically stated that it is not
committed to any near-term action, a firming of its policy stance
at the next FOMC meeting on Nov. 16 is a distinct possibility, and
in fact is now expected by market participants, judging from the
spread between the two-year Treasury note and the federal funds
rate. At this juncture, it would appear that only a sudden,
significant deterioration in the economy's performance or imminent
sharp contraction in the stock market could quickly alleviate
inflation concerns and keep the Fed at bay.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer spending, the key to the economic outlook, still
appears to be healthy. September retail sales rose just 0.1
percent, less than the 0.2 percent expected. This does not seem
indicative of a slowdown since it came on the heels of outsized
increases of 1.5 percent and 1.0 percent in August and July
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns Securities,
said Thursday's retail sales report was masking powerful
third-quarter growth for the economy. ``U.S. consumers paused for
breath in September, but the underlying trend remains undeniably
strong. Even with the September lull, sales are still up a towering
10.5 percent from year-ago levels and they expanded at a healthy
9.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter.'' Dr. Cooper said
that even Hurricane Floyd could not put a meaningful dent in
consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the market is bracing for Friday's producer price
numbers, which are expected to come in well above the recent trend.
Analyst are forecasting the core and overall number to be up 0.4 to
0.5 percent. ``Each new piece of strong data is adding to fears
that the Fed is falling behind,'' said Stanley Shepard, a market
analyst with Standard &AMP; Poor's MMS, a research and analysis firm
based in San Francisco. ``This is causing players to mark prices
ever lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, investors are opting to buy corporate debt to give
them a bigger yield cushion if inflation accelerates.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Pugliese, senior vice president and director of fixed
income at J.W. Genesis Financial Corp., in Boca Raton, Fla., sees a
lack of conviction in the market at this point, with not many
people willing to make buying bets. ``If the PPI number takes an
inflationary turn, I see the long bond yield gravitating toward 6.5
percent. If it proves benign, do not expect a major rally either.
The current bias is toward lower prices, with any rally a selling
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much lower do prices have to go?'' Pugliese asked. `` I
think we're nearing a short-term bottom as the market sets for a
Fed tightening.''

APOLOGIZING FOR A JOB DONE RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Friday, Oct. 15)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seems that companies have become so accustomed to irritating
their customers that they now feel a need to apologize when they do
something right.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of months ago, British train passenger Stevan Walton
wrote to a railway company to express his appreciation for a
pleasant journey. The company, Virgin Trains VA.CN, was so
discombobulated it sent him not one, but two, letters of apology.
</P>
<P>
   According to the London Daily Telegraph, the first letter
offered an apology and a ticket refund. The second apologized that
Walton's ``complaint'' had not been dealt with quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Red-faced train-company officials admitted later that the whole
matter had been an ``administrative mistake'' and that the letters
were a ``completely inappropriate response.''
</P>
<P>
   That could well be, but I think Virgin Trains VA.CN may have
inadvertently discovered a way for major corporations to trim
customer-service costs. Instead of going to all the trouble and
expense of creating a complaint department _ or, more likely, a
labyrinthine voice-mail system that routes the calls of
dissatisfied customers from machine to machine until the caller
hangs up, is disconnected or dies of old age, whichever comes first
_ why not simply bring someone in for an hour or two a year to
apologize for what has been done right?
</P>
<P>
   Customers do not like change and need to be assured that the
positive experience they had with a store, business or service
provider will never be repeated again. Eventually, after repeated
apologies, the concept of ``good service'' will become so blurred
in the customer's mind that they will stop bothering company
officials with appreciative calls and letters and the company can
devote more of its energies to raising prices and lowering quality.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers, which are inundated with complaints on a daily
basis, would enjoy the benefits of this new approach more than
most. Newspapers are forever publishing corrections,
clarifications, retractions, apologies, reversals, recantations,
set-the-record-straighters, oopsies, never-minds and general
obsequious boot-lickings, and neither the papers nor the readers
seem to feel any better for it.
</P>
<P>
   It would certainly save a lot of time and effort, not to mention
trees, if papers would simply apologize, right off the bat, for
anything that might be accurate, truthful or otherwise correct in
the day's edition.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the editorial department might issue this
disclaimer: ``Dear Readers: Due to circumstances beyond our
control, it turned out we were right about the state lottery. None
of the money has been used to enhance education or, if it has, no
one has been able to tell the difference. We apologize for being
right about this and intend to make it up to you in the near future
by writing an editorial urging the legislature to make it easier
for convicted felons to purchase automatic weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The person who delivers your paper could send out a form letter
once a year _ perhaps enclosed in the annual Christmas card _
apologizing for all the times the paper did not arrive late or was
not thrown on the roof or in a puddle. It's gestures like this that
make people open their hearts, and checkbooks, at Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Personal computer companies certainly stand to gain a lot from
this new approach to customer relations. The present system
basically consists of frustrated computer-users sitting on ``hold''
for hours at a time while a tech-service representative makes a few
personal calls and does his or her homework. For this you pay them
$7 an hour so they can go out and buy more nose rings and tongue
studs? Wouldn't it make more (economic and fashion) sense to fire
all these people and simply record a brief message apologizing for
whatever the computer managed to do right?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear customer,'' the apology might begin. ``We wish to
apologize for the fact that your computer has not crashed in
(Choose one: 1, 2, 3 days) and/or has not flushed an irreplaceable
file that took you (1, 2, 3) weeks to create straight down the
silicone-lined commode to Gigabit Hell in less time than it will
take Bill Gates to earn his next (1, 2, 3) million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we are sorry that we have failed to develop any
mandatory and expensive `upgrades' to your system in the past (1,
2, 3) minutes, or forced you to install some of our slow and balky
software that will cause your computer, and perhaps every
electrical appliance in your house, to start sparking and smoking
the instant you try to use it.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a token of our remorse, please note that we have raised
your monthly user fee by $10. Have a nice day.''
</P>

<HEADLINE>
JACK ROUSH LOOKING AHEAD TO 2000  (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ala., Calif., Mich., Ky.)  By PATRICK ZIER   The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jack Roush talks, he comes across as the kind of guy who
could probably tell you where every single nut and bolt is on every
one of his race cars.
</P>
<P>
   In Winston Cup alone, Roush owns five entries, the largest
multi-car team in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday's Winston 500 in Talladega, Ala., three of Roush's
car, driven by Jeff Burton, Mark Martin and Kevin Lepage, will vie
for a $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   They are eligible for the money by virtue of having finished in
the top five at the last bonus race, Darlington's Southern 500,
which Burton won.
</P>
<P>
   Should Burton win again Sunday, it would be his third victory in
a bonus race this year. In addition to Darlington, he also won at
Las Vegas, so he could wind up pocketing $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is interesting to Roush, but not his main focus.
</P>
<P>
   With a bachelor of arts degree in mathematics and physics from
Berea (Ky.) College and a masters in scientific mathematics from
Eastern Michigan, Roush's main concern is trying to make his cars
run faster.
</P>
<P>
   He is always looking ahead, and right now, that means trying to
narrow the gap between Martin and Burton, by far the best cars in
his team, and Lepage, Chad Little and Johnny Benson, who are
essentially non-competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Benson lost his sponsor and that operation will be shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But Roush is adding Matt Kenseth, perhaps the best young driver
in the Busch Series, to his stable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the Winston Cup Series is concerned, we've had a
great year,'' Roush said. ``Mark has had some mechanical problems
at times when it hurt a lot. We've been caught in a wreck or two
that has hurt us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff Burton and his crew chief Frankie Stoddard have come of
age and placed themselves well in the top 10 and served notice that
they'll be contenders for championships and winning races into the
next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those I take great pride in,'' Roush said. ``Johnny Benson's
program is a huge disappointment to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Lepage is about on track with what it takes to be able
to establish the chemistry and build a group around a driver that
can get him what he needs. That's working about the way it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad Little and the John Deere program have been up and
down,'' Roush said. ``We certainly didn't start the year on the
note we finished on last year, but this has been a solid year of
building.''
</P>
<P>
   For Roush, the goal is a title in 2000. Despite having the
talent and equipment to run with anybody, Roush Racing has not been
able to take the final step.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody will say they can't make it, though, and with a new car
and a new year, they will be ready. Roush will see to that.

 &HT;    TEXAS WAR HERO-ACTOR AUDIE MURPHY HONORED WITH POSTAGE STAMP
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In what some consider postage overdue, the boyish,
freckled face of a Texas war hero will join the profiles of Elvis
Presley and Marilyn Monroe next year, with the debut of the 33-cent
Audie Murphy commemorative stamp.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, the son of Hunt County sharecroppers, gained national
fame as the most decorated U.S. combat soldier of World War II and
became a Hollywood star, making 44 feature films.
</P>
<P>
   Texas legislators, including Rep. Ralph Hall, D-Rockwall,
unveiled the stamp at a Capitol Hill press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Audie Murphy was indeed a legend in his own time _ and a hero
for all times,'' said Hall, who counted the Texan among his
personal friends, until Murphy's death in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Hall recalled one of Murphy's favorite sayings about the Lone
Star state: ``He always said never to ask people if they're from
Texas, because if they were, they'd tell you, and if they weren't,
there wasn't any reason to embarrass them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, also praised Murphy, whom he called a
``country boy, baby-faced young man'' who turned out to be the
greatest hero of World War II and a major spokesman for the rights
of veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're awfully proud that he is a Texan, and we think that he
is a symbol of what is best in our state and in our country,''
Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy received the Congressional Medal of Honor for saving the
troops in his company and single-handedly breaking up a German
attack toward the end of World War II. His young looks and modest
frame did not exactly fit the typical visual of a Hollywood war
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was small _ 5 feet 5 inches, 112 pounds and the Marines
turned him down,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas. ``But
he wanted to serve his country, and we all know the end of that
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy received 33 military awards and decorations and is
credited with killing more than 240 enemy soldiers and wounding and
capturing many others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a 120-pound, blue-eyed killer during the war. He
answered the call and carried it out well,'' Hall said. ``But to
know him and be with him, he was very mild _ a very quiet guy.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Murphy was invited to Hollywood by actor James
Cagney, who saw his picture on the cover of Life magazine. Among
his many films _ most of them Westerns _ the best known is ``To
Hell and Back,'' in which
</P>
<P>
   Murphy starred as himself. The motion picture, based on his
best-selling autobiography, was Universal's highest grossing film
until 1975, when it was surpassed by ``Jaws.''
</P>
<P>
   His legend extended to other areas, including gambling _ where
he was known to have won and lost fortunes. He also raised horses
and wrote dozens of songs that were recorded by artists including
Dean Martin and Roy Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Three other soldiers will be featured on new U.S. postal stamps
next year: Gen. John L. Hines, a highly decorated WWII veteran who
later became Army Chief of Staff; Sgt. Alvin C. York, who received
the Medal of Honor for his single-handed capture of German soldiers
during World War I; and Gen. Omar N. Bradley, who commanded the1st
Army during the 1944 Allied landing in Normandy and became the
first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   The stamps feature black and white photographs of the soldiers
in uniform with boxes in the corner that indicate the
shoulder-sleeve insignia of the units in which they served.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Hutchison quoted several letters
supporting the Audie Murphy stamp, including one from a veteran in
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard to believe that Bugs Bunny, Marilyn Monroe and Bela
Lugosi have stamps but not Audie Murphy. Somebody has got to get
their priorities straight,'' the letter read.
</P>
<P>
   After his death in a 1971 plane crash, Murphy was buried with
full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. His gravesite
is the second most-visited in the historic park, after the eternal
flame of President John F. Kennedy.

<P>
   SUNDAY, 4 P.M. GAMES
</P>
<P>
   Carolina (1-3) vs. San Francisco (3-2)
</P>
<P>
   This is George Seifert's first game against his old team, and he
catches them at a low point. The 49ers are nursing deep wounds
after their whipping at the Rams. They still don't have Steve Young
back at quarterback and, more and more, it looks as if Young's
concussion might keep him out longer. Their pass defense was porous
against the Rams and oftentimes embarrassing. Look for the 49ers to
rebound. But watch Carolina and back Tim Biakabutuka chew them up.
Look for a big game from Beuerlein and his receivers. This is a
victory that Seifert desperately wants. He will cherrish it.
Panthers, 31-28.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay (3-1) vs. Denver (1-4)
</P>
<P>
   A rematch of Super Bowl XXXII but both teams have different
looks. Green Bay is turning games over to Brett Favre, letting him
work his magic in a variety of ways. Denver is still trying to
solve its problems at quarterback, running back and on defense.
Winning at the Raiders was a start. But the Broncos meet a team
that has jelled much faster than them. One with more talent, too,
especially at the skill positions. Denver offers a fight but Green
Bay's Dorsey Levens (4.4 average yards per carry) runs out the
clock at the end. Packers, 24-20.
</P>
<P>
   SUNDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Washington (3-1) vs. Arizona (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   Washington enjoyed a bye and an extra week to prepare for
Arizona. That should serve them well, especially quarterback Brad
Johnson. He has thrown for 1,191 yards in four games and leads an
offense that averages 412.5 yards per game. In 122 pass attempts
this season, Johnson has not thrown an interception. Stephen Davis
anchors the ground game with 400 rushing yards; his career high in
a season is 567. Arizona has won six of the last seven at home
against Washington and its defense is capable; it has the
top-ranked pass defense in the NFC. But look for Johnson to solve
them. Redskins, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY NIGHT
</P>
<P>
   Dallas (3-1) vs. Giants (2-3)
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is 6-0 against the Giants on Monday nights and last year
in a Monday night game spanked them, 31-7. It was a game where
Deion Sanders ran circles around them, scoring on punt and
interception returns. Dallas swept the Giants last year. The
Cowboys recover from the emotional loss of the injured Michael
Irvin and play confidently against a team they think they can
dominate. They find the Giants offense simple, the Giants defense
tougher, but, overall, believe they are simply a better team. Maybe
so. Cowboys, 23-17.

LAWMAKERS SAY CLINTON SEEKS COMPROMISE ON PUERTO RICAN BOMB RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, meeting with Hispanic lawmakers
from six states, appealed for Puerto Rico's political leaders to
negotiate the Navy's future use of a bombing range on the island of
Vieques, Rep. Carlos Romero-Barcelo, D-Puerto Rico, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawmaker, a non-voting member of Congress who represents
the 3.8 million U.S. citizens in Puerto Rico, said the government
of Puerto Rico would not negotiate resumption of Navy target
practice on an island that is home to almost 9,400 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The president is ``looking for a solution to a very difficult
problem and he doesn't have an answer at this point in time,''
Romero-Barcelo said, adding: ``The president thinks there must be a
meeting of the minds, that we have to sit down and discuss the
situation with the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., said Clinton appealed for continued
efforts to find a compromise to a five-month stalemate that would
satisfy Navy needs for combat training and Puerto Ricans'
insistence that the Navy withdraw from Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ``understood that for the Navy to stay in Vieques and
resume bombings would be an affront to the Puerto Ricans both on
the island and in the states,'' Serrano said. ``I was pleasantly
surprised and somewhat shocked to hear an American president speak
the way he spoke about the situation in Vieques.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers' comments followed a meeting Wednesday night at
the White House with the president and members of the Congressional
Hispanic Caucus that includes representatives from Arizona,
California, Illinois, New Jersey, New York and Texas, as well as
Guam and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials had no comment on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Calif., chairwoman of the
17-member caucus, said lawmakers had a ``productive, working
meeting'' with the president that ``will keep the lines of
communication open.'' But neither the congresswoman nor her aides
would discuss what the president said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo said he told the president that the government of
Puerto Rico will not discuss resumption of live-fire combat
training on the bombing range that has been used by Atlantic-based
Navy and Marine Corps forces since 1941.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that the bombing must cease permanently and
the Navy must withdraw from Vieques,'' Romero-Barcelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo said the lawmakers who took part in the meeting
with the president on behalf of the Hispanic Congressional Caucus
were unified in their appeal for the president to order the Navy to
cease using Vieques for bombing practice and military maneuvers and
to return Navy-owned land to Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo said he warned the president against undertaking
any effort by U.S. Marshals or other federal law enforcement
authorities to clear several dozen protesters from the 899-acre
area where they have camped since April in a bid to prevent
resumption of target practice with bombs, rockets, naval gunfire
and artillery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are arrested there, there will be others who go in
to replace them, including some members of the Hispanic
Congressional Caucus,'' the lawmaker said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is grappling with a politically sensitive decision that
has repercussions for the New York Senate campaign of First Lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton and the presidential ambitions of Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rican voters are an influential constituency in New York,
representing about 60 percent of the 2.6 million Hispanics in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic voters also have growing political influence in
electorally important states that are represented in Congress by
members of the Hispanic Congressional Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not taken a public position. But New York state Sen.
Olga Mendez, a Democrat from Manhattan, said Gore told her during a
private meeting on Oct. 5 that he favored closing the target range.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's bombing range on Vieques has been closed since April
19 when a Marine Corps pilot mistakenly bombed a range observation
post located about 10 miles from the nearest civilians. Two 500
pound bombs killed a Puerto Rican security guard employed by the
Navy and wounded four other civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Romero-Barcelo said Puerto Rico's political leaders, led by Gov.
Pedro Rossello, will only consider discussions with the Navy after
a Pentagon review panel appointed at the request of the president
publicly delivers its recommendations for future use of the target
range.

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has sought a compromise in the dispute from the outset,
sounding sympathetic to both sides. The president, in a
hand-written note on July 21, told national security adviser Samuel
``Sandy'' Berger that ``the Navy can find a way to work around''
local opposition to the live-fire training.
</P>
<P>
   But in a letter to Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John
Warner, R-Va., released on Sept. 23, Clinton endorsed the
``rigorous, realistic'' combat training sought by the Navy.

COLUMN: BIZARRE FIGHT FOR CONTROL AT NATIONAL AUTO CREDIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subpoenas arrived this week, and the president of the
company being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission sounded downright exultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the authorities will continue to move quickly,'' said
Allen Rice of National Auto Credit Inc. ``This investigation by the
SEC appears to be consistent with the agency's well-publicized
crackdown on individuals who are suspected of manipulating
corporate earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Your average chief executive wouldn't be thrilled to have
gumshoes from Washington going over his books, but this is not a
normal situation. The investigation, and a related one by the
Justice Department, probably represents Rice's best chance of
keeping his job. For National Auto Credit of Solon, Ohio, a company
that specializes in auto loans to people with dubious credit, is
the target of one of the more bizarre fights for control ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Rice, who joined the company in May. On the other
side is the company's majority shareholder, Sam Frankino, who was
not consulted on Rice's employment. Frankino is now battling in
Delaware courts to take control of the board, with a ruling
expected soon. The losers so far are the public shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   A little background is in order. Early last year, when Frankino
was running National Auto Credit and its shares were traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, the company's auditors resigned, saying
that they did not trust management's representations. A special
committee of the board concluded that the auditors had a point.
Frankino forced those directors off the board, and appointed
replacements more to his liking. The stock cratered.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, things have gone against Frankino. After he
stepped down as chairman in March 1998, his hand-picked board
turned against him and now says it may sue him. Restated financial
results showed about $100 million in losses that, the company says,
``should have been reported when Frankino was at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankino denies wrongdoing. ``They've spent millions of dollars
on an alleged witch-hunt, and Mr. Frankino is tired of it,'' says
William Lafferty, a lawyer for Frankino. ``They've come up with
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice says they certainly have come up with something. ``The
forensic auditors completed their report in late July,'' he said in
an interview. ``It is quite a substantial report. There is a lot of
information therein that is very damning to the former
management.'' But he says he can't release the report, which was
provided to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In his arguments in Delaware, Frankino maintains that the past
is irrelevant. He has a majority of the stock, he says, and
majority rules.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all this leave the company? In limbo. It avoided
bankruptcy and has positive cash flow, but it can't borrow money
while the battle is on. Its stock, kicked off the Big Board, trades
for 76 cents on the over-the-counter bulletin board, far below book
value of about $3 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the SEC investigation goes on. Even if he loses in
Delaware, Frankino can probably take control at next year's annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If minority shareholders don't like it, there does not appear to
be much they can do. They have tried suing, but on Wednesday, a
federal magistrate judge in Cleveland recommended dismissal of the
suit against the company and its former officials. She reasoned
that there was no proof that the company knew its books were wrong
before the auditors quit, and therefore there was no case.

OPPOSITION IN SERBIA UNITES TO DEMAND ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Under pressure from Washington and the
fizzling of protests against President Slobodan Milosevic, the
weakened democratic opposition in Serbia united Thursday in
demanding early elections under the watchful eye of foreign
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   In a setback for the Clinton administration, such elections
would not remove Milosevic, who was elected in 1997 to a four-year
term by the Yugoslav Parliament and controls a government
considered unlikely to call parliamentary elections due in 2000
before next spring.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday's agreement on conditions follows pressure from
Washington on the splintered opposition to unite and some signs
that it is pulling together after the disappointment of what one
opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, hoped would be major street
protests forcing Milosevic to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful Serbian Renewal Movement led by Vuk Draskovic,
Djindjic's main opposition rival, indicated Thursday that it too is
now gearing up for demonstrations, as Draskovic had promised if the
Milosevic government does not grant early elections.
</P>
<P>
   His party leadership demanded early elections on all political
levels _ local, Serbian and federal _ before the end of this year
and said the municipal assemblies of all 31 Serbian cities and
towns controlled by the opposition would rally on one day behind
that demand.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, which earlier shared Djindjic's
hopes of large protests forcing Milosevic to resign, has lately
concentrated on pushing Draskovic into better cooperation with his
opposition rival.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has threatened Draskovic with indictment by the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague for the activities
of his short-lived Serbian Guard, a paramilitary group, in Croatia
in 1991, officials say, and Draskovic was until very recently on
the American ``visa watch list,'' which would prevent his traveling
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American officials admit that Draskovic has been proven correct
with his analysis that rallies would not succeed in ousting
Milosevic and that early elections to undermine his power must be
the joint opposition goal.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic was also radicalized, aides say, by what he called an
assassination attempt on Oct. 3, when a heavy truck swung into his
lane, smashed into his car, killing his powerful brother-in-law and
then hitting the car of his three bodyguards, killing them. The
police have not found the driver of the truck or its current owner.
</P>
<P>
   However much Draskovic and his influential wife, Danica, despise
Djindjic, an aide said, ``they both know that they would never try
to kill one another.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent trip to Washington, a top Draskovic aide, Ognjen
Pribicevic, tried to smooth over relations with the Americans.
Pressed by Washington, Draskovic agreed to allow Studio B, the city
television station he runs, to cover the entire opposition more
credibly, including Djindjic, who lacks his own media outlet. And,
last week, the two opposition parties cooperated for the first time
since Draskovic helped oust Djindjic as Belgrade mayor in 1997,
passing resolutions that called on Milosevic's to resign and
condemned the attack on Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Nis Thursday, several thousand opposition supporters jeered
at a smaller crowd of government supporters while Serbian President
Milan Milutinovic reopened a bridge damaged by NATO bombs. Police
kept the two crowds apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian deputy prime minister, ultranationalist Vojislav
Seselj, said on Wednesday that ``it is obvious there will be no
elections before the spring.'' He acknowledged that Serbs are
unhappy with their government, but said the opposition was no
substitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are justly angry with the authorities in Serbia,''
Seselj told a private Nis television station. ``But there is no
alternative. We are the way we are, and there are no better ones in
Serbia.''

INSIDE ART: COLLECTING CEZANNE; URBAN SCULPTURES; RENAMING THE
TATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Auguste Pellerin is a name that keeps cropping up at
auctions. The French industrialist, who died in 1929, was one of
the world's greatest collectors of Impressionist and
post-Impressionist art. He bought his first Cezanne in 1895 and by
his death had amassed about 150 works by Cezanne, almost a sixth of
his entire surviving oeuvre.
</P>
<P>
   But Pellerin didn't stop there. He also collected paintings,
drawings and sculptures by masters like Manet, Monet, Rodin and
Renoir.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Pellerin's heirs have been slowly selling off
the parts of the collection that had not found their way to
museums. Both Sotheby's and Christie's have sold works from the
Pellerin collection.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Christie's will auction 10 paintings by Cezanne as
well as a sculpture by Rodin and a painting by Manet. They will be
included in Christie's sale of Impressionist and post-Impressionist
art on Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   While the current crop of Pellerin works are by big-ticket
artists, they tend to be serious and early, the kind of things that
appeal more to scholars, serious connoisseurs and museums than to
the art buyer looking for a pretty image to put in a living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have already had museums sniffing around `The Orgy,' ''
said Nicholas Maclean, who runs Christie's department of
Impressionist and 19th-century art, referring to the 1867 Cezanne
painting. Partly inspired by Veronese's masterpiece ``The Marriage
of Cana,'' which is in the Louvre, it depicts a drunken banquet and
is estimated to sell for $7 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eve,'' a sculpture by Rodin, is the first bronze cast by the
Rudier Foundry. Dating from 1897, it was initially conceived as
part of an Adam and Eve group to flank Rodin's ``Gates of Hell,''
one cast of which is in the Rodin Museum in Paris. Pellerin
purchased the Rodin directly from the artist in 1898. Christie's
estimates it will sell for $3 million to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the Christie's sale is Manet's ``Polichinelle,' an 1873
full-length portrait of Punch, from the Italian medieval comic
couple Punch and Judy. Punch was a central figure in the artist's
work in 1873 and '74. The painting is estimated to bring $2.5
million to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Art in Urban Landscape
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Metrotech, the complex of corporate offices in
downtown Brooklyn that includes Chase Manhattan Bank, Bear Stearns
and Brooklyn Union Gas, has just installed a show of special
commissions by five young artists.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception eight years ago, Metrotech has been known
for its public art _ both permanent installations and temporary
exhibitions _ and for giving younger sculptors a chance to work in
a public place.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Art Fund, a nonprofit group that installs art around
the city, has been responsible for Metrotech's program. This
season, it placed all but one of its new commissions in the
Metrotech commons. Visitors are greeted by ``Grand Entrance at the
Commons'' by Jason Middlebrook, a Brooklyn-based installation
artist. He created a false entrance outside the complex, the kind
one might find in an upscale suburban housing cluster, made from
Styrofoam, wood and paint.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the Australian artist James Angus' ``Basketball
Dropped from 35,000 Feet at Moment of Impact.'' Using
three-dimensional computer-aided design technology, the artist
simulated the impact of a basketball that has fallen from an
aircraft onto a New York sidewalk. Kirsten Mosher, a Manhattan
installation artist, made ``Local Park Express,'' an interactive
sculpture where benches and planters travel along train tracks. In
the trees, Sharon Louden, a Manhattan artist known primarily for
her drawings, created ``Tangled Tips,'' webs of luminescent pale
blue wires.
</P>
<P>
   In the lobby of MetroTech 1, the Canadian artist James Carl has
made ``Dupes,'' life-size, finely detailed recreations of an ATM, a
Federal Express box and a metal detector like those used at
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Each artist was given $10,000 toward the fabrication of the
works, which will be on view at least a year. Some works installed
last year, like Tony Matelli's ``Stray Dog'' and Do-Ho Suh's
``Public Figures,'' are so popular that they are staying a second
year.
</P>
<P>
   Tate Who?
</P>
<P>
   It's not only Americans who like sound bites. The Tate Gallery
in London conducted marketing studies to determine a suitable way
of distinguishing its 102-year-old Millbank building from its new
museum under construction in the renovated Bankside power station
in Southwark. Popular opinion voted overwhelmingly for short,
punchy names.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bankside project was begun seven years ago, Sir
Nicholas Serota, the Tate's director, announced that the Millbank
site would house only British art and that the new museum would be
devoted to modern art from all over the world. Back then, the
museum called the two branches the Tate Gallery of British Art and
the Tate Gallery of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were two big mouthfuls,'' Sir Nicholas said. ``We
realized that the public wanted snappy names that were connected
with the subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting March 24, the original museum building will be called
simply Tate Britain. And when the transformed power station opens
on May 12, it will be known as Tate Modern.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of hanging art chronologically, both museums will use a
theme approach _ ``hanging historic and modern works together in
challenging juxtaposition,'' Serota said.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that the Tate's original home doesn't seem outdated,
it is getting a $51.6 million facelift and its collection of
British art, from the 16th century to the present, will be rehung.
</P>
<P>
   The London architects John Miller and Partners are working on
upgrading the building to create new galleries, increasing the
display space by 35 percent. The museum will also get a second
entrance, in Atterbury Street, to reduce overcrowding at the main
entrance.

<P>
   The subpoenas arrived this week, and the president of the
company being investigated by the Securities and Exchange
Commission sounded downright exultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the authorities will continue to move quickly,'' said
Allen Rice of National Auto Credit Inc. ``This investigation by the
SEC appears to be consistent with the agency's well-publicized
crackdown on individuals who are suspected of manipulating
corporate earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Your average chief executive wouldn't be thrilled to have
gumshoes from Washington going over his books, but this is not a
normal situation. The investigation, and a related one by the
Justice Department, probably represents Rice's best chance of
keeping his job. For National Auto Credit of Solon, Ohio, a company
that specializes in auto loans to people with dubious credit, is
the target of one of the more bizarre fights for control ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Rice, who joined the company in May. On the other
side is the company's majority shareholder, Sam Frankino, who was
not consulted on Rice's employment. Frankino is now battling in
Delaware courts to take control of the board, with a ruling
expected soon. The losers so far are the public shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   A little background is in order. Early last year, when Frankino
was running National Auto Credit and its shares were traded on the
New York Stock Exchange, the company's auditors resigned, saying
that they did not trust management's representations. A special
committee of the board concluded that the auditors had a point.
Frankino forced those directors off the board, and appointed
replacements more to his liking. The stock cratered.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, things have gone against Frankino. After he
stepped down as chairman in March 1998, his hand-picked board
turned against him and now says it may sue him. Restated financial
results showed about $100 million in losses that, the company says,
``should have been reported when Frankino was at the helm.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankino denies wrongdoing. ``They've spent millions of dollars
on an alleged witch-hunt, and Mr. Frankino is tired of it,'' says
William Lafferty, a lawyer for Frankino. ``They've come up with
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice says they certainly have come up with something. ``The
forensic auditors completed their report in late July,'' he said in
an interview. ``It is quite a substantial report. There is a lot of
information therein that is very damning to the former
management.'' But he says he can't release the report, which was
provided to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   In his arguments in Delaware, Frankino maintains that the past
is irrelevant. He has a majority of the stock, he says, and
majority rules.
</P>
<P>
   Where does all this leave the company? In limbo. It avoided
bankruptcy and has positive cash flow, but it can't borrow money
while the battle is on. Its stock, kicked off the Big Board, trades
for 76 cents on the over-the-counter bulletin board, far below book
value of about $3 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the SEC investigation goes on. Even if he loses in
Delaware, Frankino can probably take control at next year's annual
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   If minority shareholders don't like it, there does not appear to
be much they can do. They have tried suing, but on Wednesday, a
federal magistrate judge in Cleveland recommended dismissal of the
suit against the company and its former officials. She reasoned
that there was no proof that the company knew its books were wrong
before the auditors quit, and therefore there was no case.

VOLKSWAGEN CHOSEN FOR FIRST CLIENT EXHIBIT AT PRESTIGIOUS
ADVERTISING CLUB  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Del., South Africa, Germany, Britain, France)   By STUART ELLIOTT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Volkswagen may have once implored consumers to
``Think small,'' but now a prestigious advertising organization is
thinking big about the auto maker's campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The One Club for Art and Copy in New York, which encourages
creativity in advertising through efforts like the annual One Show
awards, will devote an exhibit to a single advertiser: Volkswagen
AG. The exhibit, which is to open to the public Friday at the One
Club Gallery here at 32 E. 21st St., offers a retrospective of VW
campaigns around the world from the 1940s through the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to presenting television commercials, print
advertisements and posters, the show, which is scheduled to run
through Nov. 30, also looks at how Volkswagen has earned a place in
popular culture, primarily through the venerable Beetle and its
contemporary successor, the New Beetle. There will be reproductions
of cartoons from magazines like The New Yorker, excerpts from films
like ``The Love Bug'' and video clips of quips from late-night
comics like Jay Leno and Dennis Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first time we've done an exhibition for just one
client,'' said Mary Warlick, executive director of the One Club.
``But what a client.''
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen has gained a reputation as a marketer that encourages
creativity among its agencies, which have won innumerable awards
from the One Club and other organizations for campaigns for the
Beetle, New Beetle, Golf, Polo and other models. The company's
Volkswagen of America unit has agreed to sponsor the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The original Beetle ads, by Doyle Dane Bernbach in New York _
now part of the DDB Worldwide Communications Group, owned by
Omnicom Group _ have been widely deemed the best campaign of all
time. The ads for the New Beetle by Arnold Communications in
Boston, a unit of Snyder Communications, pay tribute to their
predecessors with a look and attitude evocative of the understated,
humorous Doyle Dane style.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '90s are similar to the '60s,'' said Ann Cooper, an
advertising journalist who is the curator of the exhibition, ``with
the right people and the right car coming together and able to
create great buzz again.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition also features work from DDB agencies that still
work for Volkswagen, including BMP DDB in London and DDB Paris, as
well as other Volkswagen shops like the Cape Town, South Africa,
office of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide, part of WPP Group PLC. In
addition, online advertising for Volkswagen created by BBDO
Interactive in Dusseldorf, Germany _ part of the BBDO Worldwide
unit of Omnicom _ will be available on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Beetle ads will be displayed as they appeared in
magazines of the era like Life and Look. Those ads are being
borrowed from Raymond Nichols, coordinator of the Visual
Communications Group in the Department of Art at the University of
Delaware. Nichols also conducted interviews with some of the
creators of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition coincides with three anniversaries. Doyle Dane
opened for business in 1949, when the first two Beetles were sold
in the United States. (That modest beginning was the inspiration
for a classic Beetle TV spot, ``1949 Auto Show,'' that is part of
the exhibition.) The Doyle Dane relationship with Volkswagen
started in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   As for other clients that may merit similar salutes, Ms. Warlick
suggested Absolut vodka, Apple Computer, Levi Strauss and Polaroid.

   TREATY-CLINTON (Washington) _ President Clinton charges that the
Republicans who defeated a treaty banning all underground nuclear
testing are leading the United States into a ``new isolationism,''
and he vows to abide by the treaty's provisions even though it was
overwhelmingly rejected by the Senate. By David E. Sanger.

<P>
   TREATY-CANDIDATES (Undated) _ The contrasting responses by
presidential candidates underscores how Republicans and Democrats
see the vote from decidedly opposite vantage points. By Richard L.
Berke.
</P>
<P>
   TREATY-REACT (United Nations) _ Around the world, government
leaders and arms experts react with dismay and even anger after the
U.S. Senate defeated, without much debate, a nuclear test ban
treaty that had been decades in the making. For many, there was a
sense that the treaty may now be dead. By Barbara Crossette. 1,200
words.
</P>
<P>
   NAZI-GOLD-TRAIN (Washington) _ In the last weeks of World War
II, as Soviet troops advanced from the east, Nazi officials in
Hungary ordered that a train be sent west toward Germany with the
collected wealth of Hungary's decimated Jews. Their wedding bands
alone filled crate after crate. American troops intercepted the
train in Austria in May 1945, and moved its contents _ gold,
silver, paintings and furs _ to a guarded warehouse near Salzburg.
But according to a report Thursday by U.S. investigators, the
Americans were not the most selfless of custodians. U.S. officials
deemed the valuables ``unidentifiable'' and refused to let the
Hungarians inspect them for their possible return to rightful
owners. In the meantime, however, some of the American troops in
Austria helped themselves. By Tim Golden.

<P>
   PAKISTAN-MILITARY (New Delhi, India) _ Soldiers seal off
Pakistan's Parliament and round up more ministers who had served in
the elected government that was toppled Tuesday in a military coup,
but the chief spokesman for the country's armed forces declares,
``Yes, democracy is intact.'' As the nation waits for the military
to announce who will govern the country now that Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif has been dismissed and put under house arrest, the
military's efforts to put a friendly face on their takeover does
not end signs of nervousness. By Celia W. Dugger.
</P>
<P>
   LEAD-LAWYERS (Undated) _ A growing wave of lawsuits by cities
and states against makers of tobacco, guns _ and now lead paint _
has reignited a fierce debate over the role of lawyers and the
enormous fees they can earn in legal actions brought by public
officials. By Barry Meier and Richard A. Oppel Jr.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE-LIFE-COURSES (Southampton, N.Y.) _ There is a
proliferation of life-skills seminars nationwide, with more than 70
percent of colleges and universities offering some sort of academic
classes designed to help students adjust to adulthood and
institutional life. The trend has exploded over the last decade, as
budget-strapped and consumer-oriented colleges battled high dropout
rates and searched for strategies to boost student success. By Jodi
Wilgoren. 2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BRAIN (Undated) _ In a new challenge to the longstanding
belief that adults never generate new brain cells, biologists at
Princeton University have found that thousands of freshly born
neurons arrive each day in the cerebral cortex, the brain's outer
rind, where higher intellectual functions and personality are
centered. Though based on research in monkeys, the finding is
likely to prove true of people too and if so, several experts said.
By Nicholas Wade. 1,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   OBIT-NYERERE (Undated) _ Julius K. Nyerere, the idealistic,
principled and some would say naively misguided founding father of
Tanzania, died Thursday. The man who led his country into
independence and guided it for nearly three decades was about 77
years old. By Michael T. Kaufman. 3,400 words.

<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ It was not the first time it had happened.
Sitting with some friends in a restaurant, still energized from
accepting his first honorary doctorate, Jeffrey S. Wigand noticed a
man approaching from the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started shouting at me in a very abusive way,'' Wigand
said.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague who was seated with Wigand said it was all very
sudden and threatening.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man just went off on Jeff,'' she said. ``He started
screaming: `How does it feel not to be making big money any more?
Look at your cheap shoes.' He said to me, `What's a nice-looking
woman like you doing with a loser like this?'''
</P>
<P>
   The man pointed to a tobacco company logo on his shirt and
pulled a wad of bills from his pocket, thrusting it under Wigand's
nose. Big tobacco money! Remember what this looks like?
</P>
<P>
   Only several years ago, few people had heard of Jeffrey S.
Wigand, then a high-salaried senior executive at Brown &AMP; Williamson
tobacco company in Louisville, Ky., owned by British American
Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993 Wigand was dismissed, which he said was because he
resisted the company's use of a potentially dangerous pipe tobacco
additive. And he was warned, he said, to abide by the company's
confidentiality agreement or face lawsuits and the potential loss
of his family's medical benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, despite increasing pressure from the company and
anonymous death threats, he said, he decided to cooperate with
federal regulators and anti-tobacco investigators, becoming among
the most famous corporate whistle-blowers in America, the man who
told a grand jury and ``60 Minutes'' the inside secrets of Big
Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's disclosures played a crucial role in the case brought
by the states' attorneys general against the major tobacco
companies, which resulted in a $246 billion settlement last year
for health claims paid by the states for tobacco related illnesses,
and in the decision last month by the Justice Department to seek
billions of dollars in additional damages from the tobacco makers.
</P>
<P>
   But being a whistle-blower has not been easy. Indeed, Wigand
said he has never become comfortable with the term whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even like the word,'' he said. ``To me, it has a
negative connotation. And I struggle with what I did with what I
knew, I really do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigand has drawn his share of critics. He has been cast as a
turncoat for spilling company secrets and blasted as someone driven
to anti-tobacco zealotry by what has happened to him. But he said
he does not embrace the martyr's cloak, and is not dedicating his
life to an anti-tobacco crusade to do penance for his years earning
big dollars from tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's penance, I've paid it already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he worked for Brown &AMP; Williamson, he lived in an
8,300-square-foot house in one of Louisville's fanciest
neighborhoods, sent his daughters to the best schools, drove a
company-bought Mercedes, played golf at the country club and
brought his wife with him on business trips, everything first
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had all the trappings of a successful corporate executive,''
Wigand said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he lives and works in an apartment on the outskirts of
Charleston _ ``two-and-a-half miles from downtown and
two-and-a-half miles from the beach'' _ running a foundation he
formed to teach children about the dangers of tobacco. The
foundation, Smoke-Free Kids, has a staff of one, he said. Him.
There are no more country clubs or first-class living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from making $300,000 a year _ plus stock options, plus,
plus, plus _ to making $30,000,'' Wigand said. ``Yes, there is a
price I've paid. Anybody who got near me paid a price.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the inevitable question, the one he said everyone eventually
asks him: Would he do it again?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said. ``There is no stuttering here. There is no
hesitation. I am at peace with myself. I have a good name now. It's
a very good name and I protect it very much. My name stands for
integrity. I can't describe to you what it is like to have that
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   His story is the subject of a new movie, ``The Insider,'' to be
released by Disney on Nov. 5, directed by Michael Mann and starring
Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman, the ``60 Minutes'' producer who
prodded Wigand to go public and then fought to have the interview
broadcast, and Russell Crowe as Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   He has seen the movie and loves it _ ``it was 100 percent on
target, at least for me'' _ and acknowledges that he feels more
than a tiny bit of vindication. He looks forward to taking his
daughters, ages 11 and 13, to the star-studded premieres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want my children to see it with me,'' he said. ``I mean,
they're proud. Terribly proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Wigand said he has received and will receive no money from the
film. ``My pay is psychological.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the future, Wigand said: ``Basically, I would like to have
some private life again. I don't want the people around me to feel
there is always an impending situation about to happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After he was dismissed by Brown &AMP; Williamson, Wigand taught at
du Pont Manual High School in a diverse, urban neighborhood in
central Louisville. His marriage fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want to go there,'' he said. ``It was very
passionate and very bitter, on both sides. It was not an amicable
divorce.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he decided to stay in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids were there, and there was a part of me that did not
want to run out of the lion's den with my tail between my legs,''
Wigand said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't all bad, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days were good, some were ugly,'' he said. ``Sometimes
people would come up and defend me when someone attacked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, his ex-wife remarried and moved to Texas. And there
continued to be the occasional nasty incident in Louisville. In
1998, when the states' attorneys-general settled with the tobacco
companies, part of the settlement was an agreement that the
companies would drop all of their legal actions against Wigand. He
decided it was time to leave Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   He picked Charleston, he said, because one of his lawyers had
his offices there, and because it was near his father and the
ocean. His daughters remain close to him and visit regularly. But
he lives alone, save for a dog that one of his lawyers bought him,
``you know, for some company.'' He said he hasn't felt, until very
recently, that he was ready to embark on a new relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to be able to go around anonymously for awhile, to
heal,'' Wigand said. ``Now, I can relax a little bit. I would like
to have a relationship. I'm going through rebuilding my life when
I'm 56 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Some days, he said, he hardly thinks about his former life.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear is gone now,'' he said. ``I think I've been seasoned
a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That made it all the more disheartening when the man verbally
assaulted him. It reminded him, Wigand said, that passions about
tobacco are high and that the release of the new movie may stir
them up again in some people.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get the truth out has been such an effort,'' he said.
``It's still an effort.''

`RYAN CAULFIELD': IN NEED OF A HIT, FOX CALLS A ROOKIE COP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning of his first day as a Philadelphia street cop,
Ryan Caulfield (Sean Maher) admires himself in his bedroom mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing his thoughts with viewers in one of those overused
interior monologues, he notes the heft of the handcuffs and the
badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``And finally,'' he says, ``the gun. A standard-issue
nine-millimeter semiautomatic weighs about two pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all heavy,'' he continues, presumably speaking now about
the whole uniform regalia, ``and very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene conveys the character's boyishness and the seriousness
of the job as ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' premieres Friday on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He's 19 years old, recently out of high school. He's too young
to buy a legal drink, and he's about to shoulder a big load.
</P>
<P>
   So is the show, because Fox is off to a splatter start to its TV
season. Fox desperately needs a new hit, and everything's going
(set ital)kerplop.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Action,'' pre-empted the past few weeks, has practically sunk
to Pax-land in the Nielsen ratings, and Fox decided this week to
pull it from the November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' hasn't made a dent. ``Harsh Realm'' premiered to
poor numbers. Viewers are sniffing the fraud in ``Ally,'' the
foreshortened ``Ally McBeal'' that's also known as David E.
Kelley's Christmas Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Manchester Prep.'' In a severe act of pre-emptive
criticism, Fox saved time and trouble by murdering that clinker
before it even aired.
</P>
<P>
   These are not happy times in Fox's chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   So, under the circumstances, ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' might
seem presumptuously named. ``Week One'' might be more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   By any name _ it originally was ``Ryan Caulfield,'' without the
``Year One,'' and later ``The Badland'' _ this show won't be a
smash hit. But it has survival potential, which is good enough.
With its careful insistence on tracing the emotions and tracking
the senses of a rookie cop, ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' has a feel
that's all its own.
</P>
<P>
   You sense his awkwardness at his on-the-run introduction to his
partner, a veteran named Susser (Michael Rispoli). Caulfield
doesn't even make roll call before Susser swoops him into a squad
car and off to the scene of a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   And Caulfield is embarrassed when duty brings him into the
bedroom of a tenement apartment, where a corpulent man lies nude in
a deep alcoholic doze.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't tell you how strange you feel when you're in
someone's home,'' he tells us in voice-over. ``Even though you're a
cop, you feel like you're an intruder invading their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The device is a narrative crutch that's suddenly all the rage on
TV this fall _ I blame HBO's ``Sex and the City.'' But a limited
amount of it works for ``Ryan Caulfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's episode seems complete, but it's full of loose
threads and dangling story lines. I'm not sure there are many sides
to Ryan Caulfield the character. But there are to ``Ryan
Caulfield'' the show.
</P>
<P>
   We're introduced to his retinue of buddies, headed by his best
friend, Vic (James Roday), an acid-tongued slacker. To Ryan's
college freshman girlfriend, though she's destined to be written
out of the show. To Ryan's mother (Brenda Bakke). To the notion
that Ryan's father was a crooked cop, now in prison. And to the
precinct house, where the regulars include the Puerto Rican rookie
Kim Veras (Roselyn Sanchez).
</P>
<P>
   (As if Sanchez weren't singeing the screen enough by her very
presence, she's given a bra-and-panty scene in the precinct locker
room.)
</P>
<P>
   The sizable supporting cast also includes Clifton Powell as a
lieutenant at the precinct, Richard Portnow as a tough sergeant and
Chad Lindberg as yet another Ryan bud, a young plumber called
``H.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ryan Caulfield'' will rise or fall, with millions of
dollars at stake, on one of those great television risks: its
unknown star. Maher hasn't had a regular role in any previous TV
series. In fact, there's no sign he's ever been on TV before, in
any capacity. Or in a movie. Regional theater roles are the
entirety of his career credits.
</P>
<P>
   He's got those daytime soap-opera looks, though, that would make
him stand out anywhere _ except TV, of course, where everybody's
beautiful. Imagine Ray Liotta's face imposed on a younger George
Clooney's head, and you're close to Maher. That's the look. As for
ability, those theater boards are no liability; Maher has an
appealing presence for a young actor, with just the right mix of
shyness and self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   I'm often, if not customarily, wrong about these things. But
this show could be a quiet success en route to ``Ryan Caulfield:
Year Two.'' That's not exactly an answered prayer for Fox. But it
would be sustenance at the moment it's needed most.

EVEN WITH ATTENTION ON WAR, KIDNAPPINGS CONTINUE IN CHECHNYA  
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia _ Bursts of automatic gunfire rang out in central
Grozny on Wednesday, followed by an ear-splitting volley from a
heavy machine gun. People were running on the street, while
fighters and armed men rushed toward the gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   In broad daylight, on a main street in the center of town, an
armed gang was trying to kidnap a local journalist. With a burst of
machine-gun fire, government commandos shot out the wheels of the
gunmen's jeep and wounded the driver, just as the gunmen were
forcing their hostage into the car.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnapping, the scourge of the Chechen republic since the last
war with Russia ended in 1996, has not ceased, even when attentions
are turning to a renewed war. The Chechen government has fought a
losing battle against the kidnapping gangs that have targeted
foreign journalists and aid workers, as well as ordinary Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   The Chechen leadership has long been criticized for failing to
stop the increase in crime, and this incident illustrated the
brazenness of the kidnappers and their disdain for the government
forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately felt so mad,'' said Ruslan Suleymanov, one of
the commandos who arrested the men, hitting one of them on the head
and disarming him quickly. ``At such a time, when a war is going
on, they are kidnapping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman Savin, a computer technician from the Chechenpress
government news agency, escaped the kidnapping attempt with just a
blow to the head. A Chechenpress correspondent with him, Marina
Abubakarova, was unhurt.
</P>
<P>
   One kidnapper shouted ``Allahu-Akbar!'' as he was marched to the
commando headquarters, and one of his guards thumped him between
the shoulders with a rifle butt.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later they were taken off in cars by the government
security services to be interrogated, their jackets pulled over
their heads. If they are found guilty of attempted kidnapping, they
could face a death sentence, said Abu Movsayev, chief of Chechnya's
Special Department Responsible for Internal Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not just criminals,'' he said. ``This is a group sent
with an aim. It is calculated to frighten foreign journalists from
coming here.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostage trade grew out of the last war, when prisoners taken
in fighting, even the bodies of dead fighters or soldiers, were
handed over only for a price. Almost every commander was thought to
be involved in trading hostages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, kidnapping began to become widespread, with every
small-time criminal joining in. Criminal gangs elsewhere in the
Caucasus also took part, often selling their hostages to people in
Chechnya, or claiming to be holding them there.
</P>
<P>
   The government, with its economy destroyed by the war, has been
unable to pay its law enforcement agencies and is ill-equipped to
fight such powerful and well-armed groups. But it does claim to
have captured, tried and executed some of the culprits, including
Abbas Murtazalayev, the leader of a criminal gang responsible for
the beheading of four employees of a British telecommunications
company.
</P>
<P>
   Movsayev says he is convinced that Russian secret services are
behind much of the kidnapping that has made Chechnya one of the
most dangerous places in the world for foreigners, and created an
image of the Chechens as bandits, and even terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   It touches civilians too. Khadizhat Gatayeva, who runs a home
for war orphans in Grozny, received a visit from two Dagestani
women who said they had two of her children, who disappeared at the
border between Chechnya and Dagestan last month. They demanded
either $10,000 for the teen-age boys or the return of two Dagestani
hostages seized by Chechens in recent fighting.

 &HT;    McCain tells his Vietnam War story in new book
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _
</P>
<P>
   Faith of My Fathers, By John McCain. Random House; 349 pages;
$25.
</P>
<P>
   First the politics. John McCain is touting his book in the usual
cities _ New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago and Manchester,
N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester?
</P>
<P>
   Note that New Hampshire is home to the first presidential
primary _ which the third-term senator would love to win in his bid
to become the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   There seems to be more than coincidence at work in this book's
timing, which is bringing the Arizona Republican a lot of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new ploy. Biographies or weighty missives on
social and international issues have long been a part of campaign
strategy. That said, ``Faith of My Fathers'' does much more than
accomplish its political goal of helping a candidate win attention.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's story about his father and grandfather, both Navy
admirals, and the strength he took from them as he struggled to
stay alive for more than five years as a prisoner of war in
Vietnam, is compelling.
</P>
<P>
   A family of warriors, the McCains distinguished themselves in
battle. Father and grandfather were heroes in World War II. Both
would become four-star admirals, a first for a father and son. Both
were hellraisers who loved the Navy and saw it as a calling but
struggled through the Naval Academy. Both were revered by the
enlisted men they commanded.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain entered the Naval Academy and turned out to be a
dismal student who couldn't avoid getting into mischief. He did so
poorly that he was nearly kicked out and finished fifth from the
bottom of the class of 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Things didn't get much better after he left Annapolis. He went
to Pensacola, Fla., for flight training and became a Navy pilot. In
between flights, McCain played hard, often too hard. Even in play
he was following the McCain family legend. His father smoked, drank
and loved to gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Life's first big jolt hit McCain shortly before 11 a.m., July
29, 1967, while he was sitting in his A-4 fighter plane on the deck
of the USS Forrestal, preparing for his sixth bombing run over
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Just before takeoff, a missile from a nearby jet accidentally
fired, hitting McCain's plane. Fleeing through the fireball, McCain
managed to put out the flames on his flight suit. Seconds later, he
was hit in the legs and chest by bits of shrapnel from exploding
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The fire burned for 24 hours, killing 134 men, wounding many
more. Worried he would be forced to return to the States, McCain
volunteered to go to another ship and continue combat duty. He
would be hit by one more missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was hit. My A-4, traveling at about 550 miles an
hour, was violently spiraling to earth. In this predicament, a
pilot's training takes over. ... I reacted automatically the moment
I took the hit and saw that my wing was gone. I radioed, `I'm hit,'
reached up, and pulled the ejection seat handle.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain broke both arms and his right knee. He landed in a lake
near Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling him from the water, one of his captors broke
McCain's shoulder with a rifle butt. He was stabbed in the leg and
groin with a bayonet. Then he was taken to what POWs derisively
called the ``Hanoi Hilton.'' It was Oct. 26, 1967.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 5 1/2 years, McCain and the other POWs would
endure torture, solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, demands
for confessions and the constant threat of execution.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after his capture, McCain's father was named
commander in chief in the Pacific _ in charge of all ground, sea
and air forces in the Pacific, including those in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Believing they could get some propaganda value out of releasing
the admiral's son, McCain's captors offered to let him go. He
refused, saying that those captured before him should be released
first. He understood that his release would be used to torment the
other prisoners, who would be told that their country cared only
about the children of admirals.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the book is devoted to the bravery of the POWs, who did
all they could to torment and resist their guards. It is a grim
reminder of the real cost of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ends his book shortly after the prisoners were released
in 1972. He writes that his Vietnam experiences have strengthened
him and his country. ``America has a long, accomplished and
honorable history. We should never have let this one mistake,
terrible though it was, color our perceptions forever of our
country's purpose. We were a good country before Vietnam, and we
are a good country after Vietnam. In all history, you cannot find a
better one.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that McCain really believes that. And if that
belief helps him in New Hampshire, McCain's not going to complain.

 &HT;    Ridley jabs, weaves in gritty, sin-filled 'Smokes'
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Now that James Ellroy has been taken
seriously as a writer and _ worse _ slowed down, the mantle of the
hot and hungry master of neo-noir has passed to John Ridley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody Smokes in Hell'' is a title that promises a lot,
and, by God, Ridley delivers. The book is more fun than a box full
of scorpions at a wedding, a convoluted but never-confusing story
of greed, lust, and all the other deadly sins that keep life from
being dull.
</P>
<P>
   The setup: Paris Scott, would-be writer, would-be actor,
would-be director, actual failure, works at a convenience store
where he's picked up by a famous rock star named Ian who's doing a
Howard Hughes/Melvin Dummar number. Ian takes Paris back to his
mansion, plays him a tape with his latest and greatest music on it,
then passes out.
</P>
<P>
   Paris steals the tape. Ian wakes up and, not knowing the tape is
gone, accidentally kills himself in a way even Sonny Bono would
find hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to Paris, his equally feckless roommate has
liberated a quantity of fine cocaine from a particularly vicious
drug lord, who sets two thugs to catch and kill the man who stole
his drugs. Then, just in case they fail, he sets an even scarier
psychopath named Brice to back them up.
</P>
<P>
   Brice happens to be a beautiful woman who likes to dance to hard
rock while she tortures her victims, usually with cigarette butts.
Paris hits the road for Las Vegas, with all manner of viciousness
following in his wake.
</P>
<P>
   What sets Ridley apart is his uncompromising grimness matched
with a high energy. Jim Thompson had a similar outlook but wrote
through a dolorous fog; Ridley writes like the keys are tapped into
a Sears Die-Hard.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional tactic for most writers who deal with
antiheroes is to make their heavies much worse than their heroes,
so the audience has no choice but to root for the half-bad man.
</P>
<P>
   But Paris is not just a mope and a loser; he's a faithless mope
and loser, betraying the trust of the only sympathetic character in
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Ridley's people are empty souls on the fast track to perdition:
``The girl behind the counter was nineteen and white trash
distilled to its purest form: uncontaminated, unaffected,
undetrashified by the many and various, the endless variety of
ethnicities in the city she'd migrated to ... The girl was white
trash by virtue of the pumps she wore with her Levis and the halter
top that drooped from her shoulders, exposing creamy pink
afraid-of-the-sun flesh. She was white trash because of her hair _
dirty blonde despite its bleaching _ which had been tossed and
permed, blown out and curled ... everything except properly
introduced to a comb ... The girl filled her time thumbing through
a Hollywood fluff rag, not bothering with the simple-worded
articles, but lingering in rapture over the pictures of beautiful
movie-star people hanging out in beautiful movie-star places doing
nothing more significant than looking good. Manufactured glamour
shots were just about as heavy-duty a concept as this chick could
handle.''
</P>
<P>
   This luscious bit of character setting is not for a major player
but a walk-on; a more literary style would make it a couple of
wasted paragraphs, but Ridley's energy makes it an extended jazz
riff before returning to the central melody of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   The central gimmick could be played for farce as well as thrills
_ Paris thinks the people chasing him are homicidal record
executives who want Ian's tape. He doesn't even know about the
cocaine in his bag and has no idea some serious blood-and-guts
types want a heart-to-heart.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the cross-purposes, Ridley bobs and weaves, moving
fast, crosscutting between short, punchy scenes _ ``Everybody
Smokes in Hell'' has all the marks of a busted screenplay, but it's
subtler and more surprising than most screenplays ever dare to be.
Ridley even references ``The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,'' which,
these days, is grad-school esoteric _ and pulls off a tingling
lady-or-the-tiger ending.
</P>
<P>
   The book is for those with a taste for hard-core crime writing.
``I don't believe in love,'' a character says. ``I think people get
together with someone because they lust after them. I think people
stay together because they're afraid of being alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thompson never said it better. Or Charles Willeford. Or even
Dashiell Hammett.

 &HT;    Oxford Press reissues classics in paperback
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Oxford University Press is reissuing
their legendary World Classics in a new paperback format. There are
nearly 700 titles in print in the series, and the paperbacks have
been around since 1980, but the books have been reformatted and, in
some cases, reset. The results are quite attractive and readable,
and the versions offered by Oxford also come with annotations,
chronologies, glossaries and new introductions.
</P>
<P>
   The joy of the Oxford collection is its range. There are the
expected titles _ 46 novels by Trollope, 15 by Dickens, 14 Conrads,
11 Conan Doyles, nine Eliots, eight Dostoevskys, five Melvilles and
a partridge in a pear tree.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a profusion of 19th-century Gothics (``The
Mysteries of Udolpho,'' etc.) and other titles from deep left field
_ two volumes of James M. Barrie, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   I'm particularly interested in catching up on some gaps in my
19th-century British reading: the once-popular Jerome K. Jerome's
``Three Men in a Boat,'' as well as Philip Taylor's ``Confessions
of a Thug,'' a famous early (1839) novel about India. Prices range
from $8.95 for ``Riders of the Purple Sage'' up to $12.95. Also
from Oxford is a delightful reissue of Somerset Maugham's
``Princess September and the Nightingale'' ($16.95). Written in
1922, Oxford first issued the book in 1939, with stunning, densely
colored illustrations by Richard Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Maugham's story is a light, charming tale of a Thai princess who
owns a gifted nightingale who cannot sing unless it is free, and
cannot live if it cannot sing. By itself, it's a sweet footnote to
Maugham's sardonic, realistic career, but the illustrations take it
to another level.
</P>
<P>
   Highly recommended.
</P>
<P>
   LEX LUTHOR LIVES ...
</P>
<P>
   Those with a bent towards Superman won't do better than
``Superman: The Complete History'' ($29.95), a very nice
coffee-table book from Chronicle Books. The text takes you through
all of the character's permutations, from the imaginations of Jerry
Siegel and Joe Shuster, two Cleveland high school kids, through
comics, radio, serials, television and features. And yes, Siegel
and Shuster named Clark Kent's home base of Metropolis after Fritz
Lang's great 1926 film.
</P>
<P>
   The art is, of course, the main selling point, with everything
from cels from the Fleischer animated shorts of the war years, to
reprints of classic ``Superman'' comics of the postwar era.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously nostalgic fun.

 &HT;    `My Son the Fanatic' a unique cross-cultural drama
 &HT;    By Jim Luksic
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The meshing of different cultures is given a
fresh perspective in ``My Son the Fanatic,'' director Udayan
Prasad's second big-screen feature. The filmmaker, an India native
who immigrated to Great Britain, stays objective in his treatment
of Hanif Kureishi's script, first published as a New Yorker short
story.
</P>
<P>
   This uncommonly poignant tale unfolds through the eyes of Parvez
(Om Pui), a Pakistani who has spent his quarter-century in England
as a cab driver. While wife Minoo (Gopi Desai) and son Farid (Akbar
Kurtha) _ who broke up with his fiance to pursue religion _ remain
home, Parvez seems content tooling around in his taxi at night.
</P>
<P>
   He will introduce his favorite passenger, a hooker named Bettina
(Rachel Griffiths), to debauched German businessman Mr. Schitz
(Stellan Skarsgard of ``Breaking the Waves''). Parvez becomes
disgusted by their activities, but soon finds his affection for
Bettina is reciprocated. That revelation widens the chasm between
him and his dutiful spouse, and further strains relations with
Farid, whom Parvez suspects is taking drugs. Longtime friend and
restaurant owner Fizzy (Harish Patel) comes forth as a
fence-straddling devil's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   The inherently disturbing narrative examines the confusion and
contradictions Middle Easterners face in foreign lands.
Screenwriter Kureishi traversed similar turf in 1986 with ``My
Beautiful Laundrette,'' but here implements an intriguing notion: a
middle-aged married man acting less responsibly, and having less
trouble assimilating, than his devout son.
</P>
<P>
   Prasad's treatment of the material is unobtrusive; he doesn't
take sides, nor does he patronize the characters. Each individual
is given distinct values, ideals, dreams. One touching moment shows
the father grasping for explanation when asked why he hasn't
pursued a desire to write. (``It's been so long since I thought
about anything.'')
</P>
<P>
   Loose strands have been drawn together into a tiny knot. A
potentially explosive, overwrought scene wherein fundamentalists
converge upon a whorehouse isn't framed distortingly or
ostentatiously with heavy-handed angles and slow motion. In the
same instant, our hero gets revenge on his two male antagonists in
a sharp, economically shot clip.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian native with more than 100 movies under his belt, Puri
fills the screen with presence and emotional range subtly
demonstrated by his careworn face. Griffiths, the brunette in
``Hilary &AMP; Jackie,'' here sports blond locks, perhaps to augment
her trick-turning persona _ but the coif belies pain and
tenderness. The pair's pleasant conversation over coffee at dusk
speaks volumes, a credit to the actors. Kurtha and Patel,
conversely, emote too intensely; both could learn from the reserved
Skarsgard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Son the Fanatic'' overcomes a jumbled, misleading prologue
and settles down into a provocative, deceivingly witty drama about
tolerance, integrity, love and family. Rarely has the generational
gap between a parent and child been outlined within such an unusual
framework.

`RYAN CAULFIELD': IN NEED OF A HIT, FOX CALLS A ROOKIE COP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the morning of his first day as a Philadelphia street cop,
Ryan Caulfield (Sean Maher) admires himself in his bedroom mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing his thoughts with viewers in one of those overused
interior monologues, he notes the heft of the handcuffs and the
badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``And finally,'' he says, ``the gun. A standard-issue
nine-millimeter semiautomatic weighs about two pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all heavy,'' he continues, presumably speaking now about
the whole uniform regalia, ``and very cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene conveys the character's boyishness and the seriousness
of the job as ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' premieres Friday on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   He's 19 years old, recently out of high school. He's too young
to buy a legal drink, and he's about to shoulder a big load.
</P>
<P>
   So is the show, because Fox is off to a splatter start to its TV
season. Fox desperately needs a new hit, and everything's going
(set ital)kerplop.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   ``Action,'' pre-empted the past few weeks, has practically sunk
to Pax-land in the Nielsen ratings, and Fox decided this week to
pull it from the November sweeps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' hasn't made a dent. ``Harsh Realm'' premiered to
poor numbers. Viewers are sniffing the fraud in ``Ally,'' the
foreshortened ``Ally McBeal'' that's also known as David E.
Kelley's Christmas Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Manchester Prep.'' In a severe act of pre-emptive
criticism, Fox saved time and trouble by murdering that clinker
before it even aired.
</P>
<P>
   These are not happy times in Fox's chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   So, under the circumstances, ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' might
seem presumptuously named. ``Week One'' might be more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   By any name _ it originally was ``Ryan Caulfield,'' without the
``Year One,'' and later ``The Badland'' _ this show won't be a
smash hit. But it has survival potential, which is good enough.
With its careful insistence on tracing the emotions and tracking
the senses of a rookie cop, ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' has a feel
that's all its own.
</P>
<P>
   You sense his awkwardness at his on-the-run introduction to his
partner, a veteran named Susser (Michael Rispoli). Caulfield
doesn't even make roll call before Susser swoops him into a squad
car and off to the scene of a shooting.
</P>
<P>
   And Caulfield is embarrassed when duty brings him into the
bedroom of a tenement apartment, where a corpulent man lies nude in
a deep alcoholic doze.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't tell you how strange you feel when you're in
someone's home,'' he tells us in voice-over. ``Even though you're a
cop, you feel like you're an intruder invading their privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The device is a narrative crutch that's suddenly all the rage on
TV this fall _ I blame HBO's ``Sex and the City.'' But a limited
amount of it works for ``Ryan Caulfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's episode seems complete, but it's full of loose
threads and dangling story lines. I'm not sure there are many sides
to Ryan Caulfield the character. But there are to ``Ryan
Caulfield'' the show.
</P>
<P>
   We're introduced to his retinue of buddies, headed by his best
friend, Vic (James Roday), an acid-tongued slacker. To Ryan's
college freshman girlfriend, though she's destined to be written
out of the show. To Ryan's mother (Brenda Bakke). To the notion
that Ryan's father was a crooked cop, now in prison. And to the
precinct house, where the regulars include the Puerto Rican rookie
Kim Veras (Roselyn Sanchez).
</P>
<P>
   (As if Sanchez weren't singeing the screen enough by her very
presence, she's given a bra-and-panty scene in the precinct locker
room.)
</P>
<P>
   The sizable supporting cast also includes Clifton Powell as a
lieutenant at the precinct, Richard Portnow as a tough sergeant and
Chad Lindberg as yet another Ryan bud, a young plumber called
``H.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ryan Caulfield'' will rise or fall, with millions of
dollars at stake, on one of those great television risks: its
unknown star. Maher hasn't had a regular role in any previous TV
series. In fact, there's no sign he's ever been on TV before, in
any capacity. Or in a movie. Regional theater roles are the
entirety of his career credits.
</P>
<P>
   He's got those daytime soap-opera looks, though, that would make
him stand out anywhere _ except TV, of course, where everybody's
beautiful. Imagine Ray Liotta's face imposed on a younger George
Clooney's head, and you're close to Maher. That's the look. As for
ability, those theater boards are no liability; Maher has an
appealing presence for a young actor, with just the right mix of
shyness and self-assurance.
</P>
<P>
   I'm often, if not customarily, wrong about these things. But
this show could be a quiet success en route to ``Ryan Caulfield:
Year Two.'' That's not exactly an answered prayer for Fox. But it
would be sustenance at the moment it's needed most.

WORLD LEADERS REACT WITH DISMAY TO REJECTION OF TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TREATY-CLINTON) 
(th)

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Around the world Thursday, government leaders
and arms experts reacted with dismay and even anger after the U.S.
Senate defeated, without much debate, a nuclear test ban treaty
that had been decades in the making. For many, there was a sense
that the treaty may now be dead.
</P>
<P>
   There are countries that fear American power, and those fears
have been heightened by what looks like an American renunciation of
any controls over its huge nuclear arsenal. There are also nations
that rest secure in the shadow of American might and leadership.
For them, the appearance that Americans are moving away from
international agreements and responsibilities can also be alarming.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the example set by Washington is important.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States, the sole superpower, refuses stubbornly
to ratify a global nuclear test ban treaty that will make the world
safer for all, why on earth would any other country want to do
it?'' The Straits Times of Singapore asked in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping called the Senate's
decision ``absolutely wrong,'' and an aide to President Jacques
Chirac of France echoed the tone of the comments in Europe when he
called the Senate vote on Wednesday night ``a setback to the
process of nonproliferation and disarmament.''
</P>
<P>
   A Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vladimir Rakhmanin, called
rejection of the treaty ``a serious blow.''
</P>
<P>
   In Asia, Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono said the adverse
effects of the Senate vote would be ``inestimable and of extreme
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had hoped for the U.S.'s leadership in nuclear disarmament
and in preventing nuclear proliferation, and so the result is very
regrettable,'' Kono said.
</P>
<P>
   China also registered ``profound regret'' but hinted that it
would step up its own ratification process in the hope of keeping
the treaty a live issue in world opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven acknowledged nuclear weapons countries, only two _
France and Britain _ have ratified the treaty. Russia, the United
States and China have only signed it. Israel, which is assumed to
have a nuclear weapons program, has also signed. North Korea, whose
nuclear program has caused much nervousness in Asia, has not
signed.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan, both of whom have tested nuclear bombs, have
also not signed, and by wide agreement are not now under as much
pressure to do so, even though many experts believe that the
tensions between these two countries have made their region a
potential ground for nuclear conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``All said and done, the treaty is dead,'' said Brahma
Chellaney, a security analyst at the Center for Policy Research in
New Delhi, India. ``Why would other nations move ahead with the
treaty. It will just go into limbo. It's not an issue any more.
India can just relax now.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week ago, an international conference in Vienna to
discuss how to put the treaty into force reaffirmed support for a
pact that delegates called ``internationally and effectively
verifiable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, European and Asian nations urged the United
States to ratify the accord. Rejection by the Senate six days later
is being interpreted by many diplomats and editorial writers abroad
as a direct slap on the face of American allies and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the Australian disarmament expert who fought
back a challenge from India to win approval of the treaty in the
U.N. General Assembly in September 1996 and was present when
President Clinton signed it soon afterward, called the Senate vote
``a profoundly wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt in 1996 that one of the last remaining pieces in a
nuclear nonproliferation fabric had been woven,'' said Butler, a
diplomat in residence at the Council on Foreign Relations in New
York. ``It is a tapestry. It has in it the nuclear nonproliferation
treaty, the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards, controls
on the export of sensitive material, the atmospheric test ban,
under-sea test ban and so on. It had all those filaments.''
</P>
<P>
   If testing were banned, Butler said, the tapestry would be
complete ``and we could finally get on with the business of
reducing the numbers of weapons, hopefully one day getting down to
zero.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the treaty continue to argue that there were too
many dangerous flaws for it to be acceptable to the United States.
Kathleen Bailey, senior associate at the National Institute for
Public Policy in Washington and author of a study of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for the Cato Institute, said in an
interview that not all nations take international agreements as
seriously as Americans do.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the United States signs a treaty, it adheres to its terms
rigorously, and we do not cheat,'' said Ms. Bailey, who was
assistant director for proliferation at the Arms Control and
Disarmament Agency from 1987 to 1990. ``Yet we know for a fact that
other nations have cheated on arms control treaties or break the
norms established by the treaties. The No. 1 example is the nuclear
nonpoliferation treaty. North Korea is still in violation of that
treaty and has cheated on it. Numerous other nations have done so
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all arms control treaties have been trampled upon,''
she said. ``Those who question verification don't have any
confidence that the Russians, the Chinese or anybody else who sees
it their national security interest to test will not do so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the very few foreign leaders to put something of a good
face on the Senate vote was Robert Hill, Australia's environment
minister, who said he understood that the senators were concerned
about any agreement that might weaken the United States in carrying
out its ``special global responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   American arms control experts were overwhelmingly critical,
among them diplomats who had devoted years to steering this treaty
through the U.N. system, only to see their work jettisoned in an
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition to Reduce Nuclear Dangers, a group of 17
independent arms control associations accused the Senate of
``playing petty political games on a matter that effects the
survival of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Vienna, John B. Ritch III, the American representative at the
arms control bodies based there, expressed his irritation in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key aspect of the Senate vote is its effect on the worldwide
inspection regime of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which
is our first line of defense against proliferation,'' he said. ``In
practical terms, the IAEA's on-site inspection system is even more
important than the test ban since it is aimed at catching a nuclear
proliferator well before the point of testing. But politically, the
test ban is needed to buttress the nonproliferation treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It boils down to this: Not only has the Senate said no to an
added line of defense against proliferation; it has also weakened a
potent defense barrier we had already constructed.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the Indian and Pakistani nuclear explosions in May
1998, there have been no tests since French tests in 1995 and
China's in 1996, just before the test ban treaty was adopted.

A NEW MOSQUE IN NAZARETH COULD THREATEN POPE'S VISIT TO ISRAEL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Israel, Italy, Turkey, France, Germany, Britain)    By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Angered by Israel's decision to allow the building of a
mosque next to a Christian holy site in Nazareth, the Vatican
warned Thursday that such a move could jeopardize a papal visit to
Israel next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a situation does not help in the preparation of a
possible pilgrimage by the holy father to that illustrious
sanctuary,'' the Vatican spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Vals, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to authorize construction of a mosque a few
meters away from the historic Basilica of the Annunciation in
Nazareth worries both the secretariat of state and the Catholic
Church in the Holy land,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Israeli government announced a compromise in a
long-simmering dispute over the proposed mosque, permitting its
construction next to the basilica, the site where Christians
believe the archangel Gabriel told Mary that she was to be the
mother of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Though Roman Catholic and Protestant church leaders in Israel
have criticized the proposal, this was the first time the Vatican
expressed its displeasure so publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is to be hoped that the Israeli government authorities,
considering the value that the city of Nazareth has for the whole
of Christianity, will guarantee respect of the Christian holy site
and its free and peaceful access to pilgrims,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute in Nazareth is one of several issues that cloud the
pope's desire to visit holy sites in the Middle East in the year
2000. Seeking reconciliation among Jews, Christians and Muslims in
the new millennium, the pope is said to be intent on keeping to his
plan to visit Ur, the town in Iraq where Abraham is said to have
been born, in December. But that plan has met with criticism by
some Muslim intellectuals in Iraq, as well as pleas from the United
States and Britain that the pope not lend legitimacy to the Iraqi
leader, Saddam Hussein, with a state visit.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions between Catholics and Muslims even surfaced at a synod
in Rome Thursday, where hundreds of European bishops are gathered
to discuss the challenges to the Catholic faith in secular
societies like France and Germany. In a speech unlikely to ease
hostility in Nazareth, Giuseppe Germano Bernardini, the Italian
archbishop of Izmir, Turkey, warned of the threat to Christianity
posed by Islamic immigrants to Europe _ and by the Muslim world in
general.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble in Nazareth began two years ago, when Ramez
Jerayseh, the Christian mayor of the mostly Arab town, began
building a plaza in front of the basilica in anticipation of
pilgrims arriving for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The area is also holy to Muslims, who believe it contains the
tomb of a 12th-century Muslim leader who died in the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims outnumber Christians in Nazareth, about 42,000 to
18,000, and in recent municipal elections, the Islamic Movement, a
political party, won a majority on the city council, though
Jerayseh remains mayor. After the site was bulldozed for the plaza,
knocking down an old school but leaving a small mosque, supporters
of a new, larger mosque set up a protest tent outside the basilica.
Under the compromise presented on Wednesday, the proposed size of
the new mosque would be scaled down, and construction delayed until
after the 2000 celebrations and the pope's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Israel's public security minister, Shlomo Ben-Ami, who
brokered the compromise between Christians and Muslims in Nazareth,
said the mosque would be screened from the basilica by a fence. He
ordered the protesters to remove the tent by Nov. 8, when the
mosque's cornerstone is to be laid.
</P>
<P>
   Suleiman Abu Ahmad, a leader of the Islamic Movement, said he
generally approved of the compromise plan, but opposed removing the
tent until construction began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the problem is, why some people are against
it,'' Abu Ahmad said. ``In a mosque we are going to pray to God. We
are not building a casino or a dance hall.''

GENETIC FINGERPRINTS YIELD CLUES ON CANCER CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have proven that identical-looking cancer cells can
be distinguished just by their genetic fingerprints, and they say
that this method _ a spinoff of the Human Genome Project _ could
greatly improve cancer diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and
the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston used powerful, miniature
``laboratories-on-a-chip'' to scan two types of cancer cells for
genetic differences.
</P>
<P>
   These DNA chips, as they are called, can scan thousands of genes
at once and determine whether each is active or switched off. In
the test results, the chips showed that two distinct types of
cancer cells (acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, and acute
lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL) showed activity differences in more
than 50 of their several thousand genes.
</P>
<P>
   The differing gene signatures alone told which cells were which,
said the scientists. When genes are active, they make proteins;
when genes are off, no protein is made. A combination of the wrong
proteins being made or the right ones not being made cause cells to
become malignant.
</P>
<P>
   The results show that what scientists had predicted was in fact
feasible, said Dr. Todd Golub, a physician and scientist at the
Whitehead Institute and Dana-Farber.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are two types of leukemias that appear to be a single
disease under the microscope,'' said Golub, adding that it requires
experienced pathologists using highly specialized equipment to
distinguish them in clinical practice. But the diagnosis is
crucial, he said, because the two types of leukemia have different
prognoses and need to be treated differently.
</P>
<P>
   The report in journal Science, authored by Golub, Eric S.
Lander, also of the Whitehead, and a number of other scientists, is
the first success in what cancer scientists believe will be a new
approach to diagnosing and treating cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a window into the future in terms of getting at the
fundamental genetic abnormalities (in cancer cells) and also being
able to intelligently classify cancers,'' said Dr. Jerome Groopman,
chief of experimental medicine at Beth-Israel Deaconess Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In traditional cancer diagnoses, specialists take samples of a
tumor from the patient and study them under the microscope, looking
for characteristic abnormalities in the way cells look or the way
they absorb chemical stains. Sometimes the differences are hard to
identify and the pathologist is required to make a judgment call.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the research was to find out if cancer cells could
be differentiated entirely by genetic differences, which would be
an objective, systematic approach in which the gene chips and
computer analyses would give an answer that didn't depend on human
judgment. Moreover, said Golub, the technique could also be used to
make distinctions that haven't yet been found between some types of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Once the differences in gene activity have been discovered,
Golub said, a DNA chip that looks just for those differences can be
used as a test for varying cancer types.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the National Cancer Institute, using techniques
devised in the Human Genome Project for mapping and deciphering all
the 100,000 or human genes, have discovered thousands of genes that
are expressed _ that is, are active _ in cancer cells. Dr. Richard
Klausner, director of the NCI, spoke recently about the value of
classifying cancers by their genetic patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classifying them is incredibly important,'' he said. ``You
need to have a meaningful diagnostic classification to have
meaningful therapy.'' For example, said Klausner, a cancer known as
diffuse large-cell lymphoma is currently being studied to determine
whether it is one, two, or more different diseases. Genetic
patterns, it is hoped, will help find the answer, making it
possible to say which patients will respond well to which drugs,
which patients will go into remission and be cured, and which will
relapse.

   Most auto manufacturers reacted coolly to the advisory from the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, saying side air
bags used in conjunction with age-appropriate restraints
significantly enhance safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although BMW already allows customers to tell dealers whether
they want rear seat air bags activated, a Mercedes spokesman said
the company has no plans to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it's in the consumer's best interests,'' said
Stuart Schorr, a Mercedes spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   About 7,500 people in the United States each year die from
side-impact crashes and a growing number of auto manufacturers are
installing side air bags as standard or optional equipment to
provide greater safety.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no deaths or serious injuries attributed to side
air bags. By contrast, front air bags have been blamed for at least
145 deaths since 1990. In those cases, the impact of the bag
inflating caused serious injuries. Most of the victims were
children and short people, many of whom were not wearing seat
belts.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said more than 2.4 million vehicles with
front-seat side air bags are in use, but fewer than 20,000 have
rear-seat air bags. Most manufacturers are installing front-seat
side air bags, but only Mercedes, Audi, BMW, and Rolls Royce are
putting them in the rear seat.
</P>
<P>
   In its consumer advisory, the traffic safety administration
warned that side air bags can kill or seriously injure children
whose head, neck, or chest are in close proximity to the air bag at
the time of deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Since children under 12 are supposed to be traveling in rear
seats at all times, the advisory urged car manufacturers to
deactivate rear side air bags before shipping vehicles to dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Purchasers who want such air bags activated, after being
advised of the potential risk to out-of-position children, should
be able to have them switched on by their dealers,'' the advisory
said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also urged manufacturers to allow owners of vehicles
with rear side air bags to bring them back to dealers to have them
deactivated if the vehicle is likely to be carrying children.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory noted that children under 12 should always sit in
the rear seat and use age-appropriate restraints, but manufacturers
and insurance industry officials said the warning failed to point
out the benefits of side air bags used in conjunction with seat
belts and child seats.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in all the crash tests cited by the agency the dummies
representing children were not wearing seat belts or sitting in a
child safety seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think what the agency has done today is to needlessly scare
people,'' said Julie Rochman, a spokesman for the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged a child lying on the rear seat with his head
near the door or kneeling with his chest against the door would be
in danger if the side air bag deployed. But she said a child in
those positions would be at far greater risk if the car were hit by
another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Said Schorr of Mercedes: ``For properly restrained children,
side air bags are a great safety device that will save lives.'' He
said Mercedes plans to contact owners of its vehicles shortly to
review the benefits of side air bags used appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   A BMW spokesman said the company decided to deactivate rear-seat
air bags to give consumers a chance to review the pros and cons.

TWO MORE JAPANESE BANKS PLAN TO MERGE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese banking industry is consolidating at an
unexpectedly quick pace with implications that reach far beyond the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The news Thursday that Sumitomo Bank, widely regarded as one of
Japan's stronger banks, and Sakura Bank, one of the weaker of the
big banks, are forming an alliance that will lead to a merger in
two years came just a week after the Asahi Bank and the Tokai Bank
accelerated plans to combine.
</P>
<P>
   A Sumitomo-Sakura merger would create a bank with about $864
billion in assets and a roster of some of the most powerful
corporate clients in Japan, such as NEC Corp. and the Matsushita
Industrial Electric Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It would rank third in size only to the pending combination of
competitors Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Fuji Bank Ltd. and
Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd., which would have about $1.3 trillion
in assets, and the current leader, Deutsche Bank AG of Germany,
which has about $866 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Banking industry analysts said that a combined Sumitomo-Sakura
would be a strong force in Japanese retail banking and much better
equipped to invest in information-technology to reduce costs and
provide online banking and trading services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We firmly believe that the integration of Sakura and Sumitomo,
expected by autumn 2000, will mark the birth of Japan's future star
mega bank,'' James Fiorillo, a senior banking analyst at ING
Barings in Tokyo wrote in a report to investors.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned, however, the speed of consolidation taking place
here might mean that some deals come apart and that merged banks
will probably overestimate the savings and profits they can
achieve.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Thursday evening, executives of Sumitomo
and Sakura said intensified competition in the global banking
business, greater choice for consumers and the investment required
for up-to-date information technology were among the reasons behind
their decision to merge.
</P>
<P>
   They promised to eliminate a total of 6,300 jobs, close 151
domestic and 32 international branches and clear their books of
problem loans by the time they combine. The merged bank's core
business will be consumer and middle-market banking, and it will
retain connections to major corporations and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   The deal means that since the Japanese financial system slipped
into crisis with the failure of the Hokkaido Takushoku Bank in
November 1997, the number of big banks has begun to dwindle from 20
to 15 _ and of the remaining banks, two have been nationalized by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not imagined that it would progress in such a quick
manner as this,'' said Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who, in
the midst of the furor over Hokkaido's demise, had declared that
the 19 remaining big banks were the right number for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does that signal that the far-reaching overhaul of the
banking system that the government promised when it plowed $7.5
trillion yen in public money into the major banks is occurring, it
also suggests more wide-reaching reorganization is ahead for the
corporations that are their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implications for industrial Japan are huge,'' said Kathy
Matsui, chief strategist at Goldman Sachs (Japan) Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the banks that are joining forces share customers and
hold the same stocks in their equity portfolios. As a combined
entity, they will have more leverage and incentive to push their
clients to reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think banks will start pulling credit lines or rush to
sell their cross-shareholdings,'' said Ms. Matsui, referring to the
practice in which banks hold shares in their borrowers. ``But if
their aim in creating these mega-banks is better profitability and
competitiveness, that should lead to better credit allocation and a
more pro-active management of their investment portfolios.''
</P>
<P>
   Takashi Imai, chairman of Nippon Steel and the head of Japan's
business lobby, the Keidanren, recently said one reason the steel
industry here has not consolidated was the diversity of primary
banking relationships among steelmakers. As banks merge, more
companies will share the same bankers, making it easier to
negotiate debt restructuring and the like.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, merged banks will suddenly find themselves holding
much bigger stakes in faltering companies, increasing the pressure
on them to either reduce their exposure or become more actively
involved in promoting restructuring. After Dai-Ichi Kangyo, the
Industrial Bank of Japan and Fuji Bank complete their merger, for
example, they will hold 12.4 percent of NSK Ltd., a vast
ball-bearing and machine parts manufacturer, and 10.5 percent of
Nissan Motor Co., neither of them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   In their statement, Sakura and Sumitomo said they would reduce
their cross-shareholdings with customers ``as much as possible,''
adding, however, that they would seek customers' approval first.
</P>
<P>
   The power of multi-bank pressure can be seen in the partnership
between Nissan and Renault SA, the French car maker that acquired a
36.8 percent stake in its Japanese rival earlier this year.
Although that deal preceded the three-way bank merger deal, Fuji
and the Industrial Bank jointly prodded Nissan to seek capital from
a foreign partner, saying they could offer it no more credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relationship between banks and the corporate sector should
change rapidly'' as a result of bank mergers, said Setsuko Akiba, a
banking analyst at Deutsche Securities in Tokyo. ``The banks will
think about how to make profits from each client, and the clients
will consider which banks can provide the most value-added
services.''
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a Sakura-Sumitomo tie was greeted with surprise partly
because it would cross the boundaries of two of Japan's big
industrial clusters, or keiretsu, which is highly unusual.
Sumitomo, with its roots in Osaka, is the main bank for the
Sumitomo group of companies, which include NEC and Sumitomo
Chemical, while Sakura Bank, based in Tokyo, is the main bank for
companies like Toshiba and Toyota, affiliated with the Mitsui
group.

&HT;        TEXAS SPACEPORT FACES LEGISLATIVE HURDLES
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Alex Canizares  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 -- The Texas congressional delegation sent a
letter Thursday urging a space launch company to choose south Texas
as a site for a spaceport. But obstacles remain before the Texans'
dream of being the home of spaceport for reusable launch vehicles
becomes a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas delegation wishes to express to you our desire that
the site for the Spaceport be in Texas,'' read a letter to Steve
Wurst, president of Space Access, a space launch company that is
narrowing its decision of where to construct a runway and hangar
for its shuttles to two sites in South Texas, at least one in
Florida, and one in California.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, was one of the 23
lawmakers to sign the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Valley officials hope the site will boost the Valley's economy
by hiring employees and bringing in tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But hurdles remain before Space Access makes a decision about
where -- or whether at all -- to build a spaceport.
</P>
<P>
   One obstacle involves federal paperwork, which entails
environmental inspections of the two Texas sites, one in Brazoria
County and the other between Corpus Christi and the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to ensure that the [Federal Aviation Administration]
licenses aren't a problem, `` said Tom Moser, spokesman for the
Texas Aerospace Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Texas plans to use the site for reusable launch vehicles, which
would go to space and return needing only refueling. Since there
has never been a reusable launch, FAA must establish rules to
license their launch. The FAA is finalizing the rules, which will
then need approval by the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Aerospace commission has not submitted an application
for a licence, but has made a ``compelling enough'' business offer
to the FAA, Moser said, by claiming it has adequate weather,
infrastructure, and a location near water.
</P>
<P>
   Another obstacle to a port being built at all is that launch
companies may not be able to afford it unless Congress approves
space launch legislation that offers loan gaurantees to the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, introduced by Sen. John Breaux, D-La., would offer
$500 million of govnernment-backed loans to the commercial space
launch industry. Because space launches are risky, investors are
wary of giving money to launch companies. The bill would provide
government backing that could trigger $5 billion in loans,
according to Breaux.
</P>
<P>
   Without government backing, the companies may struggle to raise
enough capital to build the site, Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Breaux bill sends a signal to the private sector that the
government wants them to do this,'' Moser said. If the bill fails,
``companies won't be able to get financing to build the vehicle, so
we wouldn't need the spaceport.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, to keep [the site] on the timeline that these
companies have created, this bill is very important,'' said Shirley
Clowers of the Harlingen Chamber of Commerce, which has been trying
to garner support for the project for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's fate is unclear. Although some Senators have voiced
support for it, the measure failed to gain support in Congress last
year, and some small companies have opposed it on the grounds that
it will only help larger companies who don't need loan gaurantees.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Space Access, along with other launch vehicle companies,
asked Congress this week to approve the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Space Access has yet to build its resuable, 747-size space
shuttle, which it wants to launch from the spaceport.

CLINTON ACCUSES GOP OF `RECKLESS PARTISANSHIP' IN WAKE OF TREATY'S
DEFEAT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton denounced congressional
Republicans on Thursday for ``reckless partisanship'' after the
Senate rejected a nuclear test ban treaty and as the House attempts
to force him to sign budget bills he opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic
White House appear at a new low just as another deadline looms for
a government shutdown next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton held an hourlong news conference in the East Room just a
day after the Senate handed him the biggest foreign policy defeat
of his presidency _ and amid some signs that political retribution
has been simmering since Clinton's impeachment played a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``In recent days, members of the congressional majority have
displayed a reckless partisanship. It threatens America's economic
well-being and now our national security,'' Clinton said in his
opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton accused ``hard-line Republicans'' of acting
``irresponsibly'' in forcing a vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty rather than allowing it to be withdrawn. And, he accused
Republicans of turning to isolationism at a time when the United
States is the lone superpower.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was partisan politics of the worst kind because it was so
blatant and because of the risks it poses to the safety of the
American people and the world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., denied politics was
afoot. ``I reject any suggestion of reckless partisanship. If there
is any partisanship, it's on the other side,'' he said. Lott said
he was proud of the vote to defeat the treaty, which he called a
danger to the nation's security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to accept any responsibility for the treaty's
defeat, even though the White House and Democrats demanded Senate
action at a time they lacked the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he assumed there would be hearings that would allow
him to address opponents concerns for a verifiable test ban.
Instead, Lott gave Democrats eight days to make their case and
allowed the administration no chance to offer safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have reached an all-time low in relations between the
executive and legislative branches. You'd probably have to go back
to 1974 in the dark hours of the Nixon administration to find
something comparable,'' said Marshall Whitman, a government expert
with the conservative Heritage Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A House Republican leadership aide said GOP members find Clinton
untrustworthy, a fallout not just of the impeachment of Clinton
sparked by accusations of perjury stemming from his affair with
Monica Lewinsky but from years of double-talk from the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will look you in the face and lie and that hinders any sort
of true negotiations,'' the aide said. ``There's no trust there.''
</P>
<P>
   But references to the sex scandal came from Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and
leader of the treaty opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing a letter supporting the treaty from British Prime
Minister Tony Blair, Helms said he could just imagine Clinton
asking Blair for the letter and, ``I know Tony said `oh yes, I'll
do that; I'll do that and give Monica my regards.''' Helms edited
that remark out of the Congressional Record.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in debate, Helms answered a question by saying, ``It
depends on what your definition of `is,' is,'' a reference to
Clinton's infamous equivocation before the grand jury. The Senate,
along a largely party line vote in February, acquitted Clinton of
impeachment charges brought by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who never mentioned Helms by name, said personal
attacks against him only were an indication of the weakness of the
treaty opponents arguments. ``They think that maybe they can
deflect the analysis of their vote and their argument by attacking
their opponent,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In a tit-for-tat response, Lott accused Clinton of making
partisan remarks because the president had a weak argument in favor
of the treaty. Sen. Joe Lieberman, a Connecticut Democrat hoping to
fashion a bipartisan resurrection of the treaty, said, ``There is
plenty of blame to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also looked toward next Thursday when a temporary
spending measure expires at midnight, chastising the House
Republicans for ``lurching from one unworkable idea to the next''
while time runs out.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would veto any measure that cuts spending
across-the-board by 1 percent to 3 percent as House Republicans now
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unconscionable to think that America at its moment
of greatest prosperity, when we've got our first surplus in 30
years, is out there cutting education and several other areas. So
yes, I would (veto the bill),'' Clinton said. He also blasted
Congress for failing to provide money for U.S. obligations in the
Middle East peace process or to help dismantle Russian nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legitimate differences of opinion, but we can put an
end to the reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,''
Clinton said. ``We can work for a season of progress, not a winter
of politics. And I am committed to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee, said, ``For a president who took office hoping to bring
America together to tackle our country's toughest problems, it's
sad that his (Clinton's) final chapter has been reduced to tax
hikes and partisan attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, where conservatives hold a stronger sway,
have often been at odds with Clinton, especially over budget
issues.
</P>
<P>
   They intend to vote next week on the tax hike package that
Clinton proposed in January as part of his budget to pay for
spending increases in education and other areas. The stand-alone
tax hike measure will fail and Democrats contend it is an attempt
to embarrass them and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like another stunt, another gimmick, another effort
at political advantage rather than trying to sit down and figure
out a budget that people can agree to,'' said House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo. ``We're sitting here wasting time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president chided House Republicans for not wanting to raise
taxes on tobacco companies as a way to curtail teen smoking. ``You
know, they don't have to agree to raise it as much as I proposed,
but it would help to sit down and negotiate that,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations any time soon seem unlikely.

INDONESIA ENTERS FINAL DAYS BEFORE ASSEMBLY SELECTS A PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Indonesia entered the final and most
intense days of its political transition Thursday with
demonstrators and security forces battling in the streets as
President B.J. Habibie pleaded with an electoral assembly to choose
him for a full five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the president's ``accountability speech'' in
which Habibie described what he saw as his accomplishments _ civil
rights and openness, a degree of economic stability and the
political transition itself _ since the forced resignation of his
autocratic predecessor, Suharto, 17 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   What was a ceremonial routine during Suharto's 32 years in power
is now a crucial moment for Habibie, whose political stature has
been slipping. For the first time, there is the possibility that,
in the next two days, the electoral assembly could reject an
accountability speech, dooming Habibie's hopes for election.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday the 700-member assembly is to choose the next
president in what has become an electoral cliffhanger between
Habibie, his chief challenger, Megawati Sukarnoputri, and a third
candidate, Abdurrahman Wahid, a popular Muslim leader.
</P>
<P>
   At stake, in the minds of most Indonesians, is something more
than personalities or even policies: it is the future of the
movement for reforms in the post-Suharto era.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the candidates may say or do, Habibie, a protege of
Suharto, is seen as representing the old order and Mrs. Megawati,
the daughter of Indonesia's founding president, Sukarno, carries
the nation's hopes for change.
</P>
<P>
   Resting quietly at home after a recent stroke, Suharto remains
the nation's political touchstone. Mrs. Megawati's popularity grows
out of her opposition to him. Habibie's greatest liability is his
personal and political closeness to him.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the president defied one of the main demands of
reformers, refusing to proceed with an investigation into charges
of corruption by Suharto. That action drew angry chants at protests
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, in the first corruption case brought against
Suharto or his family, a judge acquitted one of his sons, Hutomo
Mandala Putra, who had been accused of bilking the government in a
land deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the witnesses could prove the accused had directly or
indirectly caused a loss to the country,'' said the judge,
Soenarto.
</P>
<P>
   As Habibie spoke Thursday evening, all the forces that came
together in May 1998 to force the resignation of Suharto were
gathered once again at the nation's political center, the
Parliament Building. It was here that the spectacle of thousands of
student demonstrators and the defection of key political supporters
helped force Suharto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the student demonstrators chanted and waved
banners opposing Habibie as an apostle of Suharto's discredited
regime. They threw rocks and gasoline bombs and charged at massed
ranks of soldiers and riot policemen with their samurai-style
helmets and tall plastic shields.
</P>
<P>
   The security forces fired tear gas, water cannon and plastic
bullets in a replay of scenes that have become as integral a part
of Indonesia's political process as the assembly meeting that
continued at its measured pace inside the Parliament Building.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds represented Mrs. Megawati's political strength: a
personal popularity that no other candidate comes close to
rivaling. The tumult in the streets outside was a reminder to the
parliamentary delegates of the broad unrest that many people here
warn will erupt if Mrs. Megawati is denied the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``A re-election of Habibie is not going to be definitive; people
are not going to take this lying down,'' said James C. Clad, a
professor of Southeast Asian Studies at Georgetown University. ``It
could move us into a new period of really endemic civil
disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   In the general election in June, Mrs. Megawati's party won
nearly 34 percent of the votes in a raucous field crowded with
dozens of newly formed parties. Habibie's party, which had been the
vehicle for Suharto's repeated and manipulated re-elections,
finished second with 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The June election involved just 462 of the 700 seats in the
partly appointed electoral assembly that is now meeting. Mrs.
Megawati's victory gave her just 153 of these seats.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the months of power plays and payoffs that have intensified
since the assembly convened at the start of this month, Habibie's
party has the advantage of long political experience and huge sums
of money.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many foreign and Indonesian analysts have been
aghast at the passivity and sense of entitlement of Mrs. Megawati
and her party in this period of hard bargaining. Accounts abound of
her refusing to meet with political rivals or canceling meetings at
the last moment.
</P>
<P>
   After her plurality in the first contested election in Indonesia
since the mid-1950s, the presidency seemed to be hers to lose. And
indeed, she has been losing ground since then, refusing to make
deals as the political ground shifts rapidly around her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's so aloof! She's not a politician,'' exclaimed Jusuf
Wanandi, who heads a private policy institute, the Center for
Strategic and International Studies. ``It's a good thing that she's
now scared and her people are now scared. Finally they are willing
to compromise, willing to entertain anybody that could help her.''
</P>
<P>
   As the presidential vote approaches, alignments have become
increasingly fragmented and fluid. The electoral process today is
as chaotic and unpredictable as it was packaged and stultifying for
decades under Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   A key bloc of 38 votes or more is held by the military, and its
chief, Gen. Wiranto, is being courted by Habibie with an invitation
this week to be his vice president. A number of analysts say that
the military would feel comfortable with either Habibie or Mrs.
Megawati and that it is likely to wait to align itself with
whichever party seems likely to win.
</P>
<P>
   Abdurrahman Wahid, the Muslim leader, whose party finished third
in the June vote, was originally aligned with Mrs. Megawati, then
broke away to pursue his own candidacy. He is not seen as a strong
candidate on his own, but his endorsement and the votes of his
supporters are considered crucial for Mrs. Megawati to gain a
majority.
</P>
<P>
   Another Muslim leader, Amien Rais, did poorly in June but
remains a key political figure and was chosen last week to head the
electoral assembly. Even more than Mrs. Megawati, he is a reformer
at heart. In the vacuum of her inactivity he has formed a loose
coalition that could also be crucial to her if he chooses to
support her.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a faction of Habibie's party has vigorously
opposed his candidacy for months and could throw its support to
Mrs. Megawati. One indication of the fluidity of this moment, less
than a week before the vote, is that even in this well-defined bloc
the estimates of delegates who might break away range from 20 to 40
to 60.

SMALL SCHOOL   CLOSES IN ON A BIG RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The numbers indicate greatness: eight undefeated seasons, four
national championships, and a 145-16-3 record in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that the level of competition (Division 3)
mitigates those impressive numbers to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Horsefeathers.
</P>
<P>
   Winning is winning, and when you have 47 consecutive victories,
as tiny Mount Union has over the past four seasons, you deserve all
the accolades you receive.
</P>
<P>
   The feel-good story to date of this college football season
should be in Alliance, Ohio, Saturday afternoon as the Purple
Raiders go after a record 48 consecutive victories when they meet
Otterbein.
</P>
<P>
   By winning _ and Mount Union is an overwhelming favorite _ the
Purple Raiders would break a tie with Oklahoma, which set the
current NCAA record for consecutive wins in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Union coach Larry Kehres, who holds the all-time mark for
winning percentage (.811) among college football coaches (ahead of
No. 2 Knute Rockne and No. 3 Frank Leahy), understands the apples
and oranges theory concerning the streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mount Union can't break Oklahoma's winning streak because they
are Divison 1 and we're Division 3,'' says Kehres. ``If you were a
longtime Oklahoma person and heard some little school called Mount
Union is breaking your record, you'd go, `What are you talking
about?' I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   As well he should. But what Mount Union has accomplished also
deserves recognition and respect.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Union has not lost a game since a 20-17 defeat to
Wisconsin-LaCrosse in the semifinals of the 1995 Divison 3
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Which means: no bad games, no let downs, no flat games. The team
has not lost a game in almost four seasons, not four weeks or four
months.
</P>
<P>
   And Kehres has done this going through a couple of recruiting
classes. It wasn't like he brought in a superstar class that kicked
butt for a few years and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Those classes are gone, and Mount Union is still winning, still
adding to the streak.
</P>
<P>
   At times, the Purple Raiders have been lucky _ they survived a
57-51 triple-overtime battle against John Carroll two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma may have run up its winning streak from 1954 to '56
against tougher competition, but that competition is relative.
Divison 3 football is not Division 1. There are no athletic
scholarships and the athletes are less-skilled, but Mount Union has
done it on a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   You can argue the merits of the achievement all you want and
talk about how Oklahoma had to beat tougher competition. And that
may all be true.
</P>
<P>
   But the feat of winning 48 games in succession should not, must
not, be denied.
</P>
<P>
   In this era, when negative stories get more attention than
positive ones, Mount Union deserves the 15 minutes of national fame
it has received this week and will receive Saturday if it breaks
the record.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mum's the word in Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State coach Joe Paterno has shut down the media's access to
his players this week in preparation for the Ohio State game,
barring all but three players from speaking.
</P>
<P>
   His argument is that the players are overwhelmed, not just by
the media, but by fans and autograph hounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need a little time to themselves,'' said Paterno.
``I think this thing has gotten a little bit ridiculous, the amount
of time they have to give up to it. Someone complained to me that
they can't get things done, that there are a lot of things going
on. You keep forgetting that they are college students. You're the
first people that would crucify them if they don't go to class or
they flunk out of school or something happens to them. I've got to
protect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine, Joe. Have it your way. But life is not just games on
Saturday afternoon. It's dealing with adversity, it's dealing with
pressures. It's what going to college is all about.
</P>
<P>
   By shutting down access, Paterno is making the game more
important than it is, saying this is a different week than any
other. If the routine is broken, the players might be more uptight
than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State coach John Cooper has made that mistake numerous
times before Buckeye games with Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State-Penn State is a big game, but there will be bigger
ones. There will be bigger things in the players' lives in the
future, far more than a simple game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to the media doesn't require a lot of time or effort. An
hour a week is enough in most instances. A few innocuous quotes,
and life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of life. Paterno, as much as anyone, should know that.
</P>
<P>
   Deal with it and move on. Don't make it bigger or more important
than it should be by breaking the routine.
</P>
<P>
   Paterno has chosen not to do that. If Penn State loses to Ohio
State, the finger will be pointed in a lot of directions, but not
at the media.
</P>
<P>
   A Pitt-fall for BC?
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Temple last Saturday exposed Boston College's
weaknesses and magnified the challenge the team now faces. At 4-1
(instead of 5-0), the Eagles will have to pull off a few upsets to
become bowl-eligible with six wins.
</P>
<P>
   The game against Pittsburgh Saturday looks like a tossup, with
the Eagles holding the home-field edge.
</P>
<P>
   After that, there are no guarantees. The Eagles could very well
lose all their remaining games, which would put another dark cloud
over the program at The Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty is the health of starting quarterback
Tim Hasselbeck, who injured his right shoulder in the 24-14 loss to
Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom O'Brien's dilemma is clear. Hasselbeck might be
healthy enough to play, but also fragile enough that one hit could
sideline him for several weeks or the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   What should O'Brien do?
</P>
<P>
   He could sit Hasselbeck for a week to get him healthy and play
Brian St. Pierre instead. If he does that and St. Pierre has a
strong game to help beat Pittsburgh, O'Brien's got a quarterback
dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   All of that makes Saturday's game the biggest of the season for
BC, one that could determine the course of the season and the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Either the Eagles move on and build, or they fall back into what
could be another deadly 4-7 season.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big East feast
</P>
<P>
   The Big East finally has a national marquee game. Syracuse at
Virginia Tech has drawn the ESPN Game Day traveling set to
Blacksburg, Va. It will be the first time a Big East game has been
covered by the network's top crew . . . With Florida State's Peter
Warrick sitting out another game because of legal problems, the
quest for the Heisman Trophy for the wide receiver becomes more
difficult. The character issue involved in committing what was a
petty crime (paying less than 10 percent for more than $400 worth
of merchandise) is not as important to many voters as simply not
playing in games . . . The first BCS ratings, which will determine
the teams in the Sugar Bowl Jan. 4, come out next week. Right now,
Florida State and Nebraska are 1-2, which could be a problem for
undefeated Virginia Tech and Penn State if everyone runs the table.

CLINTON THREATENS TO VETO ACROSS-THE-BUDGET CUTS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., Texas)   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Thursday that if Republicans
in Congress pressed ahead with their latest plan for meeting budget
targets _ an across-the-board cut in spending on all government
programs _ he would veto the measure.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, the president accused Republicans of
``lurching from one unworkable idea to the next'' and urged them to
``put an end to reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and
gamesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, called
his own news conference immediately following the president's and
responded, ``If there is any partisanship, it's on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott insisted that he and his allies in the House of
Representatives had not made a final decision on whether to seek
spending reductions in all programs, but he said: ``If the choice
comes down to protecting Social Security or cutting across the
board just a little nick off of every program, I believe the
American people would support that. I would.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if he wants to veto it because of that reason, I guess he
can, but I don't think that would be the responsible thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On the budget, the president and the Republican leaders in
Congress are like two feral animals circling each other, working
for a position that will be advantageous when the inevitable clash
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the spending bills to finance the various Departments
and agencies in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 have still not
been enacted. Government offices have remained open under temporary
legislation extending their spending authority, but that measure
expires Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Congress will almost certainly agree next week
to another extension, but sooner or later concessions will have to
be made by one side, the other or both. Clinton has generally
prevailed politically in such battles in recent years, and
Republicans are determined not to let that happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Senate gave final legislative approval to the
Defense Department's spending bill, and the House approved a final
version of a measure for veterans, housing and other programs. With
most of the controversies bypassed, the president is likely to sign
them.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also passed a funding measure for the District of
Columbia that is so similar to one the president vetoed last month
that it is clearly ripe for another veto.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton would probably veto the Interior
Department's spending bill on the ground that provisions to help
oil and mining companies would be detrimental to the environment.
In a speech on Wednesday, Clinton said: ``If the Interior bill
lands on my desk looking like it does now, I will give it a good
environmental response. I will send it straight back to the
recycling bin.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest stumbling block is the largest of all spending
bills, the one for the Departments of Labor, Education and Health
and Human Services. Republican leaders have not yet assembled a
measure that can attain a majority in Congress, much less pass
Presidential muster.
</P>
<P>
   To meet their self-imposed goals of not raising taxes and not
spending any money raised by Social Security taxes above what is
needed for Social Security benefits, Republicans have floated and
then discarded several options.
</P>
<P>
   One would have made bookkeeping adjustments so that a good deal
of spending was shuffled into the next fiscal year. Another would
have delayed payments of tax credits to low-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest idea is the across-the-board spending reduction in
all government programs. Estimates of how large the cuts would be
have ranged from 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent. Lott Thursday called
the plan ``a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was asked at his news conference whether he would veto
such a measure. He replied: ``I would have no choice. It would be
unconscionable to think that America at its moment of greatest
prosperity, when we've got our first surplus in 30 years, is out
there cutting education and several other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then renewed his proposal for meeting the spending needs
by raising the tax on cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, accused the
president of wanting to raise taxes on the poor. He cited studies
showing that 55 percent of tobacco taxes are paid by people making
less than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Thursday they might try to embarrass the
president and Democrats in the House by calling for an up or down
vote next week on the entire $90 billion in tax increases in the
president's budget, including the tobacco tax. The taxes are sure
to be rejected.

GORE AIRS ADS CRITICAL OF SENATE'S REJECTION TO RATIFY TREATY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, sensing a political
opportunity in the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban
treaty, quickly taped campaign commercials denouncing the vote and
rushed them on to the air Thursday as the first television ads of
his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the
American people,'' Gore says in the 60-second ad. He called on
voters for ``your mandate'' to resubmit the treaty if he is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vice president said he had worked on arms control
for 20 years and would send the pact back to the Senate, ``because
unless we get this one right nothing else matters.'' In other
appearances, Gore said that resubmission would be the first act of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described the commercials, paid for by the Gore 2000
campaign, as he flew back to Washington from a three-day campaign
tour in the West. He had made criticism of the Senate action a key
piece of public appearances as soon as the vote occurred Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quick move by Gore to seize on the Senate vote was also
intended to show that the vice president had taken personal charge
of his troubled political operation. Gore said that after the
Senate vote he called his political team and announced his
intention to tape the ads. Media adviser Carter Eskew, working from
Washington, assembled a video team that completed taping the
commercial near midnight Wednesday in a hotel suite in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stressed that the ad was a largely personal effort and gave
reporters aboard Air Force Two a copy of the final script with his
heavy editing. Gore said he told President Clinton about the ads in
a telephone call early Thursday and that the response was
``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Senate action allows Gore to campaign on arms
control, an issue he knows well, he expressed sorrow that the
matter had become available for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy for the country that has to be rectified,''
Gore said on Air Force Two. ``Nothing would make me happier than to
not have this issue on the table by virtue of the Senate having
ratified the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the commercials would run nationally but with a
concentration of airings in early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire.
Beyond those states, an aide said, the heaviest purchase of
broadcast time was apparently on CNN nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ads are the first in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, magazine publisher Steve Forbes, whose
campaign is largely self-financed, has been on and off the air
several times with ads about himself and his position on several
issues. Forbes is expected soon to launch ads aimed at Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the GOP front-runner, and Bush's campaign is
apparently ready to respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore ad came as a new poll showed Gore lagging farther
behind Bradley in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential
primary. A Zogby International survey found that among likely
Democratic voters in the Granite State, Bradley led Gore 45 percent
to 36.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken Friday through Sunday, found that in
general-election matchups among all New Hampshire voters, Bradley
led Bush 47.6 percent to 40.8 percent, while Gore trailed Bush 49.8
percent to 39.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rhetorical tone in the ad is less heated than his initial
reaction to the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement just minutes after the Senate acted, Gore called
rejection of the treaty ``breathtakingly irresponsible'' and ``one
of the most dangerous votes ever cast in the Senate. ... I'm angry
about it.'' He repeated similar sentiments later Wednesday to a
machinists union rally and a fund-raising dinner in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also does not mention, as Gore did in the speeches, that
Gov. Bush had voiced opposition to the pact, formally known as the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued a statement early Thursday that said: ``The
president failed to make the case that this treaty was in America's
best interests. I support a continued moratorium on nuclear testing
and oppose the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the treaty was not verifiable. He said it would have
weakened the United States while allowing ``rogue'' nations, such
as Iraq and North Korea, to test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If elected president, I will be committed to stopping
proliferation, but this flawed treaty was not the way to further
the cause of peace in the world,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Gore's statements, Bush spokesman Mindy Tucker said,
``This issue should not be a political question. It's a matter of
national security. Governor Bush's position on this is based on his
view of this as an issue of national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore does point out in the ad that ``the last Republican
president'' _ Bush's father _ ``stopped all U.S. testing'' and that
the treaty was supported by chairmen of the military Joint Chiefs
of Staff from the Bush administration as well as those of
Presidents Clinton, Reagan and Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since President Kennedy began the effort almost 40 years ago,
Democrats and Republicans have made nuclear arms control a national
priority,'' Clinton says in the ad. ``But now the Republican Senate
has rejected the nuclear test ban treaty signed by 154 nations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the
American people. So why don't we do something about it?'' Gore
says. ``I believe campaigns should be about the future, and there's
no more important challenge than stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons. I ask for your support and your mandate, if elected
president, to send this treaty back to the Senate with your demand
that they ratify it. ... If you agree, we can change this mistake
and once again lead the world toward peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore delivered a similar message after arriving in the capital
to the Democratic Leadership Council, a group of party centrists
which he helped form in the mid-1980s and whose support is critical
to his White House campaign.

GORE AIRS ADS CRITICAL OF SENATE'S REJECTION OF NUCLEAR TEST BAN
TREATY 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore, sensing a political
opportunity in the Senate's rejection of the nuclear test ban
treaty, quickly taped campaign commercials denouncing the vote and
rushed them on to the air Thursday as the first television ads of
his White House bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the
American people,'' Gore says in the 60-second ad. He called on
voters for ``your mandate'' to resubmit the treaty if he is elected
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic vice president said he had worked on arms control
for 20 years and would send the pact back to the Senate, ``because
unless we get this one right nothing else matters.'' In other
appearances, Gore said that resubmission would be the first act of
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Gore described the commercials, paid for by the Gore 2000
campaign, as he flew back to Washington from a three-day campaign
tour in the West. He had made criticism of the Senate action a key
piece of public appearances as soon as the vote occurred Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The quick move by Gore to seize on the Senate vote was also
intended to show that the vice president had taken personal charge
of his troubled political operation. Gore said that after the
Senate vote he called his political team and announced his
intention to tape the ads. Media adviser Carter Eskew, working from
Washington, assembled a video team that completed taping the
commercial near midnight Wednesday in a hotel suite in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Gore stressed that the ad was a largely personal effort and gave
reporters aboard Air Force Two a copy of the final script with his
heavy editing. Gore said he told President Clinton about the ads in
a telephone call early Thursday and that the response was
``positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Senate action allows Gore to campaign on arms
control, an issue he knows well, he expressed sorrow that the
matter had become available for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tragedy for the country that has to be rectified,''
Gore said on Air Force Two. ``Nothing would make me happier than to
not have this issue on the table by virtue of the Senate having
ratified the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the commercials would run nationally but with a
concentration of airings in early-voting Iowa and New Hampshire.
Beyond those states, an aide said, the heaviest purchase of
broadcast time was apparently on CNN nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's ads are the first in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
   In the Republican race, magazine publisher Steve Forbes, whose
campaign is largely self-financed, has been on and off the air
several times with ads about himself and his position on several
issues. Forbes is expected soon to launch ads aimed at Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, the GOP front-runner, and Bush's campaign is
apparently ready to respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore ad came as a new poll showed Gore lagging farther
behind Bradley in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential
primary. A Zogby International survey found that among likely
Democratic voters in the Granite State, Bradley led Gore 45 percent
to 36.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken Friday through Sunday, found that in
general-election matchups among all New Hampshire voters, Bradley
led Bush 47.6 percent to 40.8 percent, while Gore trailed Bush 49.8
percent to 39.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rhetorical tone in the ad is less heated than his initial
reaction to the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement just minutes after the Senate acted, Gore called
rejection of the treaty ``breathtakingly irresponsible'' and ``one
of the most dangerous votes ever cast in the Senate. ... I'm angry
about it.'' He repeated similar sentiments later Wednesday to a
machinists union rally and a fund-raising dinner in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also does not mention, as Gore did in the speeches, that
Gov. Bush had voiced opposition to the pact, formally known as the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush issued a statement early Thursday that said: ``The
president failed to make the case that this treaty was in America's
best interests. I support a continued moratorium on nuclear testing
and oppose the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said the treaty was not verifiable. He said it would have
weakened the United States while allowing ``rogue'' nations, such
as Iraq and North Korea, to test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If elected president, I will be committed to stopping
proliferation, but this flawed treaty was not the way to further
the cause of peace in the world,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Gore's statements, Bush spokesman Mindy Tucker said,
``This issue should not be a political question. It's a matter of
national security. Governor Bush's position on this is based on his
view of this as an issue of national security.''

president'' _ Bush's father _ ``stopped all U.S. testing'' and that
the treaty was supported by chairmen of the military Joint Chiefs
of Staff from the Bush administration as well as those of

 &HT;    Officials to mark GE unit's opening
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A fast-growing General Electric Co. business today
officially opens a high-tech customer service center in Cobb County
that will monitor a global network of electric power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The center moved last year from Schenectady, N.Y., to Wildwood
Office Park. It has grown from 450 employees to 1,000 to keep pace
with the booming demand for natural gas-fired turbines used at such
plants.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is operated by GE Energy Services, a $3.5
billion-a-year GE unit based in Atlanta. The offices first opened
in June 1998, but the company is staging a ceremonial headquarters
opening today with top executives attending. Gov. Roy Barnes is
also scheduled to appear.
</P>
<P>
   About 650 employees have been recruited locally, said GE
spokeswoman Jan Smith. The rest were relocated from upstate New
York and other GE locations.
</P>
<P>
   GE Energy Services has contracts for various services with more
than 120 power plants in 22 countries. The Atlanta customer service
center is staffed 24 hours a day and monitors operations of
GE-manufactured turbines at 50 plants around the world.
</P>
<P>
   GE Energy Services is part of Schenectady-based GE Power
Systems, a $9.5 billion-a-year unit that builds power plants and
equipment. The parent General Electric Co. earlier this month
reported that the Power Systems unit posted a 51 percent increase
in operating profit for the third quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Power Systems is benefiting from strong global demand for
natural gas-fired turbines, which are much cheaper to build than
other technologies and burn a relatively clean fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The unit in July signed contracts valued at $210 million to
design and maintain power plants for Gulf Power Co. and Alabama
Power Co., both subsidiaries of Atlanta-based Southern Co.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Power Systems has also announced deals with
utility companies in Venezuela and Chile, and the largest oil and
gas companies in Mexico and Brazil. The division announced this
week that it will build a $1.9 billion power plant for Entergy, the
New Orleans-based utility.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Nardelli, president and chief executive of Power Systems,
has had such success that he is reported to be in contention to
succeed GE Chairman Jack Welch, who is scheduled to retire at the
end of the year. Nardelli is scheduled to attend today's Atlanta
grand opening.

PERVIS ELLISON IS MAKING STRIDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM _ The moment went relatively unnoticed Wednesday at the
FleetCenter, given the time (4:38 left in the first quarter), score
(15-8, Charlotte), and overall situation (bored fans waiting for
the Red Sox-Yankees to start).
</P>
<P>
   Onto a basketball court, in any kind of quasi-meaningful
situation for the first time since March 11, 1998, strode Pervis
Ellison. He had that familiar, loping gait and the now-familiar
dredlocks in a ponytail. It was a moment more than a few Celtic
fans wondered if they'd ever see again: Ellison as a Celtic.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't dazzle anyone. He didn't embarrass anyone. He played
12 minutes and had 4 points, 3 rebounds, and 1 assist. It's not all
that different a line from the submission of March 11 against
Atlanta (2 points, 2 rebounds, 9 minutes).
</P>
<P>
   But there was one big difference: After the Hawks game, Ellison
went on the injured list for the remainder of the season because he
wasn't in shape. This year, he still isn't in the kind of shape
coach Rick Pitino would like, but he's apparently getting there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just trying to get my timing back,'' Ellison said after
the game Wednesday. ``It felt great to be out there. It would have
felt even better if I had done anything.''
</P>
<P>
   That last sentence demonstrates Ellison's value to the Celtics,
maybe even more than whatever he can deliver on the court. He's
enormously popular among his teammates, as much for his humor as
for his even-keel demeanor. He wants to be a leader. He wants to be
a locker room presence.
</P>
<P>
   But for that to happen, he has to play. And for that to happen,
he has to spit in the face of his personal history and avoid
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're out there in the heat of battle, you don't think
about injuries,'' said Ellison, who has seen little heat the last
three years. ``It's the farthest thing from my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back and revisit some of the maladies that have
afflicted Ellison in his five years with the Celtics:
</P>
<P>
   Year 1: He missed 27 games mostly because of knee
rehabilitation. Yet the promise was there in two huge outings: a
19-point, 10-rebound effort against Denver in his Boston debut, and
a big performance in Game 2 of their playoff series with Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2: His Ripken-esque year in Boston. He totaled 69 games,
led the Celtics in blocked shots, and even had 29 starts. Of the 13
missed games, one was a suspension for fighting with Miami's Kurt
Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Year 3: The slide begins. He played six games and was out for
the year after, according to the Celtics, he dropped a coffee table
on his foot while helping Greg Minor move furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Year 4: Pitino arrives and, to everyone's surprise, is smitten
with Ellison's personality. He names him a captain. But Ellison
appears in only 33 games and is placed on the IL for the final 20
games because he's out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   Year 5: Season-DNP. He underwent ankle surgery in November
during the lockout and never made it back.
</P>
<P>
   Year 6: Who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Ellison could be the test case for ``What Is Wrong With
Guaranteed Contracts.'' He could be the test case for ``How To Make
The System Work For You'' or ``Skating, NBA Style.'' He has
collected a lot of money in Boston for not a lot of work, which has
made him the subject of a lot of ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino, always talking positive, figures Ellison may actually be
involved this season, if for no other reason than it's the last
year of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be a UMass grad to figure that out,'' the
UMass alum said. ``If he continually misses games, no one is going
to take him seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was counting on Ellison, Pitino said, ``If he
totally dedicates himself, he is our best big man. He would be a
starter. But he'd have to totally dedicate himself and totally turn
himself over. I am not counting on him, based on his history. If he
can give us something, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Pitino said Ellison is not in shape and is unfamiliar
with the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Ellison didn't look too out of whack against the Hornets. Two of
his three rebounds were off the offensive glass, a team weakness
last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt a little awkward,'' he said. ``But that's why you have
an exhibition season.''
</P>
<P>
   He then said he was simply happy to be playing basketball again,
which, given his history, is understandable.

MEXICAN VILLAGES REMAIN CUT OFF AFTER FLOODS AND MUDSLIDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZACAPOAXTLA, Mexico _ They walked 16 hours through fog and
drizzle, but when the Indian men in mud-spattered sandals arrived
safely at this mountain town in search of food for their devastated
hamlet, they broke into a murmured chant, thanking the Virgin for
small blessings amid vast misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost everything,'' said Francisco Santiago Rodriguez,
whispering in broken Spanish as he and his 37 Totonaco-speaking
neighbors lined up for bean broth at a sidewalk soup kitchen.
Later, at a municipal warehouse, the men shouldered bags of corn
meal and sugar to bear back to their village, Olintla, where homes,
cattle and crops were swept away last week by flash floods and
mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   Olintla, like hundreds of other settlements across four states
in eastern Mexico, remained cut off Thursday from outside help, 10
days after one of Mexico's worst natural disasters. Virtually all
country roads in the region have been washed out, and a vengeful
fog had grounded helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The men of Olintla were part of a tide of thousands of storm
victims who have converged on Zacapoaxtla, a county seat of 27,000
bedraggled souls that straddles a hillside shoulder in northern
Puebla state 95 miles east of Mexico City. Hundreds of Zacapoaxtla
residents have themselves lost homes and businesses, but those who
still have a roof and floor space have opened their doors to the
arriving refugees. The government is distributing free food and
medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never dreamed that rain could hit so hard,'' Gildardo
Castaneda Dominguez, Zacapoaxtla's mayor, said to a visitor as he
helped form a clamorous crowd of peasants seeking foodstuffs into a
line snaking along the front edge of the tile-roofed town hall.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government said Thursday that the death toll had
risen to 360 from the tropical rains that deluged Puebla, Veracruz,
Hidalgo and Tabasco states on Oct. 4 and 5 and have continued as a
drizzle since. Estimates by the Catholic church and other private
groups have put the toll above 500.
</P>
<P>
   The rains were like one of those summer downpours that drops
buckets of water for a few minutes, then clears. But this deluge
did not clear. Fueled by a tropical depression hanging over the
Gulf of Mexico, it dumped 30 inches of rain in three days,
according to Mexico's National Water Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The roiling currents of two rivers flowing past Zacapoaxtla
swept away scores of riverside shanties, drowning eight people. As
hillsides began to give way, seven others, including a local
policeman, were crushed by sliding mud. Other villages and towns
along a 600-mile stretch of the Gulf Coast suffered even more
tragic consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In Teziutlan, 20 miles east of Zacapoaxtla, a cliff-top cemetery
tore down a hillside, sweeping away dozens of homes. The death toll
there reached 102 on Thursday, officials said. In Gutierrez Zamora,
a coastal town in Veracruz, a 12-foot wave at the front edge of a
flash flood swept away an entire riverside neighborhood, killing
dozens.
</P>
<P>
   Those dramatic tragedies have attracted news coverage, but parts
of hundreds of other settlements across the Gulf Coast region were
swept away in the same hours by rampaging waters and sliding mud.
Many villages that suffered tremendous damage have received little
or no help because authorities cannot get to them except on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tapayula doesn't exist anymore,'' said Zeferino Ramos Peralta,
a schoolteacher who arrived here Wednesday night, speaking of a
village nestled in a valley 10 miles north of Zacapoaxtla.
Mudslides hit Tapayula from two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Amador Manzanero, a radio repairman and volunteer
ambulance driver, said peasants who had passed Tapayula on their
trek to Zacapoaxtla had reported that only the bell tower of the
church was visible above the mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only catastrophe in all my villages,'' said the Rev.
Jose Margarito Robles, a priest based in Zacapoaxtla who tends to
several dozen settlements in the surrounding mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Early Wednesday, during a brief break in the fog, army pilots
flew a helicopter from Zacapoaxtla to a nearby town cut off from
outside help, carrying a doctor and foodstuffs and hoping to rescue
a few of dozens of tourists stranded there. But the fog closed in
and the helicopter could not leave, said Valdivieso Suastegui, an
Interior Ministry official working here.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, how Mexico should face the disaster became a
national issue when President Ernesto Zedillo was confronted by a
throng of victims in Veracruz state imploring him to ask the United
States for aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we Mexicans can handle this ourselves,'' Zedillo
responded.
</P>
<P>
   That comment provoked outcry from opposition lawmakers, who
criticized it as a display of stubborn nationalism, and the
government has since softened its stance. Cash donations from
foreign friends are welcome, and will be donated to the Mexican Red
Cross, the government says. But since hundreds of communities are
cut off from truck traffic, the government still will not accept
shipments of food or medicine.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Wednesday that Americans ``as a people
and as a government stand ready to help in any way we can,''
according to a statement by the American Embassy. The United States
has offered $100,000 in immediate cash aid, the statement said.

DREW, MEET BEN. BEN, MEET DREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Five games are gone, and the starting tight
end has only 11 catches, so we feel it's time to re-introduce Drew
Bledsoe to Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew . . . Ben. Ben . . . Drew.''
</P>
<P>
   With those formalities out of the way, let's make sure that a
little selective amnesia hasn't taken place by going over Coates's
resume. He is a five-time Pro Bowler who has caught 50 touchdown
passes in his career. Only two other tight ends have caught more TD
passes in NFL history _ Jerry Smith and Dave Casper, who leads
Coates by only two. Coates is sixth all-time among tight ends in
receptions (468).
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1994, Drew, Ben Coates set a record for most receptions
by a tight end with 96. Remember? It was you who threw him those
balls. The following year, Coates caught 84 passes. He has caught
50 or more passes in six consecutive seasons. That's second best
all-time. Only quasi-tight end Shannon Sharpe has more consecutive
50-catch seasons (seven), and Coates has done it more consecutive
times than Kellen Winslow, a Hall of Famer who was coached by none
other than Ernie Zampese, the Patriots' offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   On his current pace, Coates won't even break 35 receptions,
which is fine for, say, Lovett Purnell, but for Ben Coates?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always gonna be frustrating when you're used to catching
50 or 60 balls at the end of the season and you only have 11 right
now,'' said Coates. ``You make goals as a player. A lot of players
do that. If you catch 60 balls this year, you try to do that every
year so you can make a contribution to the team.''
</P>
<P>
   We've heard many explanations as to why the number of passes to
Coates has decreased. The popular theory is that Terry Glenn is
healthy, therefore he will be the go-to guy. Understandable. Of
course, back in '96, the Super Bowl season when Glenn caught 90
balls as a rookie, Coates caught 62 and nine touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   Now you hear Bledsoe say, ``Teams are taking Ben out of our
offense.'' This leads to the old ``you say `to-may-to,' I say
`to-mah-to' '' bit, as Coates doesn't appear to share that thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think teams are trying to take me away at all,'' said
Coates. ``I'm seeing a lot more man-to-man coverage than I've seen
at any time in my career. Like I said before, they're going with
the hot guy, and `T' (Glenn) is still the hot guy. I don't see that
changing, so I think my role is going to be the same unless
something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that ``something'' could be injuries. Troy Brown
(ankle sprain) likely won't play Sunday against Miami. There's a
theory that Coates will see a lot of Brown's third-down
opportunities. Maybe. Because there's been such attention paid to
this situation around the league, perhaps Bledsoe will be more
conscious of his once-favorite receiver and get him the ball. One
need only harken back to the Patriots' 21-16 win over the Colts
Nov. 1, when Coates caught 10 passes for 109 yards and one
touchdown. That week, both Glenn and Brown were out of the lineup.
Coates had Colts draped all over him, but Bledsoe kept forcing the
ball into him, and Coates kept catching it in a brilliant
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Kansas City, Bledsoe tried to force one in and it
was intercepted. He tried to force another in and Coates couldn't
hold it in double-coverage.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Patriots were winning, it didn't matter how they
won or who got the ball. But after a loss, issues do arise. And one
of them is ``Where's Ben?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know, to be honest,'' said Coates, who has
caught 61 career passes, including nine for touchdowns, against
Miami. ``Everybody's healthy, and they're just using other guys to
throw it to. Maybe it'll change, maybe it won't. Right now, it's
just not coming my way, period.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates has had to listen to all sorts of wild speculation about
himself because of this situation. One idea is that he is slowing
down. A second is that he is injured. And a third is that perhaps
the Patriots are phasing him out of the offense so they won't have
to deal with re-signing him when his contract expires after next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, I feel great,'' Coates said. ``I've had no
injuries. My body feels good. No problems. Nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll insisted this week, ``This has nothing to do with
Ben.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A game ago, I think the explanation was clear the ball went
outside all day long for obvious reasons,'' Carroll said. ``This
last week, we had a normal mix of what we are doing, although we
were trying to get the ball downfield against their corners. But we
went to Ben three, four, five times, something like that. He caught
one that was called back. It's just the way it's happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything to this at all. We would rather
have Ben catching passes three to five times a game to make sure
that people have to pay attention to him. I'm not real pleased with
the fact that hasn't happened, because it doesn't give us the
balance that we would like. One game doesn't matter, but when you
take it over two or three games, then we need to get him back
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Coates was thrown the possibility that it will all balance out
in the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will,'' said Coates. ``I'm not saying it will. I
hope I can contribute to the team in some kind of way. I'm just
used to being in here and being a guy who's involved in what's
going on. It's strange not to be contributing to the team in that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots have proven anything over the years, it's that
when times are tough and the Patriots are having trouble moving the
offense, Coates has always been there. Over the last two weeks, the
Patriots have scored 19 and 14 points respectively. In that time,
Coates has caught a total of one pass.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Coates caught only one ball over a two-game span
was in the dark, dank pre-Bledsoe era. It can most assuredly be
written that Bledsoe's career took off because he had Coates to
throw to, and Coates's career became what it was because of
Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   But now this long-standing relationship has grown distant, and
it needs a re-introduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drew . . . .Ben. Ben . . . Drew.''

TEXAS NEAR THE TOP IN REDUCING TOBACCO TO TEENS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas has slashed the chances that its children can
successfully buy a pack of cigarettes at retailers, making the
state one of the best performing under a 1992 federal anti-tobacco
law, according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Only five states _ Florida, Georgia, Maine, New Hampshire and
Vermont _ have outperformed Texas in reducing the rate at which
merchants sell tobacco to minors. The statistics are based on the
number of times minors working for inspectors are successful in
buying tobacco at retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Texas officials reported those minors were able to purchase
cigarettes 56 percent of the time in 1996, but only 13 percent of
the time in 1999, the Department of Health and Human Services
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The federal law, known as the Synar Amendment, allows Health and
Human Services to deny 40 percent of federal grant money earmarked
for alcohol and drug abuse programs if states don't reduce sales
rates to minors each year, and reach 20 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   State officials attribute the decline to a set of strict
anti-tobacco laws passed by the Texas Legislature in 1997, although
they also say the Synar Amendment has made at least one agency, the
Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse, pay closer attention to
tobacco-related issues. That is because nearly $50 million of the
commission's $163 million budget is subject to withdrawal if the
state fails to meet tobacco sales targets.
</P>
<P>
   To neglect federal anti-tobacco measures is ``just not a gamble
that we can risk,'' commission spokesperson Stephanie Goodman said.
``Texas could never afford to make up for 40 percent of the
commission's funding.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 numbers reported to Health and Human Services came from
the commission and were based on 521 inspections.
</P>
<P>
   An independent study released Wednesday, however, concluded that
most states, including Texas, are slow to enforce laws that
prohibit tobacco sales to minors. The study was published in the
October issue of The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine,
a journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that the Synar Amendment has not pushed
states to enforce anti-tobacco laws rigorously enough. So far, the
federal government has rewarded grants to states every year, even
though data shows some states, such as Missouri and Minnesota, have
not been able to reduce minors' access to tobacco. The end result,
the study says, is that states are less apt to enforce anti-tobacco
legislation if they know their funding is not in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Health and Human Services officials said Wednesday the
independent study is based on data from 1996 and many states,
including Texas, have passed a wealth of anti-tobacco legislation
since then, which largely focuses on children.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, between 60 percent to 90 percent of teens were able
to successfully purchase tobacco before the Synar law took effect,
the Health and Human Service report said. After one year, the
national average had fallen to 40 percent, and it is expected to be
close to 20 percent this year, said Mark Weber, an HHS spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas State Comptroller spends about $1 million each year
working with local police departments to conduct random stings by
sending minors into retailers to try to buy tobacco. Merchants that
sell to minors face up to $1,000 in fines and, after four offenses,
face revocation of permits.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the independent study, Joseph DiFranza, a
professor at University of Massachusetts Medical School Professor,
said Texas and other states have not gone far enough until fewer
than 10 percent of merchants sell tobacco to kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children still know where to go, and they won't have trouble
finding these stores'' that sell tobacco, DiFranza said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy HHS statistics Texas minors still get their
tobacco. While state, federal and local agents conducted 12,478
inspections of tobacco merchants between October 1997 and October
1998, tobacco use among high school seniors increased to an all
time high of 47 percent in 1998, according to a Texas Department of
Health study.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller office conducted more than 4,000 of those
inspections, which Deputy Comptroller Billy Hamilton said are
selective because of limited funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this program works now is we go off tips and target
places that we know kids are willing to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For the state to inspect each of the 33,652 merchants in the
state would cost well over $25 million, which is not possible,
unless the federal government contributes more money, Hamilton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line on tobacco usage has not changed, but even some
anti-tobacco advocates say federal legislation has kept bureaucrats
and legislators at least aware of issues related to the sale of
tobacco to minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been more compliance checks,'' said Kelly Hedrick,
the Texas representative for the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids, an
anti-tobacco group. ``We are seeing more legislative debates, and I
would say the (Synar Amendment) is taken pretty seriously here.
Texas is not one of the states that has thumbed its nose at this.''

 &HT;    Heaven knocks on Hollywood's door
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Today isn't just another opening weekend at the
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's $65 million ``Fight Club,'' with previous Oscar
nominees Brad Pitt and Ed Norton trading jawbreaking uppercuts in a
bloody tale of anti-establishment pugilism, is expected to ignite
the most controversy at the box office. But a smaller, far less
publicized film with a distinct religious connection _ the $8.5
million ``The Omega Code'' _ is boldly challenging Hollywood at its
own game.
</P>
<P>
   As with a cry from the wilderness, Trinity Broadcasting Network,
the world's largest Christian television network, has been
unabashedly promoting ``Omega Code'' across the country, urging
viewers to buy advance tickets en mass. And many are.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 ``Omega Code'' tickets, for instance, have been
pre-sold for this weekend's showings at the Regal megaplex at the
Mall of Georgia in metro Atlanta. And two people representing
separate groups walked up to Regal box offices this week in
Portland, Ore., and Oklahoma City and bought 1,000-seat blocks of
tickets for showings in those cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is huge,'' says Phil Zacheretti, Regal's senior vice
president of marketing and advertising. ``Other than with something
major like 'Star Wars,' you just don't sell advance tickets to
movies. Even with blockbusters, moviegoers usually decide to buy
the day they go.''
</P>
<P>
   Financed in part by TBN and produced by Matt Crouch, son of TBN
founder Paul Crouch, ``The Omega Code'' stars veteran actor Michael
York (``Cabaret'' and the ``Austin Powers'' flicks) and Casper Van
Dien (``Stormship Troopers'') in a story somewhat reminiscent of
the biblical book of Revelation: A prominent entrepreneur seeks
world domination. The title relates to real-life claims of a
scriptural code that supposedly deciphers hidden messages in the
Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   The Motion Picture Association of America has rated ``Omega
Code'' PG-13, for several scenes involving shootings. ``Fight
Club'' is rated R, for disturbing and graphic depictions of violent
antisocial behavior, sexuality and profanity.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Omega Code'' does involve Hollywood talent and a healthy
special-effects budget, it is not connected with any of the major
studios or widely known distributors that normally handle a movie
of this size. The film is aimed squarely at the nation's
evangelical Christians, which some experts estimate to number about
75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Today ``is our chance,'' Matt Crouch says. ``It's a way to show
Hollywood there is a market out there for (this kind of)
entertainment. We have the ability to make a film and we have a
core audience out there who want to buy our stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   TBN's only previous movie experience has been 1991's little-seen
``China Cry.''
</P>
<P>
   To drum up support for ``Omega Code,'' TBN, which airs locally
on WHSG, has been occasionally running a crawl detailing the 300
theaters nationwide (15 in metro Atlanta) where the movie will be
playing. On Wednesday, the network broadcast live from the movie's
world premiere in Los Angeles. In addition to York and Van Dien,
stars attending included Clifton Davis, Smokey Robinson and Kim
Fields. TBN also is touting a website devoted to the film
(www.omegacode.com).
</P>
<P>
   Though 300 theaters is a much smaller release pattern than what
most major Hollywood films attain (``Fight Club'' will debut at
approximately 2,000 theaters), ``Omega Code'' will get wider
exposure than many specialty films which debut at a limited number
of theaters in select markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe somebody's going to find out how many Christians there
are in this country,'' says actress Jane Russell, who touted the
film at the L.A. premiere. ``This is the way to get the word out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Family Christian Store in Gainesville, manager Judy
Herndon says she and all of her 10-member staff are planning to go
see ``Omega Code.'' ``I've had a lot of calls from people asking
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herndon, 55, of Gillsville, says she hasn't heard of ``Fight
Club'' and hasn't seen a movie at a theater since last year's ``ThePrince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally don't care to go see (Hollywood movies),'' she
says. ``I don't care to hear the language and a lot of times
they're full of bedroom scenes.'' But she'll go to ``Omega Code.''
``I'm excited. I want to help make a statement. And that's that
Christians will get behind good movies if Hollywood will do this
kind of quality movie.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prince of Egypt'' is also the last movie Larry Pitts saw at a
theater. But Pitts, manager of Kennesaw's Family Christian Store,
which is promoting ``Omega Code'' with posters and Bible study
materials at his store, plans to see ``Omega Code'' with his wife
next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a movie's not going to be beneficial to our lives, we're
not going to spend two hours (insheater),'' says Pitts, 49,
of Nelson. ``We even elected to take cable TV out of our home. Why?
Because the content is not the truth. They perpetuate the theory
that life is not eternal and that you better enjoy what's here at
the expense of everyone. Of course, the Bible teaches the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where this movie fits right in.''

LOTT'S ROLE IN TEST BAN TREATY'S DEFEAT SHAPED BY 1997 VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss., S.D., Pa., Ariz., Okla., N.C., Ga., Ark.)  (With TREATY-CLINTON, TREATY-REACT) 
(th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One day shortly after Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi became the Republican leader in 1996, he got an urgent
phone call from Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was to begin debating a treaty that banned the
production, storage and use of poison gas, and Christopher pleaded
with Lott to cancel the vote _ likely to be a rejection _ for
national security reasons. Lott readily agreed, and over the next
seven months worked closely with the White House and Senate
Democrats to address objections to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
</P>
<P>
   On April 24, 1997, when the Senate approved the revised treaty
with a 74-26 vote, Lott voted yes. His cautious support was sealed
by a last-minute letter from President Clinton, who promised to
withdraw from the accord if it compromised the country's military
capacities or led to the spread of poison gas. ``He is the
president and his assurances in foreign policy must make a
difference,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   The contrasts between Lott's accommodation on the poison gas
treaty and the decisions he made this week that helped spell defeat
for another landmark pact, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, can
be explained, in part, by the wrath he drew from Senate
conservatives on that first treaty vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been paying the price for that vote ever since,'' Lott
said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican hard-liners have always grumbled that Lott is
more comfortable cutting deals and keeping comity than sticking to
core conservative principles. They complain that Lott backed a GATT
trade accord that challenged U.S. sovereignty, and that he sold out
the House Republican managers during Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   As Sen. James Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, said in an
interview last week, ``As much as I like and love Trent Lott, I've
said he'd rather make a bad deal than no deal at all.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Democrats goaded Lott into calling up the test ban
treaty this month on short notice, and then quickly realized the
accord lacked the two-thirds majority to pass, the scene was set
for another political rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Clinton and his aides appealed to Lott to defer
action, and near-certain defeat, citing national security reasons.
This time, however, the Republican dynamics had changed. Four
conservatives, including Inhofe, blocked an easy escape by
declaring that they would object to breaking a prearranged
agreement, endorsed by all 100 senators, to debate and vote on the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   A new hurdle had risen since 1996. ``Some of my colleagues are
philosophically opposed to arms control,'' explained Sen. Arlen
Specter of Pennsylvania, one of four Republicans to vote for the
test ban treaty. ``There are some who just want to have Fortress
America.''
</P>
<P>
   A tentative deal that Lott and the Democratic leader, Sen. Tom
Daschle of South Dakota, worked out _ to delay Senate action on the
treaty until Clinton left office _ collapsed in the face of
opposition from conservatives like Sens. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, Jon Kyl of Arizona and Paul Coverdell of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   As majority leader with supreme control over the Senate's
schedule, Lott alone could still have honored Clinton's pleas,
including a last-minute phone call before the final vote, by not
moving the Senate from its regular legislative business to what is
called the executive calendar, where treaties reside. But he pushed
ahead, buoyed by a pep talk on Wednesday from Dick Cheney, a former
Defense secretary, who opposes the pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue had been elevated to the level where it was seen as
such a bad treaty, that it'd have been very hard to shift gears
with our conservative base and not vote on it,'' one top Republican
aide said. ``They wanted us in the end zone, spiking the ball on
something that belonged to Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lott denied that partisan politics had factored into
the test ban vote. Approving the poison gas treaty, he said, ``was
the right thing to do.'' The test ban agreement, he said, was
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to delay action on the poison gas treaty because
Democrats ``had not been playing with this politically'' as they
had with the test ban treaty. Yet in his floor speech two years
ago, Lott recalled two filibusters that the Democrats held in 1995
and 1996 to force Republicans to take up the chemical weapons pact.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Thursday that Christopher's request had come ``early
enough in the process'' but that Clinton's written plea had come
``very late.'' In fact, Lott received both requests before floor
debate began.
</P>
<P>
   As for deferring to presidential assurances on matters of state,
as he did three years ago, Lott insisted Thursday, ``We are not a
rubber stamp for the president of the United States on a treaty we
think is flawed. We have a co-equal role.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, conservatives cheered Lott and savored their victory.
Sen. Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, one of the four unyielding
conservatives, said, ``Lott took a difficult decision and showed
leadership.''

 &HT;    `Survivor!' takes TV game shows to the extreme
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With its new show ``Survivor!,'' already generating buzz though
it won't air until next summer, CBS has managed to merge two TV
megatrends _ the resurgence of game shows and Extreme TV.
</P>
<P>
   Part ``Lord of the Flies,'' part MTV's ``Real World'' and, who
knows, maybe part ``Gilligan's Island,'' ``Survivor!'' will deposit
16 prescreened applicants _ normal Americans from all walks of life
_ on a deserted island near Borneo with no shelter, the only food
what they can catch or kill. Every three days, they take a secret
vote to exile one of their own. When it's down to two survivors,
everyone comes back and votes on one winner, who gets $1 million.
Everything they do will be filmed, then edited for viewing.
</P>
<P>
   Will ``Survivor!'' be degrading, voyeuristic, appealing to our
darker impulses? Quite likely. Will people watch? Like it was O.J.
confessing.
</P>
<P>
   High anxiety
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' lured millions of
viewers in August, the networks have been slobbering over
high-stakes, high-anxiety game shows. CBS is working on a new
``$64,000 Question'' (presumably adjusted for inflation) and NBC on
a revved-up (presumably scandal-free) ``Twenty-One.'' Fox, always
the class act, is trying to launch ``Greed'' for November sweeps, a
show described as like ``Famly Feud,'' only the family members have
to betray each other to win. ABC will also bring back
``Millionaire'' for a two-week run in November.
</P>
<P>
   Cross that with Extreme TV, the catch-all genre that includes
pro wrestling (the most popular show on cable), the rebirth of
Roller Derby, the still popular (but fading somewhat)
confrontational talk shows and Fox's ``World's Most
Shocking/Amazing . . . '' shows. Fox has been trying to get
government permission to crash an unmanned jumbo jet into the
desert on live TV for November sweeps, which makes ``Survivor!''
seem relatively tame.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Mark Burnett says he wants to get a diverse mix of
castaways for ``Survivor!'' ``We may have a 60-year-old priest. We
may have a 22-year-old from the inner city, or a fortysomething
mother of three from the Midwest,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Who does Burnett think will win? Somebody with strong survival
skills whom the group needs, and who also gets along well with
everyone. The guy with attitude will be gone real fast.
</P>
<P>
   Safely dangerous
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the camera crews who will tape the proceedings,
there will be medical teams standing by. Not a bad idea, since
CBS's official announcement claims that PulauTiga is home to ``the
world's most venomous snake,'' the sea krait. Burnett, trying to
downplay the krait, says it's very small, lives in the ocean and
``is not known to bite people.''
</P>
<P>
   This have-it-both-ways hype is typical for TV: It's really
dangerous! But it's really safe!
</P>
<P>
   What's most surprising about ``Survivor!'' is that it's taken
America this long to get it. The show comes from Sweden, where it's
huge, like the cast of ``ER'' vs. the cast of ``Ally McBeal'' in
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the American Century, our pop culture is one of
our most widespread exports, but the rest of the world has its own
ideas about TV game shows. In Italy and other European countries,
contestants strip as they play. Japanese game shows border on S&AMP;M,
with participants humiliated and literally tortured: Women are
fondled by strangers, and men stand barefoot on blocks of ice or
have the hot sun focused on their bare skin by large magnifying
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   We've already been borrowing the tame: ``Whose Line Is It
Anyway?'' and ``Millionaire'' both originated in England. Now we're
on to the next level of imports, and don't think it will stop with
``Survivor.'' It's only starting.
</P>
<P>
   Applications to compete on ``Survivor'' are available only at:

EDDIE PEREZ STEPS UP IN THE POST-SEASON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After hitting his second home run in two days against the Mets _
this one to win the game _ Eddie Perez, former backup catcher,
continued to play down his talents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand why they're pitching to me,'' said Perez, the
Atlanta Braves' most-potent offensive force in the first two games
of the National League Championship Series. ``I'm not a good
hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   But Perez has been very good lately. Against the Mets in this
series, Perez is 4 for 7, with the two home runs, a double and
three runs batted in. His sixth-inning homer in Game 1 on Tuesday
night gave the Braves some breathing room, turning a 2-1 lead into
a 3-1 margin. His two-run, sixth-inning homer in Game 2 on
Wednesday afternoon broke a 2-2 tie and sealed the Mets' fate.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entered the bottom of that inning, trailing, 2-0, but
Brian Jordan tied the game with a two-run homer to the opposite
field. Andruw Jones followed with a hard single to left that
brought Perez to the plate. The Mets' starter, Kenny Rogers, was
obviously losing his effectiveness, and Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine weighed whether to yank Rogers from the game.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Valentine decided to let Rogers pitch to Perez. That
was a mistake. One pitch later, Perez's home run was sailing into
the left-field seats, and the Braves were in front for good.
</P>
<P>
   Perez admitted he was surprised, and pleased, by Valentine's
decision not to pull Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was coming out of the game, but I didn't want him
to,'' Perez said of Rogers. ``I didn't want to face a fresh arm
from the bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez got his wish, then he made the most of it. With his home
run, Perez continued his uncanny penchant for becoming a dangerous
hitter during the post-season. A career .259 hitter, Perez is 7 for
his last 11 in NLCS play. In last year's NLCS against the San Diego
Padres, Perez was 3 for 4 in a backup role, and while some players
become more tense in pressure situations, Perez seems to have the
kind of self-deprecating humor that allows him to relax. For
instance, when asked about Rogers' pickoff move to first base,
which caught both Gerald Williams and Andruw Jones in Game 2, Perez
had to laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the best pickoff move I've ever seen,'' Perez
said. ``When he threw Andruw out, I swung the bat and he threw to
first base.''
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Perez became Atlanta's starting catcher when
Javy Lopez suffered a season-ending knee injury on July 24.
Catching 104 games, Perez hit .249 with 7 home runs and 30 rbi, but
his main value was behind the plate, where he provided solid
defense and did a strong job handling Atlanta's fine pitching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Javy went down, Eddie stepped right in and did the job,''
John Schuerholz, Atlanta's general manager, said. ``What he has
done is even more impressive because he's banged up, with two sore
knees. He's done a great job. Believe me, he'd be the No. 1 catcher
on a lot of teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the series began, Perez thought he might play a key role.
He knew the Mets would pitch carefully to Atlanta's dangerous No. 3
and No. 4 hitters _ Chipper Jones and Jordan _ and walk them on
occasion. That left Andruw Jones, batting fifth, and Perez, batting
sixth, with a chance to make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to pitch to Chipper and Brian,'' Perez said.
``I told Andruw before the series to be ready, because we're going
to see somebody on base every time we're up.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be interesting to see how Perez and his teammates react
Friday night, when the series shifts to Shea Stadium for Game 3,
and the atmosphere becomes more hostile. Still, during the regular
season, all seven of Perez's homers were on the road, a statistic
the Mets' pitching staff would be wise to note.
</P>
<P>
   If Perez continues to hit, it will greatly improve Atlanta's
chances. His performance has raised questions about who will be the
No. 1 catcher next season, when Lopez, a two-time All-Star, is
expected to return. For his part, Perez, who has been the backup
since Lopez became a regular in 1996, would rather not worry about
that issue until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen, but I don't want to go
anywhere,'' Perez said. ``I want to stay in Atlanta. This is where
I want to be, with a team that has a chance to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are the Braves in the playoffs, but Perez has also been
one of their heroes. Maybe the Mets are surprised. But the Braves
are not.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great defensive catcher and he can hit,'' Braves
Manager Bobby Cox said. ``I've seen him in the playoffs before, and
it's not unusual for Eddie to hit a home run or drive in a big run.
He has done a fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be more to come. &QL;

MARVIN WOOD, COACH OF `HOOSIERS' TEAM, IS DEAD AT 71 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Ohio)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marvin Wood, who coached a tiny high school's basketball team to
the Indiana state championship, portrayed in the 1986 movie
``Hoosiers,'' died on Wednesday in South Bend., Ind. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' wife, Mary Lou, said the cause was lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   The team's feat was legendary in the basketball-crazed state
well before it was celebrated in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   At the storied 1954 title game, all but a handful of the 1,150
citizens of Milan, Ind., were on hand to see their Indians take on
Muncie Central High School, whose team had won four state
championships. Tickets were being scalped for $50 and it was
estimated that 90 percent of Indiana's residents were watching or
listening to broadcasts of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The final 18 seconds of the game were so exquisitely tense that
the movie reproduced them almost exactly. The denouement came with
just five seconds left when Bobby Plump faked left and fired a shot
cleanly through the net, winning the game, 32-30. The Indianapolis
Star recently called the game the top sports story in Indiana
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proved that dreams can come true,'' said Plump, who is now
63 and owns a restaurant in Indianapolis called Plump's Last Shot.
</P>
<P>
   Plump and others said that Wood was far more mild-mannered than
the irascible movie character played by Gene Hackman. He would
never scream, instead raising the level of his voice ever so
slightly. ``You knew he meant business,'' Plump said. ``He coached
with quiet confidence and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was born in Morristown, Ind., and grew up on a farm there.
He attended Butler University, playing basketball under Tony
Hinkle, a coach who favored a controlled, structured style of play
of the sort Wood would later adopt.
</P>
<P>
   Wood began his coaching career in French Lick, Ind., later well
known as the hometown of the Hall of Fame player Larry Bird,
leading to a lifelong joke that Larry Birds were in short supply
there during Wood's tenure. He moved to Milan in 1952 to take over
from a coach who had just been dismissed, so his first challenge
was to win the confidence of players upset by the dismissal, a
situation recalled in the movie. He immediately annoyed townspeople
by barring them from attending practices, a favorite local
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Though he did not subscribe to the fast-break style of the
former coach, he favored such imaginative tactics as the type of
fast-switching press later popularized by UCLA and the four-corners
offense later used by the University of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Still in his mid-20s at the time, Wood liked to suit up and play
with the team in practices. ``We kind of grew up with him, because
he's only eight years older,'' Plump said.
</P>
<P>
   Milan reached the state tournament in his first year, a level
the school had never reached before. The next year the Indians went
all the way, and Wood is remembered for one unusual coaching move
in the championship game almost as much as for his game-ending
strategy. He held up both palms, signaling a stall. Bobby Plump
then proceeded to stand stock still, holding the ball for 4 minutes
13 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody on the court is moving,'' said Plump, as if the moment
were yesterday. ``The crescendo of noise just continued to increase
the longer I stood there. What we were trying to do was shorten the
game. We were trying to get it down to the last couple of
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Miracle of Milan'' headed off a plan to break up the
Indiana basketball tournament into divisions based on school size.
Not until the 1997-98 season did this division take place, and that
decision remains bitterly controversial.
</P>
<P>
   After the title season, Wood left Milan, where his record was
52-7, moving on to New Castle, then North Central in Indianapolis
and finally to Mishawaka, where he also served as guidance
counselor. His overall high school record was 329-279.
</P>
<P>
   While coaching at the various high schools, he also coached
women's teams at Bethel and St. Mary's Colleges. He coached his
granddaughter's seventh-grade team in Kirtland, Ohio, until last
December, when his illness no longer permitted it. He had been
active in counseling others with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, Wood is survived by a daughter, Deidra Juday
of Kirtland, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Proud as he was of his famous victory, Wood was even more proud
that 9 of his 10 players that year went on to college. His wife
said he turned down an invitation to the premiere of ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a front-row seat the first time,'' he explained. &QL;

CHRYSLER MAKES ITS PLACE IN HISTORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Pa., Minn., Ky., N.J., Calif., Wis., Germany)   By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ This city, whose name is synonymous with the American
auto industry, is strengthening that identification at several
museums dedicated to the business.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Ford Motor Co. opened a museum in its nearby
hometown of Dearborn, Mich., and only a few Thunderbird-lengths
from the Henry Ford Museum and the Automotive Hall of Fame. Early
in the next century, General Motors plans to open a downtown
museum.
</P>
<P>
   And this month, DaimlerChrysler opened the Walter P. Chrysler
Museum at its North American headquarters in the suburb of Auburn
Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The cars are the stars of the Chrysler museum, which is named
for the company's founder. It displays 75 vehicles from a
collection of about 140, and they were chosen to showcase
milestones for Chrysler and the auto industry. Many of the displays
are intended to give visitors a sense of Chrysler's place in
history and American culture as the century draws to a close. A
World War II Jeep, for example, appears to emerge from the rubble
of a French village, and a 1924 Chrysler Six, the first car to bear
the Chrysler name, is seen through the window of a replica of the
founder's office.
</P>
<P>
   A two-story revolving display shows off a half-dozen vehicles,
including a 1963 Chrysler experimental turbine car, the original
1989 Dodge Viper show car, the Chrysler Thunderbolt and the
twin-cockpit Chrysler Newport Phaeton, both from 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The prewar vehicles include a 1929 DeSoto, which had been walled
up in a Chrysler plant; &UR;  &LR; a 1934 DeSoto Airflow, considered by many
to be the first modern car because it foreshadowed the aerodynamic
design of cars built decades later, and a 1929 Nash that never left
the factory in Kenosha, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   About 35 high-performance cars line a track in the lower level
known as Boss Chrysler's garage. A lounge resembles a 1930s
showroom and there is a replica of Chrysler's Room 13, the
birthplace of legendary high-performance engines, including the
Chrysler Hemi V8.
</P>
<P>
   The new Spirit of Ford &UR;  &LR; museum is near the Henry Ford Museum in
Dearborn, as well as the recently opened Automotive Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Henry Ford Museum, which contains a wide
collection of historic cars, including Ford's original quadricycle,
the Spirit of Ford focuses on current vehicles and future concepts.
It also stresses the design and manufacturing process more than the
Chrysler museum does.
</P>
<P>
   In 2002, GM plans to open its museum, focusing on the company's
heritage, in the Renaissance Center in downtown Detroit, which
General Motors bought for its headquarters two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Dressel, director of the Chrysler museum, said travel
industry surveys found that about half of Americans plan museum
visits during vacations, with corporate museums accounting for an
increasing share. For example, he said, Crayola Crayon's visitor
and creative center in Easton, Pa., &UR;  &LR; attracts more than 300,000
people a year, and Spam Town in Austin, Minn., draws 60,000.
DaimlerChrysler's Mercedes-Benz museum in Stuttgart, Germany, pulls
in an average of 35,000. BMW has a museum in Munich and has opened
a smaller one at its plant in Spartanburg, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of museums nationwide contain collections of cars or car
artifacts. Chevrolet's Corvette museum in Bowling Green, Ky., has
become one of the state's top tourist attractions. Jaguar plans to
build a museum at its North American headquarters in Mahwah, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the nation's finest automobile museums, which are not
affiliated with an auto manufacturer, are in California. The
Blackhawk Automotive Museum in Danville is filled with beautiful
rare cars _ some once owned by Hollywood stars _ with nameplates
like Bugatti, Mercer and Hispano-Suiza. A relatively new wing of
the museum is devoted exclusively to automotive art from fine
paintings to hood ornaments.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles exhibits
important cars in historical displays. Dioramas, including a 1930s
Hollywood street scene, a 1960s garage and a 1931 showroom, depict
the history of the automobile and its impact on Amlife.

 &HT;    CLINTON BLASTS REPUBLICANS FOR TREATY REJECTION
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Venting frustration a day after suffering a
bruising foreign policy defeat, President Clinton accused Senate
Republicans on Thursday of listing toward ``a new isolationism''
that threatens the country's global leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think we ought to go it alone,'' Clinton said,
summarizing the GOP message to the closest U.S. allies as, ``Go
take a hike.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are saying America does not need to lead, either by
effort or by example. They are saying we don't need our friends or
allies ... that, at the height of our power and prosperity, we
should bury our heads in the sand, behind a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not where I stand,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's fourth animated broadside against the GOP-controlled
Congress in less than two weeks came at a White House news
conference dominated by the Senate's rejection Wednesday of an
international nuclear test ban treaty at the heart of the
president's nonproliferation agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., called his own news
conference to rebut the charges.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton had gotten his ``feelings hurt a little bit''
over the defeat, denied that his party was drifting toward
isolationism, and said the president was using that charge to mask
substantive objections to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be international cowboys,'' Lott told
reporters at the Capitol. ``Nobody can be an isolationist in this
world. It's physically impossible, it's irrational, and we are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Lott added, ``we are not a rubber stamp for the president
of the United States on a treaty we think is flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his hour-long East Room press conference, touched on
a handful of subjects:
</P>
<P>
   _ He threatened to veto a spending bill Congress is scheduled to
sent to his desk within the week unless it contains sufficient
funding for his plans to hire additional teachers, boost
after-school programs and add computers to classrooms. Republicans
have proposed lumping most of that funding into block grants that
would let local school boards decide how the money is spent.
</P>
<P>
   _ He tiptoed around a question about this week's military coup
in Pakistan, declining to condemn the overthrow of that country's
democratically elected government and saying instead, ``We don't
like it when military leaders forcibly displace elected governments
... and I would hope that the military government will soon
transition to a civilian one.''
</P>
<P>
   _ And he declined to comment on an Arkansas court ruling that he
had committed perjury in connection with a civil suit filed by
Paula Jones, who later reached an out-of-court settlement with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am out of office, I will have a lot to say about
this,'' said Clinton. ``As I understand it now, all this is
finished and I don't have to comment on it; and unless there is
some reason I legally have to, I'm not going to say anything else
that doesn't relate to my responsibilities as president.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, though, Clinton returned to the test ban treaty,
the topic with which he kicked off his press conference.
</P>
<P>
   He tried to portray Wednesday's Senate action as a central
moment in a far larger debate. At issue, he said, is whether
conservative Senate voices would be able to steer the country away
from five decades of diplomacy aimed at putting in place arms
control agreements and economic treaties meant to strengthen global
security and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the world we will live in if they prevail,'' Clinton
said. ``I think it will be a bleak, poor, less secure world. I
don't want my children and my grandchildren, or your children or
your grandchildren to live in it. ... I will do everything I can to
stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this country's shores, Clinton said, the Senate's
rejection of the test ban treaty ``was also an amazing rebuke to
our allies.''
</P>
<P>
   The British, French and German heads of state had pleaded in a
joint op-ed article for the Senate not to kill the treaty. Those
countries are the United States' core NATO allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, 'Okay, you guys are with us every time we need you,
the Gulf War, the Balkans, always in NATO, you're there, but you
ask us to do something for your common safety, go take a hike,'''
said Clinton. ``I think that's a very tenuous position.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's blistering critique added to a season of mounting
contention between the White House and the GOP-controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Clinton assailed Senate Republicans for shooting
down his nomination to the federal court in Missouri of Ronnie
White, the first African-American to sit on the bench of the
Missouri Supreme Court. Clinton statement that White's rejection
lent credence to the view that the Senate confirmation process
discriminated against minorities and women infuriated Lott.
</P>
<P>
   He later accused House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R- Ill., of
selling out to the interests of the health insurance industry in
his efforts to kill new consumer protections. Hastert denied the
charge, and the protections passed the House.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton last Friday accused Senate Republicans of placing
politics ahead of national security as it became clear that the
nuclear test ban treaty was headed toward defeat, again raising the
ire of Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not about politics,'' Lott said Thursday, ``it was
about the substance of the treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott suggested that Clinton's remarks reflected an emotional
reaction to Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's disappointed and maybe his, you know, feelings
hurt a little bit here,'' said Lott. ``But, you know, let's move
on. You don't win them all, Mr. President. Sometimes you're
wrong.''

GHOSTS OF DETROIT PAST IN OLD FORD BUILDINGS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM McCRAW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEARBORN, Mich. _ Henry Ford was so intent on preserving pieces
of the nation's past that he had dozens of buildings shipped here
to Greenfield Village, a historical park where visitors can wander
through Thomas Edison's laboratory and the Wright Brothers' bicycle
shop. Yet as Ford's greatest legacy, the Ford Motor Co., looks to
its centennial in 2003, several of the most important buildings
from its past have disappeared or are in disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   The company's original Mack Avenue plant in Detroit was
destroyed by fire decades ago, though it has been recreated in
Greenfield Village. The company's former headquarters at 3000
Schaefer Road in Dearborn, which was later the home of
Lincoln-Mercury and then the Ford parts and service division, was
leveled in 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two historic structures remain, but their future is in doubt. An
enormous complex that built 15 million Model Ts in Highland Park _
a city encircled by Detroit _ has been empty for decades. There is
a historical marker in front on Woodward Avenue, but the complex is
much too large to restore. Most of its thousands of windows _ it
was nicknamed the Crystal Palace _ are broken, and weeds and trash
are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative offices may soon be converted into a charter
school for 540 students from kindergarten to fifth grade. The
school would be operated by Advantage Schools of Boston under a
10-year lease, but the building would need at least $2 million in
renovations, Advantage said.
</P>
<P>
   The other building is at 411 Piquette Street in Detroit, a few
miles south of the Highland Park complex. Ford quickly outgrew its
original Mack Avenue site and moved to the three-story Piquette
Street building. Between 1903 and 1909, Ford built thousands of
cars there, said Mike Skinner, a Ford historian. In an office on
the northeast corner of the third floor of this building, Henry
Ford and his research staff designed and developed the Model T.
</P>
<P>
   The building is currently owned by Heritage Investments, but is
being sold to the Henry Ford Heritage Association, a group of about
1,000 Ford history buffs.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wickins of Heritage Investments said the sale was
complicated because Studebaker bought the building from Ford and
added an extension that now makes it a blocklong building with a
single title. Heritage wants to sell the entire building, currently
worth about $3 million, to the group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henry Ford Hospital uses most of the Studebaker extension to
store records, and the original Ford building is used by multiple
tenants, mostly for storage. &QL;

MCCAIN (Washington) - In a blistering debate on the floor of the
U.S. Senate Thursday, John McCain's enemies tried to fit him for a
political pine box, insisting on a adding an amendment that would
require any senator who made a general charge of corruption or
improper influence to back it up with specifics or pay a penalty.
More than a few GOP senators expressed outrage over McCain's
citations of `pork` on his website, forcing the Arizona senator and
his Wisconsin co-sponsor to backpedal, explaining they were talking
about `the appearance of corruption.` This spectacle of a GOP
presidential candidate being flayed by members of his own party
even as Democrats kneeled down to nurse his wounds is so
extraordinary that it raises the question: Even in the unlikely
event McCain could be elected president, would he be able to govern
when so many powerful senators of his own party are willing to
display their contempt for him in public? By KRIS MAYES. Story will

 &HT;    S.C. high court rules against video gaming referendum
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel and Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MILL, S.C. _ The South Carolina Supreme Court on Thursday
shoved the state's embattled video poker industry halfway into its
grave. As it stands, the lid will slam shut July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there's any breathing room for the controversial $2.8
billion industry is up to state legislators who convene in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got eight months till the deadline goes into effect,''
said Michael Gunn, a South Carolina video poker lobbyist. ``A lot
can happen between now and then. What that is I don't know, but a
lot can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   However, both Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, and state House
speaker David Wilkins, a Republican, said Thursday there aren't
enough votes to reverse next year's ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's deader than Elvis,'' said Larry Huff, a spokesman for the
anti-gambling group Legacy Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Voters had been scheduled to decide the fate of video poker in a
statewide referendum Nov. 2. But the state Supreme Court ruled 5-0
Thursday that the measure unconstitutionally granted voters the
option to decide statewide policy themselves. The court kept intact
the part of the law, passed last session, that outlawed video poker
payoffs starting July 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we may view the task with disfavor, and may have
varying personal views on the merits of the controversy that
surrounds video gaming, we cannot ignore precedent and our duty to
interpret the constitution,'' said the unsigned South Carolina
Supreme Court decision.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville attorney Frank Eppes, who filed the suit on behalf of
Joytime Amusement Co., said he hasn't decided what to do, though he
doubts the U.S. Supreme Court would take up a state's rights issue.
Eppes has until Tuesday to request a reconsideration by the state's
highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the referendum had taken place and there was a `yes' vote,
opponents of gaming would have challenged the outcome and the court
would have ruled the same way,'' Eppes said. ``It was a case of
taking your medicine now or later.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen colorful, neon-lit game parlors sit jammed
between here and the North Carolina state line. Erin Delehant, 38,
owns one of them, State Line Video.
</P>
<P>
   ``When are they going to stop telling people how to live their
lives?'' Delehant asked.
</P>
<P>
   Delehant projects the Legislature ``will continue to juggle and
bounce around'' the issue, delaying or rescinding the July 1 ban.
He reasoned the machines contribute too much to state and local
taxes, payroll and legal fees to be eliminated by legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is most important in this country is the
dollar,'' said Delehant, sitting outside his 15-machine parlor
within sight of the North Carolina state line.
</P>
<P>
   When he was governor, David Beasley vowed to shut down video
poker, calling it a ``cancer'' on South Carolina. Outraged, video
poker operators shoveled $3 million into Hodges' campaign. Hodges
said he would let voters decide the fate of video gambling. The
issue turned Beasley into an unlikely upset victim _ a conservative
Christian elected by a core of Southern Baptists in the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some degree of vindication,'' Beasley said Thursday
from a conference of former governors in Nevada. ``But I would have
done it again. It was worth risking everything to see this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing other video gambling opponents, Beasley said the battle
is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video poker bought one branch of government, and they'll try
and influence another, whether ethically or unethically,'' Beasley
said. ``It's a very corrupt industry, and they'll do anything they
can to keep it going. It's going to be an all-out battle in the
Legislature. It's not over. They will try and do everything they
can.''
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina court decision came two days after Alabama
voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have
authorized a Georgia-style education lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest anti-gambling week in American history,''
said gambling expert Bill Thompson, a public administration
professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   During next year's general election, South Carolina voters will
vote on their own lottery proposal, which would fund HOPE
scholarships like Georgia's.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia lottery players from South Carolina represent the
highest group of out-of-state winners. Last year, South Carolinians
bought an estimated $112 million of Georgia lottery tickets _ 5.52
percent of the lottery's $2 billion in sales. However, if video
poker dies in South Carolina, Thompson and other gambling
researchers doubt those players would add much revenue to the
Georgia lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're close to Georgia they might buy a ticket,'' said
Thompson, in Columbia today for a forum on gambling. ``But they're
not going to drive 100 miles to play. It won't be a major shift.''

   &UR; WHAT MAKES WOMEN HAPPY &LR;

<P>
   Reporting on international polls about happiness levels for
various generations of women, the Economist finds that nostalgia
has a warm and fuzzy effect.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, an Angus Reid poll found, only 29 percent of modern
women feel they are happier than their grandmothers were. In the
United States, 28 percent of modern women think they are happier
than their grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So 71 percent of German women think their grandmothers living
under Hitler were happier,'' writes  &UR; Robert Kunze &LR; , ``and 72
percent of Americans think the Depression was a lot of laughs.''
Japan was the only country where a rousing majority of respondents,
82 percent, recognized that they were happier than their
grandmothers.

a dream that someone used my toothbrush _ this is such a, who's
that guy, Richard Bach, dream _ but that I had all these other

<P>
   PHOENIX - Many Thanksgivings ago, my cousins and I took their
German shorthaired pointer for a post-feast walk through a nearby
field in the New Jersey suburbs. I mentioned whatever dish their
paternal grandmother had whipped up and said she was a good cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' my cousin Kenny said, ``She's never eaten pasta
that came out of a box.''
</P>
<P>
   Their very Italian grandmother had clearly eaten her share of
pasta over the years. She made the staple several times a week,
Kenny said, but never from a box.
</P>
<P>
   As someone whose genes had been routed from northern Europe and
the British Isles, via a couple of generations in the Midwest, the
idea that pasta could originate from anywhere other than a box was
startling.
</P>
<P>
   I filed the concept of homemade pasta away in the
Isn't-That-Quaint section of my pre-adolescent brain. It would be
several years before the idea would resurface in the form of a menu
item, homemade fettuccine with veal.
</P>
<P>
   I ordered it. I tasted it. I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   There is something wonderful about a simple starch elevated to
near perfection. I have a Chinese cookbook that recommends
carefully prepared rice as a meal and encourages diners to
appreciate the steamed grains in and of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   If you have ever had sweet corn cooked within minutes of being
picked, you know that no other corn can compare.
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for homemade pasta. The fresh pasta in the grocery
refrigerator is not a bad compromise, but it's still a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   After eating homemade pasta for the first time, I refiled the
concept in my brain's Order-It-If-You-See-It-on-the-Menu folder.
</P>
<P>
   That lasted until a few years ago, when a friend had a yard sale
to jettison excess household goods before getting married. He
wanted to get rid of a shiny, imported, hand-cranked pasta machine.
I decided to take a stab at making my own, so I bought it.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of pasta machines. Owners of either type
will tell you that theirs is the best. I love my hand-powered
machine. I think it's the best. And there's no disputing that it's
the more traditional.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-cranked machines are a little harder to find, but are
available in some department-store kitchen departments, mall
specialty kitchen-supply stores and Italian delis.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, it consists of two rollers. A ball of dough is pulled
through the rollers, making a thick, flat strip. The rollers are
moved progressively closer together and the dough is run through,
making it progressively wider. When it's been through the roller,
it's called sheet, as in a sheet of pasta. Different end products
get rolled into sheets of varying thicknesses, but spaghetti,
linguine, angel hair, fettuccine and ravioli all start out as
sheet.
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast, there are commercial pastamakers that sell
sheets, which cuts the work by half or more. However, I don't know
of any in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The machine also includes hand-turned blades that cut the pasta
into various-size strips.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of machine is an all-American electronic kitchen
appliance. Its advantage is that it simplifies the process down to
dumping the ingredients into one end and waiting for the pasta to
come out the other. As a shortcut, the machine does an end run
around the sheet process. Instead, the pasta is extruded into
various shapes. This extrusion method is the way to go for tube
shapes such as ziti and rigatoni.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think the extruded fettuccine or other long noodles are
the equal of those made from sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Making pasta is an acquired skill, which means it gets easier
the more you do it. The first time you try it, give yourself lots
of time. The first time I cranked up my pasta machine, I served
dinner around 11:30 p.m. and my blood pressure was about 390 over
185. The second time, it took half as long. Now, it takes about an
hour, including 30 minutes for the dough to rest before rolling it
into sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I made pasta, I used plain old American white
all-purpose flour. The results came out more like Pennsylvania
Dutch egg noodles than pasta.
</P>
<P>
   The first rule of pastamaking is to use semolina flour. Right
off the bat, this gives you an advantage over many grocery-store
products. Some Valley grocery stores carry it, including AJ's.
</P>
<P>
   The second rule is to never add salt, no matter what the recipe
says. It will only detract from the texture of the dough. If you
want salt, add it to the water when you cook the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the pasta batch is in proportion to the number of
eggs you add. A one-egg batch serves two or three. A two-egg batch
serves four or five.
</P>
<P>
   I use a mixer to blend and knead the dough, which simplifies the
process. Both steps can be done by hand if you don't have a dough
hook on your mixer.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the flour, oil and egg(s.) Mix on low speed until
everything is blended together. It should have a course, crumbly
look like cornmeal. Add the water, a half tablespoon at a time, to
the dough until it begins to change from a crumbly mixture into a
dough. You want only enough water to hold it together, not enough
to make it spongy or batterlike.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, switch to a dough hook and knead the dough for 10
minutes. The dough should not be crumbling into separate pieces,
but it should not be sticky, either. If it's too dry, add a few
drops of water. If it's too moist, you can sprinkle in a tablespoon
of flour.
</P>
<P>
   Cover it with plastic wrap care fully, because dough exposed to
the air will dry quickly and be ruined. Let it sit for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This gives you time to have a glass of wine and get the sauce
simmering on a back burner.
</P>
<P>
   After the dough finishes its nap, tear or cut it into pieces
slightly bigger than golf balls. Cover everything back up except
the one you're working on.
</P>
<P>
   Set the pasta machine rollers for the widest opening.
</P>
<P>
   Turn the handle and run the ball through to make a thick, flat
oblong. Fold it in half and run it through again. Do this several
times. You'll see the dough become softer and more flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Then, adjust the rollers one notch to the second-widest opening
and run the oblong through again. My machine has five settings. I
never use the smallest opening because I generally make ravioli,
fettuccine and lasagna, which are thicker noodles.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to have a sheet almost exactly as wide as the
rollers by the time you're at the last step. The blades are the
same width, so this is the most efficient way to do it. Don't worry
if the sheet is a little short or not wide enough when you start
out. It'll be easier next time.
</P>
<P>
   Cover the piece of sheet. Reset the rollers to the widest
setting and get out another ball of dough. Repeat the above steps
until you have rolled all the dough into sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Gaze proudly at your handiwork for a second, then place the
blade attachment on the machine and get ready to cut the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Lightly flour the sheet to keep the cut pieces from sticking to
each other. Move the handle to the blade and turn the blades while
feeding the sheet in with your other hand. When two-thirds of the
sheet has been cut, let the machine pull the remainder through.
This frees up your other hand to catch the pasta and keep it from
clumping together. Hang the strips on a pasta rack or spread them
on a floured surface. The idea is to keep them separated from each
other, because they will try to turn themselves back into a lump of
dough when you're not looking.
</P>
<P>
   I'm told that sheet can be rolled out by hand and rolling pin if
you don't have a machine. The theory is that you roll the ball a
little, turn it 45 degrees. Roll it. Turn it. Repeat until you have
a thin sheet of pasta. Then you lightly flour the sheet and roll it
up into a cylinder. Slice the noodles off the end of the cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the water (always boil the water before you add the pasta).
Cut the remaining sheets. And get ready to eat.
</P>
<P>
   When cooking homemade pasta, always remember Henry Blake's
recipe for cooking a steak: ``Just show it the fire, Radar.'' Just
show it the water.
</P>
<P>
   A thin homemade pasta such as angel hair is done almost as fast
as you can put it in the water. Have your strainer ready in the
sink before you put the pasta in the boiling water. Pasta should
come to the top when it is done. A fettuccine or lasagna may take
up to 90 seconds to cook. Don't plan on a break while it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the pasta and water through the strainer. Don't rinse. The
pasta will continue to cook even after it's out of the pot, so it's
important to not boil it too long.
</P>
<P>
   Add a little olive oil or sauce and the pasta to the serving
bowl and lightly toss to coat the pasta and keep it from sticking
together. &QL;

One Egg Pasta and Variations &QL; 
(From Jon Sidener) &QL; 
One Egg Pasta: Makes 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup semolina flour
</P>
<P>
   1 egg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 teaspoons lukewarm water or milk
</P>
<P>
   Two Egg Pasta: Makes 3 to 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups semolina flour
</P>
<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   3/4 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 or 3 teaspoons lukewarm water or milk
</P>
<P>
   Three Egg Pasta: Makes 5 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   2 1/4 cups semolina flour
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 teaspoons lukewarm water or milk
</P>
<P>
   Mix flour, eggs and oil on low speed in a heavy-duty mixer until
mixture has a coarse, crumbly look, like corn meal. Add water or
milk a half tablespoon at a time until the mixture starts to hold
together.
</P>
<P>
   Switch to the dough hook on the mixer, or knead by hand. Knead
in mixer 7 to 10 minutes. Dough should not be sticky or in separate
pieces. Add a little more liquid if needed, or a little more flour
if sticky.
</P>
<P>
   If kneading by hand, turn out onto lightly floured board and
knead well for 7 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cover with plastic wrap and let dough rest 15 to 30 minutes. Set
pasta machine to widest opening. Roll out ball of dough just a
little larger than golf balls, then run through machine to make a
thick, fat oblong shape. Fold in half and run through again. Repeat
three or four times, then roll to desired thickness.
</P>
<P>
   Repeat until all balls of dough are rolled into sheets, keeping
all extras and finished sheets covered. Then put blade attachment
on pasta machine. Lightly flour the sheets of pasta to keep them
from sticking to each other. Run through the machine, using one
hand to crank and the other to hold the strips as they come out.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the strips on a pasta rack or a floured surface to dry.
</P>
<P>
   To cook, be sure water is at a full boil. Fresh pasta cooks very
quickly and will rise to the top of the water when done. Drain in a
colander; do not rinse. Because pasta will continue to cook after
it's done, be careful not to overcook. &QL;

THE WAY THEY WERE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was almost like the good old days before Newt
Gingrich spoiled the fun.
</P>
<P>
   Former Democratic House Speaker Thomas Foley returned to the
U.S. Capitol Wednesday and for a brief moment restored the mood of
mutual respect that evaporated when Gingrich's right-wing troops
seized control of the House five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's official portrait was unveiled amidst a burst of
bipartisan good will that included the present Republican speaker,
Dennis Hastert, and former Minority Leader Robert Michel. Big-name
Democrats, natch, turned out in droves to honor one of their best _
still a political role model to be admired.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the mood won't last. How nice if it would spread like a
permanent balm through the marble halls of our overrated,
overheated chief deliberative body.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's six years as speaker were recalled as a golden era of
legislative battle in which the vindictiveness and name-calling
that are now routine in Congress were rare. Michel observed, ``We
were political adversaries, but there was never an ill word spoken
between us ... and that's the way it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foley lost his longtime seat from Washington state and his
job as speaker in the 1994 Gingrich revolution. Civility and comity
in Washington, always a delicate business more honored in concept
than practice, went totally out of fashion. Tough, uncompromising
talk was in. Personal insults became the basic coin of exchange.
</P>
<P>
   As Foley's successor, Gingrich viewed the speaker's role as a
partisan hammer with which to beat up Democrats, not work with
them. He and his Democratic counterpart, Minority Leader Richard
Gephardt, barely spoke during the four years they shared the House
leadership. Foley and Michel actually liked each other and called
each other ``friend,'' but Gingrich and Gephardt are creatures
apart.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert has restored a kindly face to the speaker's role. With
only a six-vote margin of control, he has little choice but to be
more conciliatory than Gingrich, although this makes the GOP
hotheads call him weak. He stressed his respect for Foley and
praised him for ``dignity and purpose, always with fair and honest
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, a longtime Foley protege, never mentioned Gingrich's
name but managed to draw an unflattering contrast between the two
speakers with practically every sentence. Gephardt recalled Foley
was so honorable that ``when our members were clamoring to vote the
political way, Foley always brought us back to the right thing to
do, for country and for the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised Foley's sense of bipartisanship, noting that
when the speaker was about to disagree with someone he invariably
began by saying, ``With respect, I ... '' That was what it was all
about, Gephardt said. Mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing without being disagreeable. It reinforces the most
important function of politics _ serving as a substitute for
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Foley himself, now U.S. ambassador to Japan, was in fine fettle.
He recalled that when he was first elected to Congress in 1964, a
powerful House committee chairman warned the freshman class members
that the most dangerous thing they could do would be to ``think for
yourself.'' He told the newcomers that instead they should follow
the advice of their elders, their subcommittee chairmen, their
chairmen, their party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Foley was outraged. ``I was not about to subcontract out my vote
to others,'' he remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But times change, for us all. ``When I was sworn in as
speaker,'' he smiled, ``the wise words of that chairman came
favorably back to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is torn today, as it was then, between the demands of
party leaders that members fall into line and the independent
spirit that helped get the members elected in the first place. As
Foley noted, where you stand depends on where you sit, which makes
the joint pretty confusing.

   DISCO-MUSIC (subslug) (New York) _ When the Broadway musical
version of ``Saturday Night Fever'' opens on at the Thursday
Minskoff Theater, it should, by rights, look as quaint as the 1950s
of ``Grease'' did in the 1970s. ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the movie
released in 1977, marked the apogee of disco, a lucrative moment in
pop that quickly generated a backlash, a record-business crash and
a widespread repudiation. Twenty years is the usual nostalgia gap,
the time it takes for fond memory to replace the embarrassment of
succumbing to a long-gone trend; hence the Broadway-bound
``Saturday Night Fever,'' despite disparaging reviews of its London
production. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).

   SAME-OLD-SONG-FILM (Paris) _ Alain Resnais seemed quite amused
by the idea that it took him 35 years to have his first genuine box
office hit. Of course, at 77, he could well afford to display
nonchalance, what with his place in the history of modern cinema
having long been assured by his remarkable first two feature films,
``Hiroshima Mon Amour'' and ``Last Year at Marienbad.'' Even so,
the success of his latest movie, ``On Connait La Chanson,'' or
``Same Old Song,'' surprised him. Much of the charm of ``Same Old

   JOE-THE-KING-FILM (Undated) _ In ``Joe the King,'' which opened
on Friday, Frank Whaley has made an intensely affecting yet
unsentimental movie about a lost child. That the film contains a
large dollop of autobiography _ it is dedicated to his parents _
only makes this 36-year-old actor's achievement more striking.
``Joe the King'' is Whaley's first outing as a writer and director,
and if this is what's considered a small film, it's an
exceptionally rich one. The movie won the screenwriting award at
this year's Sundance Festival. By Karen Durbin. (Moved). Photo.

   AMERICAN-BALLET (Ne _ More than most dance companies,
American Ballet Theater prides itself on its versatility. And
rightly so. Last spring it presented ``Giselle'' and other Old
World heirlooms. For the fall season, which opens on Tuesday and
runs for two weeks at the City Center, the troupe will flaunt its
progressive side, taking on the macabre expressionism of Agnes de
Mille, the wry populism of Twyla Tharp and the quicksilver
partnering of Nacho Duato. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved). Photo.

   ST.-FRANCIS-OPERA (Undated) _ As it becomes clear that Gerard
Mortier will be replaced as director of the Salzburg Festival when
his contract expires in 2002, a new release of Olivier Messiaen's
lone, immense opera ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' which was present on
the program of his first year at the festival, is especially
timely. The new release (Deutsche Grammophon 445 176-2; four CDs),
was recorded at a revival last year. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).

   TRANSPOSED-MUSIC (New York) _ Transposition is in the news at
the Metropolitan Opera. Sir Charles Mackerras has just opened a run
of ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with three large chunks of the score
restored to the higher keys in which the composer originally wrote
them, and at the same time Placido Domingo is reprising two of his
most celebrated roles, the tragic clown of ``Pagliacci'' and the
tormented Moor of ``Otello,'' with adjustments in the other
direction to accommodate the autumnal range of his tenor voice.
Both circumstances are being discussed extensively _ even heatedly

Alan Lomax visited the Mississippi Delta to document its
African-American folk music. One of his major objectives was to
record the Delta's most famous cultural product, the blues.
``Mississippi the Blues Lineage'' (Rounder 11661-1825), whose

``a profound and unhurried meditation'' that can ``help change

capital's most prestigious, has organized the first systematic
examination of ``the scourge that has bled the country dry,'' as
she puts it, in an unsettling exhibition entitled ``Art and

   ARTISTS-RETREATS (Undated) _ In a late 20th-century version of
J.M.W. Turner's search for the untrammeled landscape, a small band
of contemporary artists is spending this month trekking in the
Himalayas, seeking fresh vision as well as fresh scenery. This is
part of new versions of the artist residency program in which
traditionally, artists retreat for sabbaticals in bucolic,

SENATE AGAIN DEBATES CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate began another long debate on campaign
finance reform Thursday, taking up a streamlined version of a
bipartisan bill introduced by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., that would ban unregulated ``soft money''
donations to political parties.
</P>
<P>
   But as the debate opened, the senators were still far short of
the 60 votes they need to stop a Republican-led filibuster against
the legislation, which is designed to curb the massive
contributions from special interests groups, corporations and
wealthy individuals that McCain says are ``corrupting'' the
nation's political system.
</P>
<P>
   The two sponsors remained hopeful that their decision to drop a
controversial provision of their measure that would have imposed
restrictions on so-called ``issue'' advertisements in campaigns
will persuade some opponents to change their minds. The two also
agreed to a five-daylong debate on the issue, during which members
would be allowed to offer amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to break this open,'' Feingold told reporters
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The House has already passed a much stronger version of campaign
finance legislation, and if enough senators end up supporting
``McCain-Feingold lite,'' as it's now being called, a compromise
bill would have to be worked out between House and Senate
conferees.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who has made campaign finance reform the centerpiece
of his run for the 2000 Republican presidential nomination,
acknowledged that the outcome this year is likely to be the same as
in previous years when he has tried to get his bill through a
Senate controlled by his own party.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., the leading opponent of the
measure, showed McCain just how hard he intends to fight it by
peppering his colleague with questions about what constitutes the
``corruption of government.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell hammered away at his Arizona colleague for nearly two
hours, and at one point challenged him to name lawmakers who had
engaged in corrupt practices on behalf of special interest
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no corruption, none whatsoever,'' McConnell told
McCain, who has spoken bluntly for years _ and now in his campaign
for the presidency _ about ``the corrupting influence'' of money on
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special interests have the right to participate in the
political process,'' said McConnell, who as director of the
Republican Senate Campaign Committee is in charge of raising
millions for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell added that he is ``extremely grateful'' that special
interest groups give their money to support get-out-the-vote
drives, advertising and other campaign-related efforts.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain continued to insist that ``soft money
distorts the legislative process'' by putting pressure on lawmakers
to back legislation and causes favored by big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a head-in-the-sand pretense ... to say that soft
money does not affect the legislative process,'' McCain said,
adding that the flow of unlimited and unregulated cash into
campaigns ``is impairing our integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold measure would ban the use in federal
campaigns of unlimited and unregulated soft money donations that
the Democratic and Republican parties have come to rely on to get
around federal limitations on contributions to individual
candidates. The money, which pours in from unions, business
interests, wealthy individuals and special interest groups with
their own agendas, is used to finance everything from voter drives
to negative commercials in the closing days of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the bill would force the parties and candidates to
adhere to strict spending and donation limitations imposed by
current federal law.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to win more support, McCain and Feingold dropped
the most controversial provision of their bill, which would have
dictated how and when so-called issue ads could be used in the
closing weeks of a campaign. The ads, often aired by anonymous
groups, are used to promote a negative image of a particular
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate started, President Clinton signaled his support
for the measure by sending a letter to Senate leaders urging its
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is challenging Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the
Republican nomination, has staked his presidential candidacy on
convincing Americans that the nation's campaign finance system is
preventing other vital government reforms from taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Recent public opinion polls in New Hampshire and other early
primary states indicate that McCain, who is now considered the
primary challenger to Bush for the nomination, is beginning to
strike a chord with voters. In New Hampshire, he has climbed to 21
percent in the polls as the favored GOP candidate, second only to
Bush who is still about 40 percent.

 &HT;    GORE'S FIRST TV AD SUPPORTS TEST BAN TREATY
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore moved Thursday to make the
2000 presidential campaign a referendum on nuclear weapons with the
broadcast of the first TV commercial of his White House bid _ a
60-second ad he wrote himself and filmed in a Seattle hotel room in
the wee morning hours after the Senate rejected a treaty banning
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   And at a conference on global trade with pro-business Democrats
later Thursday, Gore said the actions of the Republican majority of
the Senate, in voting down the treaty Wednesday, was ``breathlessly
reckless'' and ``goes against'' the national security advice of
military advisers in the Clinton, Bush, Reagan and Carter
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they do this? I think there was undeniably for some of
those who voted as they did an element of what feels like political
spitefulness,'' he told an audience of several hundred at the
Democratic Leadership Council's trade conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm wrong about that,'' he added. ``But there has never
been a time in my memory when issues of war and peace, issues of
nuclear security have been handled on a party-line vote in a
partisan atmosphere with personal invectives directed at the
commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore makes similar points in the TV ad, which was to run
nationally on CNN Thursday night. ``This vote goes against the tide
of history,'' the vice president says, according to a copy of the
script provided by campaign officials. ``Why don't we do something
about it?''
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Gore promises that, if elected president, he will
send the treaty back to the Senate ``with your demand that they
ratify it.'' He adds: ``We can change this mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president wrote the script on hotel stationery in
Seattle late Wednesday, then summoned a local TV production crew to
his hotel room to shoot the ad. He telephoned President Clinton
Thursday morning to notify him of his plans to make the treaty a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had originally planned a biographical ad for his first TV
spot later in the campaign. But he told reporters on the flight
from Seattle to Washington that he felt so strongly about the
Senate's actions that he chose to make the treaty the subject of
his first ad instead.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy is rarely a big factor in presidential politics
and treaties even less so. But Gore became an expert on strategic
arms during his 16 years in Congress. And his TV ad indirectly
points up the lack of foreign policy experience on the part of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the front-runner for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, like most of the Republican members of the Senate, opposes
the treaty. But a poll conducted last summer by Democrat Mark
Mellman and Republican Richard Wirthlin found that 80 percent of
Americans are against nuclear testing.

 &HT;    Bradley's Internet irregulars helping boost support
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ Bill Bradley doesn't know it, but the secret
weapon of his presidential campaign lives in the basement of a
split-level house in this leafy suburb of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Greg Laynor. He is 14 years old. He studies world
civilization and Latin at the local high school, where he just
started as a freshman. He doesn't drive and he won't cast his first
vote for president until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But this gawky teen-ager, who began using computers at the age
of 5, is at the forefront of how the Internet is changing political
dialogue in America and giving voice to a new class of political
activist.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Laynor started a Web site supporting Bradley,
whom he has always admired, from his basement computer. Soon,
Laynor was corresponding via e-mail with other Internet users
around the country who liked Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Heller, a sophomore at Ohio's Oberlin College, suggested
they move the site to a larger Internet server, one that would
support more information and more traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Web site (www.netizensforbradley.org) serves as the
unofficial Bill Bradley for president Web site, using some of the
Web's latest technology to link together about 500 hard-core
supporters and thousands of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   It hosts live chat sessions about Bradley and features
electronic bulletin boards, one for each state, where supporters
can post messages about organizing for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' of New York is looking for volunteers to circulate
petitions to get Bradley on the primary ballot there. ``Steve'' of
Florida is urging Bradley supporters to attend the state Democratic
convention in December.
</P>
<P>
   The site has spawned BostonForBradley.org and
studentsforbradley, an off-shoot of that site. Supporters in
Austin, Texas, are launching their own site soon.
</P>
<P>
   This week, users bombarded AFL-CIO President John Sweeney with
e-mails urging him to withhold labor's endorsement of Vice
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just organizing,'' said Laynor, a slender teen who wears
braces. ``I don't think there is anything like this for any other
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as Laynor, even those younger than voting age,
also are creating new headaches for regulators at the Federal
Election Commission. The FEC is considering whether such
computer-driven organizing is an independent expenditure subject to
FEC disclosure requirements, a finding that Internet users would
vigorously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you try to regulate a medium that is unregulatable,
global and ubiquitous?'' said Phil Noble, president of
PoliticsOnline. ``You can have a `Bill Bradley is a jerk' Web site
that is hosted in the Ukraine, developed by programmers in Fiji and
funded by credit card contributions all over the world. How is the
FEC going to deal with it? It's almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, which asked the FEC to clarify
its rules with regard to the Internet, wants answers to difficult
questions. What is the value of e-mail? What about volunteers who
use the Internet to raise money?
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the rules are written now forces campaigns into the
position of almost discouraging the free voices of the Internet,''
said Ben Ginsberg, a lawyer for Bush's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When Bradley's campaign found out about Laynor, the campaign's
lawyer directed campaign staff to avoid having any contact with the
Web site or its creators, advising them that they might run afoul
of FEC regulations prohibiting coordination with outside groups.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign modified its disclosure statement on its own Web
site, www.billbradley.com, to spell out that it was Bradley's one,
only and official campaign Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Bradley doesn't appreciate what Laynor is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great,'' said Lynn Reed, Bradley's Internet consultant.
``We've got to have lots of Greg Laynors out there if we are going
to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Every candidate for president, of course, has a Web site,
offering visitors campaign information. Most also allow visitors to
make a credit card contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, Gore and Elizabeth Dole also are using their sites to
develop e-mail lists of supporters. The Bradley database, for
example, is up to about 40,000. When Bradley visits a state, the
campaign alerts supporters so they can turn out to support him.
</P>
<P>
   But what the official sites aren't doing, and what Laynor and
his fellow ``netizens'' are, is creating a medium where supporters
can talk to each other, via e-mail, weekly on-line chats and
postings on electronic bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supporters talking to supporters,'' said Laynor, who
convinced his father to drive with him to New Hampshire to canvass
for Bradley this summer. ``People feel like they are a part of the
campaign _ that they are making a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Laynor is a child of the Internet age. His mother
is a librarian. His father is a college text book salesman. Both
use computers in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Greg grew up with computers _ the family now has five. And he
has grown up with the rapid explosion of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Laynor's mother said her son spent about ``a zillion hours''
this summer hunched over his computer in the basement developing
his netizens site. ``We couldn't get him to do anything else,''
Barbara Laynor said.
</P>
<P>
   About 15 people scattered around the country, from Texas to New
Jersey, maintain the site, which just added a new feature that
tells users how to write letters to the editor on behalf of
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Laynor reads and answers scores of e-mails every day. He has
never spoken to, or even met, Heller, the Ohio college student.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I should call him one of these days,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that school has started, Laynor's parents are encouraging
their son to spend less time on the computer and more time on his
other school work, such as a pesky geography map he had to draw
recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, what he's doing,'' said his father, Dennis
Laynor. ``I just don't want it to interfere with his Latin exam or
geometry.''

 &HT;    Bradley's Internet irregulars helping boost support
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. _ Bill Bradley doesn't know it, but the secret
weapon of his presidential campaign lives in the basement of a
split-level house in this leafy suburb of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Greg Laynor. He is 14 years old. He studies world
civilization and Latin at the local high school, where he just
started as a freshman. He doesn't drive and he won't cast his first
vote for president until 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But this gawky teen-ager, who began using computers at the age
of 5, is at the forefront of how the Internet is changing political
dialogue in America and giving voice to a new class of political
activist.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Laynor started a Web site supporting Bradley,
whom he has always admired, from his basement computer. Soon,
Laynor was corresponding via e-mail with other Internet users
around the country who liked Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Heller, a sophomore at Ohio's Oberlin College, suggested
they move the site to a larger Internet server, one that would
support more information and more traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Web site (www.netizensforbradley.org) serves as the
unofficial Bill Bradley for president Web site, using some of the
Web's latest technology to link together about 500 hard-core
supporters and thousands of visitors.
</P>
<P>
   It hosts live chat sessions about Bradley and features
electronic bulletin boards, one for each state, where supporters
can post messages about organizing for Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' of New York is looking for volunteers to circulate
petitions to get Bradley on the primary ballot there. ``Steve'' of
Florida is urging Bradley supporters to attend the state Democratic
convention in December.
</P>
<P>
   The site has spawned BostonForBradley.org and
studentsforbradley, an off-shoot of that site. Supporters in
Austin, Texas, are launching their own site soon.
</P>
<P>
   This week, users bombarded AFL-CIO President John Sweeney with
e-mails urging him to withhold labor's endorsement of Vice
President Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just organizing,'' said Laynor, a slender teen who wears
braces. ``I don't think there is anything like this for any other
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists such as Laynor, even those younger than voting age,
also are creating new headac regulators at the Federal
Election Commission. The FEC is considering whether such
computer-driven organizing is an independent expenditure subject to
FEC disclosure requirements, a finding that Internet users would
vigorously oppose.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you try to regulate a medium that is unregulatable,
global and ubiquitous?'' said Phil Noble, president of
PoliticsOnline. ``You can have a `Bill Bradley is a jerk' Web site
that is hosted in the Ukraine, developed by programmers in Fiji and
funded by credit card contributions all over the world. How is the
FEC going to deal with it? It's almost impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush's campaign, which asked the FEC to clarify
its rules with regard to the Internet, wants answers to difficult

</P>

of FEC regulations prohibiting coordination with outside groups.

   SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ These are the lessons from Tuesday's class
at Southampton College:
</P>
<P>
   _ A smart budget has more money coming in than going out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not make the password for your ATM card something obvious,
like your birthday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay the full balance on credit cards, if possible, but
definitely more than the minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in college, I had a roommate who thought as long as
she had a checkbook with checks in it, she could write checks,''
Suzette Carlow, a guest lecturer from European American Bank, told
the students. ``That's not the way it works.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly macroeconomics. Rather, it is College 101, a
one-credit seminar required of all new students. Highlights of the
syllabus: ``Values _ What Matters to You?'' and ``Home for the
Holidays: Readjusting.''
</P>
<P>
   The course at Southampton, a campus of Long Island University,
is part of a proliferation of life-skills seminars nationwide, with
more than 70 percent of colleges and universities offering some
sort of academic class designed to help students adjust to
adulthood and campus life. The trend has exploded over the last
decade, as budget-strapped and consumer-oriented colleges have
battled high dropout rates, and have searched for strategies to
increase student success.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with large groups of immigrants and first-generation
college students pushing enrollments to record numbers,
administrators say the courses are critical. Besides teaching
skills like how to balance a checkbook and deal with the opposite
sex, the classes also create a comfortable environment of
small-group discussions in a world often dominated by droning
lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us who went to college 20 or 30 years ago managed to
handle this on our own,'' said Betsy foot, until recently
the co-director of the National Resource Center for the Freshman
Year Experience at the University of South Carolina in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barefoot acknowledged that the courses, ``to many people,
seem like hand-holding and coddling,'' but she and John Gardner,
the University of South Carolina historian who is considered the
father of the modern life-skills movement, said they are a
necessary adjustment to the changes in higher education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of people who are going to college now are not those
for whom colleges were historically designed,'' Gardner said.
``It's really very subversive. It's about changing the structures
and policies of college to make it more realistic for the people we
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals range from improved note-taking to better self-esteem
and a deeper connection to the college community. The lesson plans
can be as unconventional as the subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, students must attend
a campus event _ a lecture, a basketball game, even a house party _
and write a paper about it.
</P>
<P>
   At California State University at Chico, a class reads the
town's alternative newspaper one week and embarks on a quest for
the best hamburgers in the neighborhood the next. At the Carolinas
College of Health Sciences in Charlotte, N.C., one instructor has
each student draw ``a negative self-picture'' and then she burns
them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the courses include an orientation workshop with the
campus e-mail system _ often followed by mandatory e-mail journals
submitted weekly _ and a field trip to the library.
</P>
<P>
   ``A college library today?'' Ms. Barefoot said. ``Even I need
help.''
</P>
<P>
   Those involved in what they call the ``first-year experience
movement'' say the first life-skills course dates from 1882, at a
community college in Kentucky. The modern version started at the
University of South Carolina in 1972, in an era of student protest,
as administrators tried to cultivate a sense of citizenship within
the university.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Students were, and still are, taught ``The Carolinian Creed,''
six principles that form a code of honor for the school. The course
started as pass/fail, but now is letter-graded, with midterm and
final exams.
</P>
<P>
   Word spread. And spread. In 1981, about one in five colleges had
such classes; now, it is more like three out of four, the resource
center said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming a Master Student,'' a textbook that includes ``The
seven-day anti-procrastination plan'' and an article headlined
``Crazed Glazed Donut Runs Amok,'' has sold 3 million copies, and
is just one of about 50 such handbooks on the market.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Freshman Year Experience newsletter, an academic
journal (articles include ``New Student Disorientation: Becoming a
Member of an Academic Community'' and ``Is There Life After the
Freshman Seminar''), annual conferences and an e-mail discussion
group with 1,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that about 85 percent of the classes are for
credit, but typically one credit instead of three, the standard
amount for an academic course. The majority are graded, and taught
by a mix of faculty and staff members.
</P>
<P>
   A few colleges, particularly elite ones, just try to integrate
life lessons into a freshman seminar on an academic subject, but
most make orientation the centerpiece of the life-skills
curriculum, mixing tutorials on how to take proper notes with
sessions urging students to join campus clubs. The trend stretches
from community colleges to selective liberal arts campuses to large
research universities, every place from Ithaca College to the
University of Maryland to the Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the curriculum, including substance abuse, sexual
harassment and multicultural relations, used to be covered over
pizza in the dorm lounge during orientation. Taking these topics
into the classroom, instructors say, lends more seriousness and
reflects a belief that social problems are linked to grade-point
averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall goal here is promoting academic success,'' Gardner
said. ``If a student has a propensity for acquiring a sexually
transmitted disease, that's very likely to deter academic success.
Drinking certainly affects academic success. It affects class
attendance, it affects your concentration ability, it affects your
dietary habits, your sleep habits. All of that relates to academic
success.''
</P>
<P>
   But some say the courses should be more narrowly focused on
skills crucial to the classroom, like note-taking, close reading
and time management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without sounding too much like a snob, we are in the business
of higher education,'' said B. Thomas Lowe, a dean for first-year
students at Ball State University in Muncie, Ind., scoffing at the
notion of giving students course credit for learning the names of
campus buildings or discussing roommate problems, common items on
life-skills syllabuses. ``While checkbook balancing and the like
are important, they must be learned elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Research suggests that the introduction of life-skills courses
has helped increase retention rates at open-enrollment schools by
about 10 percentage points, and that students who take the courses
earn higher grades in academic courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one credit,'' said Christopher Lynch, director of
the Freshman Seminar at Kean University in Union, N.J., one of many
schools where a life-skills course is required. ``But it's the most
important credit, because this is the course that motivates
students for success.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many campuses also offer specialized seminars for specific
groups of students, for example future teachers, business majors,
older students, the disabled, or athletes, and include career
planning in the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   At a session of ``Life Skills for Athletes'' at the University
of Connecticut in Storrs this fall, a panel of upperclassmen gave
the new students advice on everything from homesickness to handling
criticism from coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to class as much as possible,'' Erin Layton, a softball
player now in graduate school, said to a room in which several
heads lay on tables. ``Yes, you're going to be tired. If the
professor sees you every day, then if you have to leave early to
catch a bus, or miss class, they might understand.''
</P>
<P>
   When absent, she added, get several classmates' notes. ``One
person can be unreliable,'' Ms. Layton said. ``They may be
sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleep _ How much is enough? Are catnaps worthwhile? _ is a hot
subject in the required freshman seminar at the University of New
Haven, where a homework assignment asked students to keep an
hour-by-hour time sheet for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Nick D'Amato, a baseball recruit from Mystic, Conn., had ample
sections blocked off for sleep, and several marked ``chill with
friends.'' Monday from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. was filled with S-E-X,
while Friday from 7:30 p.m. to 1 a.m. was simply, ``party.'' The
calendar did not have room for the 24 hours per week of study time
the instructor said was suggested for a 12-credit course load.
</P>
<P>
   Students in the University of New Haven classes said the
lectures and videos on study skills were often boring review, but
that they liked having a place where they could talk about their
problems, and form a kind of community with classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite class, for one reason: We actually get to
interact with each other,'' said Branden Morgan, 18, of Newport
Beach, Calif. ``My other classes, the teacher just sits up there
and blah, blah, blah.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's comments came after a heated discussion of drinking and
date rape, where students raised different colored pieces of paper
to indicate whether they agreed (green) or disagreed (pink) with a
set of controversial statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes women invite sexual assault by their actions,
appearances or behavior,'' the instructor said, and all of a sudden
Lyn Fockler, clutching pink, founded herself alone in a classroom
crowded with green.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintively yet forcefully, Ms. Fockler, a 17-year-old forensic
science major from San Francisco, complained that if she wore a
tube top rather than her bulky sweatshirt, she would be more likely
to be harassed, or even attacked, than a man strolling shirtless
down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because you're a woman,'' Morgan said from across the
room. ``It's been that way since the beginning of time. It's always
going to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just going to have to accept that,'' added Brett
Ortola, 20, of Berlin, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to accept that,'' insisted Ms. Fockler, a petite
woman who wears a buzz cut and several hoops in her ears. ``You
don't deserve to be harassed. It doesn't matter what you wear. It
doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman seminar teachers at several campuses said the
discussions of sex and drugs, diversity and homosexuality, are
typically the most volatile, but that students often also praise
the more practical sessions, like the library visit.
</P>
<P>
   At Southampton, a serene 1,200-student campus whose rolling
hills resemble the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club across the street,
students asked few questions during the banking lecture, but
listened attentively. Several even took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I'd had this workshop when I was a freshman,'' said
Lisa McCluskey, 21, a senior who was a teaching assistant for the
class. ``I wouldn't be $1,500 in debt right now.''

American, a court-appointed scientific panel reported Thursday, but

Salmon, Wash., has been fasting for 39 days now in an effort to

   FILM-FIGHT (Undated) _ ``Fight Club'' is a dangerously

ANTI-ISRAEL JORDANIANS COMPILE LIST OF COUNTRYMEN WITH TIES TO
`ENEMY' 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ They are making a list, and they are checking it
twice. Then they plan to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The still-secret registry includes the names of about 300
Jordanians who the list makers say consort with ``the enemy'' _
Israel, the country with which Jordan signed a landmark peace
treaty five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month, they say, they will begin naming names, starting
with those involved in what they consider the 40 or so most
egregious cases. These include politicians and journalists who have
openly visited Israel, artists who advocate across-the-border
cultural exchange, academics engaged in research with Israel and
the Palestinian Authority, and a handful of local entrepreneurs in
U.S.-encouraged ventures with Israeli partners.
</P>
<P>
   This preliminary blacklist is the latest project of Jordan's
increasingly visible ``anti-normalization'' movement, which seeks
to ostracize any Jordanians who have cordial or collaborative
relations with Israel. The self-proclaimed anti-normalizers say
they want to boycott the products of the accused, scare away their
clients, force them out of government and strip them of the guild
memberships they need to practice their professions.
</P>
<P>
   Many take the threat seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-normalizers are not marginal figures: Their backers
include such bastions of the establishment as the national bar
association. A gathering of anti-normalization forces in September
drew more than 400 representatives of leading unions and business
associations, and 13 of Jordan's 20 registered political parties.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem out of character for a country that has
distinguished itself by embracing the cause of peace. That is
certainly the view of King Abdullah; since assuming the throne in
February, he has continued the peacemaking efforts of his late
father, King Hussein, and worked to strengthen Jordan's still
minimal trade and investment with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   (King Abdullah met with President Clinton in Washington on
Tuesday to discuss Jordan's efforts to promote Israeli negotiations
with Syria and the Palestinian Authority.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am uncomfortable with the way that certain groups in the
country try to put their views on the majority and try to
intimidate people,'' said King Abdullah when asked in a recent
interview about the anti-normalization campaign. ``I do not think
that this is the Jordan that His Majesty King Hussein wanted, or
that we want for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But the leader of the country's biggest political party, a vocal
advocate of the anti-normalization drive, contends that he
represents the majority viewpoint. Jordan's relationship with
Israel ``can never be normal,'' the official, Muslim Brotherhood
chairman Abdel Majeed al-Dhniebat, asserted in an interview,
``because they are not a peaceful people, the Jews _ they are not
civilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's 1994 treaty with Jordan ``was the peace of the
victorious against the vanquished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the anti-normalization campaign began in the last years
of King Hussein's reign, it has become increasingly strident and
public under King Abdullah, who seems more tolerant of vocal
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Abu Sukar, the energetic coordinator of the drive, says at
least 20 people on the list have already approached him, promising
to cease activities to which the group objects in exchange for
keeping their names unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   Sukar says he embraced the cause for one simple reason: ``I am a
Muslim man, and the Jewish people are our enemy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his newly remodeled downtown offices, with his meticulously
trimmed beard, crisply starched shirt and fashionable tie, the
38-year-old Sukar is the very picture of the successful young
Jordanian urban professional. He is president of the national
association of civil engineers and is a leading force in the
umbrella organization of professional groupings to which lawyers,
doctors, architects, journalists and others are obliged to belong.
</P>
<P>
   These associations have all endorsed his campaign against
``normalization,'' defined in a joint resolution as ``any activity
that would break the psychological barrier of hostility between
Arabs and the Jewish state.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (A clash between Israelis and Jordanian lawmakers Oct. 9
provided fuel to those who object to normal relations with Israel.
A band of Jewish settlers attacked a Jordanian parliamentary
delegation visiting Hebron, a West Bank city under Palestinian
governance but Israeli security control. Instead of protecting the
Jordanians, Israeli soldiers subjected them to body searches,
according to House Speaker Abdul Hadi Majali, who called the
experience ``humiliating.'' Jordan protested the incident.)
</P>
<P>
   Enmity toward Israel is strongest among the more than 1 million
Palestinians still in refugee camps here, but analysts say their
attitudes are shared by much of the educated middle class, which is
also predominately Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Sukar's family history is typical, as is his inherited
resentment. His Palestinian father was born in Lod, once a quiet
Arab village and now the site of Ben-Gurion International airport
in Israel. He fled to Jordan as a destitute refugee during the 1948
Israeli war of independence, never to return. ``Israel is our
enemy, because it usurped our land,'' Sukar said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah Hasanat, editor of the state-owned Jordan Times, is
among those who expects to appear on Sukar's blacklist. For
traveling to an academic conference in Haifa, Israel, he already
faces expulsion from the Jordanian journalists union.
</P>
<P>
   Hasanat is hopeful that his government-appointed superiors will
not make his continued employment contingent on union membership.
But for rank-and-file reporters in most publications, the loss of a
union card would mean instant dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absurd,'' he said, noting that Israeli reporters travel
frequently and freely to Jordan. ``We have to engage the Israelis
somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sukar disagrees. He opposes not just government or corporate
ties between Jordan and Israel, but any Arab-Israeli
fraternization. He says Palestinians who live intermingled with
Israelis in East Jerusalem and the West Bank should take special
care to avoid voluntary dealings with Israelis _ as business
partners, or even as tennis partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sons, our children will look upon the Israelis as friends
if we have a normal relationship with these people,'' Sukar
explained. ``That is the danger: When they grow up, when their
generation becomes strong, they have to be ready to fight for what
is rightfully theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, Sukar's public targets have included Palestinians
visiting from the West Bank, most of them fervent nationalists. In
the past year the anti-normalization forces protested appearances
by a Palestinian playwright who has worked with Israeli actors and
an Israeli Arab poet who publishes a magazine that like most
literary publications in Israel, receives state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   In September Sukar's group persuaded the Jordanian Artists
Association to revoke the membership of the director of Amman's
annual theater festival because he had invited a repertory troupe
from Jerusalem _ Arab East Jerusalem, to be sure, and wholly
Palestinian in ethnicity and outlook, but including a few
performers who hold Israeli passports.
</P>
<P>
   Passing Sukar's litmus test can be tough. At September's
convention, organizers tried to silence representatives from the
Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a faction
responsible for devastating terrorist attacks against Israel. The
complaint: the group's leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, had shaken the hand
of Israel's president at King Hussein's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Others singled out for reprisals are groups supported by the
Ford Foundation, an institution Sukar says is permeated by
``Israeli and Jewish influence.'' He considers grants from the
Frederich Eibert and Konrad Adenauer foundations equally
objectionable. ``They are based in Germany, but there is also
influence from Israel,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments make liberal Jordanians cringe. Even for those
who adamantly reject detente with Israel, the anti-normalization
strategy ``makes no sense,'' Hasanat said. ``If they are the enemy,
go and study them. Know thine enemy. The Israelis have been doing
this with us for 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah says confidently that the anti-normalization
movement should evaporate once Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak complete their peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get the Palestinians and the Israelis to sit down
so that in a very short period of time, these people will have no
case,'' he said. ``If there is normalization between Palestinians
and Israelis, it will be very difficult for Jordanians to have any
gripes about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sukar is almost as opposed to Arafat as he is to Israel, and
he vows to continue the campaign until Palestinians reclaim all
their ancestral lands. ``If there are two teams, the winners and
the losers, those who happen to be on the losing side should not be
forced to have normal relations with the winners,'' he said. &QL;

 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate proved Wednesday night with its
rejection of the nuclear test-ban treaty that it can stop one of
President Clinton's policy initiatives in its tracks. But Clinton
proved Thursday afternoon that he still knows how to wield his
office as a powerful political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress has used its power in recent days
not only to kill the treaty, but to turn down one of Clinton's
judicial nominations, block his efforts to provide low-cost
prescription drugs under Medicare, and sidetrack his proposals on
education, child care and tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, as he has so often before, has employed a form of
political jujitsu to turn these Republican ``victories'' into
political campaign themes by portraying them as reckless defiance
of the national interest or public will.
</P>
<P>
   And he showed last week that he can still manage an occasional
legislative victory, with the vote in the House on a managed-care
plan that met many of his long-held goals, while also showing the
weakness of House Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
will come back to haunt them, Clinton argued in his news conference
Thursday afternoon. What he called their isolationism, partisanship
and indifference to public opinion will be powerful arguments
against them in the coming political year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By this vote, the Senate majority has turned its back on 50
years of American leadership against the spread of weapons of mass
destruction,'' Clinton said in a rehearsal of a campaign speech
likely to be delivered on behalf of Democratic candidates over the
next year. ``They are betting our children's future on the reckless
proposition that we can go it alone, that... we should bury our
heads in the sand behind a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president nears his final year in the White House, he is
no longer running for office, only for a place in history. And
while he continues to prove adept at embarrassing his enemies, he
may end up with little to show for the last 15 months of his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ironic thing is that Bill Clinton could have a successful
year,'' said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster who is no fan of
the president. ``But he's so intent on destroying Congress'
reputation that he'll end up destroying his own. He could get tax
relief, budget reform, Social Security reform, but he'll end up
with none of it, by his own choice, because he just wants to play
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Luntz was expressing a view commonly held by Republicans _ that
everything Clinton does is for partisan political advantage.
Clinton is suspected by the Republicans of sending phony budgets to
Capitol Hill, knowing they will be rejected, so that he can accuse
Republicans of insensitivity to the poor, the old and the infirm.
</P>
<P>
   There were whispers this week that the administration mounted
only a tardy and halfhearted defense of the test-ban treaty because
Clinton wanted an issue for Democrats to use in the 2000 campaign.
White House officials denied that, and Clinton acknowledged
Thursday that he was unprepared for the rapid treaty debate and
vote.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the ill will between Clinton and the
Republicans that they suspect him of engineering humiliating
defeats for political advantage. But he certainly has learned how
to use the powers he retains _ the veto, the bully pulpit and the
unilateral foreign policy action _ against a Senate that can vote
down treaties and torpedo judicial and ambassadorial nominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president and the Democratic Party still are effective
players on many issues, including the ongoing budget negotiations,
patients' bill of rights and gun control,'' said John Isaacs of
Council for a Livable World. ``And there is, moreover, no reason
why Bill Clinton can't be successful on a number of foreign policy
issues as he tries to help secure a Middle East peace settlement,
work more for a final settlement in Ireland or improved relations
with China. But any international agreement requiring a two-thirds
majority in the U.S. Senate over the next 15 months I think you can
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In his news conference Thursday, Clinton explicitly threatened
to veto any spending bills that in his view shortchange education
or health care. He knows he holds the poll-tested high ground with
the public on these issues, and he intends to try to cement a
public view of congressional Republicans as tightfisted and
uncaring.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was clearly trying to link in the public mind the
Republicans' action on the treaty and their hard line on taxes and
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just reinforces the hardened, partisan, ideological image
that exists of this Congress,'' said Rahm Emanuel, a former senior
adviser to the president. ``These people are hellbent on their own
political destruction. The only thing that unites them is their
antipathy to Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   That anger, which boiled over this week, augurs poorly for
meaningful compromise on budgets, social programs, trade and
foreign policy, said Stephen Hess, an expert on the presidency at
the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hess, who worked in the Eisenhower, Nixon and Carter
administrations, said that the presidency is like an hourglass,
with the sand pouring inexorably through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the eighth year of any presidency is not very
productive,'' Hess said. ``Theoretically, there is hope of some
accomplishment over the next 14 months, but in the 40 years I've
watched politics, I have never seen the depth of the animosity the
Congress has for this president, and vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Presidents Eisenhower and Reagan, who were the two oldest
men to serve in the presidency, Clinton is young and energetic and
wants to make a mark as the clock ticks down. Especially because he
lost a year to scandal and much of the first half of this year to
the conflict in Kosovo, he is impatient to achieve at least a
measure of his still-ambitious domestic agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legitimate differences of opinion, but we can put an
end to reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,''
Clinton said hopefully Thursday afternoon. ``We can put people
first and make a principled, honorable compromise. We can work for
a season of progress, not a winter of politics. And I am committed
to do just that.''

TEXAS KILLER APPARENTLY BECAME ENRAGED BY WIFE'S INFIDELITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTON, Texas _ Friends of the young gunman who killed three
law enforcement officers in an ambush described him Thursday as a
likable, hard-working man who was distraught over marital problems.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Vodochodsky, 19, his wife and two children lived with
Jeremiah Engleton and his wife and 15-month-old daughter for the
last six or seven months in their double-wide mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   Vodochodsky, a friend from San Antonio who had known Engleton
for 11 years, said the two of them worked together on a
construction job in nearby Pearsall. Engleton, 21, was deeply upset
and depressed about an affair his wife had had months earlier,
Vodochodsky said, and often cried and talked to Vodochodsky's wife
about the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was stressed out read bad, depressed ... He found out about
it, and they've been trying to work it out, but it wasn't worked
out,'' he said. ``So that's mainly why they argued so much. He was
too hurt to even look at her every day. That's why they'd fight so
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Engleton's anger, his friend said, ``I didn't think that
he'd do this.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, about six hours after his release from jail for
beating his wife, Violet, Engleton made a phony 911 call from his
home and lay in wait for officers to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   He systematically killed Atascosa County Sheriff's deputies
Thomas Monse, 31, who had arrested him earlier that day, Mark
Stephenson, 31, and state trooper Terry Miller, 37. He wounded two
others and held 75 officers and state troopers off for two more
hours before shooting himself in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Tommy Williams could only speculate that Engleton may
have been angry at officers for jailing him after he beat his wife.
When he got out of jail, she wasn't home because a county family
violence counselor had convinced her to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Police found photographs of Violet Engleton in the trash after
her husband's shooting rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Engleton also had been arrested in April for hitting his wife,
but not as violently, the sheriff said, as the episode that caused
his arrest early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Engleton's mother, Renita, agreed with Vodochodsky's assessment
of her son and his claims that his wife had had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``She loved Jeremiah very much and he loved her,'' Renita
Engleton said. ``But he just was not willing to forgive her for
what had happened. It hurt him too deeply.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that her daughter-in-law had spent much of Thursday
with her. But Violet Engleton could not be located for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Most neighbors of the Engletons _ who had moved to the
subdivision of mesquite- and cactus-dotted, five-acre lots less
than a year ago _ knew of nothing amiss.
</P>
<P>
   Resident Wayne Thomas, 44, plant manager for a peanut company,
said Engleton was a polite neighbor who was always ready to help.
``He wasn't at all sullen. ... He would always wave. I told my wife
he would be a good addition (to the neighborhood).''
</P>
<P>
   Other neighbors gave similar assessments, although some said
they were troubled that he often liked to shoot guns at night.
Engleton's firearms collection included the Chinese-made SKS
semiautomatic rifle he used to shoot the officers, plus three
pistols and a shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Renita Engleton said her son had wanted to live in the country
for a long time, and had ``scraped and saved'' to buy the land and
mobile home in the San Antonio bedroom community best known for
ranching and deer hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Engleton worked relentlessly to clear the land
and put in a septic tank.
</P>
<P>
   `` He just had too much stress, too much pressure, and somebody
did something to make him snap,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   She believes her son's rage was triggered by an undisclosed
``culprit'' and she wondered if something might have happened in
jail that made him snap.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said nothing out of the ordinary happened during
Engleton's arrest or the nearly 12 hours that he was in the county
jail in Jourdanton.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his arrests for domestic violence, Engleton did not
appear to have a criminal record as an adult. However, a scuffle
with San Antonio police in 1991 over an argument over bus fare
resulted in his suing the police. The suit was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Vodochodsky said that the final fight between
Engleton and his wife was over a trivial event: The family dog, a
Rottweiler named Chaos, chased their lone milk cow away. Engleton
wanted his wife to track down the cow, Vodochodsky said, and she
refused.
</P>
<P>
   But that minor episode was not at the heart of their problems,
he said. It was always the affair.

U.S. FORCES CAPTURED A NAZI `GOLD TRAIN' AND LATER LOOTED
VALUABLES

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last weeks of World War II, as Soviet troops
advanced from the east, Nazi officials in Hungary ordered that a
train be sent west toward Germany with the collected wealth of
Hungary's decimated Jews. Their wedding bands alone filled crate
after crate.
</P>
<P>
   American troops intercepted the train in Austria, in May 1945,
and moved its contents _ gold, silver, paintings, furs _ to a
warehouse near Salzburg. But according to a preliminary report
released Thursday by U.S. investigators, the Americans were neither
careful nor selfless custodians.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffing pleas from the Hungarian government and surviving
Hungarian Jews, U.S. officials declared the valuables
``unidentifiable'' and refused to let the Hungarians inspect them.
Then, while the fate of the loot was being resolved, the report
said, the Americans apparently helped themselves.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents cited by the investigators, Gen. Harry J.
Collins, the commander of U.S. forces in the area, requisitioned
silver and china from the warehouse, ordering that it be ``of the
very best quality and workmanship available in the land.'' He
furnished his Austrian villa with some of the Hungarians' carpets
and silver candlesticks, and his senior officers followed suit.
</P>
<P>
   Clocks, jewelry and furs that had belonged to Hungarian Jews
were appropriated by the Army and sold to soldiers. A pair of
suitcases filled with gold dust disappeared, the researchers found,
and other property was stolen from the warehouse by soldiers,
apparently with the collusion of the guards.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, many of the remaining valuables were auctioned in
New York and the proceeds given to a U.N. refugee agency. But the
report by the Presidential Advisory Commission on Holocaust Assets
in the United States suggests that at least in part of Austria,
American forces ignored regulations calling for the preservation of
victims' assets and their return to the country from which they
were seized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here you have a massive exception to those rules,'' said
Deputy Treasury Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, one of the Clinton
administration's representatives on the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspected when we set this commission up that there might
be some dark chapters in our immediate post-war history,''
Eizenstat said in an interview. But, he added, ``we want to
establish the principle that the United States is willing to hold
itself to the same high standard to which it has held others.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers for the commission cast their findings as
preliminary, and they cautioned that some important parts of the
story remain unclear. Chief among the unanswered questions is why
Gen. Mark Clark, the commander of U.S. forces in Austria, decided
that the property could not be identified, when it appears that the
train carried at least some information about the original owners.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's representative to the commission, P.T. Henry,
said the Army Center for Military History was examining military
records to try to determine the context of Clark's decision. ``The
Army is committed to telling the story on this,'' said Henry, an
assistant Army secretary. ``We are not going to half-step.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study largely confirms and expands upon the findings
of an amateur American historian, Kenneth D. Alford, who first
reported the pilfering of assets from the so-called Hungarian gold
train in 1994 in his book ``The Spoils of World War II.''
</P>
<P>
   Working mainly from government files at the National Archives
and elsewhere, the commission's researchers also discovered that
the train contained more than 1,100 paintings taken from Hungarian
Jews and apparently turned over by the United States to the
government of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the paintings is unknown. But the researchers said a
recovered inventory of the paintings included considerable
identifying information, raising the possibility that a cache of
less-famous art works looted in the Holocaust might someday be
returned to their owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all the Jews were Rothschilds, and most of their paintings
were not masterpieces,'' said Konstantin Akinsha, the researcher
who found the inventory. ``This is the first time we have found a
large group of that type of paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ulf Pacher, a spokesman for the Austrian Embassy in Washington,
said the matter would be investigated. The commission's research
director for art and cultural property, Jonathan Petropoulos, said
a senior Austrian cultural official had reported back that some of
the paintings had apparently been returned, but without specifying
when or to whom.
</P>
<P>
   Hungarian officials told the commission that they had never
received any such paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The train was one of several dispatched from Hungary by the
Nazis as Red Army troops fought their way across German lines. One
train carried gold taken from the Hungarian Central Bank; another
was loaded with paintings from the Hungarian National Gallery. The
valuables from both of those trains were eventually returned.
</P>
<P>
   According to documents cited by Alford, the gold train set out
from Budapest on Dec. 15, 1944, on orders from Karl Adolf Eichmann.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Eichmann had overseen the extermination of most of the
750,000 Jews who lived in Hungary before the war; nearly 400,000
had been killed during a single brief period after the government
of Miklos Horthy broke with the Nazis in 1944 and tried to make
peace with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The gold train also carried the property of some pro-Nazi
Hungarians, including officials of the puppet government set up by
Eichmann's superior, Heinrich Himmler.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of March, according to Alford's account, the
train had advanced barely 100 miles and its Hungarian guards had
already repelled 10 robbery attempts, nine of them by troops of the
German SS.

N.Y. TIMES AGREES TO BUY WORCESTER, MASS., NEWSPAPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times Co. said Thursday that it has agreed to buy
the third-largest daily newspaper in Massachusetts, the Worcester
Telegram &AMP; Gazette, for about $295 million from The Chronicle
Publishing Co. of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The long-expected purchase would let the Times, which also owns
The Boston Globe, pursue a ``cluster strategy'' in Eastern and
Central Massachusetts. The strategy is one of the latest trends in
the newspaper industry, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   By owning papers in neighboring markets, companies can gain
efficiencies by combining some back-office operations and
potentially boost revenues by offering national advertisers
one-stop shopping for buying ads in a geographic region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strategically, the Telegram &AMP; Gazette supports a clustering
strategy of managing complementary markets,'' Russell T. Lewis,
president and chief executive officer of the Times Co., said in a
statement. ``The company's ownership of The Boston Globe and the
Telegram &AMP; Gazette will enable us to better serve readers and
advertisers in the eastern half of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the proposed purchase of the Telegram &AMP; Gazette,
Worcester's only newspaper, is also a bet on the future of central
Massachusetts and the high-technology and biotechnology companies
that are rapidly growing there.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are likely to employ affluent, well-educated
consumers that newspapers and their advertisers want to reach.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times, the T&AMP;G has a daily circulation of about
107,000, and the Globe has a daily circulation of 463,600.
</P>
<P>
   The T&AMP;G sale is subject to regulatory approval, and until the
purchase is completed, Times spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen said it
would be ``premature'' to discuss specific plans that the company
has for the T&AMP;G's future.
</P>
<P>
   Along with television and radio stations and magazines, The New
York Times Co. publishes 23 newspapers, including the Globe, which
it bought in 1993. The Times had 1998 revenue of $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   At Credit Suisse First Boston, analyst Steven N. Barlow said
that the clustering theories behind the proposed purchase of the
T&AMP;G have the ``potential for achieving revenue gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Clustering strategies have grown increasingly popular among
newspaper companies in recent years, added David Cole, publisher of
News Inc., a newsletter that tracks the newspaper industry.
</P>
<P>
   By owning newspapers in neighboring markets, companies have the
opportunity to combine many operations. Taken to its extreme,
clustering could some day have different papers sharing a single
centralized printing facility; what's more, neighboring newspaper
could share stories _ or even whole sections of the newspaper such
as business, features, and sports sections.
</P>
<P>
   Many US newspaper chains are pursuing modified versions of this
strategy, said media analyst John Morton.
</P>
<P>
   Citing the T&AMP;G's strong cash-flow margin, Nielsen said the $295
million purchase price made the T&AMP;G ``an excellent value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full price but not extravagant,'' Morton said.
</P>
<P>
   Given that there was a ``bidding war'' for the T&AMP;G, Cole said of
the price, ``It's not totally outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of the Times dropped 9/16
to close at 40-7/16 on a day when it also released quarterly
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   For the past few months, the Chronicle had been looking for a
buyer, and because newspapers of the T&AMP;G's size rarely go on sale,
many newspaper companies had expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   Identified in news reports as potential T&AMP;G suitors were
Community Newspapers Co., the Needham-based company owned by
Fidelity Investments; Pulitzer Inc.; and Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the T&AMP;G reported in its business pages that the
front-runners in the bidding war were the Times, Media NewsGroup
Inc. of Denver, and Journal Register Co. of Trenton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps intent on pursuing cluster strategies of their own, some
of those companies have reputations as rigorous cost cutters. As a
result, some T&AMP;G employees said they were relieved that the Times
had submitted the winning bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is the best possible deal we could have,'' said
reporter Kathleen A. Shaw, who also heads the newsroom union, a
unit of the Providence Newspaper Guild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was pleased that it was the Times over some of the
alternatives,'' said reporter Chris Pope. ``But there was some
trepidation over whether there will cutbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Many questions about the future remain unanswered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would remain as publisher, Bruce S. Bennett
replied, ``I have made no assumptions.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that the paper's management and staff were part of
what had made the Telegram &AMP; Gazette attractive to the Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal is good for everyone,'' said Chronicle chairman and
chief executive John B. Sias in a statement. ``The employees will
benefit and the community served will benefit from the new
ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle has been embroiled in a dispute among the heirs of
its founding family and is selling off its media empire piece by
piece as heirs look to cash out, Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a timeline on the T&AMP;G's Web site, the Worcester
Evening Gazette was founded by a Rhode Island dentist and a Boston
reporter in 1866, and the Worcester Sunday Telegram began
publishing in 1884. The papers were owned by a series of families.
In 1925, the Stoddard and Booth families bought the Telegram and
Gazette. The papers were sold to the Chronicle in 1986 and merged
into the Telegram &AMP; Gazette in 1989.

 Special for The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is Anne Stephenson's ``New &AMP; Notable'' column forthe week
of Oct. 10:
</P>
<P>
   ``PHYSIOGNOMY: THE MARK SELIGER PHOTOGRAPHS'' &QL; 
(Bulfinch, $75) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You have not lived until you've seen Brad Pitt in an evening
gown and goggles. Better yet, look at Drew Barrymore dancing nearly
naked with a sumo wrestler. Or Aerosmith's Steven Tyler with his
lips spread just as wide as they will go (that is to say shockingly
wide _ Tyler can look like a contortionist just by opening his
mouth). Or Keith Richards playing dominoes. Or Howard Stern wearing
a crown of thorns (think about it). On the cover _ the stunned
look, we assume, is from the makeup session _ is Jerry Seinfeld as
the Tin Man. Just inside is a perplexed-looking Tom Hanks
scratching his brow with ape hands. Trust us _ you will look at
this picture for a long, long time. In fact, if you pull this book
out in public, a crowd will gather _ it's that big a draw. Maybe
it's the celebrity factor. Maybe it's Seliger's unpredictable way
with his subjects, who seem willing to do the oddest things at his
request. As chief photographer for ``Rolling Stone,'' he has put
famous faces in the most surreal and unusual circumstances. The
photos go largely unexplained, and we found that to be irritating.
Also, the subjects remain unidentified until the very back of the
book, which makes for some confusion because it's really hard to
tell who some of them are. But those are quibbles. The book is
pricey but fun. With an introduction by Eric Bogosian. &QL; 
``SHE SAID YES'' &QL; 
By Misty Bernall (Plough, $17) &QL; 
It's at issue whether 17-year-old Cassie Bernall said anything at
all before she was shot to death in April at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo. Did Dylan Klebold ask her whether she believed
in God and did she say yes before he pulled the trigger? Her
parents choose to believe she did despite reports to the contrary,
and her mother has now written this book _ proof that grieving
people need to impart some meaning to the death of a child and that
the attention of strangers is oddly comforting. Beyond religious
fervor and parental sorrow, however, Misty Bernall tells another
important story. Three years ago, Cassie was a difficult
ninth-grader whose conversations with friends touched on drugs,
sex, self-mutilation and violence toward teachers and parents.
Misty discovered this when she read letters Cassie had written to a
friend, whereupon the stunned Bernalls did what Misty calls ``the
hardest thing you can ever do as parents: to put your foot down and
say, `This stops right here.' '' They immediately put Cassie into
another school, regularly searched her room, tapped the phone and
forbade her to see her old friends even though they knew it might
backfire and drive Cassie further away. When Cassie's friends
vandalized their house, they moved to another neighborhood to keep
her away from them. Cassie eventually got better, but it's
impossible to read about this troubled girl at war with her
desperate parents and not think of the boys who later murdered her.
What Cassie Bernall said that day is not as important as what two
other parents wrote to the Bernalls a month later: ``We will never
understand why this tragedy happened,'' Sue and Tom Klebold said,
``or what we might have done to prevent it. We apologize for the
role our son had in your Cassie's death. We never saw anger or
hatred in Dylan until the last moments of his life when we watched
in helpless horror with the rest of the world. . . . May God bring
peace and understanding to all of our wounded hearts.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``WHAT IF?'' &QL; 
Edited by Robert Cowley (Putnam, $27.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What if, in the summer of 1941, Adolph Hitler had made his major
attack not into Soviet Russia but into Syria and Lebanon _ would he
then have won a strategic position that could have brought him
eventual victory? Or what if, early in his invasion of the Persian
empire, the young King Alexander had been dealt a second blow with
an ax (the first had damaged Alexander's helmet and left him
disoriented and unable to defend himself) by a Persian noble named
Spithridates? What if Alexander's bodyguard had not speared
Spithridates before he could strike again and destroy Alexander's
chance of becoming ``great''? If you feel your blood pounding, the
goose bumps rising, your heart soaring with the thrill of it . . .
then you must be a historian. If you dozed off before the first
question mark, you are a civilian and should refrain from looking
at this book lest you asphyxiate on the futility of it all. This is
an expansion of the the 10th anniversary issue of ``MHQ: The
Quarterly Journal of Military History,'' in which the editor asked
historians to write about the most important ``might-have-beens''
of military history. They had so much fun that many came back for
more. Contributors include John Keegan (who explores the
aforementioned Hitler scenario), David McCullough, Stephen E.
Ambrose and James M. McPherson. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``THE LONG PROGRAM'' &QL; 
By Peggy Fleming (Pocket, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Figure-skating champion Peggy Fleming is too nice to write a
book. She didn't get angry at her son when his girlfriend turned up
pregnant. She doesn't blame her mother for being a control freak.
She has been married to the same man for a million years. She went
into a depression during her recent treatment for breast cancer,
but that was caused by a drug _ she stopped taking it, and her
sadness disappeared. We ask you: Where's the dirt? Where's the
trouble? The answer is that there is none. Fleming is as nice as
she appears to be and then some (she calls Nancy Kerrigan ``a very
ungracious loser'' for her behavior after Oksana Baiul beat her in
the 1994 Olympics _ for Fleming, that's like hurling obscenities).
This memoir, which covers her career and personal life, is not
exactly scintillating reading, but Fleming is so likable that we
decline to say more. &QL;

SHARES HALT TWO-DAY SLIDE, BUT INFLATION FEARS PERSIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks arrested their sharp two-day decline Thursday
but regained little ground as investors digested another strong
report on the economy and braced for another round of possibly
unsettling inflation news.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after retreating nearly 100
points and slipping more than 10 percent from its Aug. 25 record,
recovered and closed with a gain of 54.45, or 0.53 percent, at
10,286.61. The Nasdaq had a smaller gain, but the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index declined for the fourth straight session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interest rate fright,'' said David G. Dietze, president
of Point View Financial Services, one of many analysts who cited
rising yields on Treasury bonds and other high-quality debt as the
market's chief depressant. ``When you get up over 6.30 percent,
fixed-income starts looking attractive relative to stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury fell enough to raise its yield to
6.32 percent, another two-year high, from 6.27 percent on
Wednesday, after the government reported that retail sales,
excluding the automotive sector, were stronger than expected last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sentiment is poor,'' added Kathleen M. Camilli, director of
economic research at Tucker Anthony. ``The bond market is telling
us that it smells inflation, not just fears inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting some of the gloom about rising rates, however, was
continued optimism about corporate profits, which are beginning to
be reported for the summer quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, for example, jumped 3[, to 43|, accounting for nearly a
third of the rise in the Dow blue-chip average after announcing a
sharp earnings increase. And Apple Computer, which issued a
surprisingly favorable report after the close on Wednesday, soared
9 5/32, or 14 percent, to 73 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   But the market continued to batter companies announcing bad
news, like Unisys, which warned of lower revenue in coming
quarters. Its stock fell 15 11/16, or 37 percent, to 26 9/16 as 23
million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   And Tyco International, plunged 10, to 87, after losing 7] on
Wednesday after questions were raised about its accounting
practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the recent general weakness has served to create bargains,
some strategists suggested, noting that whole sectors, such as
military goods, have been battered as a result of problems at
individual companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to wonder if we're setting up a pretty good
opportunity to do better,'' said Andrew M. Brooks, chief stock
trader at T. Rowe Price. ``There are some pretty good valuations,
some pretty good entry points.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Elizabeth J. Mackay, chief strategist at Bear
Stearns, said the rate rise might be approaching its peak. The risk
of deflation is gone, she said, but there is no risk of serious
inflation despite jumps in the price of some commodities, including
oil and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The markets will be closely examining a government report on
inflation at the producer level Friday, with the Consumer Price
Index for September to be published next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market, which hit a record on Monday before tumbling,
finished with a gain of 5.57 points, or two-tenths of 1 percent, to
2,806.84.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, which had 237 components moving up
and 236 down, fell 2.13 points, or 0.17 percent, to 1,283.42, close
to 10 percent below its mid-July peak.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, volume rose to 892.3 million
shares from 821.5 million on Wednesday, with 1,841 issues closing
lower against 1,157 that rose. A whopping 371 stocks made new
52-week lows compared with just 24 reaching new highs.

 &HT;    Leaders rally against plan to redefine minority-owned companies
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A proposal that would relax the definition of what
constitutes a minority company came under fire Thursday from
African-American and Hispanic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians, business executives and civil rights leaders
rallied against a proposal by the National Minority Supplier
Development Council to grant waivers to its own rule that companies
must be 51 percent owned by minority groups in order to receive
minority certification.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is controversial because it would allow a company,
on a case-by-case basis, to retain the council's highly coveted
certification even if that company sells stock that reduces
minority ownership to as little as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call on them to slow down, to push back, to cease and to
desist any and all efforts to redefine what is or is not a
minority-owned business,'' said Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``If it
ain't broke, don't fix it, and if it is broke, let's learn to fix
it together.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell said if the proposal is adopted by
the council at its Oct. 26 meeting in Phoenix, it could open the
door to ``front companies'' that hire minorities, but are
controlled by whites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will stunt the growth of real minority-owned businesses
that have been deliberately left out of the nation's economic
mainstream for hundreds of years,'' said Campbell, who was not at
the news conference but is working with protesters to draw
attention to the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The group _ which included Ray Arvizu, chairman of the United
States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; Earl Graves, publisher of
Black Enterprise magazine and one of the founders of the council;
and African-American and Hispanic members of Congress _ is asking
the council to postpone voting on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Harriet Michel, president of the New York-based council,
said the proposal is vitally important to help minority businesses
expand their capital. That expansion, she said, is critical if
minority companies are going to compete against larger and better
financed white-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what critics say, Michel said, the council is not
proposing to change its overall definition of a minority company.
Companies would still be required to meet the 51-percent ownership
rule.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change would allow companies already designated as
minority-owned to apply for a waiver from the rule if they have
brokered a stock deal with a venture capitalist for money.
</P>
<P>
   Michel noted that companies that apply for an exemption of the
ownership rule would be required to keep minorities in control of
the voting stock and board of directors _ a fact not mentioned by
the opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the criticism came before the proposal was released,''
Michel said. ``In the heat of the discussion, it is hard to lower
the decibel level of the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   The council, started in 1972 to increase business opportunities
for minorities, has the potent power of certifying whether a
company is actually owned by minority entrepreneurs. Large Fortune
500 corporations regularly depend on that certification before
doing business with minority contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed change is supported by big companies, which say
they want to do more business with minority companies but are
limited by the small size of many minority firms.

FEAR OF VIOLENCE GROWING IN BURUNDI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the landlocked central African nation of
Burundi, a rebel gunned down two United Nations officials this
week. The chief peace negotiator in Burundi's civil war, former
Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere, died Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent weeks an ongoing war has escalated in the nation
the size of Maryland, as both Tutsi-dominated government forces and
Hutu rebels stand accused of massacres of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights monitors and African watchers say conditions are
ripe for an even greater explosion of killing in Burundi, putting
civilians at grave risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're looking at a potential disaster, a potential genocide
in the making,'' Herman J. Cohen, assistant secretary of state for
African affairs during the Bush administration, said in an
interview. He expressed special concern over the forced
``regroupment'' of an estimated 300,000 people in the Bujumbura
Rurale province.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the U.S. State Department denounced the
roundup in a statement, saying it was ``gravely concerned about the
forced movement of the population and its humanitarian and human
rights consequences.'' A U.S. official, though, disputed Cohen's
warning of a possible genocide. ``While we are concerned about the
potential for abuse in these regroupment camps, we have no evidence
to indicate a genocide is in the making,'' said the official,
asking not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Human Rights Watch consultant Alison DesForges, the
absence of a peace process and recent rebel attacks on the capital
Bujumbura foreshadow ``continuing violence on both sides, with
fairly sizable numbers of people killed.'' Several thousand people
have died so far this year. The killing of the two UN workers last
week, followed by a shootout that killed seven others, underscored
the degree of lawlessness in the countryside. Rebels first robbed
the UN convoy, and witnesses say a single rebel then shot dead the
two.
</P>
<P>
   DesForges, who just returned from three weeks in Rwanda, said
prospects for mass killing based on ethnicity were low because
``there's enough consciousness on part of the international
community to not let it happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the Rwandan Hutu government and army carried out a
genocide of more than half a million Tutsi, until an army of mostly
Tutsi refugees defeated them.
</P>
<P>
   In Burundi, the civil war is fueled by a history of Hutu-Tutsi
killing. In 1972, the Tutsi-dominated army killed as many as
200,000 Hutu, targeting anyone with more than four years of
education. In 1993, Tutsi soldiers assassinated the first Hutu
president. Hutu then slaughtered thousands of Tutsi, and in
response the Tutsi army massacred thousands of Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it is escalating to the point where the Tutsi may be on
the verge of doing something very, very bad,'' said Cohen, now a
consultant for several African nations. ``The reason is that the
(Hutu) guerrillas are infiltrating the capital, and no Tutsi living
there can feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The government roundup of up to 300,000 Hutu is like ``taking
everyone in Montgomery County (Maryland) and putting them in a
concentration camp. The conditions in these camps are horrible.
People are dying of sickness, starvation, it's sort of a stealthy
genocide,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Ndikumana, Burundi's ambassador to the United States,
acknowledged the conditions in the camps need improvement, but said
Burundi has asked for international assistance for the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not `regroupments,' they are protection sites,''
Ndikumana said Thursday. ``The aim of the protection sites is to
protect the civilians against these insurgency groups.''
</P>
<P>
   DesForges, of Human Rights Watch, praised the State Department
for condemning the regroupments but said danger persists in the
camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both sides in Burundi, it's getting nastier and nastier,''
she said. ``It's important now to point out the potential for
large-scale suffering, even large-scale death in the camps _ simply
by starving them. This seems to be a hidden strategy of war used
increasingly in this region.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday accused the
Republicans who defeated a treaty that would ban underground
nuclear testing of retreating into a ``new isolationism'' that
threatens national security.
</P>
<P>
   He pledged to abide by the treaty's provisions and warned
countries with nuclear ambitions like China, India and Pakistan not
interpret the defeat as a signal that they are free to resume
testing.
</P>
<P>
   In an hourlong news conference, Clinton tried to make the best
of what his aides conceded on Thursday was a humiliating setback,
one that some White House officials fear could lead other foreign
leaders to wait until the end of Clinton's term before seeking to
strike any deals with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   With a series of attacks on Congress for what he called
``reckless partisanship,'' Clinton made it clear that he hoped
Democrats would turn the defeat of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test
Ban Treaty into a campaign issue. He said that the Senate's
rejection of the treaty effectively sent a four-word message to
America's allies: ``Go take a hike.''
</P>
<P>
   And he added, ``By this vote, the Senate majority has turned its
back on 50 years of American leadership against the spread of
weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a hint of the usual Washington bipartisan niceties
toward the Republican leaders who organized the defeat of what was
supposed to be the crowning achievement of his foreign policy,
Clinton used the vote to launch a sweeping denunciation of the
Republicans on the full range of domestic issues: the budget
surplus, Social Security, education, the environment, Head Start,
taxes, Medicare, medical research and air traffic safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say to the congressional majority, enough is enough,''
Clinton. said ``We've got a job to do for the American people. It
is not that difficult. Let's just do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And by announcing his resolve to abide by the provisions of the
first major treaty rejected by the Senate since 1920, Clinton was
essentially challenging the Republican aspirants for president to
say whether they would resume underground explosions in the Nevada
desert _ a change of policy that would invite other nuclear powers
to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if we ever get a president that's against the Test Ban
Treaty, which we may get,'' the president said, the world should
know that ``all bets are off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have Russia testing, we'll have China testing, we'll
have India testing, we'll have Pakistan testing,'' he said. ``We'll
have countries abandoning the Nonproliferation Treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidates were careful to focus their
criticism on specifics flaws in the treaty and not to dismiss the
notion of banning nuclear weapons testing altogether. Republicans
in Congress were quick to reject the isolationist label. They shot
back that the Senate simply voted against the treaty because it
could never be confident that China, Russia, North Korea or others
had truly abandoned testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the substance, the facts were not with the president or
with the supporters of this treaty, they are saying, `Oh, well, it
was politics,' '' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said on
Thursday. ``That was absolutely not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   While the treaty's rejection and its impact dominated Thursday's
news conference, Clinton also used it to press his case against the
budget that Republicans are assembling, and to lay out America's
agenda for what is likely to be a noisy, protest-filled meeting of
the world's top trade officials in Seattle next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that he would veto any spending bill that
eliminated his plans to increase funding for education,
specifically for more teachers and computers in classrooms around
the country. The current Republican plan for across-the-board
spending cuts would eliminate many of those initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that he was willing to negotiate on an increased
tobacco tax, a tax most Republicans oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in the press conference did Clinton begin to sound
defensive _ and it was when a reporter questioned whether the White
House, by inattention or ineptitude, was partly responsible for the
treaty's defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Though he insisted that he had spoken ``30 times'' about the
need to pass the treaty, his aides have acknowledged that Clinton
made little effort to build support for the treaty until
Republicans caught the administration off guard by suddenly putting
it on the agenda for a speedy vote. Only then, as one adviser to
Clinton said on Thursday, ``did everyone discover that there was a
wildly wrong estimate of where we were on this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton faces a delicate dance: He must convince his
domestic audience that the Senate has made a terrible mistake, and
convince other nations not to take his defeat as an invitation to
abandon the treaty themselves or challenge Clinton's authority.
</P>
<P>
   A delay in the vote would have made that two-step a lot simpler.
On Tuesday, when it appeared possible that Democrats and
Republicans would strike an agreement that would delay a vote until
after the next president takes office, Clinton's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, said that ``there is an enormous difference
between a postponement and a defeat.'' An outright defeat, he said,
could vitiate American credibility and ``give other countries a
pretext'' to resume testing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that prospect on Thursday, and he
specifically warned India and Pakistan, neither of which have yet
signed the treaty, against interpreting the Senate vote as a green
light to proceed with their nuclear weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say to India and Pakistan, do not take yesterday's vote
as a sign that America doesn't care whether you resume nuclear
testing and build up your nuclear arsenals,'' Clinton said. Such a
move, he told them, ``will hurt your economy and your future.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same moment, he acknowledged that the message the vote
sent would be a confused one. He said that he told three
ambassadors that he saw on Wednesday night, hours after the vote,
that they should tell their governments that he remained ``in a
battle with the new isolationists in the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   But he expressed confidence, he said, that ``we are not going to
reverse 40 years of commitment on non-proliferation,'' and he
insisted that the treaty remains on the Senate calendar _ even
though there is no interest, in either party, of reviving it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear whether the treaty vote will become a
potent election issue over the next year; without a clear threat
from the likes of the former Soviet Union or China, nuclear
politics do not have the kind of resonance they did when Lyndon
Johnson ran a campaign advertisement in 1964 of a giant mushroom
cloud.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton made a run on Thursday at reviving that strategy.
``Imagine the world we will live in if they prevail,'' he said of
the Republicans whom he charged _ three times _ with isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the ultimate goal of the Republicans was to
wipe out all arms control accords, and leave the United States free
to expand on its huge lead. ``They think we ought to go it alone,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy aside, he said that if the nuclear arms and
chemical weapons conventions were swept aside, defense budgets
would soar, not only in the United States but elsewhere around the
world. He painted a picture of countries diverting money from
education and health care to the military, and raised the specter
that Japan _ which has vowed never to possess nuclear arms _ might
be forced to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and some nuclear experts questioned on Thursday
whether Clinton was stretching to make his point: Japan has never
seriously been tempted to build its own nuclear weapons, despite
years of tests by Russia and China, and India and Pakistan have
been living under mutual nuclear threat for years.

TAPES REVEAL NIXON BLASTING SENATOR KENNEDY, O'NEILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The anti-war stance struck by prominent
Massachusetts Democrats triggered fury and resentment from
President Richard Nixon during the Vietnam era, newly released
White House tapes reveal.
</P>
<P>
   In the private confines of the Oval Office, Nixon called
then-House whip Thomas P. ``Tip'' O'Neill Jr. an ``all-out dove and
a vicious bastard.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy was a ``goddamn lily-livered
mealy-mouth,'' the president told his aides.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had mixed feelings about young John F. Kerry, who was then
a prominent spokesman for a group of Vietnam veterans who opposed
the war. The tapes show that Nixon and his staff respected Kerry's
political gifts, but they saw him as a threat and disparaged him as
a hypocrite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a Navy lieutenant, on a gunboat, and he used to run his
gunboat up and shoot babies out of womens' arms,'' said a bitter
White House chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, after Kerry gave
compelling testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, stop that,'' Nixon said, in mock reproach. ``People in the
Navy don't do those things.''
</P>
<P>
   The tape recordings were made by Nixon's secret taping system,
which he had installed to document his role in history. They are
now available to the public for listening at the National Archives,
the latest in a series of tapes to be released.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes show Nixon the strategist, huddling with national
security adviser Henry Kissinger and others to bring the war in
Vietnam to an end and discussing his daring diplomatic
breakthroughs with the Soviet Union and China. They also reveal
Nixon's dark side, as the president rants against his political
enemies and makes cutting remarks about women, African-Americans,
Hispanics, gays and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame these things stay hidden when they matter,''
Kerry said Thursday. ``Yet its always better to have history
written properly.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kerry returned home from Vietnam, he took a leadership
position in the Vietnam Veterans Against The War. The veterans,
many of them disabled by their wounds, camped out in Washington and
lobbied Congress to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently this fellow that they put in the front row is one
of the real stars ... Kerry ... he was extremely effective,'' Nixon
said to Haldeman and Kissinger on April 23, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kerry. He did a hell of a great job ... a superb job,'' said
Haldeman. ``A Kennedy-type guy. He looks like a Kennedy and he
talks exactly like a Kennedy.'' Nixon predicted that Kerry would be
a formidable Democratic candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's preoccupation with the Kennedys turned up on the tapes
as well. In one phone conversation with the Rev. Billy Graham,
Nixon expressed his opinion that John F. Kennedy had conspired with
former Massachusetts Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, then the ambassador
in Saigon, in the assassination of South Vietnamese President Ngo
Dinh Diem. Diem lost his life in a US-backed coup in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy ``started the damn thing. He killed Diem and he sent the
first 16,000 combat people there himself,'' Nixon told Graham.
``Diem had been murdered. The key thing here, Billy, is Kennedy's _
and I must say our friend Lodge's _ agreement to murder Diem ....
That's what threatened the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   When the May Day demonstrations were staged by antiwar
protesters in Washington in 1971, Nixon hoped the televised scenes
of violent long-haired ``hippos'' wild on hallucinogenic ``LSC''
would play poorly in middle America. He hoped to tie Senator Edward
Kennedy to the rioters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Kennedy doing about all of this?'' Nixon asked his
aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's out of town, conveniently ...,'' said aide Charles
Colson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smart as hell,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon urged Colson to ``charge up our guys'' and kick the
``goddamn lily-livered mealy mouths'' like Kennedy ``in the
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   When Nixon discovered that Kerry was not camped out with his
fellow veterans but was staying with a friend, Nixon put him down
as a phony. ``He wasn't living down there with those guys ... He's
living in a posh pad in Georgetown,'' Nixon told his secretary,
Rose Mary Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said jokingly Thursday, after hearing of the taped
material, ``They really liked me. They thought a lot of me.'' Then
he said proudly, ``I was a real thorn in their side.''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1971, after Nixon had addressed the nation on Vietnam
and announced new US troop withdrawals, he talked about O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly bamboozled the goddamn Congress,'' Nixon told
Kissinger. ``O'Neill, who is an all-out dove and a vicious bastard,
didn't know what the hell to say.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; At another point in the tapes, Nixon is heard laughing about
cutting defense contracts in O'Neill's district.

RIGHT OR WRONG, WALL STREET ECONOMISTS GENERATE IDEAS AND TRADES

(DW) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the forecasts of Wall Street economists are often
so wrong, how do they keep their jobs? How do they make any money?
</P>
<P>
   Those are fair questions after a string of years _ including
1999 _ when many seers of Wall Street missed their calls on
interest rates, were wrong on the direction of Federal Reserve
policy, and substantially underestimated economic growth and even
overestimated inflation.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through 1998, for example, the consensus economic
forecast at the start of the year turned out to be, on average, 1.4
percentage points below the actual annual growth rate, according to
the Blue Chip Economic Indicators. The consensus estimate for 1999
_ 2.4 percent as recently as January _ is well below the 3.4
percent growth rate in the nation's gross domestic product for the
first six months of the year. It is likely to be even further off
the mark for the full year.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that Wall Street economists forecast because they
have to. But their money-making product is a stream of, they hope,
good ideas about how the economy works that stimulates the thinking
of the money managers that make up much of their clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``People wanting to read what you write and learn how you're
thinking about substantive matters is more important than whether
you are precisely right in your macro forecasts of GDP or interest
rates,'' said Charley Ellis, managing partner at Greenwich
Associates, which assesses Wall Street performance by interviewing
institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   This research _ whether a long-term analysis of the surprising
rise in productivity or an instant interpretation of the newest
employment report _ plays an integral role in most Wall Street
firms and smaller boutiques. Research is the everyday grist for a
firm's sales representatives, who deal with clients on a regular
basis. It is used to attract clients who then trade through the
firm or compensate it in other ways, adding to profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Research helps write trading tickets,'' said Donald H. Layton,
Chase Manhattan Bank's vice chairman in charge of overseeing its
global market business.
</P>
<P>
   John Lipsky, the chief economist and the director of research at
Chase, and Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co., are
two such economists from the 50-odd firms constantly scrambling to
get the attention of money managers. Both, who themselves spend a
third of their time seeing clients, have to contend with the
economists at the Wall Street leaders in this business, including
Bruce Steinberg at Merrill Lynch and Stephen S. Roach at Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter.
</P>
<P>
   It is a business whose top players have not changed very much in
the last several years, according to Greenwich Associates. But that
only intensifies the challenge to come up with the Next Big Idea.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most attention-grabbing ideas this year came from
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. He
argued that year 2000 computer disruptions would cause a recession
in the beginning of next year. Even if it proves wrong, the idea
forced many money managers to address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But good ideas, right or wrong, are not easy to come by. ``If we
have three great ideas in a year that is a home run year,'' said
Richard Berner, chief U. S. economist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky, 52, heads Chase's 120-person research team, which is
striving to become one of the major players on the Street. He was
chief economist at Salomon Brothers before coming to Chase in 1997.
Before that he worked for Salomon in London and New York, after a
decade at the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is able to consistently foresee specific market
developments far into the future,'' said Lipsky, who speaks to
hundreds of clients all over the world. ``That is why forecasts are
inevitably revised as new facts emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   An economist's real job, he explained, is to ``help our clients
organize their own thinking, even if they come to different
conclusions about market implications. We are doing the digging,
analysis and thinking that they would do if they had the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase's 1998 forecast, done by Lipsky and his research staff,
shows how a forecast can be off-base on growth but still contain
crucial insights. While predicting about 1.5 percent growth _ which
was off by 2.4 percentage points _ Chase said that long-term
interest rates would fall toward 5 percent, which was correct, and
that inflation would decline to about 1.5 percent, also correct. A
forecast that the Federal Reserve would cut interest rates, based
in part on the expected decline in inflation and helped by the
deepening of the world financial crisis, was also on the mark.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, Chase has gone astray again, missing on interest
rates, Federal Reserve policy and economic growth. On the other
hand, overall inflation, although slightly higher, is still
contained _ one of Lipsky's main themes. The forecast of a stronger
than expected dollar early in the year was a contrarian gem.
</P>
<P>
   But Lee Thomas, senior international portfolio manager at the
Pacific Investment Management Co. in Newport Beach, Calif., the
world's largest active bond manager, brushes off the muffs. ``His
forecast record changed from last year to this year,'' he said of
Lipsky, ``but the quality of his ideas has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is your job,'' Thomas said of money managers like himself,
``to sit down and decide which idea makes sense and construct your
own world view.'' It is the economist's job, he said, ``to explain
a theme that catalyzes my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbera, 47, left the heart of Wall Street after seven years at
Lehman Brothers to become a sole practitioner at Hoenig &AMP; Co., a
small brokerage firm based in Rye Brook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He scored this year with his contention that Japan's economy
would rebound and, even more strikingly, last year with his
contrarian theme that the pain in Asia would be a gain for the
United States. Barbera reasoned, correctly, that the recession in
Asia would lead to lower inflation, lower interest rates and more
growth in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get paid for looking out for what might change the
conventional view,'' Barbera said. ``There is a small list of
portfolio managers who think I have something to deliver and we
talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul DeRosa, a partner at Mount Lucas Management, an asset
management company in Princeton, N.J., and one of Barbera's 60
clients, said: ``The money is made and lost in interpreting
situations as they develop.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what he counts on from Barbera. In the summer of 1998,
as the Asian economic crisis spread to Russia and Latin America,
DeRosa said that Barbera was quick to say that the situation would
force the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which it did three
times.
</P>
<P>
   While getting this right, DeRosa said that Barbera did not
foresee the big rally in the bond market that occurred the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
   The de-emphasis on economic forecasting, obviously, is partly
the result of being wrong so often. But it also reflects how the
once-revered job of forecasting has become little more than a basic
commodity in a world where just about everybody has access to his
own black box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can decide what way interest rates are going,'' said Rob
Kapito, vice chairman of Black Rock Management, an asset management
company, and a client of Lipsky.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of forecasting is reflected in the name change of
the National Association of Business Economists to the National
Association for Business Economics. The association's membership
has fallen substantially as many corporations turned from reliance
on teams of macro-economists who were supposed to predict the
overall economy to smaller groups of micro-economists focused on
specific markets.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, forecasts, even when they are right, are no longer
enough for most clients. With just a forecast, Barbera said, ``you
are simply asking clients to bet on your black box and good
portfolio managers won't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   What portfolio managers do want instead is easy access to good
idea merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas of Pacific Investment, who sees Lipsky three to five
times a year, said that he narrows the choice of who he trades
through based on the quality of the ideas from the economists he
talks to. Despite Lipsky's forecasting misses, Chase is being
called as often as last year.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the trade, Peter Frey, the head of credit
market sales at J.P. Morgan Securities, said: ``It is not clear
that there is a good correlation between how precise our
forecasting calls are and our pay back,'' he said. ``The
correlation between the access and dialogue we give our clients and
our pay back is clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Firms also rely, at least in part, on their economists' views
when they bet their own money on movements in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Lipsky's views are considered, for example, when Chase stress
tests its own bets in the financial markets to assess the amount of
risk it is taking. His sense that the world's economic crisis was
deepening in the summer of 1998 played a role in Chase's decision
to count on interest rates to decline as investors ran to the
safety of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We act with even more conviction when the views of the
economist are aligned with those of the traders,'' said Ina Drew,
head of the domestic treasury at Chase. That successful bet was one
reason why Chase reported record earnings in the fourth quarter
last year even as some of its rivals reported profit declines for
the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Layton also said that Lipsky's connections to international
financial leaders around the world can help in getting underwriting
business for the bank when countries, especially in emerging
markets, issue new debt or privatize a state-owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Economists are also useful to money managers who disagree with
their views. Kapito of Black Rock Management, for instance, said
that although he disputed Lipsky's argument that inflation would
remain contained, the reasoning helped Black Rock form its own view
that inflation was at a bottom and likely to move higher, even if
only modestly. On this basis, Black Rock decided to buy more of the
Treasury's bonds that are indexed to inflation and rise in value
when inflation expectations rise.
</P>
<P>
   Barbera likes to provide his clients with what he calls
signposts. For example, as early as February this year he was
writing that the Japanese economy would recover this year. Along
with his reasons for the recovery, he listed developments money
managers could watch on their own to see if the recovery was
developing along the lines he predicted. For example, Barbera said
that the confidence level among the executives of smaller Japanese
companies would rise and that the bankruptcy rate would fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I happened to agree with that and so we made a small play in
Nikkei futures that have done very well,'' said DeRosa of Mount
Lucas Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cast a wide net,'' Barbera said, ``and try to catch on to
one or two things that have changed in a specific fashion that
could have an impact on things. But you never catch it all.''

2000 MITSUBISHI ECLIPSE GT: SPORTS COUPE FOR MATURE AUDIENCES 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Car buyers can be a fickle and cranky constituency. Consider
Mitsubishi's Eclipse sport coupe, which is new for the 2000 model
year. The design wonks and focus-groupies on the company payroll
endorsed the idea that the redesigned Eclipse should be a kinder,
gentler sports coupe rather than the earthy, turbo-zinging
me-machine of years past.
</P>
<P>
   So Mitsubishi traded away a degree of hard-edged performance _
in the form of the car's optional turbo-charged four-cylinder and
all-wheel drive _ for greater civility and more sophisticated
styling.
</P>
<P>
   And an excellent trade it was, too. The top-line Eclipse, the
GT, which is powered by the Galant sedan's 3-liter V6 engine _ has
been transformed into a smooth and suave sports tourer, with
fistfuls of around-town torque, a firm but well-dampened ride and
composed handling.
</P>
<P>
   Many Eclipse loyalists, however, feel more than a bit betrayed.
The new GT is some 200 pounds heavier than the front-drive,
turbo-charged Eclipse GS-T it replaces and a step slower. The GS-T
could make it to 60 miles an hour in about 6.5 seconds; the new car
needs almost a second more.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt some of the carping is because the new Japanese-built
car cannot be as easily ``slammed'' as the older model. Slamming is
modifying imported cars with performance add-ons; it is easier when
a bigger turbo and a wilder computer chip can simply be installed
to raise turbo pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But the complainers should be thankful; Mitsubishi could have
easily pulled out of the sport coupe market, which has dwindled
drastically the last decade from about 800,000 in 1989 to about
half that level last year because of the appeal of those suddenly
sexy sport utility vehicles. So what if the Eclipse has matured
with its prospective market.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, the Eclipse GT is no slouch. The 205
horsepower and 205 foot-pounds of torque, or pulling power, coming
from the 24-valve dual-overhead cam V6 is more accessible than in
the older car (torque in normally aspirated V6 engines resides at
lower rpm than in four-cylinder turbos).
</P>
<P>
   Also, the GS-T had a fair amount of turbo lag, the slack period
of acceleration before the turbo kicked in, and when it did, the
car would often surge ungainfully, spinning the front tires and
washing out the steering.
</P>
<P>
   The new car is just as capable of smoking the tires, but the
power is more progressive and easier to modulate. The older model
also required constant nursing of the gears to keep it revving at
peak power. The new car pulls longer and harder at lower rpm, and
that makes for less busywork at stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the throaty contralto exhaust note is an utter joy to
the ear as you work your way up and down the gears. The test mos equipped with a notchy and quick five-speed shifter with a
nifty baseball-stitch leather cover.
</P>
<P>
   The rich, purring exhaust note, which was fairly pronounced at
higher speeds, made me long for a sixth gear.
</P>
<P>
   The GT is also available with Sportronic, an automatic that can
be shifted manually without a clutch. The lower-end RS and GS
Eclipse models, powered by 2.4-liter, 140-horsepower, in-line
four-cylinder engines, can be bought with Sportronic or manual
transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   The slightly larger, substantially stiffer body helps the new
Eclipse deliver a supple and settled ride, well isolated and quiet
without being numb. The front suspension uses MacPherson struts
while the rear suspension uses multilink connectors.
</P>
<P>
   The car handles very well, answering to steering with crispness
and without sordid body motions. The standard 17-inch Goodyear RS-A
tires, however, lack serious grip, limiting the car's agility when
you want to put the hammer down. Likewise, the four-wheel antilock
disk brakes fail to hang on when pushed hard. Mitsubishi has
obviously left itself some room to build a performance variant in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Visually and tactually, the new Eclipse speaks a very different
vernacular than the older car. Strake-sided, jeweled with
crystalline headlights and limned in edges and accent lines
(Mitsubishi calls the styling geomechanical, though at Ford Motor
similar styling is called new edge), the Eclipse GT is smartly
current, where the earlier version's organic curves seemed cliched.
</P>
<P>
   This is a handsome car. But as an indication of just how fast
things move in the car business, the Eclipse, which went on sale
this fall, has already been trumped by Toyota's new, crisply
futuristic Celica.
</P>
<P>
   On the inside, the GT holds more than its own. The dash layout
comprises densely rubberized dual cowls divided by the center
console, with simple and well-organized audio and climate controls.
The controls have a pleasant heft and precise action.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath a deep binnacle, the instrument panel displays speed and
rpm with black-on-while dials with orange backlighting. Everything
in the cabin has a taut, rock-solid feel. By contrast, the earlier
GT-S had a nagging flimsiness to the doors and interior fittings.
</P>
<P>
   Among its keen features is an optional in-dash CD changer; two
armrest-mounted cup holders for coffee mugs, and an liquid crystal
display atop the dash, providing either time or radio station data
to the commuter who dares not take her eyes off the bumper ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In a pinch, you can even carpool. The Eclipse's rear seats have
been enlarged to seat full-size adults without undue cruelty. The
rear seatbacks fold down to reveal the trunk cargo area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Aging, gracefully.

   An Accounting Gap In Financial Software &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sure, personal financial software allows checkbook balancers to
track every penny. And, certainly, it can lead to gleeful moments
when consumers, after finding a bank miscalculation, say to the
branch manager: ``Oh yeah? Well, my computer says your computer is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is what to do next. Until the bank issues a
refund, the checkbook won't balance. The popular personal financial
software _ Quicken from Intuit, and Money from Microsoft _ have no
built-in way to correct bank errors. That can mean a delay of one
to three months before the statement can be reconciled _ the sort
of thing that can drive diligent bookkeepers to distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly O'Neil, a spokeswoman for Quicken, says she just makes a
note in the note field and enters the right amount of money to
correct the balance.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants have a term for money that is missing but on its
way: ``in transit funds.'' Gerald Lean, a principal in Naden Lean,
an accounting firm in Timonium, Md., suggests entering a deduction
if the mistake is in your favor, or a deposit if the mistake is
against you, then marking it ``in transit.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't waste time over pennies, advised Damian Gallina, a
financial planner at Horan &AMP; Associates in Towson, Md. ``Just write
it off,'' he said. &QL;

   The Philanthropy Food Chain &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philanthropy is about to show up on some high-definition radar
screens.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have
invited 150 leading donors, as well as young people and leaders of
foundations and other nonprofit groups, to the East Room this
Friday for what is believed to be the first White House conference
on philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The group will ``take a look at the tradition of philanthropy
and giving in this country and new ways of looking at it,'' said
Marsha Berry, Mrs. Clinton's director of communication.
</P>
<P>
   Also, America Online's AOL Foundation is about to introduce a
philanthropic Web portal, which will connect donors and volunteers
to nonprofit groups, and link those groups to resources on topics
like management and fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   A second philanthropic Web portal is also in the works. The
Surdna Foundation in New York has awarded $150,000 to Compumentor,
a nonprofit group in San Francisco, to create a technology portal
that will include links to help nonprofit groups find technical
assistance, donated and discounted software and information about
hardware.

MANDELA TO SPEAK AT RICE UNIVERSITY 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Former South African President Nelson Mandela,
considered one of the most intriguing political figures of this
century, will appear Oct. 26 at Rice University.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 Nobel Peace Prize winner, Mandela was the first black
president of South Africa in 1994, stepping down in June. He
emerged in 1990 after 27 years in an apartheid prison to oversee a
peaceful transfer of power from South Africa's white-minority
regime.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's speech at the James A. Baker III Institute for Public
Policy will coincide with his receiving the Enron Prize for
Distinguished Public Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is truly a signal event for Rice and for Houston,'' said
Rice President Malcolm Gillis. ``If there's anyone in this century
who qualifies for sainthood, he's at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela will speak at Autry Court, which can seat up to 5,000.
University officials are inviting students from Houston public
schools and other colleges to attend the event.
</P>
<P>
   He will be joined by His Royal Highness Prince Bandar bin
Sultan, the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, 81, was raised in a tribal culture. As a student and
law clerk in Johannesburg, he grew aware of the racial oppression
resulting from apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the founding members of the African National
Congress Youth League and then opened the first black legal firm in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Mandela helped lead a sabotage campaign against the
government. Charged with treason, he was sentenced to five years in
prison but that was later expanded to life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Although retired from public office, Mandela has assumed the
role of elder statesman in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Mandela helped convince Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi to turn over two men wanted for trial on charges of blowing
up a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.

 &HT;    Friends, family support new inquiry in Ramsey case
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The move to appoint a special prosecutor to
investigate the JonBenet Ramsey slaying is a popular one with
family and friends of the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ramsey, brother of John Ramsey, who lives in metro Atlanta,
said John and Patsy Ramsey are innocent and the case should
continue to be investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just grateful that the grand jury found there was no case
against them _ because they're innocent,'' Jeff Ramsey said. ``Now
we can get on with finding out who did this. Our intention is to
find that out.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Ramseys, he said: ``They feel this was just terrible
from all directions. They were innocent but they had to go through
all this. I just hope this opens people's minds to the fact that
(the police) were going down the wrong direction. I hope law
enforcement now puts some serious attention to finding the
killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Sanders, 56, of Sun Lake, Ariz., became close to Patsy
Ramsey when they were both suffering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, they never bothered to investigate anybody but
the Ramseys. I have a lot of frustration. There were a lot of
sloppy police procedures. Now, how are they ever going to find out
who killed their (the Ramseys') baby.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Ramseys ``are always changing their phone
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Patsy Ramsey could have never killed JonBenet, Sanders said.
``When she had cancer, she worked too hard to stay alive, so she
could take care of her children.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Smith, a longtime friend of the Ramseys and a chaperone
for Patsy Ramsey when she was West Virginia's entry in the Miss
America pageant, said the Ramseys had been in Boulder, Colo., for
Wednesday's announcement. Smith was happy when she heard the news
that her friends were not being indicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thrilled with the verdict,'' she said. ``I tried to call
them (Wednesday night) and (Thursday) but I don't know if they're
back in town yet. I know they were in Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said all along they weren't guilty. I'm sure the family is
relieved they're out from under suspicion, but they have to be
quite upset that someone else wasn't indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who said she spoke with the Ramseys last month, held out
little hope a special prosecutor would help. ``I guess I'm in favor
of it. But I'm afraid it would likely be a waste of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Steven Bacon, head of staff at Peachtree Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta, where the Ramseys worship, said the relationship
between ministers and the Ramseys falls into the realm of pastoral
care, and they have determined not to speak publicly about the
couple or the case.

 &HT;    Visitors reflect on sad injustice at Ramsey burial site
 &HT;    By Joshua B. Good and Fran Gilpin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Betty Broom and Roslyn Lambert had shopping on the
brain Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But bargain hunting in Marietta, Ga., could wait, as the two
strolled over to the corner of Winn and Polk streets for a more
somber, reflective moment _ a peak at JonBenet Ramsey's grave.
</P>
<P>
   The burial site has become a bit of a tourist stop _ not the
maddening, constant attraction, but a place often visited by folks
who'd never met any of the Ramseys. Thursday wasn't all that
different. A handful of visitors _ most like Broom and Lambert _
passed through.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first visit for Lambert, a 57-year-old Orlando, Fla.,
mother of three who had followed the coverage of the girl's slaying
by watching CNN and reading on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second visit for Broom, 58, of Atlanta. She showed
Lambert the dangling angel ornaments hanging from the tree
branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't this precious, these little angels?'' Broom asked,
cradling one in her hand.
</P>
<P>
   As Broom knelt next to the grave marker and lightly brushed her
hand across the stone, Lambert stood with her arms across her
chest, reciting her opinion of the unsolved homicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just baffles my mind, our justice system,'' Lambert said.
``In all the pictures of JonBenet, she was smiling. But if you look
at the eyes, just the eyes, she was so sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Broom stood, dusted herself off and smiled as she announced her
next destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're off to the (Marietta) Square to shop,'' Broom said.
</P>
<P>
   The next visitor was Kristen Valentine. She works across the
street at Marietta High School.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, 25, walked to the grave during her lunch break and
stopped to look for a few short moments as a TV camera recorded her
visit. Her two students ignored the grave and stared at the TV
camera.
</P>
<P>
   As Valentine turned to leave, she commented: ``It's quiet and
peaceful,'' referring to JonBenet's cemetery plot. But the visit
reminded Valentine that someone who killed a child is still free.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person or persons who did this have not been brought to
justice,'' she said.

NEW YORK TIMES BUYS MASSACHUSETTS NEWSPAPER FOR $295 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds note slug change: budgeted earlier as TIMES-ACQUIRE) 
(th) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Times Co. bought The Worcester Telegram
&AMP; Gazette on Thursday for $295 million, expanding its reach in
Massachusetts, where it already owns The Boston Globe, and making a
major investment in the newspaper industry, which is currently
buoyed by record advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's boom was reflected Thursday in the Times Co.'s
earnings report, which showed net income for the third-quarter
rising 9.2 percent, to $60 million, on revenue of $729.7 million.
The revenue total was 6.9 percent above the 1998 third-quarter
total of $682.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company's operating profit, excluding such specia
such as the cost of work force reductions at The Boston Globe, rose
11.2 percent, to $112.8 million from $101.4 million, an increase
spurred by a 9.9 percent increase in newspaper advertising revenue,
which rose to $460.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding the special items, the company earned 36 cents a
diluted share, one cent above the consensus estimate reported by
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   The company's purchase of the Worcester newspaper, with a daily
circulation of 107,000 and a Sunday circulation of 134,000 in
central Massachusetts, ended a lively competition among at least
seven newspaper companies bidding for the remaining newspaper
properties of Chronicle Publishing Co., which sold its flagship,
The San Francisco Chronicle, this summer to Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   One rival bidder, according to those who participated in the
negotiations, was Community Newspaper Co., which is based in
Needham, Mass., and publishes dailies in Framingham and Milford,
Mass., as well as more than 100 nondaily newspapers around the
state. Another was the Denver-based Media News Group Inc., which
owns five dailies in northern and central Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   The competition among bidders reflects the desire of newspaper
companies to consolidate, or cluster, their holdings in one
geographic area, to gain efficiencies in everything from printing
and distribution to advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Nielsen, a spokeswoman for the Times Co., said that the
company forecast economies in joint advertising sales between the
Globe and the Telegram &AMP; Gazette as well as centralizing newsprint
buying, accounting and record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   According to one person who has inspected the paper's financial
statements, the $295 million price was about 13.5 times the 1998
cash flow of the Telegram &AMP; Gazette _ a multiple well below that
paid by Pulitzer Inc. to Chronicle Publishing for The Pantagraph, a
newspaper in Bloomington, Ill., that has a circulation of 49,600.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days ago, Pulitzer announced its acquisition of The
Pantagraph for a purchase price of $180 million, representing a
multiple of roughly 19 times 1998 cash flow, according to one
newspaper company adviser who had seen the financial information
circulated by Chronicle Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   But the $295 million price for the Worcester paper was still a
strong reminder of the prices newspapers can command these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Worcester price is just reflective of the very strong
state of the newspaper marketplace,'' said Owen Van Essen, the
president of the newspaper brokerage firm of Dirks, Van Essen. He
added that newspapers the size of the Telegram &AMP; Gazette that
dominate their markets _ the newspaper reaches 43 percent of the
homes in Worcester County _ do not come on the market often.
</P>
<P>
   Van Essen added, ``There is bullishness in newspaper companies''
_ a comment bolstered by recent increases in the share price of
some newspaper companies. The Times Co., Knight Ridder, Dow Jones &AMP;
Co. and Times Mirror Co. all hit 52-week highs within the last
week.
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester purchase, however, had little effect on analysts'
views of the activities of the Times Co., particularly since the
$295 million cash outlay for the newspaper is dwarfed by the $376
million the company has spent to repurchase its stock this year.
</P>
<P>
   Two analysts, Lauren Rich Fine of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. and Kevin
R. Gruneich of Bear, Stearns, used the same word _ ``nonevent'' _
to describe the Worcester newspaper purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Both analysts focused instead on the resurgence of advertising
revenue at The Boston Globe, which took in $114.4 million in ad
revenue in the third quarter, a 9.8 percent increase over the
corresponding period in 1998. The New York Times newspaper took in
$260.5 million in the period, an increase of 10.9 percent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The most pleasant surprise was the upward pivot in Boston
Globe advertising,'' Gruneich said. He added that he also saw
``some awfully good momentum at Times Company Digital'' _ the
division of the company that includes Web sites like nytimes.com
and boston.com.
</P>
<P>
   The number of registered users of The New York Times on the Web
rose to 8.7 million, an increase of 900,000 over the June 30
figure.
</P>

SOUTH CAROLINA COURT ENDS VIDEO-POKER GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The country's largest video gambling industry faced
extinction Thursday when the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled
that the state's 34,000 video poker machines must be unplugged by
midnight June 30.
</P>
<P>
   In a swift stroke, the court put an end to the most rancorous
issue now confronting South Carolina, with all five justices voting
to silence the poker machines that have taken root in virtually
every convenience store and gas station in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The poker machines were at the core of the state's gubernatorial
election last year, and public anger against them had produced a
feverish campaign in recent weeks leading up to a Nov. 2 referendum
on whether the machines should remain legal. That referendum was
declared unconstitutional Thursday by the Supreme Court, triggering
a legal provision requiring the machines to be banned after June
30.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise decision, the result of a legal miscalculation by
one video poker operator, is the second major defeat this week for
organized gambling in the South. On Tuesday, with the encouragement
of religious leaders, voters in Alabama rejected a plan to create a
state lottery for the benefit of education.
</P>
<P>
   Church groups had also been extremely active in South Carolina
in campaigning against the video machines, which were called the
``crack cocaine'' of gambling in a recent national study because of
their addictive nature. Joined by most of the state's business
community and many of its politicians, the anti-poker effort had
appeared likely to suffocate the state's $2.8-billion-a-year
gambling industry at the ballot box, with polls showing that 61
percent of expected voters planned to vote against the machines.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling, however, said the referendum was
unconstitutional because it improperly gave the voters the ability
to legislate, a right reserved solely for the state Legislature.
The South Carolina Constitution, unlike those of some states, does
not contain a provision allowing referendums on legislative
matters.
</P>
<P>
   The court then went a step further and said that under the law
authorizing the referendum, video poker could continue only if the
voters approved. Because the referendum was i the court
said, the machines would have to be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of video poker had helped write the law with this
possibility in mind, because it was never clear that the public had
a legitimate right to vote on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The video industry wanted the law to say that poker would stay
alive unless it was killed by the voters, but legislators decided
that poker would die unless it was kept alive by the voters. The
law explicitly said that if the referendum should be declared
illegal, then the provision outlawing video poker would stay in
effect. The high court upheld that section of the law in its
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling opponents were overjoyed by the decision, even though
some had hoped for a definitive vote of the people next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were watching on TV when it was announced, and there was a
lot of shouting, high-fives, tears of disbelief, and joy,'' said
the Rev. Steve Hogg, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Rock
Hill and a leader of Change South Carolina, a prominent anti-poker
group. ``It looks the gambling industry knew they were going to
lose at the ballot box, and one of them went to court to stop the
vote. Boy, did that backfire on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the industry, fearing just such a ruling, had declined
to challenge the referendum in court. But one small operator,
Joytime Distributors and Amusements in Greenville, filed suit
against the referendum law, hoping the entire law would be thrown
out and the machines could stay.
</P>
<P>
   Other operators filed briefs to get the lawsuit thrown out. But
to the industry's chagrin, the court ruled that only the referendum
was illegal, while the rest of the law banning poker was upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, the industry could persuade the Legislature to
change the law, but legislative leaders said it was highly unlikely
they would revive the issue. Gov. Jim Hodges, who accepted $3
million from poker interests last year, half his campaign treasury,
but later announced that he would vote against gambling, said
Thursday that the industry did not have the votes to revive itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, as of June 30, the net result of this will be that
video gaming will no longer exist in South Carolina,'' Hodges said.
``We will move on and talk about other important issues on the
agenda in South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue will be a state lottery, which will be on the South
Carolina ballot in November 2000. Although Hodges built much of his
campaign on support for a lottery, anti-gambling forces are hoping
the momentum from the effort against video poker will carry over
into a defeat for a state numbers game, much like the vote in
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Video poker has far more opponents than the lottery. Business
leaders have said poker is destroying South Carolina's image, and
many people have been galvanized by the sight of impoverished poker
players feeding money into the machines.
</P>
<P>
   The poker industry, which had held out hopes that a statewide
advertising blitz might persuade voters to keep it alive, was
stunned by the ruling. Mike Fletcher, a spokesman for the South
Carolina Coin Operators Association, said the state's 650 operators
were so focused on the referendum that they barely knew how to
respond to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the highest court in the state, so I don't know how you
change that,'' Fletcher said. ``We're all kind of shocked and
saddened, but I guess we'll take some time to study the order and
figure out where we go next. Fortunately, we're not out of business
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there might be some way to convert the machines to
nongambling amusements, like pinball, but he admitted that would
make them far less popular.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Gambling supporters had warned that 28,000 employees of the
industry faced layoffs if poker was outlawed, from repairers to
store clerks to the attendants that were required by law to
supervise every five machines. Even if that number was an
exaggeration, it was clear that many people whose livelihoods came
from the machines faced an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unemployment line is going to be out the door, and I'm
going to be in it,'' said Chris Moskovic, assistant manager of the
Slots of Fun video parlor in West Columbia, which has 10 machines.
``This is like the state is telling me I have no rights, taking
food from my family's table. It's pretty close to being
Communist.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Francis Rice, a cashier at Cherokee Games in Fort Mill, one of
the casino-like parlors that cluster on the border with North
Carolina, said she would miss the friends she had made among the
parlor's regulars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was one of the nice places,'' Ms. Rice said. ``It was
nicely decorated and they even paid benefits. But I guess I could
always go back to waitressing.''

PRACTICE DROPS PLAN TO FINE DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hit by sharp criticisms, the Mount Auburn Cambridge Independent
Practice Association Inc. Thursday made a hasty retreat from plans
to impose a $250-a-day fine on doctors whose hospital admissions
are deemed ``not medically necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Physicians both in and outside the 350-doctor Cambridge, Mass.,
practice have expressed outrage at the penalty, which would have
been effective Nov. 1, according to an internal memo obtained by
the Globe. Critics argued that the fine would lead to denials of
necessary hospital care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charging $250 is quite mean spirited, frankly,'' said Dr.
Susan Bennett, an internist in Brookline, Mass. ``It's a financial
incentive to withhold care.''
</P>
<P>
   While the physician practice vigorously defended the fine as a
way to keep physicians accountable for wasteful medical practices,
it said it would review the policy before making any final decision
on whether to implement the fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we are delaying the implementation of the policy
to give us more time for further discussion and education of our
members,'' said a statement from the Cambridge practice. ``We will
seek additional reviews of the policy with the various ethics
committees with which we work.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care insurance companies have long deployed financial
rewards and penalties to prod doctors to practice efficiently, but
much of the incentives were shared by groups of doctors, rather
than individual physicians. The Cambridge practice's proposed
penalty departs from that model by taking direct aim at individual
physician's compensation, ethicists point out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having physicians be cost-conscious is certainly something we
all want,'' said Dr. Steven Pearson, associate director of the
Center for Ethics in Managed Care at Harvard Medical School and
Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. ``But when you get down to individual
physicians and individual patients, there would have to be an awful
lot of safeguards to prevent this from'' appearing to have a
conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
   That managed care tactics are being adopted by physician groups
presents a twist in the story. Health maintenance organizations
commonly have been villified for their cost-containment strategies.
But increasingly, HMOs have passed on the financial risk to large
hospitals and physician groups such as the Mount Auburn practice,
in essence turning the practices into little insurance companies
that receive a fixed payment to care for patients. If the medical
costs exceed the payment, the group has to make up the difference
out of their own pockets. If costs come under budget, the group
gets to keep the amount and distribute the profits among its
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed care companies have gotten out of the business of
being the bad cop by sharing the risk with physician groups who are
left trying to figure out how to live within a budget,'' said
Pearson.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over the Cambridge practice's penalty grows from a
long history of tensions between cost and access to health care. As
administrators struggle to keep a lid on the soaring price of
health care, physicians and patient advocates bristle under the
financial constraints. Managing those tensions has been a high-wire
exercise for many health care administrators, who are constantly
searching for new ways to cut costs without provoking too much
outcry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The managed care environment in which we operate is extremely
complicated,'' said the statement issued by the Cambridge practice.
``Our intent remains the same _ to try to improve the quality of
care we deliver to patients. We believe that the practice of good
medicine requires us to be mindful of our limited resources.''

GORE OPENS FIRE ON REPUBLICANS, BUT DRAWS LITTLE FIRE IN RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TREATY-CLINTON, CLINTON-REPUBLICANS) 
(sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE with KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Immediately after the Senate rejected the treaty
banning all underground nuclear testing on Wednesday night, Vice
President Al Gore personally _ and furiously _ dashed off the first
television commercial of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this campaign is about the future,'' Gore declares
in the advertisement, which hit the airwaves on Thursday night in
an attempt to carry President Clinton's assault on the
congressional Republicans into the presidential race. ``And there
is no more important challenge that stopping the spread of nuclear
weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   But the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas, and the other Republican contenders did little to
respond to Gore's challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Ensconced on Thursday at his ranch northwest of Waco, Bush
issued a written statement accusing the president of backing a
treaty riddled with shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``No American, Republican or Democrat, supports the spread of
nuclear weapons,'' he said. ``And if elected president I will be
committed to stopping proliferation. But this flawed treaty was not
the way to further the cause of peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, who declined requests to discuss the nuclear testing
issue with reporters on Thursday, offered no alternative
anti-nuclear prescription of his own and left it to his aides to
fill in what his objections were to the document rejected by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The central objection, Bush's advisers said, is that the treaty
would commit the United States to the ban in perpetuity, an
argument that supporters of the treaty reject. But they also
complained that the pact did not contain adequate provisions to
insure it was verifiable and would not adequately dissuade
countries like North Korea and Iraq from halting their arms
buildups.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other Republican candidates, Sen. John McCain of Arizona
and Elizabeth Dole complained that the treaty lacked adequate
verification measures but did not commit themselves to offering a
better version if they were elected president. The publisher Steve
Forbes said he supported underground nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic
nomination, issued a statement saying he would ask the Senate to
reconsider its vote if he is elected. The treaty, he said, was ``of
strategic importance'' and ``will strengthen the international
consensus for non-proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   The contrasting responses by the leading presidential candidates
offered a clear preview of how Republicans and Democrats intend to
portray the outcome of the Senate vote as evidence of their
superior approaches to foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, their responses were tempered by tactical
political considerations. The statements by Bush and his chief
rivals seemed intended to cement their credentials with
conservatives who are important in the primaries. But because polls
suggest that that voters in general usually favor such agreements,
they tried to draw a distinction between the particular document
rejected on Wednesday and the worthy goal of limiting the spread of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also sought to make President Clinton a foil,
arguing that the outcome demonstrated that he had lost credibility
_ and that it was time for an administration that commanded more
respect on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats did not argue that the treaty itself could be
turned into a powerful campaign issue, they tried to present the
vote as emblematic of reckless decisions by Republicans in
Congress. More specifically, Democrats said the vote was an ideal
vehicle to raise questions about Bush's lack of foreign policy
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was particularly swift and aggressive in his response,
does not cite Bush specifically in his new commercial. But, talking
with reporters on Air Force II as he flew on Thursday from Seattle
to Washington, Gore drew an unstated comparison by speaking at
length about the history of arms control. He vowed to make the vote
a fundamental issue in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``My world view is pretty well developed,'' he said. ``And this
plays a major role in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he felt so passionately about the issue
that when he checked into his hotel after two fund-raising events
in Seattle on Wednesday night, he pulled out a pen and a sheet of
white hotel stationery and wrote a script for the commercial. After
the script was typed, and then edited by Gore, his campaign
advisers dispatched a camera crew and filmed the commercial early
on Thursday in a conference room of the hotel. It will be broadcast
nationwide on CNN and on stations in the early-voting states of
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, said his party would argue
that the vote ``isolates the Republicans into a position outside
the broad mainstream.'' He said: ``And the more questions about war
and peace the more skittish the public becomes about Governor Bush.
He becomes the untested, the unknown, the person we feel less
certain about.''
</P>
<P>
   But Condoleeza Rice, Bush's top foreign policy adviser, bristled
at those who questioned the intentions of Senate Republicans. ``I
don't know why anyone would say to the Senate that their
constitutional responsibility to assess treaties is any less
important than the president's responsibility,'' she said. ``That's
not partisan. That's not political. That's a national security
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview here before the Senate vote on Wednesday, Bush
suggested that a defeat for Clinton might come from a lack of
credibility on Capitol Hill. Asked if another president would
encounter such resistance, he said: ``It depends on whether or not
the next president can earn the trust of the Congress. It's just a
matter of relationships that need to be strong.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bush hastened to add: ``The reason the test ban treaty, in
my judgment, is not going forward is because a lot of senators
think it's a bad idea. Hopefully, this isn't a personality contest.
A lot of senators, thoughtful people, feel that we shouldn't have a
test-ban treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Mrs. Dole said the agreement was ``ineffective, non
verifiable and will not contribute to non-proliferation or our
national security.'' She added that it was ``nebulous in its
terminology and different countries will interpret it
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain agreed that the treaty was not verifiable. ``The only
safe course, was to do what President Reagan did at Reykjavik: take
no deal rather than a bad one.'' At the Soviet-American summit in
Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1986, Reagan came close to a sweeping
arms-reduction deal with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev but backed
away.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said his main objection was that he believes there should
be underground nuclear tests on a periodic basis. ``It is not
enough to rely upon computer models,'' he said. ``The experts tell
us we need real-world tests and I agree.''

NURSING HOME CHAIN SEEKS BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sun Healthcare Group Inc., one of the largest nursing home
chains in America, Thursday filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection, becoming the fourth nursing home company with major
operations in the state to seek court protection against its
creditors in as many months.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, based in Albuquerque, has over 4,500 patients in
Massachusetts in 36 facilities, called SunBridge homes, that are
scattered throughout the state. Nationally, Sun has 369 facilities
with roughly 40,200 beds.
</P>
<P>
   Sun officials Thursday reassured state nursing home regulators
that it fully intends to keep its homes open and workers employed.
</P>
<P>
   Sun has not been alone in its financial woes. Vencor Inc., based
in Louisville, Ky., filed for Chapter 11 court protection last
month. In late June, it was NewCare Health Corp. of Atlanta, which
owns four nursing homes in Western Massachusetts. In July, the
Frontier Group, a Boston chain with 700 beds in Massachusetts,
sought protection from its creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the four companies represent 17 percent of all nursing
homes in Massachusetts, according to Scott Plumb, senior vice
president of the Massachusetts Extended Care Federation, which
represents over 500 nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many more facilities will it take for Medicare and
Medicaid to realize how grossly underfunded our industry is,''
Plumb said.
</P>
<P>
   Sun, like other financially troubled nursing home companies
preceding it in federal bankruptcy court, pleaded shortfalls in
government reimbursements from such programs as Medicare and
Medicaid, both of which make up the vast majority of payments to
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep cuts in Medicare reimbursement exceeded all industry
expectations and severely impacted the ability to service its
current capital structure,'' Sun's Chief Executive Andrew L. Turner
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say that Sun's relentless acquisition strategy over
the years led to an unsustainable debt load. Earlier this year, it
defaulted on more than $1.57 billion in loans and bonds, leading in
June to the delisting of its shares on the New York Stock Exchange.
Company executives in August began to reassure state regulators
that it would continue to operate its 369 nursing homes in the
event it sought court protection to reorganize its finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a company that was extended to begin with,'' said
Charles W. Lynch, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we are specifically instructing the states to monitor
Sun's homes to ensure that residents continue to receive quality
care. (T)he reports that we have received to date suggest that
residents remain safe,'' said Michael Hash, deputy administrator of
the US Health Care Financing Administration, which regulates
nursing homes.

 &HT;    No letting up for Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For this the Mets can thank their favorite team from
the Bronx: the Braves are anything but secure in their 2-0 lead in
this National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   That's because they had an even better one not too long ago _
2-0 on the Yankees in the 1996 World Series in New York _ and lost.
So they don't need anyone to remind them before tonight's Game 3 at
Shea Stadium that no lead is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-0 means very little when you're playing a good team,''
Chipper Jones said. ``The momentum of a series can shift with one
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. Like Jim Leyritz's home run off Mark Wohlers in the eighth
inning of Game 4 of the '96 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about who was going to have post-World Series
parties,'' Jones said. ``Just goes to show you overlook a team, you
take something for granted, all of a sudden you relax and the team
is on your heels again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Humility, for us now having been there, is an incredible
thing,'' John Smoltz said. ``You learn a lot from it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Braves plan to go about their stay this weekend in New
York the way they did the better part of September _ sniffing out
the jugular.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves used that attitude to take the Mets out of the NL
East with six consecutive wins, including a three-game sweep of the
Mets. Then after beating Mike Hampton and the Astros in the pivotal
Game 3 of the Division Series, the Braves finished them off the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chemistry we have in the clubhouse, it builds emotion,''
said Brian Jordan, who drove in all five runs in that Game 3. ``We
know it's not going to be a cake-walk. We also know if we can win
the first game here off Al Leiter, that's going to be the straw to
break the camel's back, and that's what we're looking to do. I
don't want to go back to Atlanta. I want to win this weekend. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to take anything for granted,'' Jordan said. ``I
want to kick you while you're down, and I don't want it to be
close. I've had enough heart attacks for one season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan wasn't with the Braves in 1996, but he knows how they
feel because he was playing for the Cardinals when they collapsed
to the Braves in the 1996 NLCS despite having a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like this team is in a situation to expect the
unexpected,'' Smoltz said. ``I think this team has been through
enough. We're not really feeling anything right now. ... Pressure
is what you create for the other team.''

   In a new challenge to the longstanding belief that adults never
generate new brain cells, biologists at Princeton University have
found that thousands of freshly born neurons arrive each day in the
cerebral cortex, the outer rind of the brain where higher
intellectual functions and personality are centered.
</P>
<P>
   Though based on research in monkeys, the finding is likely to
prove true of people, too. If so, several experts said, it may
overturn ideas about how the human brain works and open new
possibilities for treating degenerative brain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   If the new brain cells, or neurons, are involved in memory and
learning _ perhaps with each day's batch of new cells recording
that day's experiences _ scientists will have to make major
revisions in the long-standing view that the adult brain's neurons
are static in number and that memory is stored only in the way they
interconnect.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if the brain's cells are in constant turnover, as
the new finding suggests, physicians may discover ways to use the
brain's natural regeneration system for replacing cells that are
lost in diseases of aging.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery, by Dr. Elizabeth Gould and Dr. Charles Gross, is
reported in Friday's issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that the adult brain does not make new cells rested
on careful, well-known studies by Dr. Pasko Rakic of Yale
University, who looked for the formation of new neurons in the
monkey brain and found none.
</P>
<P>
   But the Princeton work is likely to be convincing, because it
builds on previous reports of brain cell turnover, notably by Dr.
Fernando Nottebohm of Rockefeller University, who showed that
canaries grow new neurons to learn new songs, and on recent studies
showing that new cells are formed in the hippocampus, a brain
region where initial memories of faces and places are formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientific community can easily believe something it is 50
percent ready to absorb, but not something that comes out of left
field,'' said Dr. Eric Kandel, a leading neuroscientist at Columbia
University. ``But here, we are prepared for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandel compared the likely change in view to the paradigm shifts
described by the historian of science Thomas Kuhn as occurring when
one major scientific theory is replaced by another.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new study was done in macaque monkeys and has yet
to be confirmed in humans, as fellow primates monkeys are usually
quite predictive of what occurs in people.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gould, who has studied new cell formation in the
hippocampus, and Gross, an expert on the cerebral cortex, injected
macaques with a chemical that is incorporated in the new DNA formed
when a cell divides.
</P>
<P>
   They found that a stream of new neurons was generated in the
monkeys' brains in a zone just above the brain's fluid-filled
central chambers. This zone was recently identified by other
scientists as the home of the brain's stem cells, the source cells
from which an organ is replenished.
</P>
<P>
   The new neurons migrated toward the cortex, matured and sent out
axons to make connections with other brain cells, the Princeton
biologists found.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers looked for new neurons in four areas of the
cortex, and found them in three areas where memories are known to
be stored: the frontal cortex, used for decision-making, and two
areas on the side of the brain used for visual recognition. No new
neurons were detected in the fourth area, the striate cortex, a
region at the back of the head that simply processes visual
information from the eyes and passes it on to other parts of the
cortex.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the new cells are doing in the cortex, they affect
regions of the brain that are central to human thought and
identity. The Princeton work, said Dr. Ronald McKay, an expert on
brain stem cells at the National Institutes of Health, ``places new
neurons in the region of the brain involved in the highest level of
personality: It's the frontal cortex that is important in
determining who you are in a very human way.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gould said it was possible that the new neurons arriving in
the cortex would be particularly sensitive to recording information
for a certain period while they matured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would become integrated in the circuitry and represent
the information being learned at that particular time,'' she said,
after which they would not record anything more.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the conveyor belt of new neurons might record
successive days' experiences almost like a moving tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the characteristic of memory is that events are tagged
with times,'' Gross said. ``We have no idea how that is done. But
since we have now shown there are new cells added every day, which
cover a spectrum of ages, these cells could possibly provide the
substrate for the temporal dimension of memory.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Kandel, of Columbia University, said the idea was perfectly
possible, given how little was now known about the brain's system
for ultimate long-term memory storage.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you distinguish the memory of 20 years ago from the
memory of 30 years ago? You would have to mark the birthday of the
cell in some way,'' Kandel said, suggesting that the train of new
neurons offered a plausible mechanism whereby the brain might
somehow do this.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that new memories are stored in a train of new nerve
cells was advocated in the 1960s by Dr. Joseph Altman, then of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But his proposal was not
widely accepted. And when Rakic, an acknowledged authority on
neuron formation in the embryonic monkey brain, reported in 1985
that no new neurons were formed in the adult monkey's brain, this
became the accepted view.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Dr. Gould and others showed recently that new cells
were formed in the hippocampus, Rakic argued that this was a
primitive area of the brain _ even reptiles have a hippocampus _
and that brain organs acquired more recently in evolution, like the
primates' cerebral cortex, would not be expected to behave the same
way.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gould said it was this argument that had made her determined
to look for new cells being formed in the cerebral cortex, despite
the expense of doing work on monkeys and the risk in ``redoing an
experiment that a very well respected person,'' Rakic, had already
performed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rakic's office said he was traveling Thursday and unavailable
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   If indeed the brain is constantly renewing the cells in its
cortex, hippocampus and maybe other areas, the prospects for
learning how to repair the aged or damaged brain begin to look much
more hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Degenerative diseases of the brain are really defined by loss
of nerve cells,'' Kandel said. Though diseases like Parkinson's
affect specific areas of the brain, it might become possible to
channel young new neurons into the areas of disease. ``This is pie
in the sky,'' he said, ``but at least there is now the possibility
of thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Greenough, a neuroscientist at the University of
Illinois, said the Princeton work created a ``whole new ballgame''
for addressing brain diseases, by harnessing the brain's own
restorative potential.
</P>
<P>
   The Princeton biologists plan to follow up their discovery by
blocking the formation of new neurons in monkeys' brains and seeing
what happens. If the new neurons are essential for memory and
learning, then serious deficits should appear in the monkeys'
performance. The researchers as yet have no idea whether the loss
of brain cells and the generation of new ones are separate events
or part of the same cycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our discovery,'' Gross said, ``suggests more questions than
answers.''

A MOST PERSONAL CRUSADE TO AID THE WORLD'S HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Eds.-- 39 days in graph 4 is as of 10-15-99)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His cheeks are sunken, his ankles swollen.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he started using a cane. By next week he expects to
need a walker, and a week later a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   David Duncombe is starving. Deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   The retired minister from White Salmon, Wash., has been fasting
for 39 days now in an effort to call attention to the starving
people of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a city swarming with lobbyists and protesters of all sorts,
Duncombe is trying a personal approach. He is trying to persuade
members of Congress, one by one, to cancel the debt owed the United
States by about 40 impoverished countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them (lawmakers) to look at the face of starvation, to
hear my voice, to touch my hand,'' he says. ``I'm becoming one of
the starving millions of people in the world, one of the 10,000 a
day who could be saved by passage of this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sept. 7, Duncombe has consumed no food. A gallon of water
a day, potassium pills, and faith are keeping him alive. Each day,
by his own account, he stops by several dozen congressional
offices, trying to talk with staffers or, on rare occasions,
members of Congress, to make his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   His fast is a most personal expression of a worldwide religious
movement to make the year 2000 a year of Jubilee, a concept
described in the Bible according to which, every 50 years, all
debts should be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The debts are large. During the 1970s and '80s, in part as a
byproduct of an energy crisis and the Cold War, numerous poor
countries accumulated an estimated $200 billion in debt to a
variety of wealthy countries and international organizations. About
$7 billion is owed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to debt relief advocates, money that poor
countries could spend on food or medicine is instead going to debt
service.
</P>
<P>
   So a worldwide coalition of religious and political leaders is
pushing for debt forgiveness as a way to reduce world hunger and
poverty. There are a variety of proposals that differ in terms of
who gives the relief, who gets it, and under what condition, but
they share a common goal _ forgiving loans.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of Jubilee debt forgiveness has been endorsed by a
number of world religions and religious leaders, including Pope
John Paul II and the Revs. Billy Graham, Jesse Jackson and Pat
Robertson, as well as an eclectic collection of organizations and
individuals, including the rock stars Bono and Sting. Political
supporters of some form of debt relief include President Clinton
and the major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the 129 co-sponsors of the main debt relief bill
include Washington state Republican Jack Metcalf and Democrats
Brian Baird, Norm Dicks, Jim McDermott and Adam Smith; in the
Senate the 11 co-sponsors include Washington state Democrat Patty
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals face an uncertain future in a Congress generally
unenthusiastic about foreign aid, apprehensive about whether
impoverished countries would really use forgiven loan money to feed
the poor, and, at the moment, focused on the task of finishing up
work on budget bills and heading home for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe says he doesn't want to die, but he recognizes an irony
of his particular form of protest _ the more damage he does to
himself, the more effective he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I represent the actual starvation of millions of
people through my body, letting my body talk for me, the more
chance the spirit of the Lord has to act in these people to inform
their conscience and to give them another perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His body temperature has dropped far enough that he must seek
out the sun for warmth, which he does at least twice a day, sitting
on the steps of the Capitol, hoping lawmakers will stop him to ask
about his cause.
</P>
<P>
   The wooden cross that hangs around his neck bounces freely in
the space created by his suddenly roomy sportcoat.
</P>
<P>
   His briefcase doubles as a seat cushion. Stuffed with a pillow,
it helps him endure the fact that his pelvic bones are now the most
pronounced feature of his backside.
</P>
<P>
   He has met mostly with congressional aides, and a handful of
their bosses. For more than a month he has been showing up every
Wednesday morning at a coffee held for constituents by Sen. Murray.
At first she didn't know what to make of this unusual participant
in a group dominated by tourists looking for a picture with a
senator and a ticket to see Congress in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was to dismiss him as somebody with a crazy
cause I didn't know too much about, but he kept coming, and I
started listening to him, and there was something in him that
struck me,'' Murray said. ``It struck me that someone would give up
so much of themselves to make a U.S. senator aware that other
people were suffering, and I was very struck when he said he came
back here to meet senators and representatives and I was the only
one he'd been able to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his initial visit, Murray has been trying to help Duncombe
meet with other lawmakers, and has signed on as a co-sponsor to the
Senate debt relief bill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawmakers Duncombe has seen is Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio,
who has gone on hunger strikes himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is making a tremendous commitment,'' Hall said. ``Apart
from the fact that it brings attention to the issue, it brings a
spiritual element to it, because you're doing it under God. It's
much more powerful than most people realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups pushing for debt relief welcome the help,
although they don't know what will happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the U.S. Congress is debating what to do with a
multibillion dollar budget surplus, here's someone who is putting
his life on the line, saying that we can spare some pocket change
to help countries heavily burdened by debt,'' said David Bryden of
Jubilee 2000/USA, which is offering Duncombe a variety of
logistical support. ``When he shakes the hands of a legislator, the
legislator picks up on the fact that this man is starving. This is
a town where we all get wrapped up in policy debates, and here's a
guy who's making a simple moral appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe is clearly hampered by his informality. He hasn't met
with Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a fellow Dartmouth alum, in part
because he keeps showing up without an appointment. Other lawmakers
have met him only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that David's interest is in seeing that he makes a
statement to members of Congress and their staffs,'' said Barbara
Howell, director of government relations for Bread for the World, a
Christian lobbying group. ``As to its effectiveness, I don't know,
but he is absolutely a sincere person not wanting to make a
spectacle but to make as vivid as possible the suffering of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe is a native New Yorker and an Army veteran who has
spent much of his life in academia. He did his undergraduate work
at Dartmouth, was ordained by the United Church of Christ while
teaching prep school, got four graduate degrees from Yale and then
worked as a chaplain at Yale and at a health ministry associated
with the University of California at San Francisco before retiring
with his wife to White Salmon in 1993. There, he does plumbing work
for non-profit organizations, trying to help them save money.
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe has a long history of protest, and claims to have been
arrested more than 100 times. He joined Martin Luther King Jr.'s
voter registration drive in Selma, Ala. in 1965. He led a group of
picketers demanding a building permit for a women's shelter in the
tiny town of Bingen, Wash., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, in 1987 he was one of three men who tried to
block a train they believed was carrying arms shipments destined
for Central America from the Concord Naval Weapons Station in
California. When it became apparent that the train was not going to
stop, Duncombe and another man leapt to safety; Brian Willson was
hit and lost both his legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord protest was the first time Duncombe had gone on an
extended fast _ he stopped eating for 40 days after Wilson got hit.
In 1991, after he was jailed in another protest, he again stopped
eating for 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he has fasted before makes this one easier to
handle. After seven days, he said, he stopped feeling much hunger.
He uses meditation to control any pain. He says he'll stop if he
gets some indication that Congress plans to pass debt relief, or if
he becomes so incapacitated that he's no longer effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anxious to be a martyr,'' he said. ``I love my wife
and my kids, and I'm really happy. But I'm risking my health, and
even my life, in hopes that I can reduce the loss of life for
millions of people round the world. This is the way I can make my
life count.''

FAA CHIEF SAYS AIRLINES MUST DO MORE TO EASE DELAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administrator Jane Garvey said Thursday that
while her agency is working hard to reduce the number of delays
that cost airlines more than $1 billion this year and frustrate
passengers, only so much can be done in the air and airlines and
airports must also do more.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey, in testimony in Washington before the House Committee on
Transportation and Infrastructure subcommittee on aviation,
acknowledged that the FAA ``clearly has an important role to play
in the reduction of airline delays'' but said only so much can be
done in the air to correct existing problems.
</P>
<P>
   She said the burden of reducing delays also must be shared by
airlines in terms of scheduling, and by airports which must deal
with what she called the ``very politically sensitive issue'' of
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Garvey's remarks come at a time when she is being asked to
decide whether the Massachusetts Port Authority should be allowed
to proceed with plans for a controversial new runway at Boston's
Logan Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard choices will have to be made at all levels of government
with communities across the country to ensure that we have the
infrastructure in place to accommodate anticipated demand,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether local communities are discussing new runways, new
terminals, or new airports, the debate is always heartfelt and
emotional. While the FAA will continue to make those improvements
to the NAS (national airspace system) that are within our control,
improving how the aircraft are controlled in the air does not
necessarily ensure them a place to land on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   An FAA official said Garvey's remarks were not meant to address
specific airports but deal broadly with the complex issue of
delays, both from capacity problems in terminals and at curbside
and on runways.
</P>
<P>
   A Massachusetts native and a protege of several high-profile Bay
State politicians who are opposed to the runway, Garvey has not
disclosed her position on the proposed Logan runway, but sources
say she has been spending much of her free time on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even proponents of the proposed runway have said it would not
make Boston's airport free of delays, only reduce them.
</P>
<P>
   The number of delays at airports nationally increased
dramatically this year and Carol Hallett, president and chief
executive of the Air Transport Association, placed blame squarely
on the FAA. Hallett, whose trade association represents the major
passenger and cargo airlines, said in her testimony that the delays
``were the worst in history'' and caused $825 million in lost
productivity to passengers and more than $1 billion in losses to
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Hallett said the FAA fails to use real-time tracking to reduce
delays caused by bad weather, which forces airplanes to be
temporarily held at airports or to be rerouted. Using last July 31
as an example, Hallett said real-time tracking did not occur as
thunderstorms were forecast in a line between Buffalo and Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consequently, numerous opportunities for relief from the
punishing ground stops that FAA had imposed, which assumed total
coverage by storms, were not taken advantage of, even though there
were large holes in the line of thunderstorms,'' she said. Some 700
flights were delayed that day, many needlessly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Schwitz, executive vice president of the National Air
Traffic Controllers Association, however, testified that much of
the blame belongs with airlines because their schedules _ which
they set _ are ``intentionally overloading the system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Schedules are blindly made to reduce operating costs and
maximize revenue without regard for other airlines, terminal
airspace or airport capacity,'' he said. ``Airline over-scheduling
during peak hours guarantees delays at busy airports even in good
weather. It is like trying to cram 10 pounds of sand into a five
pound bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey and Schwitz both said the FAA is moving to improve air
traffic management by centralizing issuance and coordination of any
extensive ground-stop orders at its command center in Virginia. The
FAA has also pledged to reduce the maximum separation between
planes flying in the same direction from 90 to 30 miles.

MILITARY LEADER DECLARES HIMSELF PAKISTAN'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ In the middle of the night, just two days
after the armed forces toppled the country's elected government,
the army chief declared martial law, suspended the constitution and
Parliament and named himself the country's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who had clashed with Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif over control of the powerful armed forces,
also dissolved the provincial legislatures and decreed that the
prime minister, Cabinet ministers and provincial governors would
cease to hold office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole of Pakistan will come under the control of the armed
forces of Pakistan,'' according to a statement released early
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The general's decision to rule Pakistan himself will come as a
rude shock to many lawyers, scholars and journalists who were
convinced he was about to name a civilian government of technocrats
to run the country, while keeping the constitution largely in
place. The armed forces launched the coup Tuesday, just an hour or
so after Sharif had fired the general.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Brig. Rashid Qureshi, the chief spokesman for the
armed forces, had assured the state news agency, ``Yes, democracy
is intact.'' And a spokesman for President Muhammad Rafiq Tarar
said Musharraf wanted to restore civilian authority. ``The
rehabilitation of the democratic process as soon as possible is a
goal shared by both men,'' Qureshi said.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, the army's decision to empty the
Parliament building on Thursday and seal it turned out to be a
truer foreshadowing of its intent. Pakistan has been governed by
generals for 25 of its 52 years as an independent nation, though it
has sustained a shaky, imperfect democracy for the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   The military's latest takeover may have serious repercussions
for Pakistan's economy. The International Monetary Fund may cut off
loans unless democracy is restored. The reserves of foreign
exchange that Pakistan needs to import food are already quite low.
</P>
<P>
   Even before this morning's announcement, there were signs of
nervousness. Prices on the jittery Karachi Stock Exchange plunged
more than 7 percent on Thursday. The state bank ordered
moneychangers to close for business until Wednesday to stop a
flight of foreign capital out of the country. The army prohibited
nearly 400 leaders of the Muslim League, Sharif's party, from
traveling abroad. And in Karachi on Thursday, the police broke up a
demonstration against the coup, shoving more than a dozen people
into vans.
</P>
<P>
   International calls for a return to democracy continued to
mount. In his news conference on Thursday, President Clinton
addressed the coup's leaders: ```You should not do it. It's not
necessary, it will hurt your economy and endanger your future.'
That is our message to Pakistan, and we hope they will move to a
civilian government as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Pakistan, some in the intelligensia said Sharif's
autocratic, incompetent rule and his failure to deliver economic
progress or law and order justified the takeover. The News, an
English-language daily, said in an editorial, ``The undemocratic
ways of Pakistan's elected civilian government created conditions
which left the army, the most powerful and professional institution
in the country, with no other option but to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bazaars of Rawalpindi and the government offices of
Islamabad, people seemed fascinated by the unfolding melodrama and
its main players. Hungry for information and distrustful of the
state-run television and radio stations, they snapped up
newspapers; one hawker, Mohammad Khalil, said the stacks of papers
that used to take him most of the day to sell are gone by 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The general himself is a favorite subject. Jaggo, a vegetable
seller who only gave one name, said he stayed up until 3 a.m.
Wednesday to watch Musharraf explain why the military had
overthrown the government. ``I couldn't understand a word he said
because he spoke English,'' Jaggo said. ``But he looked good and
he's got a voice full of grandeur.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanif Khan, a sugar mill worker, thought Sharif, who is thought
to be under house arrest in Lahore, had been guilty of the sin of
pride. Sharif had tried to dismiss two army chiefs in one year,
tempting the fates in a country where the military sees itself as
the sole honest institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must always be god-fearing,'' said Khan. ``He was like a
king, but today he's a prisoner.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf had been Sharif's hand-picked choice for army chief a
year ago. But the two men have been at loggerheads over Sharif's
decision to withdraw the Pakistan-backed forces that occupied a
section of Indian-held Kashmir over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The military felt that Sharif had bowed to pressure from
President Clinton by agreeing to the pull out, and then tried to
blame the military for the failed military adventure. India and
Pakistan, both new nuclear powers, have fought three wars in the
past 52 years and were on the verge of a fourth until the
withdrawal in July.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the military justified its seizure of power as a
spontaneous effort to protect Musharraf. Sharif had made the
surprise announcement that he was firing the general at 5 p.m.
Tuesday, while the general was airborne, returning from an official
visit to Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
   As the general's commercial flight approached the airport in
Karachi, the pilot was instructed not to land, though the jet was
short of fuel and carrying 240 passengers, 20 of them children,
Qureshi said, and army commanders made a decision on the spot to
take over the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The coup proceeded so effectively and swiftly that many think
the armed forces must have developed a contingency plan that was to
go into effect if Sharif tried to get rid of the army chief.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pakistan's Constitution, those who organize the overthrow
of an elected government can be charged with treason and sentenced
to death, though there is precedent for the courts' validating the
imposition of martial law, as in the case of Gen. Mohammad
Zia-ul-Haq's overthrow of Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in
1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, nobody has been tried under this article of the
constitution,'' said Shabbar Rizvi, a constitutional lawyer in
Lahore. ``The courts have always given legitimacy to such acts
because of some mitigating factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the two-page notice the military released
overnight, the courts will be irrelevant, at least unless and until
the general decides to return the power he has taken. The notice
declares that the courts will continue to function but will have no
power to make any decision against Musharraf in his capacity as the
new chief executive.

 GOP SENATORS ASSAIL McCAIN  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a surprisingly harsh attack on a Republican
presidential candidate by his party colleagues, a group of GOP
senators Thursday publicly accused Arizona Senator John McCain of
savaging their integrity in his bid for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate opened debate on revamping the nation's
political-finance laws _ the cornerstone of McCain's presidential
campaign _ several GOP members challenged McCain to prove his
assertion that they are enmeshed in a fabric of corruption spun by
vast special-interest money.
</P>
<P>
   The rare public display of Republican infighting erupted on the
Senate floor as polls showed McCain gaining momentum in the
presidential race and as foes of overhauling the campaign finance
system signaled new determination to foil the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Citing McCain's corruption charges, Senator Mitch McConnell, a
Kentucky Republican, excoriated ``senators who go before the
American people and declare openly and with great conviction that
votes are being bought in the halls of the United States Capitol.
When senators make those kinds of allegations about their
colleagues, I think what we're suggesting here is that they ought
to back it up,'' said McConnell, the leading foe of McCain's
campaign-finance initiative.
</P>
<P>
   McCain did not yield, even as two other GOP senators _ Robert F.
Bennett of Utah and Slade Gorton of Washington _ demanded he
withdraw assertions on his Web site that they had pursued
unauthorized congressional funds for special projects in their
states as ``a direct result of the rise of soft money.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's proposal would ban soft money, the unlimited and
unregulated contributions to political parties that were linked to
several fund-raising crimes in the 1996 elections. The two major
parties are projected to raise a total of $525 million in soft
money by the 2000 election, double the amount they amassed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been accused of being corrupt, of caving in to soft
money,'' Bennettt said, referring to McCain's claim that Bennett
pursued $2.2 million in federal funds for the 2002 Olympic Games in
Salt Lake City as a direct result of the proliferation of
special-interest money in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, taking ``personal offense'' at the charge, demanded on
the Senate floor that McCain prove he acted corruptly or withdraw
the assertion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he cited the funds that Bennett and Gorton had
obtained to highlight the ``systemic'' and ``pernicious'' influence
of soft money in politics, not to impugn their integrity. But he
refused to apologize or withdraw his allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am fighting a system here,'' McCain said. ``I am trying to
change the system which corrupts all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Unmollified, the McConnell team clashed with the defiant McCain
for more than two hours, eventually prompting a rare scene, as
Senator Paul D. Wellstone of Minnesota, a Democrat, tried to
intervene in the potentially damaging GOP squabble. Addressing
McConnell, Wellstone said, ``May I ask the senator, how long will
he continue with the attack on Senator McCain?''
</P>
<P>
   Sniping at colleagues with presidential ambitions is nothing new
in the Senate, where many members harbor White House aspirations.
But the targeting of McCain was McConnell's latest strategy to
derail the effort to overhaul the campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   Citing McCain's corruption claims, McConnell said in a news
conference, ``This is a new argument that has been made out on the
campaign trail, and I am highly offended by the loose talk of
corruption when there is no proof.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ending soft-money donations, McCain's measure,
cosponsored by Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat,
would require labor unions to notify dues payers who are not union
members that they can request that their dues not be used for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold, trying to gain support for a measure that
has failed to pass the Senate three times in recent years, removed
a controversial provision that would have limited how much money
independent groups can raise to influence elections and would have
required the groups to disclose the sources of their money.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, by voice vote, Thursday adopted an amendment by
McConnell that was clearly a jab at McCain. The provision would
require senators to report any information about a colleague's
corrupt actions.
</P>
<P>
   Before the amendment passed, however, McCain took a final shot
at McConnell, noting that McConnell told Republican senators in a
closed-door meeting last year that they could take comfort in
voting against a landmark proposal to regulate the tobacco industry
because cigarette makers would support them with a massive
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who has raised millions of dollars in soft money from
the tobacco industry as chairman of the Senate GOP reelection
committee, said he was ``deeply offended'' by McCain's remarks,
though he did not dispute them. He said his opposition to tobacco
legislation stems from his desire to protect the 45,000 tobacco
growers in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the Senate approved, 77-20, a McCain amendment
that would tighten restrictions and disclosure requirements on
funds that national parties transfer to state and local political
committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this fight is about is taking the $100,000 check out of
American politics for good,'' McCain said. ``It's about putting the
little guy back in charge and freeing our system from the
corrupting power of the special interests' bottomless wallets.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Feingold appear to remain at least seven votes short
of the 60 they will need to break McConnell's expected filibuster
and force a vote on the soft-money ban.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell said he considers the proposed ban on soft money an
assault on free speech. And he appeared to revel in his ability to
consistently block the McCain-Feingold initiative, even chiding the
sponsors for scaling down the bill. ``If it were whittled down any
further,'' McConnell said, ``only the effective date would
remain.''
</P>
<P>
   The final showdown will come next week, after five days of
Senate debate.

STATES' PAYMENTS TO LAWYERS BRING CONTINGENCY-FEE BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>

 By BARRY MEIER and RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing wave of lawsuits by cities and states against makers
of tobacco, guns _ and now lead paint _ has reignited a fierce
debate over the role of lawyers and the enormous fees they can earn
in legal actions brought by public officials.
</P>
<P>
   The issue erupted after prominent plaintiffs' lawyers, hired by
state attorneys general to sue cigarette makers, earned billions of
dollars in contingency fees as a result of the $246 billion in
settlements with the companies. Now some of those same lawyers,
whose earnings are contingent upon their winning a percentage of
any jury award or settlement, have been hired by states and cities
to sue gun makers and lead paint producers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of business counteroffensive against the trend, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce will soon begin an intensive lobbying campaign
to get legislatures to drastically restrict states' use of
contingency lawyers. Recently, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also
signed a law, backed by companies, that sharply limited the ability
of the state's attorney general to hire contingency-fee lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The question has split legal experts. Economically strapped
elected officials need the skills and resources of outside lawyers
to handle difficult cases, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It levels the playing field because the other side is relying
on very skilled lawyers,'' said Robert L. Rabin, a professor of law
at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   But the interests of those lawyers can conflict with those of
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees can be out of line with the amount of work and effort
that is actually put in,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities suing the gun industry have decided to use their own
lawyers, rather than outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation proposed by the Chamber of Commerce, any
outside lawyer who contributed more than $250 to the campaign of a
public official would be barred from being hired to pursue a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wootton, the executive director of Institute for Legal
Reform at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that
provision would restrict influence peddling. Plaintiffs' lawyers,
though, have contributed largely to Democratic candidates, while
the business interests they sue have traditionally supported
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The law would also prohibit a state from changing any laws that
could affect litigation while the state was suing an industry or
even contemplating such a lawsuit, Wootton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wootton said limiting the use of contingency lawyers was a vital
issue for industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is one of the biggest threats facing American
industry today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such challenge came on Wednesday when Rhode Island
Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse said his state would sue eight
paint companies and a lead industry group to seek payment for the
treatment of children poisoned by lead paint and for its removal.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be handled by the law firm of Ness, Motley,
Loadholt, Richardson &AMP; Poole of Charleston, S.C., which represented
some two dozen states in tobacco cases, earning hundreds of
millions in fees in the process. Rhode Island will pay 17 percent
of any award or settlement to the firm, which is financing the
lawsuit and talks with other states about similar actions.
</P>
<P>
   Other tobacco veterans are also posed to jump in. Richard
Scruggs, a Pascagoula, Miss., lawyer who represented that state and
some 20 others against cigarette makers, has had talks with public
officials interested in suing. And Steve Berman, a Seattle lawyer
who represented several states, including Washington, in their
tobacco case, said he has discussed lead paint lawsuits with two
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have challenged in court contentious industries that
have successfully fought legislative restrictions or regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts believe that such high-powered law firms can
play a valuable role in public litigation because they have
financial resources to spend years, if necessary, tracking
documents, interviewing witnesses and aggressively fighting
pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University said he
believed that it would be a ``disaster'' for the public if the type
of legislation being promoted by the Chamber of Commerce was
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But Coffee also voiced concerns about potential conflicts
between lawyers who donate heavily to the campaigns of officials
who can hire them. And other legal experts said that outside
lawyers could have a financial stake in settling a case that might
be at odds with the broad public's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public might have been interested in getting more
concessions from cigarette companies in return for taking less
money'' said Susan Koniak, a professor of law at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, the plaintiff's lawyer in Seattle, said he believed that
outside lawyers representing states cut the best deals possible in
striking settlements with tobacco companies. But he acknowledged
that some of the huge legal fees awarded in those cases had fueled
the larger controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, lawyers representing the first three states that
settled _ Florida, Mississippi and Texas _ were awarded $8.2
billion in fees. The staggering fees prompted public uproar,
particularly in Texas, where one lawyer, Mark D. Murr of Houston,
who appeared to play little role in the litigation, sought $260
million in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by a state investigation, Murr, whose request was
supported by the former Texas Attorney General who hired him,
backed down. But this year, Republican lawmakers with the backing
of business groups passed legislation requiring the state attorney
general to have contingency-fee contracts approved by a board
appointed by top state officials. Legal fees could not exceed
$4,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Utah legislators also passed a bill this year requiring that
state's attorney general to get approval from the governor before
filing a civil lawsuit. But after state Attorney General Jan Graham
threatened to challenge its constitutionality, she struck a deal
with lawmakers under which her office will keep the governor
appraised of any litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cities who are heading the legal assault against gun makers have
taken different stances on outside lawyers. While some like New
Orleans, Atlanta and Newark. N.J., have hired lawyers involved in
tobacco cases under contingency deals, others like Chicago are
using their own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, the Seattle plaintiff's lawyer, said those various
approaches have apparently created some conflicts. Recently, for
example, when lawyers representing several cities suing gun makers
and a few states considering such actions meet with manufacturers
cities who had hired outside lawyers were excluded from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with suing gun makers and paint producers, some of the
tobacco lawyers like Scruggs have also filed actions against health
maintenance organizations, claiming that they failed to provide
policyholders with promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And Coffee, the law professor, said he would not be surprised if
similar actions by public entities like cities soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over the horizon, the filings on behalf of state
plaintiffs tend to come after the lawsuits filed on behalf of
individuals,'' he said.

JONBENET RAMSEY'S PARENTS ARE STILL SUSPECTS, PROSECUTORS SAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Prosecutors who failed to win a grand jury
indictment on Wednesday in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey said
Thursday that the girl's parents are still suspects in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been eliminated from the investigation,''
Alexander M. Hunter, the Boulder City and County district attorney
said, referring to John and Patsy Ramsey, who found their
6-year-old daughter strangled and beaten in the basement of their
Boulder home almost three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter made his assertion during an afternoon news conference,
where he and fellow prosecutors stressed that efforts to learn who
killed JonBenet would now be returned to the Boulder Police
Department. The department's initial investigation, which drew
widespread criticism for actions in the hours after the girl's body
was discovered, ended on Sept. 13, 1998, when the grand jury began
hearing evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was dismissed on Wednesday after the prosecution
team determined that it did not have sufficient evidence to bring
the case to trial. Hunter described the grand jury as ``a phase of
a continuum'' in the investigation and said that with persuasive
new evidence, he would consider convening another panel.
</P>
<P>
   As Hunter announced he was turning over the case to the police,
Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said at a news conference in Denver
that he was appointing a team of seven legal experts, including the
state attorney general, Ken Salazar, to consider whether he should
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the case. That would
take the investigation out of the hands of the Boulder police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice demands that we evaluate every legal opinion that
might help us determine who killed JonBenet Ramsey,'' Owens said.
``This advisory team will help me decide if appointing a special
prosecutor will further the interests of justice in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisers are expected to conclude their work this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a seven-term Democrat, said he did not want to
``conclude their work this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a seven-term Democrat, said he did not want to ``second
guess'' Owens, a Republican elected last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything that might make it more difficult
for him to make an objective determination,'' Hunter said. ``We are
interested in the pursuit of the truth of this case. If he can
assist in that, I don't think any of us would stand in his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the prosecutors who joined him at the news conference,
Hunter looked somber. He described feeling an ``aching heart'' for
their inability to present enough evidence for an indictment and
their unanimous decision not to charge anyone in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he declined to answer many questions that would have shed
light on the status of the case, including details about the grand
jury's work over the last 13 months, the reason prosecutors did not
call the Ramseys to testify before the panel or any steps the
Boulder police probably will take in future efforts to identify a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he offer any opinion about the quality of work by the
Boulder police detectives, inasmuch as local investigators did not
secure the crime scene for many hours after Ramsey found the body
of his daughter in the basement of his house.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before reporters after Hunter, Chief Mark Beckner, of
the Boulder Police Department, mounted a strong defense of his
department and its work throughout the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been made out of alleged mistakes early in this
case,'' Beckner said. ``Yes, there are things we should have done
differently. Any time a crime scene is disturbed, it creates
problems for the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' he added, ``to say that mistakes have made this an
unsolvable case is not accurate. Circumstances and evidence that
raise questions for us today are not the result of a contaminated
crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   In promising that the authorities would press ahead with the
investigation, Hunter tried to build public confidence by reminding
reporters several times that prosecutors sometimes wait 10 years or
more to develop enough evidence for an indictment and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do believe we need to follow the evidence and go
where it takes us,'' he said, without elaborating. ``The evidence
in this case gives us a belief that it deserves our best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said investigators were working on ``a broad spectrum of
leads,'' including forensic evidence, Hunter and Beckner said,
which could lead them back to JonBenet's parents, who remain the
only suspects that Hunter and other prosecutors ever have
identified in the case. The Ramseys have steadfastly professed
their innocence and on Wednesday, after the grand jury was
dismissed, said: ``We take no satisfaction in this result because a
child killer remains free and undetected. Somebody out there ought
to be pretty scared tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys did not respond immediately Thursday to Hunter's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case, Beckner added, `'is not dead in the water.''

A MOST PERSONAL CRUSADE TO AID THE WORLD'S HUNGRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (Eds.-- 39 days in graph 4 is as of 10-15-99)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ His cheeks are sunken, his ankles swollen.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he started using a cane. By next week he expects to
need a walker, and a week later a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   David Duncombe is starving. Deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   The retired minister from White Salmon, Wash., has been fasting
for 39 days now in an effort to call attention to the starving
people of the world.
</P>
<P>
   In a city swarming with lobbyists and protesters of all sorts,
Duncombe is trying a personal approach. He is trying to persuade
members of Congress, one by one, to cancel the debt owed the United
States by about 40 impoverished countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them (lawmakers) to look at the face of starvation, to
hear my voice, to touch my hand,'' he says. ``I'm becoming one of
the starving millions of people in the world, one of the 10,000 a
day who could be saved by passage of this bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Sept. 7, Duncombe has consumed no food. A gallon of water
a day, potassium pills, and faith are keeping him alive. Each day,
by his own account, he stops by several dozen congressional
offices, trying to talk with staffers or, on rare occasions,
members of Congress, to make his pitch.
</P>
<P>
   His fast is a most personal expression of a worldwide religious
movement to make the year 2000 a year of Jubilee, a concept
described in the Bible according to which, every 50 years, all
debts should be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   The debts are large. During the 1970s and '80s, in part as a
byproduct of an energy crisis and the Cold War, numerous poor
countries accumulated an estimated $200 billion in debt to a
variety of wealthy countries and international organizations. About
$7 billion is owed to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Now, according to debt relief advocates, money that poor
countries could spend on food or medicine is instead going to debt
service.
</P>
<P>
   So a worldwide coalition of religious and political leaders is
pushing for debt forgiveness as a way to reduce world hunger and
poverty. There are a variety of proposals that differ in terms of
who gives the relief, who gets it, and under what condition, but
they share a common goal _ forgiving loans.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of Jubilee debt forgiveness has been endorsed by a
number of world religions and religious leaders, including Pope
John Paul II and the Revs. Billy Graham, Jesse Jackson and Pat
Robertson, as well as an eclectic collection of organizations and
individuals, including the rock stars Bono and Sting. Political
supporters of some form of debt relief include President Clinton
and the major industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, the 129 co-sponsors of the main debt relief bill
include Washington state Republican Jack Metcalf and Democrats
Brian Baird, Norm Dicks, Jim McDermott and Adam Smith; in the
Senate the 11 co-sponsors include Washington state Democrat Patty
Murray.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals face an uncertain future in a Congress generally
unenthusiastic about foreign aid, apprehensive about whether
impoverished countries would really use forgiven loan money to feed
the poor, and, at the moment, focused on the task of finishing up
work on budget bills and heading home for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe says he doesn't want to die, but he recognizes an irony
of his particular form of protest _ the more damage he does to
himself, the more effective he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I represent the actual starvation of millions of
people through my body, letting my body talk for me, the more
chance the spirit of the Lord has to act in these people to inform
their conscience and to give them another perspective,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His body temperature has dropped far enough that he must seek
out the sun for warmth, which he does at least twice a day, sitting
on the steps of the Capitol, hoping lawmakers will stop him to ask
about his cause.
</P>
<P>
   The wooden cross that hangs around his neck bounces freely in
the space created by his suddenly roomy sportcoat.
</P>
<P>
   His briefcase doubles as a seat cushion. Stuffed with a pillow,
it helps him endure the fact that his pelvic bones are now the most
pronounced feature of his backside.
</P>
<P>
   He has met mostly with congressional aides, and a handful of
their bosses. For more than a month he has been showing up every
Wednesday morning at a coffee held for constituents by Sen. Murray.
At first she didn't know what to make of this unusual participant
in a group dominated by tourists looking for a picture with a
senator and a ticket to see Congress in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was to dismiss him as somebody with a crazy
cause I didn't know too much about, but he kept coming, and I
started listening to him, and there was something in him that
struck me,'' Murray said. ``It struck me that someone would give up
so much of themselves to make a U.S. senator aware that other
people were suffering, and I was very struck when he said he came
back here to meet senators and representatives and I was the only
one he'd been able to meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his initial visit, Murray has been trying to help Duncombe
meet with other lawmakers, and has signed on as a co-sponsor to the
Senate debt relief bill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lawmakers Duncombe has seen is Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio,
who has gone on hunger strikes himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is making a tremendous commitment,'' Hall said. ``Apart
from the fact that it brings attention to the issue, it brings a
spiritual element to it, because you're doing it under God. It's
much more powerful than most people realize.''
</P>
<P>
   Interest groups pushing for debt relief welcome the help,
although they don't know what will happen this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a time when the U.S. Congress is debating what to do with a
multibillion dollar budget surplus, here's someone who is putting
his life on the line, saying that we can spare some pocket change
to help countries heavily burdened by debt,'' said David Bryden of
Jubilee 2000/USA, which is offering Duncombe a variety of
logistical support. ``When he shakes the hands of a legislator, the
legislator picks up on the fact that this man is starving. This is
a town where we all get wrapped up in policy debates, and here's a
guy who's making a simple moral appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe is clearly hampered by his informality. He hasn't met
with Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a fellow Dartmouth alum, in part
because he keeps showing up without an appointment. Other lawmakers
have met him only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that David's interest is in seeing that he makes a
statement to members of Congress and their staffs,'' said Barbara
Howell, director of government relations for Bread for the World, a
Christian lobbying group. ``As to its effectiveness, I don't know,
but he is absolutely a sincere person not wanting to make a
spectacle but to make as vivid as possible the suffering of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe is a native New Yorker and an Army veteran who has
spent much of his life in academia. He did his undergraduate work
at Dartmouth, was ordained by the United Church of Christ while
teaching prep school, got four graduate degrees from Yale and then
worked as a chaplain at Yale and at a health ministry associated
with the University of California at San Francisco before retiring
with his wife to White Salmon in 1993. There, he does plumbing work
for non-profit organizations, trying to help them save money.
</P>
<P>
   Duncombe has a long history of protest, and claims to have been
arrested more than 100 times. He joined Martin Luther King Jr.'s
voter registration drive in Selma, Ala. in 1965. He led a group of
picketers demanding a building permit for a women's shelter in the
tiny town of Bingen, Wash., in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Most famously, in 1987 he was one of three men who tried to
block a train they believed was carrying arms shipments destined
for Central America from the Concord Naval Weapons Station in
California. When it became apparent that the train was not going to
stop, Duncombe and another man leapt to safety; Brian Willson was
hit and lost both his legs.
</P>
<P>
   The Concord protest was the first time Duncombe had gone on an
extended fast _ he stopped eating for 40 days after Wilson got hit.
In 1991, after he was jailed in another protest, he again stopped
eating for 40 days.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he has fasted before makes this one easier to
handle. After seven days, he said, he stopped feeling much hunger.
He uses meditation to control any pain. He says he'll stop if he
gets some indication that Congress plans to pass debt relief, or if
he becomes so incapacitated that he's no longer effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not anxious to be a martyr,'' he said. ``I love my wife
and my kids, and I'm really happy. But I'm risking my health, and
even my life, in hopes that I can reduce the loss of life for
millions of people round the world. This is the way I can make my
life count.''

ONE RUNAWAY ... TO GO: PIZZA DELIVERY GAVE AWAY TEEN'S HIDEOUT 

</HEADLINE>

By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Pizza was Jose Gamez's downfall.
</P>
<P>
   For three months, the 14-year-old runaway had lived the high
life, ensconced in a vacant-but-furnished house just doors away
from his parents' own northwest Harris County home.
</P>
<P>
   While hundreds desperately searched the brushy banks of a bayou
near the family's home, the youth dined on venison steaks, drank
rum, trashed several rooms and _ some contend _ used binoculars to
monitor the excitement from a bedroom window.
</P>
<P>
   The deal began to unravel last Sunday when Gamez ordered out for
pizza. When the delivery van arrived at the supposedly empty house,
and a youth answered the door, suspicious neighbors called the law.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officers failed to catch the seventh-grader on their
initial visit. But they were called again Monday morning after
homeowner Wayne Heinke _ who lives in nearby Baytown but had come
to investigate the previous night's activity _ heard footsteps in
the attic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard him running across the attic,'' Heinke said Thursday
as he supervised efforts to salvage his wrecked property. ``The
(deputies) were yelling at him a lot to stand still. They found him
hiding under the insulation. When they handed him down, he was
handcuffed. He curled up into a fetal position and cried.''
</P>
<P>
   After being examined at a nearby hospital, the youth was turned
over to Harris County juvenile authorities. By Thursday, he had
been returned to his parents, Manuela Troncoso and Jose Luis Gamez,
and again was attending school.
</P>
<P>
   The young runaway's half-brother, Jose Mondragon, 23, said the
youth vanished July 9 as he was helping his mother clean the
garage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She left him in the garage, and when she returned an hour
later, he had just disappeared,'' Mondragon said. ``He was only
wearing shorts. Dressed like that, we knew he either was nearby or
had been abducted.''
</P>
<P>
   Within days, hundreds of searchers scoured the neighborhood. The
search included helicopters, police dogs and officers on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of fliers bearing the black-haired, dark-eyed youth's
photo and announcing a $4,000 reward for his location were
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   All the efforts came to naught.
</P>
<P>
   ``They even had a door-to-door search,'' said sheriff's
Detective Robert Tonry,an officer assigned to the case. ``They went
out knocking on doors, but of course, if there's no answer, they
wouldn't force their way inside.''
</P>
<P>
   The youth's parents were decimated by his disappearance, the
second time in recent years he had mysteriously left home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother prayed every night,'' Mondragon said. ``We had a
priest here to pray and talk with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time we caught him, the police told him not to run
away again or they'd have to take him to jail,'' Mondragon said.
``This time, Jose told me he had gotten angry and just left. By the
time he realized that he had wandered away, he turned back to our
house and saw all the police cars. He decided to just keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a lively member of the family circle, young Gamez was shy
around strangers, his brother said. Mondragon described the
5-foot-tall, 90-pound teen as a ``slow learner.'' Authorities
described him as possessing the mental faculties of a 9- or
10-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smart enough to break a window to get in,'' Heinke
complained. ``He was smart enough to cover the windows with
blankets. He was smart enough to order pizza. ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Heinke said the youth apparently paid for the pizza with money
from a large jug of change the owner kept in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rolled the change up with homemade paper rollers,'' Heinke
said. ``I found piles of pennies around the house.''
</P>
<P>
   During his three-month stay, Gamez apparently raided the
refrigerator and pantry. He even used the stove to cook a freezer
full of venison.
</P>
<P>
   ``He ate everything in the house,'' Heinke said. ``He used all
the paper plates, then started on the dishes. ... He even wore my
clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Although the house had electricity during the youth's stay, it had
no running water.
</P>
<P>
   Heinke found his house a virtual disaster area, with the kitchen
floors and counters buried in dirty dishes and partially eaten
food. Carpeting in every room was crusted with filth, including
feces, and the contents of drawers and closets were dumped on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   In one room, the youth apparently built a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they pulled him from the attic,'' Heinke said, ``he was
covered head to toe in soot. The fire had to have been fairly
recent.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heinke, whose primary residence is in nearby Baytown, often is
out of town on business and had not entered the house all summer.
``I'd go by occasionally to see that the yard was being kept up,
but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondragon said authorities have not yet told the family what
charges Gamez might face. Now that the youth has been returned to
his family, Mondragon said his wife, Nancy, will quit her job to
help keep an eye on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first reaction,'' Heinke said, ``was to wring his neck. But
when they dropped him out of that attic, I just couldn't help but
feel sorry for him. He was crying. He was scared.''

CHARLES KOLB: ONE-TIME BUSH AIDE EMERGES AS CAMPAIGN FINANCE
REFORMER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Va.)   (af)  
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charles Kolb may be this city's most unlikely
champion of campaign finance reform. A conservative lawyer who
worked on domestic policy in the Bush White House, Kolb
acknowledges that he never expected to be doing what he is doing
now.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the Committee for Economic Development, a group
of chief executives and academic leaders committed to public policy
changes, Kolb leads its fight against soft money, those unlimited
contributions to political parties that have come to exemplify the
capital's cash-flush influence industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally came at this with a deregulatory viewpoint,''
explained Kolb, who is 48. ``But the more I studied it, the more
concerned I became about the appearance of influence-peddling, the
quid pro quos. There should be access to politicians, but I don't
think you need to pay a toll to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused to catch his breath. ``I have become something of a
radical on this subject,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trim and energetic, Kolb may look like just one more
sharp-dressed politician or lobbyist _ until he opens his mouth. He
speaks in eloquent, perfectly formed paragraphs about the need to
change a federal election system that some analysts say may cost $3
billion in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   As the leader of a fiercely nonpartisan group, Kolb says the
organization does not reflect his biases. ``If it did, I wouldn't
be doing my job,'' he said. Still, his friends are not surprised
that, as a champion of noble causes, he has embraced its position
on campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving the Bush administration, where he was deputy
assistant to the president for domestic policy, Kolb wrote a book
whose title communicated its author's intense disappointment: ``The
White House Daze: The Unmaking of Domestic Policy in the Bush
Years'' (Free Press, 1993). The path that led Kolb to his current
post also wound through law and charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worried about answering the question, `What do you
want to do with your life?''' Kolb said. He has a one-word
explanation for his good fortune: serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives consider it serendipitous that Kolb took the
post at the Committee for Economic Development in September 1997.
He is its fourth president in 57 years, and his predecessor held
the job for 31 years. Several trustees credited Kolb with
invigorating the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is an independent research organization that
recommends economic and social policies. Its board includes
executives of General Motors, Xerox, Merck and Sara Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the organization's growing momentum, Kolb has
occasionally found it difficult to persuade executives to publicly
endorse a soft-money ban. They worry that their endorsement will
hurt their corporations on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Charlie talks with most CEOs, they are very sympathetic,
very supportive,'' said Michael J. Petro, the committee's director
of business and government policy. ``But then they say, `Let me put
you in touch with our Washington guys,''' who often try to kill the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb blamed what he calls the capital's cottage industry of
money and influence. ``The people who favor the status quo are the
people who hand out the checks and the people who cash the
checks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kolb always wanted to practice law. It was what other men in his
family had done. He went to Princeton, then to Balliol College at
Oxford University, where he received a master's degree in
philosophy, politics and economics.
</P>
<P>
   At Oxford, he met the academic who had the most influence on his
life, Sir Isaiah Berlin, the renowned historian who died in 1997 at
88. ``What he taught me is there is no excuse for arrogance,'' Kolb
said. He once invited Berlin to tea in Kolb's dormitory room. ``And
for four hours, the leading philosopher of this century sat on my
bed and sipped his tea and talked with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb earned a law degree at the University of Virginia, and
after practicing at two Washington law firms, joined the Office of
Management and Budget. He then moved to the Education Department,
where he met his wife, Ingrid. (They now have a 2-year-old
daughter, Charlotte.) In 1990, he joined the White House, working
on domestic economic, education, legal and regulatory issues. After
that, he spent five years as general counsel of the United Way.
</P>
<P>
   On his desk, Kolb displays evidence of his freedom from
partisanship: a canceled check for $250 that Kolb wrote on Nov. 1,
1996, to the re-election campaign of Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky.,
an ardent opponent of changes in the campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, McConnell took on Kolb's organization, writing a
blistering letter to as many as 20 executives who had endorsed a
soft-money ban. McConnell accused the group of trying to
``eviscerate private sector participation in politics'' by imposing
``anti-business speech controls.''
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of most letters, McConnell scribbled a message
that some executives regarded as a threat: ``I hope you will resign
from CED.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolb responded sharply. ``I think it was an abuse of senatorial
authority,'' he said. ``It did a lot to convey to the public what
this fight is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, McConnell's smash-mouth tactics backfired. Publicity
about the letter helped the organization recruit more executives,
doubling its ranks. Now, 212 executives have endorsed the
soft-money ban. And not one executive resigned.
</P>
<P>
   With a smile, Kolb said, ``It is far better to be attacked than
to be ignored.''

A MATERIAL GIRL'S SECRET WISH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)   (af)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After years of hard work and deep soul-searching, I
have finally embraced my inner princess. Oh, I guess I always knew
she was there, but I had never fully acknowledged her, thinking it
was wrong to crave the material.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, I have found myself lingering in department
stores and poring over furniture catalogs. I have begun to realize
that I like to consume. A lot.
</P>
<P>
   Under different circumstances, this wouldn't be a problem. The
trouble is that I, a freelance writer, have less money than the
court jester, so I've had to control my urges. For the most part,
I've been successful _ no $500 Anna Sui frocks, thank you _ but it
has taken every ounce of restraint not to throw caution to the wind
and pretend that my last name is Paltrow or Bezos.
</P>
<P>
   The hard truth is this: The princess is envious of people in her
age range who, by some stroke of luck, talent or, yes, hard work,
have acquired many more dollars than she has or probably ever will.
And of people who don't tug on both ends to make them meet. And of
people who can stumble into Bergdorf's, see something they like and
plunk down their credit cards without a second thought.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Hart, 30, who lives on the Upper East Side of Manhattan,
worked for five years at Intel and took advantage of its
stock-purchase plan. The stock split and split again. ``Now I have
on the order of a quarter of a million dollars,'' he said, ``and
I'm sort of loafing.''
</P>
<P>
   Hart is typical of many young people who have prospered mightily
in the last decade. Some work on Wall Street, some in Silicon
Valley, some in show business, Some have married into a wealthy
family; others were born to it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not complaining, just observing. I know I'm much better off
than many other people. I have great friends and family. I love my
work and my apartment. I have my health. All of these are
infinitely more important than a Central Park West address.
</P>
<P>
   I chose to live in Manhattan; I chose my occupation. In short, I
made my bed, so who am I to protest the peas?
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's nice to know I'm not the only person of my
generation who envies people in higher tax brackets. ``I have a lot
of friends who have a lot of money,'' said Nichole DiBenedetto, 26,
an account executive at Laura Davidson Public Relations in
Manhattan. ``It's frustrating to see people who don't have to go
out to earn a living, who don't have any responsibilities and can
do what they please.''
</P>
<P>
   For help, I called Jessie H. O'Neill, founder and director of
the Affluenza Project, a counseling and education group in
Milwaukee, and author of ``The Golden Ghetto: The Psychology of
Affluence'' (Hazelden, 1996). She helps people achieve healthy
relationships with their money, or lack thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. O'Neill knows about wealth: her grandfather was Charles E.
Wilson, former president of General Motors. She freely concedes
that she doesn't have to work, but says she has a message to
spread.
</P>
<P>
   Our entire culture, she posits, suffers from ``affluenza'' _
with symptoms including workaholism or addiction to the
accumulation of money, and an inability to delay gratification.
</P>
<P>
   She even has a checklist to measure the affliction. Do you work
late every night to achieve a standard of living that someone has
set for you? Is this level of material success what you really want
and need? Have you lost your family and friends trying to get
ahead? More important, have you lost yourself? If you answered yes
to any question, she said, you should examine your relationship to
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be an individual kind of turning within,
finding out what's enough to feel safe and secure,'' she said from
her horse farm in Milwaukee. ``Many people confuse security with a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Valid points, but how do you reconcile yourself to the fact that
no matter how hard you work you may never earn big bucks?
</P>
<P>
   ``Money can't buy happiness,'' Ms. O'Neill continued. ``It can
buy freedom from hunger or bills, yes, but freedom can be
overwhelming. Getting up and going to work builds strength,
confidence and character.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree 100 percent. Material possessions are ephemeral. Instant
gratification ends instantly. But the princess, alas, still wants
to shop. &QL;

PAYROLL TAX, TEMPTATION AND TROUBLE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Calif.)   (af)  
 By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It might be the most often-cut corner in starting up a business:
putting off remitting payroll taxes to the Internal Revenue
Service. You don't have to talk to many veteran company founders to
find one who has tried it _ and probably regrets it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entrepreneurs do a lot of things they have to do to keep
going,'' said Gregory Conigliaro, chief executive of Conigliaro
Industries in Framingham, Mass., which recycles paper, plastics,
metal and glass. ``If they didn't, there would be a lot fewer
companies around right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Conigliaro, who started his company in 1990 when he was 26, fell
behind on payroll taxes in 1992. Ultimately, after being notified
by the IRS, he ended up owing $14,000, ``half of which was interest
and penalties,'' he said. He said he paid that sum and has since
been current on all his taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There is much cash-flow pressure on owners of nascent
businesses, and the quandaries can be painful: Pay suppliers late
and they cut you off, pay the landlord late and risk eviction, pay
employees late and they walk out. It often comes down to who is the
least likely to squawk _ and the IRS, which generally doesn't know
what you owe until you report it, is often the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Months may go by before the tax authorities notice that they
haven't heard from you, and by then you'll find the cash to make up
the arrears _ or at least it's easy to tell yourself so. It's a
common self-deception.
</P>
<P>
   On a practical level, taking a government ``loan'' this way is
dicey. ``We try to counsel business owners that the government is
the worst place you can imagine to `borrow' money from,'' said
Richard M. Colombik, a lawyer with International Tax Associates in
Schaumburg, Ill. ``You're paying a very high rate _ interest plus a
penalty. And they're the only creditor in the world that can seize
your assets, garnish your bank account, and do it all without a
court order.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are bigger issues here. The choice not to forward to
the government taxes withheld from employee paychecks, even if the
alternatives appear worse, veers onto perilous ethical ground.
</P>
<P>
   Some people distinguish between taking what was never theirs and
being slow to relinquish what was once theirs but is no longer _
and somehow rate the latter as not quite as bad. That thinking
makes it easy to rationalize holding back the tax money a while.
</P>
<P>
   But it also shortens the leap to practices like diverting
employees' 401(k) contributions or failing to forward their health
insurance premiums, actions whose dire consequences fall on the
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a dangerous precedent, many business owners treat as
anathema even the thought of tax money as a source of emergency
cash. ``For me, it's the same as walking into a store and stealing
something,'' said Christi Christich, who in 1985 founded Cristek
Interconnects, a small company in Anaheim, Calif., that makes
electronic connectors. ``And I'd feel much worse about stealing
from my employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Facing tough decisions, including ethical ones, is part of the
territory for entrepreneurs, and it is only human nature for a
business owner to seek the solution of least resistance.
Temporarily diverting money withheld from employee paychecks can
seem a seductively harmless short-term solution.
</P>
<P>
   Though at best this taints the trust between employer and
employee, and at worst spares the company one peril by exposing it
to another, it can feel hard-hearted to condemn someone in a
scramble to keep a company afloat for yielding to the temptation.
Only when a revenue officer shows up demanding a reckoning does the
wrongness of the decision come into focus.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, the only solution is to pay up. ``You're
holding these funds for the government, but you didn't give it to
them, and the government does not take kindly to this,'' Colombik
said, adding that the IRS will aggressively pursue a business owner
even if the company folds.
</P>
<P>
   But the agency generally doesn't come after employees to make
good, he said, and rarely resorts to prosecution. ``Most of the
time, being a bad business person is not criminal,'' Colombik said.
``If it was, we'd have a lot more people in jail.''
</P>

PARTNERSHIP, FROM CRADLE TO CAMPUS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Vt., Mass., N.Y.)  (af)

<P>
   On college campuses, there are now ``nonsmoking'' dorms and
``quiet study'' dorms. But with fresh-faced undergraduates
increasingly armed with laptops, cell phones, Palm Pilots and _
most important _ ideas, it won't be long before there are
``entrepreneurs only'' halls, too.
</P>
<P>
   And with all the software and Internet companies being spawned
by intrepid undergrads, you may soon be reading of sizable alumni
contributions from chief executives with the ink barely dry on
their diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Nobel and Adam Menzel, 20-year-old college juniors who go
back even further than Bill Gates and Paul Allen, are among the new
entrepreneurs. They have built a financial Web site called
Javaticker.com, which they run from their respective campuses,
Middlebury College, in Vermont, and Brandeis University, outside
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges may be the perfect hothouses for seeding start-ups,
said Lester C. Thurow, the MIT economist and most recently the
author of ``Building Wealth'' (HarperCollins). ``Many schools are
wired with fiber optics, broadband communications systems and
provide access to instant downloading,'' he said in an interview.
``You can do things from your dorm room that you won't be able to
do from your home for another 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobel and Menzel met when they were barely out of the cradle. At
18 months, they toddled over to each other at a ``Mommies and Me''
play group in Port Washington, N.Y., and began networking.
</P>
<P>
   It was the start of an extraordinary partnership. While
Javaticker.com may be their most ambitious venture to date, it's
hardly their first. As 12-year-olds, they hawked pears by the
roadside. (Adam's family had a pear tree.)
</P>
<P>
   Pears soon gave way to more practical products. On one wintry
day, Ben's father was unable to unlock his car. All the local
stores but one were sold out of de-icer. The boys bought the entire
inventory, hurried to the train station and sold the canisters for
double what they had just paid. Alas, they just ``broke even,''
Menzel recalled, still with a twinge of regret. ``We overstocked
and we got frostbite.''
</P>
<P>
   In high school, the boys had bigger brainstorms. As comic book
connoisseurs, they combed trade shows for comics that they could
resell to a local dealer. And when they built shelves for their
collections, they reasoned that everyone would want similar
cabinetry. Off they went to the lumberyard, but the idea, as Nobel
put it, ``failed to get the national recognition we'd hoped for.''
</P>
<P>
   But recognition is finally knocking on their dorm-room doors.
Two summers ago, Nobel, a computer science major, and Menzel, who
is studying economics, were watching the financial news while
riding side-by-side exercise bicycles at a local gym (apparently
the '90s version of the garage). Their conversation turned to the
user-unfriendliness of financial Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The next day they pitched their idea _ for a free,
well-organized financial site _ to Greg Leib, a former Bear Stearns
broker and now an Internet entrepreneur, who was a member of
Nobel's local Unitarian Church. Leib signed on as sole investor,
taking the chief executive's title.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months later, after many all-nighters, no salaries and
``tons of Chinese food,'' they have a solid financial site that
offers updated headlines, scrolling stock tickers (which can be
customized by the user) research, message boards, charts and
weather, all in a colorful, easy-to-use format.
</P>
<P>
   Though the goal is to have advertising cover costs, the site has
yet to break even. Menzel estimates that it has eaten $200,000 of
Leib's money so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much at all for an Internet company,'' Menzel said. And if
the company has a future, each student has an 8 percent stake, with
Leib holding the rest.
</P>
<P>
   What is it like to be a chief technology officer while still in
college? ``I have to remember to turn off my cell phone in class,''
Nobel said. ``My professors would probably throw me out if it went
off.''
</P>
<P>
   Menzel, the chief operating officer, said he was lucky to have a
girlfriend who understands his four-hour Friday night
disappearances to attend to server problems or respond to user
e-mail. His parents have been supportive, too. (And why not? They
have a lifetime supply of lock de-icer in their basement.)
</P>
<P>
   Friends on campus ask to work for them, as do some outsiders.
``Yesterday this guy from Microsoft asked me for a job,'' Nobel
recounted, still reeling. He said our site ``sounded like a more
fun place to work.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet a growing user base _ the site has an average of 12,000
hits a day _ three employees have been added. The three, also
college students, grew up with the founders.
</P>
<P>
   Future plans include, well, graduation. Then the dot.comsters
may move the business to Vermont _ and perhaps eventually to Wall
Street, in the form of a stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   The management at Sun Microsystems, owner of the Java trademark,
doesn't seem to mind that these cheeky upstarts are using the name.
In fact, the company has invited the founders to display their
stock in trade _ or trade in stock, as the case may be _ at the big
Sun trade show in New York next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd love to go but, well, it's finals week,'' Nobel said with
a sigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, finals,'' Menzel added, regretfully. &QL;

IN A VERDICT ON AUTO PARTS, THE CONSUMER MAY LOSE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mich.)  (af) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that a court in Marion, Ill., has imposed a
record $1.2 billion judgment against State Farm for ordering some
collision damage to be repaired with generic car parts, three
groups that consumers rank with the proverbial used-car salesman _
insurers, auto body shops and trial lawyers _ are arguing over what
it means.
</P>
<P>
   Its ultimate effect may be rising insurance rates, not a triumph
for consumers. State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, and
some other insurers say that if they have to stop buying generic
sheet-metal parts _ generally knock-offs from Taiwan _ and rely
only on the auto makers, policyholders could pay additional
billions of dollars (although State Farm says it can cover the
direct costs of the verdict without raising rates).
</P>
<P>
   It is not only that Ford charges $400 for the hood on a 1995
Taurus while the generic part costs $202, or that Pontiac wants
$216 for the fender on a 1995 Grand Am that a Taiwanese
manufacturer will sell for $59. If the generic parts disappear,
insurers say, the car makers will have a monopoly, abandoning all
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry's poster car is the 1997 Taurus GL, which
sold for $19,000 new, but would cost $72,000 if assembled from
spare Ford parts today, a trade group estimated. And that is with
the restraining influence of competition from generic parts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who brought the suit against State Farm dismiss the
insurers' arguments and say the decision will give policyholders
what they were promised in their policies: replacement parts of
``like kind and quality.'' Nobody can make a bumper or a headlight
assembly for a Toyota that is as good as Toyota's, and sell it for
less than Toyota does, the lawyers contend, pointing to economies
of scale and competitors' need to reverse-engineer. Imitation parts
cannot ``transcend their destiny,'' one lawyer said, and become
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The auto body shops say that not having to deal with generic
parts means that their work will go faster and easier, leaving
fewer grounds for consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But the shops, the insurers say, have a history of billing for
genuine parts, installing the generic ones and pocketing the
difference _ sometimes to satisfy customers who want the shop to
absorb the deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over repair parts applies only to sheet metal, since
other parts are not generally seen as threats to automotive purity.
``There is a whole world of after- market parts that people are
very accustomed to using,'' said Michael J. Donoghue, vice
president of claims at Allstate, the second-largest auto insurer.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Midas mufflers, Monroe shock absorbers and NAPA parts.
``People don't seem to question those things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers, however, have learned that they can end up with
poor repairs no matter the source of the parts. Good body work,
like good house painting, can require an assertive consumer,
willing to reject shoddy jobs. In auto body repairs, the paint, the
most visible part of the project, is applied by the body shop,
regardless of where the parts are made.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over collision damage probably go back to the creation
of the second car, providing a target for the first one to collide
with. After an accident, many people feel dissatisfied with their
insurance companies. In their defense, the insurers point out that
drivers deal with them mostly during times of trauma, hardly the
best circumstances for getting to like someone with power over you.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate stakes in the current dispute are highest for the
State Farm customers who filed 4.7 million accident claims in the
last 12 years, and whose cars were repaired with generic parts.
Those customers are in line for payments averaging $250, unless an
appeals court intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm says that if its appeal fails and it must pay the
$1.2 billion, the verdict will cost customers nothing. The lawyers
who brought the class-action suit earnestly agree and say the
decision is not anti-consumer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how the verdict will make any of the parties
happier. The sum is huge by historical standards but perhaps not
for State Farm, which has $16 billion salted away for catastrophes.
Spread among the 37 million policies issued by the company, the
cost of the judgment comes to about $32 a car.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an economic sense, it is a transfer between overlapping
groups of policyholders: those who have had a collision claim or
two among the 4.7 million, and those who have not.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. ``Your check will be, maybe, for $1, and
you will end up paying higher premiums,'' predicted Robert J.
Hurns, an auto insurance specialist with the National Association
of Independent Insurers, which represents 620 companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, pointed
out that a State Farm actuary had testified that a judgment would
not affect rates. As a nonrecurring expense, the company said, the
bill cannot be built into premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the verdict's impact on future rates, the cost of auto
insurance has been declining recently. State Farm says it has
returned more than $1.5 billion, including dividends, to
policyholders in the last two years, in part because claims have
been lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Use of after-market parts was another reason, the company says,
saving policyholders $234 million in 1997 alone. (But in an
internal document entered as evidence in the case, executives
worried that the high cost of generic-parts was eating that up.
</P>
<P>
   Across the industry, auto insurance prices are declining by a
projected 4.5 percent this year, according to the Insurance
Information Institute, primarily because of a declining accident
rate and safer cars. In addition, new car prices, drunken driving
and car theft are all down. And the insurers, which invest their
customers' premiums, are making money in the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   But to borrow a phrase about gasoline mileage, when it comes to
your own rates, your actual results may vary. Because the car
population is rising far faster than the number of households, and
because many of those households have been buying expensive sport
utility vehicles, many families are paying more for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance premiums include costs for theft, liability and
injury; collision damage and related costs are about 38 percent of
the total. But that cost is rising relatively rapidly, more than 3
percent last year, about half again as fast as the Consumer Price
Index, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm, for now, has given up generic parts. Some companies,
like Chubb, are crowing that they never used them. Chubb also
boasts that it puts no ceiling on the rate it will pay for body
shop labor. It is not insurance for people who want to minimize
transportation costs; most of its customers have cars that are
three years old or less.
</P>
<P>
   But Allstate uses after-market body parts in about 20 percent of
its repairs. As an incentive, it guarantees those parts, but not
auto company parts, for as long as the customer owns the car. Only
a few car owners refuse the after-market parts, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate says it sets standards. ``As a general rule, we won't
use after-market parts on a new car,'' Donoghue said, adding that
exactly when they should be used was up to the adjuster.

GORE TAKING TO THE AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Outraged at the Senate for voting down a
treaty banning nuclear-weapons testing worldwide, Vice President Al
Gore takes to the airwaves Saturday to declare ``there's no more
important challenge than stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second television ad, said to have been written by Gore
himself, will air on WMUR in New Hampshire, as well as in Iowa, and
nationally on CNN. Next week, biographical ads about the vice
president are also expected to go on television in Iowa and New
Hampshire, two crucial, early states in the race for the Democratic
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   For the test-ban ad, Gore talks about President Kennedy's making
nuclear arms control a national priority, and President Bush's halt
of all US testing of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote goes against the tide of history and the advice of
former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Clinton,
Bush, Reagan, and Carter administrations,'' Gore says in the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in my heart this vote does not speak for the
American people,'' he says. ``So why don't we do something about
it?''
</P>
<P>
   If elected president, Gore says he wants to go into office with
a mandate from the voters to send the treaty back to the Senate to
be ratified.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you agree, we can change this mistake and once again lead
the world toward peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore taped the spot early Thursday in Seattle, where he had
spent the day campaigning before aerospace union workers. The
Senate voted 51-48 on Wednesday against approving the treaty.
Sixty-seven votes were needed for ratification. Only four
Republicans voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Republican Steve Forbes, Gore is the only
presidential candidate so far to hit the airwaves in New Hampshire.
Forbes is airing a biographical ad featuring his wife and five
daughters, and another ad covering Social Security, health care,
and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   To the Bradley campaign, the advertising is a sign that Gore
won't be easily handed the Democratic nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a recognition on the Gore campaign's part that
this has become a very competitive race with Bill Bradley here in
New Hampshire and throughout the country,'' said Mark Longabaugh,
Bradley's New Hampshire director. ``They went for a long time where
they tried to ignore us and now they realize the race is engaged
and it's a very competitive situation and they have to get on
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Longabaugh would not say when Bradley will begin airing his
television ads, but said the senator has the money to run a
competitive ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For Gore, the nuclear arms control issue is one in which he has
been involved for the past two decades, in both the House and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, Gore put forth a comprehensive arms control
proposal 1980s and he co-chaired the US-Russia bilateral
commission, which oversaw a program to deactivate 2,500 Russian
nuclear missiles pointed at the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``He feels very strongly about it,'' said Chris Lehane, his
spokesman. ``He thought that the United States Senate made a huge
mistake.''

CLINTON ASSAILS GOP ON TEST-BAN STANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stung by the Senate's defeat of a treaty banning
nuclear underground testing, a visibly angry President Clinton
Thursday accused Republicans of ``reckless partisanship'' and of
embracing a ``new isolationism'' that threatens America's national
and economic security.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton linked the Republican majority's refusal to delay a vote
on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the budget battle brewing
on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers have been unable to agree on a
federal budget with only a week to go before a stopgap spending
measure, which is financing much of the government, expires.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legitimate differences of opinion, but we can put an
end to reckless partisanship, to gimmicks and gamesmanship,''
Clinton said at a White House news conference. ``We can put people
first and make a principled, honorable compromise. We can work for
a season of progress, not a winter of politics. And I am committed
to do just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's hour-long meeting with reporters was dominated by
questions about the treaty vote, although he was also asked about
the contest for the Democratic presidential nomination and his
reaction to a federal judge's decision that he lied under oath in
Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit, which triggered the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am out of office, I will have a lot to say about
this,'' Clinton said about the judge's decision. He also said he
thought Vice President Al Gore would win the Democratic nomination
over former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, whom he refused to
criticize.
</P>
<P>
   But the president was animated and verbose, often gesturing with
his hands, when discussing the test ban vote. He said he did not
think Senate Republicans were reacting out of dislike for him by
voting down the treaty. ``The idea that, you know, we would put the
future of our children in peril and the leadership of America for a
safer world in peril for some personal pique I think is
unthinkable,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Senate majority leader Trent Lott, shortly after Clinton spoke,
said the Senate's action ``was not a vote involving personalities.
It was not about politics; it was about the substance of the
treaty, and that's all it was.'' He added, ``This was a flawed
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Clinton seized the chance to make political hay, saying
he now believes it will become a campaign issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday voted 51-48, far short of the required
67 votes needed to ratify the treaty. Only four Republicans voted
for it. Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush opposes
the treaty, as do other GOP presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Although the treaty was signed by 154 nations, including the
United States, it has been ratified by only 26 of the 44
nuclear-capable states that must approve it to put it into force.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee chairman Jim Nicholson called it
an insult for Clinton to accuse Republican senators of a ``new
isolationism.'' ``The president can't excuse his own failure to
negotiate an enforceable, verifiable treaty _ or to make the case
for ratification,'' Nicholson said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference, Clinton said Republicans had offered no
alternatives to the ban, brushed aside public sentiment in support
of it and ``betrayed the vision'' of President Dwight D.
Eisenhower, who first proposed it in 1958 and other presidents who
have endorsed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even more troubling are the signs of a new isolationism among
some of the opponents of the treaty,'' Clinton said. ``You see it
in the refusal to pay our UN dues. You see it in the woefully
inadequate budget for foreign affairs that includes meeting our
obligations to the Middle East peace process, and to the continuing
efforts to destroy and safeguard Russian nuclear materials. You see
it in the refusal to adopt our proposals to do our part to stem the
tide of global warming, even though these proposals plainly would
create American jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratcheting up the rhetoric, Clinton said, ``By this vote, the
Senate majority has turned its back on 50 years of American
leadership against the spread of weapons of mass destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he will proceed according to the terms of the
treaty despite the Senate action. He noted that the treaty could be
brought up again, and vowed to ``not let yesterday's partisanship
stand as the final word.''
</P>
<P>
   That partisanship, Clinton said, also threatens America's
economic security. He said when he signed the stopgap spending
measure two weeks ago to keep the government running, ``I said they
should stop playing politics, stop playing games, start making the
necessary touch choices. Instead, we have the Republicans lurching
from one workable idea to the next.''

DISPUTED STUDY SUGGESTS POSSIBLE HARM FROM GENETICALLY ALTERED
FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A prestigious medical journal is publishing a study suggesting
that genetically modified food may be harmful, even though the
research has been widely criticized by scientists and was found
wanting by some of the journal's own referees.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancet, a journal based in England, said it had decided to
publish the study in part to spur debate and to avoid being accused
of suppressing information on a controversial subject.
</P>
<P>
   The data ``are preliminary and nongeneralisable, but at least
they are now out in the open for debate,'' Dr. Richard Horton, the
journal's editor, wrote in an editorial accompanying the study,
which will appear on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the paper in a peer-reviewed journal is likely to
further fan fears about genetically engineered crops in Europe,
where consumers and supermarkets are widely rejecting what
opponents have called Frankenfoods.
</P>
<P>
   The study is also likely to be seized upon by opponents of such
food in the United States, where consumers have until recently
expressed little concern about the genetically altered corn and
soybeans that have swept quietly into their diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it gives it a certain scientific credibility,'' said
Charles Margulis of the Washington office of Greenpeace. ``It's
going to increase concern here in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to publish the study is itself generating
debate: Some scientists say The Lancet has lowered its standards
and subverted the peer review process.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would never have been published in a plant biology
journal,'' said Dr. Maarten J. Chrispeels, professor of biology at
the University of California at San Diego and editor of the journal
Plant Physiology. He said the experiment was too poorly planned to
support the paper's conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview from London, Horton said, ``In answer to the
question, `Have you lowered your scientific standard?', the answer
is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five scientific experts who reviewed the paper
supported its publication on technical merit, he said, albeit after
numerous revisions. One reviewer opposed publication and the fifth
thought the study was flawed but should be published nonetheless in
the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   The paper reports that rats fed genetically modified potatoes
experienced a thickening of their stomach walls and other changes
in their intestines. The medical significance of this was not
stated, but such a thickening suggests a reaction to some toxin or
irritant.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes contained an implanted gene from the snowdrop plant
that caused the potatoes to produce a lectin, a type of chemical
found in nearly all plants that helps them fend off insects. Rats
in the control groups were fed either ordinary potatoes or potatoes
spiked with lectin.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes in the stomachs of the rats fed either the
genetically altered potatoes or the ones spiked with lectin seemed
to come from the presence of the chemical, which some scientists
said was not particularly surprising, because many lectins are
toxic.
</P>
<P>
   But other changes, specifically a thickening in the jejunum
section of the small intestine, occurred only in rats fed the
genetically altered potatoes, not the lectin-spiked or nonmodified
potatoes. That, the authors said, suggested that the changes could
have been caused by the genetic engineering itself, an assertion
that raises much broader concerns about so-called biotech foods.
</P>
<P>
   The study was part of broader research done by Dr. Arpad
Pusztai, a scientist formerly at the Rowett Research Institute in
Scotland. Last year, Pusztai ignited a furor in Europe when he said
on a television show that rats fed the transgenic potatoes had
experienced stunted organ growth and immune system problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Rowett Institute did not renew Pusztai's employment contract
and concluded in a review that his data did not support his
conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Society, Britain's senior scientific academy, reviewed
Pusztai's work and earlier this year declared it too flawed to draw
any conclusions about the effects of the transgenic potatoes, in
part because the experiments had lacked proper controls. The Royal
Society issued a statement Thursday reiterating that conclusion and
criticizing The Lancet for lending ``some authenticity'' to the
study.
</P>
<P>
   In his commentary, Horton said publication was not meant to be a
``vindication'' of Pusztai and his co-author of the paper, Dr.
Stanley W.B. Ewen, a pathologist at the University of Aberdeen in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The Lancet also published a sharp critique of the paper by
scientists at the National Institute for Quality Control of
Agricultural Products, which is based in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   The critique criticized the study for not, for example,
accounting for big differences between the genetically modified and
ordinary potatoes that were not associated with genetic
engineering. They also said the study did not find consistent
effects.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Pusztai could not be located and did not respond to an e-mail
request seeking comment. Ewen declined to be interviewed, but said
in a statement: ``We are convinced that further experimental work
is required to test the safety of GM foods.'' GM is a commonly used
term meaning genetically modified.
</P>
<P>
   In another article on lectin in the same issue of The Lancet,
researchers suggest that more studies must be done on the safety of
lectin before its genes are used to make crops insect resistant.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by scientists at the Scottish Crop Research Institute
and the University of Dundee, found that snowdrop lectin can bind
to human white blood cells in a test tube. The authors said the
results defied the conventional view that the snowdrop lectin would
not affect humans.
</P>
<P>
   Editors of peer-reviewed journals say it is not unusual to
publish papers opposed by a minority of the reviewers. But some
questioned whether it was proper to publish any article found
scientifically lacking merely to present data to the public,
especially when scientists can now publicize their own results on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it tarnishes the reputation of the journal that
publishes it,'' said Floyd E. Bloom, editor of Science. ``If you're
just going to take it because it's controversial, well, there are a
whole lot of controversial things.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the journal Nature published a seemingly implausible
article saying that antibodies were effective even when diluted to
the point where there were no molecules left, perhaps because the
water retained some ``memory'' of the antibodies.
</P>
<P>
   Nature published an editorial in the same issue warning readers
to beware and said one reason it published the study was to avoid
charges of suppressing an important discovery. A few weeks later,
an investigative team sent by Nature to the laboratory involved
debunked the study.

A DOWNSIZED LUNCH UNSETTLES A MEXICAN RITE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   (Eds: The name Ffrench in story is correct)  
(af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Around 4 p.m. these days, an odd calm falls over
the tables at Prendes restaurant, which for more than a century has
been a prime luncheon spot for mighty decision makers in Mexico's
government.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as March, this restaurant would have been clamorous
at that hour, filled with politicians, bureaucrats and business
people celebrating one of the great rituals of life in the Mexican
capital: the three-hour lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila shot glasses would have been intermingled with plates of
sea bass, Veracruz style, and chili-laced stews. Near the end of
their feast, some diners would have been savoring cigars.
</P>
<P>
   But then, in April, the federal government put new regulations
into effect that brought a cultural revolution to Mexico City. Most
public employees, from lowly clerks to lofty cabinet ministers, are
now supposed to start work at 9 a.m. and leave at 6 p.m. They have
one hour _ just one _ for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   With the state playing so large a role in the economy here,
private businesses in the capital have been more or less obliged to
follow suit, also curtailing long lunches and late evenings in the
office.
</P>
<P>
   The midafternoon quiet at Prendes and other downtown luncheon
shrines is a sign that the new schedule really is taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government people don't come here to do business anymore,''
said Carlos Velazquez, the head waiter at Prendes, surveying the
vacant floor before him. ``They have a little soup, their main
dish, and adios! They're back to work. Not so much as a beer with
lunch!''
</P>
<P>
   The new schedule has changed Mexico City's workday. Previously,
lunch was the centerpiece, the forum where political relations were
nurtured and major conclusions reached. The busiest part of the day
came after 6 p.m., when top officials returned from the big meal.
Final details of the day's deals were generally nailed down just
before the close of business, around 10.
</P>
<P>
   The revised schedule was imposed by President Ernesto Zedillo as
part of the austerity measures that have had an impact across his
government. The ministries enforce the schedule by turning off
lights and air-conditioning at 6 p.m. sharp. And to make the rules
stick, senior administrative officials in some ministries have
taken personal charge: Under secretaries patrol hallways after
lights-out to make sure offices are empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to leave at 8 p.m. with a guilty feeling,'' said Marco
Provencio, the spokesman for the Finance Ministry. ``Now I can feel
proud of myself when I leave that late, and I know that no one will
be talking about me behind my back.''
</P>
<P>
   Provencio even ventured a theory _ that improved efficiency
under the new order is contributing to the overall health of the
economy. ``Is it just a coincidence?'' he wondered aloud. ``Since
April, all the indicators have been improving: the exchange rate,
inflation ....''
</P>
<P>
   One side effect is that throughout the government, people are
finding that much work now gets done before noon _ rarely the case
before the new schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are much more productive in the morning,'' said
Juan de Villafranca, the top official for administration at the
Foreign Ministry. ``They are motivated because they want to get
everything done before 6 p.m. so they can go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions tend to be made in the afternoon instead of the
evening, now that people are no longer slowed by the grogginess
that followed the banquet that used to be lunch. Even the nature of
decision-making has changed: More agreements are now struck by
telephone or e-mail, and officials are getting used to dispensing
with the abrazo, or bear hug, that ritually sealed a political
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge city like this one has forced us to settle for less
face-to-face communication,'' said Antonio Ocaranza, head of the
Mexico City offices of Public Strategies Inc., a consulting firm
based in Austin, Texas. Before switching to the private sector a
year ago, Ocaranza worked marathon hours as a press officer for
Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes in communications have allowed people to be
selective and say, this is not something I absolutely have to
discuss personally,'' Ocaranza said.
</P>
<P>
   In changing its workday, Mexico City is catching up with
Monterrey, the northern city that rivals the capital as the
country's financial and industrial center. For years, Monterrey
business people have taken a more efficiency-minded approach to the
workday, lunch included.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mexican political folklore, part of the logic of
the long lunch was to give politicians _ almost invariably men _
time to visit their mistresses in the middle of the day. But a
series of jarring economic crises, and the frugal federal budgets
enacted to cope with them, have reduced the purchasing power of
public employees' pay and placed an extramarital affair beyond the
means of most officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I wanted to take a lover, I would have to have a much
higher salary than I do now,'' sighed one mid-level married
official, who, not surprisingly, spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Mexicans in government have begun to enjoy
the experience of a new-found after-hours private life. Attendance
at 8 p.m. movies is climbing, and government employees are signing
up for language and computer courses.
</P>
<P>
   But business people who deal regularly with the government say
that more fundamental change is coming slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still far away from the Swiss bureaucracy,'' said
Damian Fraser, an analyst here for Warburg Dillon Read. ``They've
changed the reason you can't get hold of them. Now they say they
are in a meeting. They can't say they are out at lunch.''
</P>
<P>
   Many officials acknowledge that the hardest part of the new
routine is the short lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Leonardo Ffrench, a top official in the Foreign Ministry, who
said he felt that the old way was more in tune with a Mexican's
natural rhythms. ``I like to have my main meal as God willed it,''
Ffrench said. ``But we understand that we have to become a lot more
rational and pragmatic. It's a sign of the times we are living
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sign is the crowded 2 p.m. scene in the Foreign
Ministry's cafeteria. Previously, its buffet was shunned in favor
of more relaxing corner bars nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Many doubts remain about the new schedule's survival after
Zedillo leaves office in December 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wait,'' said Velazquez, the waiter at Prendes. ``Eighteen
months from now it will all be back to the way it was before.''

   GM REPORTS TURNAROUND ON EARNINGS FOR 3RD QUARTER
</P>
<P>
   Demand for pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and minivans
helped General Motors earn $877 million in the third quarter, a
significant turnaround from a strike-related $309 million loss in
the quarter a year earlier. Excluding the effect of the strike,
GM's net income rose 34 percent, to $1.33 a share, beating
forecasts of $1.24 a share. Analysts said GM had earned high
profits because buyers were snapping up record numbers of new
models from all auto makers.
</P>
<P>
   TYCO STOCK FALLS DESPITE DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Investors brushed aside Tyco International's aggressive defense
of its accounting practices, pushing its stock down $10 more, to
$87, amid fears about the company's three-year acquisition spree.
The selloff has dropped shares of Tyco, one of the highfliers of
the bull market, by 18 percent since the start of the week, when an
investment manager wrote a detailed critique of the company.
</P>
<P>
   STOCKS END SLIDE BUT GAIN LITTLE
</P>
<P>
   Stocks halted their sharp, two-day decline. The Dow Jones
industrial average gained 54.45 points, to 10,286.61. The Nasdaq
composite index rose 5.57 points, to 2,806.84, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.13 points, to 1,283.42.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.32 percent from 6.27
percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   UNISYS MISSES REVENUE FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Unisys fell $15.6875, or 37 percent, to $26.5625 after
the technology company said revenue in the third quarter increased
by 4 percent, below investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   EARNINGS INCREASE 37 PERCENT AT BOEING
</P>
<P>
   Continuing its financial rebound, Boeing said its third-quarter
profit grew 37 percent as its formerly ailing passenger jet
business improved its efficiency. The results beat Wall Street
estimates for the third consecutive quarter. Philip M. Condit, the
chief executive of Boeing, said that he was not worried by recent
gains by Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, which has
received orders for 329 jets this year, compared with 138 for
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE BANKS PLAN MERGER
</P>

<P>
   SEPTEMBER RETAIL SALES ROSE 0.1 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales rose one-tenth of a percent in September as

 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that a court in Marion, Ill., has imposed a
record $1.2 billion judgment against State Farm for ordering some
collision damage to be repaired with generic car parts, three
groups that consumers rank with the proverbial used-car salesman _
insurers, auto body shops and trial lawyers _ are arguing over what
it means.
</P>
<P>
   Its ultimate effect may be rising insurance rates, not a triumph
for consumers. State Farm, the nation's largest auto insurer, and
some other insurers say that if they have to stop buying generic
sheet-metal parts _ generally knock-offs from Taiwan _ and rely
only on the auto makers, policyholders could pay additional
billions of dollars (although State Farm says it can cover the
direct costs of the verdict without raising rates).
</P>
<P>
   It is not only that Ford charges $400 for the hood on a 1995
Taurus while the generic part costs $202, or that Pontiac wants
$216 for the fender on a 1995 Grand Am that a Taiwanese
manufacturer will sell for $59. If the generic parts disappear,
insurers say, the car makers will have a monopoly, abandoning all
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry's poster car is the 1997 Taurus GL, which
sold for $19,000 new, but would cost $72,000 if assembled from
spare Ford parts today, a trade group estimated. And that is with
the restraining influence of competition from generic parts.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who brought the suit against State Farm dismiss the
insurers' arguments and say the decision will give policyholders
what they were promised in their policies: replacement parts of
``like kind and quality.'' Nobody can make a bumper or a headlight
assembly for a Toyota that is as good as Toyota's, and sell it for
less than Toyota does, the lawyers contend, pointing to economies
of scale and competitors' need to reverse-engineer. Imitation parts
cannot ``transcend their destiny,'' one lawyer said, and become
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   The auto body shops say that not having to deal with generic
parts means that their work will go faster and easier, leaving
fewer grounds for consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   But the shops, the insurers say, have a history of billing for
genuine parts, installing the generic ones and pocketing the
difference _ sometimes to satisfy customers who want the shop to
absorb the deductible.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute over repair parts applies only to sheet metal, since
other parts are not generally seen as threats to automotive purity.
``There is a whole world of after- market parts that people are
very accustomed to using,'' said Michael J. Donoghue, vice
president of claims at Allstate, the second-largest auto insurer.
</P>
<P>
   He cited Midas mufflers, Monroe shock absorbers and NAPA parts.
``People don't seem to question those things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers, however, have learned that they can end up with
poor repairs no matter the source of the parts. Good body work,
like good house painting, can require an assertive consumer,
willing to reject shoddy jobs. In auto body repairs, the paint, the
most visible part of the project, is applied by the body shop,
regardless of where the parts are made.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over collision damage probably go back to the creation
of the second car, providing a target for the first one to collide
with. After an accident, many people feel dissatisfied with their
insurance companies. In their defense, the insurers point out that
drivers deal with them mostly during times of trauma, hardly the
best circumstances for getting to like someone with power over you.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate stakes in the current dispute are highest for the
State Farm customers who filed 4.7 million accident claims in the
last 12 years, and whose cars were repaired with generic parts.
Those customers are in line for payments averaging $250, unless an
appeals court intervenes.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm says that if its appeal fails and it must pay the
$1.2 billion, the verdict will cost customers nothing. The lawyers
who brought the class-action suit earnestly agree and say the
decision is not anti-consumer.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how the verdict will make any of the parties
happier. The sum is huge by historical standards but perhaps not
for State Farm, which has $16 billion salted away for catastrophes.
Spread among the 37 million policies issued by the company, the
cost of the judgment comes to about $32 a car.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In an economic sense, it is a transfer between overlapping
groups of policyholders: those who have had a collision claim or
two among the 4.7 million, and those who have not.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. ``Your check will be, maybe, for $1, and
you will end up paying higher premiums,'' predicted Robert J.
Hurns, an auto insurance specialist with the National Association
of Independent Insurers, which represents 620 companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Elizabeth J. Cabraser, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, pointed
out that a State Farm actuary had testified that a judgment would
not affect rates. As a nonrecurring expense, the company said, the
bill cannot be built into premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the verdict's impact on future rates, the cost of auto
insurance has been declining recently. State Farm says it has
returned more than $1.5 billion, including dividends, to
policyholders in the last two years, in part because claims have
been lower than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Use of after-market parts was another reason, the company says,
saving policyholders $234 million in 1997 alone. (But in an
internal document entered as evidence in the case, executives
worried that the high cost of generic-parts was eating that up.
</P>
<P>
   Across the industry, auto insurance prices are declining by a
projected 4.5 percent this year, according to the Insurance
Information Institute, primarily because of a declining accident
rate and safer cars. In addition, new car prices, drunken driving
and car theft are all down. And the insurers, which invest their
customers' premiums, are making money in the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   But to borrow a phrase about gasoline mileage, when it comes to
your own rates, your actual results may vary. Because the car
population is rising far faster than the number of households, and
because many of those households have been buying expensive sport
utility vehicles, many families are paying more for insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance premiums include costs for theft, liability and
injury; collision damage and related costs are about 38 percent of
the total. But that cost is rising relatively rapidly, more than 3
percent last year, about half again as fast as the Consumer Price
Index, according to the Insurance Information Institute.
</P>
<P>
   State Farm, for now, has given up generic parts. Some companies,
like Chubb, are crowing that they never used them. Chubb also
boasts that it puts no ceiling on the rate it will pay for body
shop labor. It is not insurance for people who want to minimize
transportation costs; most of its customers have cars that are
three years old or less.
</P>
<P>
   But Allstate uses after-market body parts in about 20 percent of
its repairs. As an incentive, it guarantees those parts, but not
auto company parts, for as long as the customer owns the car. Only
a few car owners refuse the after-market parts, the company says.

use after-market parts on a new car,'' Donoghue said, adding that
exactly when they should be used was up to the adjuster.

MILITARY LEADERS TELL CONGRESS OF NATO ERRORS IN KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's top civilian and military officials
told Congress Thursday that allied forces were too slow in choosing
targets during the Kosovo war, that the United States seriously
underestimated how many precision-guided munitions would be needed,
that NATO should have kept alive the option of a ground invasion
and that the war was fought with too much reliance on American
forces.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the war before the Senate Armed Services
Committee Thursday, Defense Secretary William Cohen and General
Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recited
these and other lessons of the 78-day air campaign. But they also
said that it was the technological and logistical superiority of
the United States that ensured victory for the NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen described the war over Serbia as ``a very decisive
victory.'' Without referring to lapses like NATO's bombing of the
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Cohen said that this had been
accomplished by carrying out ``the most precise'' air campaign in
history and one with the fewest civilian deaths or injuries.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Senate's defeat of a landmark nuclear test ban
treaty, Republicans again showed a willingness to attack the
Clinton administration's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican on the committee, Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama,
argued that ``the ethnic cleansing occurred after we started
bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy about that,'' Sessions said, ``and I don't think
we ought to consider this a great victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen strongly disagreed, pointing out that President Slobodan
Milosevic of Yugoslavia had launched a large-scale military
operation in the fall of 1998 with the objective of removing the
ethnic Albanians from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the European allies came in for serious criticism for
falling so far behind the American military. Although Cohen
repeated that the European allies have promised to modernize their
armed forces like those of the United States, Pentagon officials in
private discussions were divided over whether that would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials have predicted that the European militaries
will not be given the money necessary to increase their forces and
readiness much and instead will become its B team, acting as ground
troops for the American air armada.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton and Cohen refused to enter the debate over what
convinced Milosevic to withdraw from Kosovo, saying that a variety
of factors played a part: the intensified bombing around Belgrade,
the resurgence of the Kosovo Liberation Army that acted like ground
forces for NATO, the threat that NATO might mount a ground
invasion, and Russia's role in isolating Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, Lt. Gen. Michael C. Short, who ran
NATO's air campaign, said he believed it was the bombing campaign
in Serbian territory outside of the Kosovo province that was the
critical factor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of concentrating bombs on Serb forces in Kosovo, he said
that he would have tried to stop ethnic cleansing by going ``hard
after Belgrade and the leadership targets and everything Milosevic
held dear, and make it very clear to him that was exactly what we
were doing.'' His comments appeared in an interview published by
Air Force Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Shelton said Thursday that he and his European counterparts all
argued to NATO political leaders for keeping alive the option of
ground troops, at least as a threat to Milosevic. But the political
leaders, including those in Washington, refused to accept their
recommendation because several NATO countries said they would pull
out of the coalition if there was any chance of a land invasion.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Another topic Cohen avoided Thursday was the debate within the
military about the role of computer warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Adm. James Ellis, commander of the American piece of the war,
which was called Joint Task Force Noble Anvil, claimed in a still
unpublished after-action report that the length of the war could
have been cut in half if the United States had made better use of
its information warfare unit, the first it had assembled and part
of whose task was to present the war in the best light to the media
and on the internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admiral Ellis is right,'' said Franklin Kramer, assistant
secretary of defense for international security affairs, in an
interview. ``We have to do more and there is a lot more to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen did discuss the public side of information warfare,
complaining that NATO lost what he called the propaganda war. Cohen
cited the Serb policy of preventing Western coverage of Kosovo
except to visit the sites where civilians were killed in NATO's
accidental bombings of convoys or hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Pentagon and NATO restricted coverage of their
side of the war, Cohen said that Milosevic ``was far more skilled
in the manipulation of the media than we were.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also addressed the charge that NATO's air campaign placed
too great a premium on saving the lives of allied pilots; not a
single pilot was killed in combat during 78 days of
around-the-clock operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misapprehension that this is the goal of the United
States, that this is a standard that has been set by the Pentagon,
there can be no casualties incurred,'' Cohen said. ``I want to make
sure that everybody understands, we are not setting a standard, did
not set one here, that there should be no combat fatalities.''
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official who has seen the classified after-action
analysis said that estimates of Serbian civilian casualties were
low given the tonnage of bombs dropped.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's strict criteria for selecting and striking targets to
reduce the possibility of hitting civilians also meant the burden
fell on the United States _ with its satellite-guided smart bombs,
other precision weapons, sensors and mission-planning computers _
to fly the vast majority of the roughly 13,000 combat sorties, with
France a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   That imbalance can only be altered if the Europeans produce or
buy precision munitions, which would be a boon to American defense
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   For one senior Pentagon official, the most powerful lesson of
this three-month review was the confirmation of the importance of
these precision weapons, especially the Joint Direct Attack
Munitions, bombs that strike a target guided by Global Positioning
System satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the biggest deal,'' said the official. ``We knew
beforehand that JDAMS were great, it was nice to have it
confirmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list of equipment that proved indispensable and in
short supply were drone airplanes, tanker aircraft, and airborne
warning and control aircraft, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected loser in this war was the U.N. High Commission for
Refugees. From the start, the agency was overwhelmed in both
Macedonia and Albania trying to care for the nearly one million
refugees from Kosovo. NATO troops stepped in, built camps and
generally overshadowed the refugee agency.
</P>
<P>
   At the war's end, British Prime Minister Tony Blair privately
took the agency to task for what he considered its problematic
performance. Officials at UNHCR said that many of NATO's criticisms
were based on unrealistic expectations for an agency with a $1.4
billion annual budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no large standby capacity,'' said Dennis McNamara, who
heads the operation in Kosovo. ``If you want us to respond quickly
to these emergencies then the governments have to pay for it, like
they do for their militaries.''

COMMENTARY: FINANCE 101 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm beginning to take an interest in the congressional budget
debate. After all, I live in a state that has not passed an
appropriations bill on time since the Erie Canal was built. I have
considerable expertise in legislatures that cannot repair a
collapsed bridge without throwing in extra money for a football
stadium or Recreational Vehicle Theme Park. So when the federal
government started a new fiscal year sans budget, I felt at home.
As a public service, I've prepared a cheat sheet on what's going
on.
</P>
<P>
   STANDARDS. In 1997 a reform-minded Congress decided to give
itself extra-tough, super-challenging spending restraints _ for
1999. This heroic effort was part of a rash of demanding new
standards being set by brave policy makers around the country, all
of whom hoped to be retired before the bill came due. Most members
of the current Congress find the budget caps ridiculous, given the
size of the federal surplus. But the Republican majority is not
allowed to admit it. Its leaders are very concerned about public
perception, as we have seen recently from their skilled maneuvering
to define themselves as the party of HMO bureaucracies and nuclear
proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION. Emergencies! Until now, emergency spending bills
have been reserved for crises like floods, wars or the discovery by
Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska that his local reindeer farmers needed
$3 million RIGHT AWAY. But since emergency spending does not count
toward those pesky caps, the current Congress is getting more
creative. As a result, the following items are being declared to be
unforeseeable emergencies: the year 2000 census, winter heating
bills and operation of the Pentagon. The House Appropriations
Committee is rumored to be putting all budget items relating to
continents whose names begin with ``A'' in the emergency category,
as well as spending during daylight saving time and Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   THE TWILIGHT ZONE. For years now, President Clinton and the
Republican Congress have been fighting to prove who is the more
vigilant protector of the Social Security Trust Fund. This trust
fund is a metaphysical concept, sort of like eternity.
Contemplating it for too long will produce feelings of anxiety that
can only be relieved by a stiff drink or appropriating money for a
Soybean Hall of Fame in your district. Right now, Congress needs to
cut billions from the budget to avoid dipping into this imaginary
vault.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION. Directed scoring. (Impress your friends by
dropping this term at your next dinner party, and watch them head
for the door!) The Republican leaders have not believed a word
Clinton has said about anything in nearly seven years. Directed
scoring means that they have decided to trust him implicitly
whenever White House cost estimates come in lower than those of
congressional accountants.
</P>
<P>
   THE BIG BANG. Still, the numbers don't add up. One reason is
that Congress and the president were both determined that there
should be a whopping increase in the defense budget. This was
needed for priorities like a military pay raise and construction of
a $1.5 billion aircraft carrier the Navy doesn't want, in the home
district of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   THE SOLUTION. The Clinton administration proposed raising the
tobacco tax, an unfair tactic given Congress' principled commitment
to protecting our national right to inhale large quantities of
nicotine. (Who could forget Sen. Phil Gramm's moving revelation
that he feared the ``excruciating, bone-crushing'' cigarette tax
could send his chain-smoking mother to the poorhouse?) For its
part, the Republican leadership keeps eyeing the Earned Income Tax
Credit refunds for the working poor, which House Majority Leader
Dick Armey refers to as ``my money.'' This is his little joke, an
attempt to define tax breaks for minimum-wage laborers as
government giveaways, as opposed to legitimate tax deductions for
business investments in meals at the Four Seasons.
</P>
<P>
   THE ULTIMATE SOLUTION. When all else fails, the budget-makers
will simply slide bills due at the end of this fiscal year into the
next one. By then Congress will be on the brink of an election in
which the presidency and control over both the House and Senate are
on the line, and in a much better mood for bipartisan cooperation.

CLINTONS SECURE NEW FINANCING ON WESTCHESTER HOUSE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton have
secured new financing on the house they are buying in Chappaqua,
N.Y., the White House said Thursday, enabling them to drop an
earlier loan arrangement that had come under sharp criticism.
</P>
<P>
   The new loan, for $1.36 million, is in the form of a 30-year
adjustable-rate mortgage with an annual interest rate of 7.5
percent for the first three years, said Jim Kennedy, a White House
spokesman. After the first three years, the rate will be set at the
one-year Treasury bill rate plus 2.75 percentage points, he said.
The current Treasury bill rate is just under 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Clintons obtained new financing so they could
cancel a much-criticized arrangement they had with a prominent
Democratic Party fund-raiser, Kennedy said: ``I'm aware of that
speculation. Once they had the initial contract, a number of
different mortgage companies came forward with different options.
This one made the most sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said the loan is from PNC Mortgage, a subsidiary of the
PNC Bank Corp. of Pittsburgh. The Clintons are to make a down
payment of $340,000, or 20 percent of the purchase price of $1.7
million, and are to close on the deal on Nov. 1, Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the party fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, has no role in
the loan from PNC Mortgage. When the Clintons decided to buy the
white-shingled, five-bedroom Chappaqua house in September,
McAuliffe agreed to guarantee a mortgage with $1.35 million of his
money as collateral. That mortgage was to have been with Bankers
Trust Private Banking, a unit of Deutsche Bank, and its initial
interest was calculated at just over 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe is a good friend of the Clintons and is raising
millions of dollars for their legal defense fund and for a
presidential library to be built in Little Rock, Ark. The Clinton's
eagerness to accept his help brought criticism from Republicans and
public-interest groups who said the arrangement smacked of special
treatment and might constitute an illegal gift.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' move to Westchester County will clear the way for
Mrs. Clinton to run for the Senate from New York state, which she
seems likely to do. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who has been widely
mentioned as her probable Republican opponent, had questioned the
propriety of the arrangement with McAuliffe, signaling that the
issue would be a hot one in a campaign against Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that when the Clintons decided they wanted the
house in Chappaqua, their situation was like that of other couples
who fall in love with a house and know they must make a solid offer
quickly or risk losing out. ``They had a very short time to put
together the financing,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   But in other ways, the Clintons' situation is hard to compare
with those of other people their age. While they list slightly more
than $1 million in assets, they have about $5 million in legal
bills, a debt that might make it hard for other couples in their
50s to qualify for a mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, former presidents of the United States have
been able to command lucrative speaking fees and big book advances.
Both Clintons are lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Before McAuliffe offered his help, the Clintons sought financial
aid from former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and two former
White House chiefs of staff, Erskine B. Bowles and Thomas F.
McLarty III, who declined to help, according to several people
familiar with the couple's house-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Principal and interest payments on a 30-year mortgage at 7.5
percent are just over $9,500 a month, exclusive of taxes and
insurance. The taxes on the Chappaqua house are estimated at
$26,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The PNC Bank Corp. advertises itself as one of the biggest
financial-services organizations in the country. It says that PNC
Mortgage provided more than $6 billion to more than 43,000
borrowers in 1997.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's defeat of the test ban treaty
Wednesday left many senators troubled about a level of partisanship
usually reserved for the House, and wondering about the
institution's ability to manage a complicated issue that affects
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that politics ``stops at the water's edge'' has always
been an exaggeration, though with some truth to it. But these days,
as the Senate succumbs to the sound-bite culture, debates there are
increasingly rancorous and party-line votes occur with great
frequency.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of recognizing that a treaty, requiring a two-thirds
vote, cannot pass without extensive bipartisan support, Democrats
last month offered a legislative taunt to Sen. Trent Lott, the
majority leader, threatening to tie up the Senate if he did not
force hearings on the matter. Lott, always prickly about his
responsibility for the Senate agenda, took up their challenge and
beat them at their own partisan game.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who said a more thorough
examination might have persuaded him to vote yes, said, ``I think
we have to find a way to come back at this in a responsible manner
where we can continue to educate ourselves and the American
public.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel said his concerns extended beyond the details of the
treaty. ``It's a question of whether we want to continue to lead
the world,'' he said. ``There's a heavy burden associated with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., who voted to ratify, criticized
the brief time spent on the measure in committee. If the treaty was
flawed, he said, ``We could fix things; that's what you have
hearings for.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who voted no, scoffed at the treaty
supporters for not realizing that ``anyone who has any interest in
this treaty has to get together with Senator Lott.'' Instead, he
said, supporters seemed to have the ``naive assumption that if the
president visited with a few people, then hearts would melt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lugar, who has been a leader in bipartisan arms control efforts
in the past and ranks second to Sen. Jesse Helms on the Foreign
Relations Committee, sounded frustrated that no one from the
administration had worked effectively with Lott _ a step that Lugar
said would have given him room to maneuver. Lugar said that he did
not believe the treaty would succeed in barring all tests or that
the American stockpile could be maintained with testing excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader, obliquely
agreed. He said on Thursday it had been a ``blunder'' to push ahead
with the treaty in the expectation that many Republicans could be
swayed. ``We assumed that we could negotiate, but they were adamant
and dug in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the bipartisanship Lugar urged is easier to prescribe than
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate justly patted itself on the back in the winter for
handling the impeachment trial of President Clinton without the
rancor of the House. But good will has worn thin. As Democrats
succeed in forcing items on their agenda to be considered by the
Senate despite Lott, he gets increasingly prickly about his
authority.
</P>
<P>
   Lott relishes rare opportunities to get even. That is what
happened last month when he offered the Democrats a treaty vote.
They agreed _ even though they knew they lacked the votes to win,
or even come close. The Democrats were worried about seeming
inconsistent if they filibustered a vote on a treaty they had said
the world needed now.

COMMENTARY: THE HIMALAYAN ERROR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: South Korea, Pakistan, India)   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since their independence, the U.S. has made decisions about
India and Pakistan fully aware that it was dealing with countries
that would have increasing political and military significance, for
international good or evil. Now that both have nuclear arms
capability and Pakistan has been taken over again by the hard-wing
military, the American government and people stare at them as if
they were creatures that had suddenly popped out of nowhere _ and
as if their crises had no connection at all to those 50 years of
American involvement in the India-Pakistan subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   The destiny of the two countries _ war or peace, democracy or
despotism _ lies with their billion-plus people, their needs and
passions.
</P>
<P>
   But American decision-making about them has been of Himalayan
importance _ because from the beginning it was almost entirely
based on a great error. America chose Pakistan as more important to
its interests than India. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have a powerful sliver of their population who
are plain villains _ politicians who deliberately splinter their
society instead of knitting it, men of immense wealth who zealously
evade taxes and the public good, religious bottom-feeders who
spread violence between Hindu and Muslim in India and Muslim and
Muslim in Pakistan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But living for about four years as a New York Times
correspondent based in India and traveling often in Pakistan, I
knew that the American error was widening and catastrophic.
</P>
<P>
   Although there were important mavericks, American officialdom
clearly tilted toward Pakistan, knighted it a military ally and
looked with contempt or condescension on India. Pakistan _ a
country whose leadership provided a virtually unbroken record of
economic, social and military failure and increasing influence of
Islamicists.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. officials preferred to deal with the Pakistanis over
the Indians not despite Pakistan's tendency to militarism but
because of it. Man, the military fellows can get things done for
you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington saw the country as some kind of barrier-post against
China, which it never was, and against Soviet invasion of
Afghanistan. The Pakistanis did their part there. But when the
Taliban fanatics seized Afghanistan, Pakistan's military helped
them pass arms for terrorists to the Mideast.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan's weakness as an American ally, though Washington never
seemed to mind, was its leaders' refusal to create continuity of
democratic governments long enough to convince Pakistanis that the
military would not take over again tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Across the border, India, for all its slowness of economic
growth and its caste system, showed what the U.S. is supposed to
want _ consistent faithfulness to elected democracy. Where Pakistan
failed to maintain political democracy in a one-religion nation,
India has kept it in a Hindu-majority country that has four other
large religions and a garden of small ones.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Danger sign: The newly re-elected Hindu-led coalition will have
to clamp down harder against any religious persecution of Muslims
and Christians. India's real friends will never lessen pressure
against that. The new government is not likely to stay in office
long if it does not fulfill its anti-persecution promises to
several parties in the coalition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No, the U.S. did not itself create a militaristic Pakistan. But
by showing for years that it did not care much, it encouraged
Pakistani officers prowling for power, lessened the public's
confidence in democratic government when Pakistan happened to have
one, and slighted the Indians' constancy to democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, in the U.S. Embassy in Seoul, I heard the ranking U.S.
diplomat urge Washington not to recognize the military gang that
had just taken over South Korea after ousting the country's first
elected government in its history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Kennedy administration did recognize the military
government. That throttled South Koreans with military regimes for
almost another two decades. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is doing what America should: demand
the departure of the generals. Maybe America still has enough
influence to be of use to democracy some place or other in Asia.
It's the least it can do for its colossal error on the subcontinent
_ do for Indians, but mostly for Pakistanis. (BOX)

only a quarter of a mile wide at its narrowest point. (Eddie

 Chronicle Publishing Sells Newspaper for $295 Million  &HT;     By Peter Sinton

<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Chronicle Publishing Co. announced yesterday that it has agreed to
sell the Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette to New York Times Co. for
$295 million.
<P>
   Russell Lewis, chief executive of Times Co., which publishes the
New York Times and which bought the Boston Globe in 1993 for $1.1
billion, said the Worcester paper ``is a good fit with our other
long-term growth properties.''
</P>
<P>
   With 107,000 daily circulation and 134,000 on Sunday, the
Worcester Telegram &AMP; Gazette will be the fourth-largest of the
Times Company's 24 U.S. newspapers. Next in size is the Press
Democrat in Santa Rosa, which the Times Co. bought in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Worcester paper is subject to Department of
Justice review and Chronicle chief executive John Sias said he
expects the deal to close ``after the first of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Worcester deal marks the third major asset sale by the
privately owned Chronicle Publishing Co. since its board of
directors decided in June to sell some or all of its properties.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Hearst Corp., publisher of the afternoon Examiner,
agreed to buy The Chronicle morning newspaper for a reported $660
million. Last week, Pulitzer Inc. agreed to buy the Pantagraph and
seven community newspapers in Illinois for $180 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still on the block are KRON, San Francisco's NBC affiliate, two
television properties in Omaha, Neb., and Wichita, Kan., and two
book publishers _ Chronicle Books and MBI (Motorbooks
International).
</P>
<P>
   Bids were due this week for San Francisco's Chronicle Books.
Bidders reportedly include Nion McEvoy, editor in chief of the book
company and an owner of Chronicle Publishing; and Leo Hindery,
former chief finance and planning officer for Chronicle Publishing
from 1985 to 1987 who went on to become president of
Tele-Communications Inc. and, until last week, head of AT&AMP;T Corp.'s
cable television operations.

 Schwab Profit Swells 27% In 3rd Quarter  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Charles Schwab Corp., the nation's largest online and discount
broker, said its third-quarter profit jumped 27 percent from a year
ago as customers shifted assets to the firm at a rapid clip.
<P>
   San Francisco's Schwab reported net income of $124.5 million (15
cents a diluted share), compared with $97.8 million (12 cents) for
the three months ended September 1998. The firm posted revenue of
$883.7 million in the latest period, up 25 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's earnings met Wall Street expectations but fell sharply
from the previous period as stock trading slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by a frenzied surge in Internet-based trading activity,
Schwab posted record profit and revenue of $151 million and $982.1
million, respectively, in the 1999 second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's stock rose $1.88, to $29.94, yesterday on volume of 6.6
million shares after it announced earnings.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of Web-based trading during the first and second
quarter ``was clearly an aberration,'' said Hambrecht &AMP; Quist
analyst Greg Smith. Schwab's third quarter probably was more
representative of the level of activity the firm can sustain, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, Schwab did well, but not great, given market
conditions,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The best news for Schwab was its ability to draw in assets.
Customers added $25 billion in net new assets in the past quarter,
an amount almost as large as the total assets of Menlo Park's
E-Trade Group, the No.2 online broker. That raised Schwab's total
customer assets to $595 billion and topped the firm's $23 billion
of net new assets in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The asset flow increased even though Schwab opened 282,000
accounts in the September quarter, fewer than the 422,000 it opened
in the previous period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worrying about that,'' Schwab Chief Financial
Officer Chris Dodds said in an interview. ``We've made a conscious
decision to focus on asset aggregation more than new accounts.``
</P>
<P>
   Average trades dropped to 175,400 per day in the quarter, from
203,700 in the previous period, as the online stock-trading mania
cooled. As a result, Schwab's revenue from commissions and
wholesale brokerage dropped, partly offset by increases in mutual
fund service fees and net interest income.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of Schwab's trades in the most recent
period occurred online.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's results contrasted sharply with that of E-Trade,
announced Wednesday, which signed up more new customers than Schwab
but added assets at a relatively sluggish pace.
</P>
<P>
   The divergence points to a growing segmentation of the online
brokerage market, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Edgier, hipper firms like E-Trade are attracting Generation X
customers comfortable on the Internet but without the wealth of
older investors. Schwab, which raised its minimum account-balance
requirement to $5,000 from $2,500 earlier this year, is attracting
well-heeled clients who traditionally used full-service brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schwab is moving upstream and going against firms like Merrill
Lynch,'' said Smith. ``Schwab clearly has a higher-caliber level of
customer'' than other online brokers.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STRASBOURG, France _ Overcoming national jealousies and
ideological obstacles, DaimlerChrysler AG of Germany and
Aerospatiale Matra SA of France agreed Thursday to merge their
aerospace businesses into a European behemoth with about $22
billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, to be called European Aeronautic, Defense and
Space Co., would be the world's third-largest aerospace company
after Boeing Co. and Lockheed-Martin Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it would essentially control Airbus
Industrie, Boeing's bitter rival in commercial aircraft production,
as well as Arianespace SA, currently the world's biggest commercial
rocket-launch company.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal is at least as important for political and military
as for business reasons. It marks the first major cross-border
merger within Europe's balkanized military industry and
demonstrates the galvanizing effect of the Kosovo war on European
military thinking.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to the relentless pace with which American
military contractors have merged in recent years, the European
players have remained fragmented along national lines.
</P>
<P>
   The price of that fragmentation was painfully apparent to
European leaders during NATO's war in Kosovo this summer, when
American military technology and aircraft utterly dominated the
multinational force.
</P>
<P>
   Highlighting the political significance of Thursday's deal,
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder of Germany and Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin of France took part in a signing ceremony here in this city
on the French-German border.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become necessary to combine European forces,'' Jospin
said. ``Today's success underlines the outstanding success of the
French-German alliance as a motor of European integration.''
</P>
<P>
   That marks a huge turnaround from earlier this year. As recently
as last March, disputes between the big European aerospace
companies and their sponsoring governments had become so intense
that the Germans had begun sounding out American companies like
Northrop Grumman Corp. about possible alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Schrempp, the chairman of DaimlerChrysler, bluntly
declared in March that ``the dream of a European defense company is
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   One symbol of the enduring differences Thursday was language.
Even though the partners here were respectively French and German,
the name of the new company and indeed its official language of
business will be English.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Thursday was only possible after both the
Germans and the French made big political compromises. Until
recently, Daimler executives refused to team up with Aerospatiale
as long as the French government still owned a big stake. The
French government was equally vehement in demanding continued
control over big decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The result Thursday was a complicated compromise that diminishes
the French government stake but leaves it with a veto on major
issues. In a twist, however, DaimlerChrysler has the right to sell
its 50 percent stake back to the French after three years if it is
unhappy with the results.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger is successful, it could create new competitive
pressure for Boeing, Lockheed and the remaining American military
contractors. But Pentagon officials have been quietly encouraging
European mergers, in the hope of standardizing the military
industry on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   European leaders, as well as executives at both DaimlerChrysler
and Aerospatiale, hope several other European players will join the
group. Casa, the Spanish aerospace company, is already in merger
talks with DaimlerChrysler's aerospace unit, and is expected to
join in quickly.
</P>
<P>
   But executives here are also hoping to recruit companies like
Thomson CSF of France, which produces military electronics, as well
as Italian partners.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question now concerns the British aerospace
industry, which broke ranks with the Continental players last year.
In a stinging rebuke to the French and Germans, British Aerospace
PLC negotiated a merger with GEC Marconi, a unit of General
Electric of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   That deal derailed painstaking efforts by European political
leaders to arrange a Continent-wide merger.
</P>
<P>
   Now British Aerospace, which remains a minority shareholder in
the Airbus consortium, appears isolated.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Luc Lagadere, the chairman of Aerospatiale, made it clear
Thursday that he was hoping to lure partners from Spain and Italy
but most importantly from Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am talking about all those countries in Western Europe, and
I am of course talking about our British friends,'' said Lagadere.
</P>
<P>
   Ranked by annual sales, the French-German conglomerate would
still be less than half as big as Boeing, with $53.5 billion, and
slightly smaller than Lockheed-Martin, with $25 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Its biggest component by far would be its 75 percent stake in
Airbus, the European consortium that produces commercial airliners
and has revenue of about $8.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to convert Airbus from its current unwieldy
structure as a multinational consortium to a conventional company
that would be a subsidiary of the French-German conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will also control Arianespace, which is the
world's biggest commercial rocket launch company. It will also
control Eurocopter, which claims to be the world's largest
helicopter producer.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the new company would remain far behind the
American rivals as a producer of jet fighters, a field where it
commands only 5.8 percent of the world market.
</P>
<P>
   To resolve the disputes over political control, the new company
would have a complicated structure. On the surface, the structure
appears to create a merger of equals that would leave the French
government with a decisive role. But the deal may well leave
DaimlerChrysler in command.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, DaimlerChrysler would turn over its entire
aerospace subsidiary except for a division that makes aircraft
engines. Because the aerospace subsidiary is much larger than
Aerospatiale, DaimlerChrysler would also get 3.4 billion euros in
cash, or about $3.7 billion, in exchange for accepting only 50
percent of a new holding company.
</P>
<P>
   The French government, which currently owns 48 percent of
Aerospatiale, would sell shares to its stake in the new company to
just 15 percent. But the government would still have a veto over
decisions on mergers, strategic alliances or additional stock
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the French government control runs counter to
DaimlerChrysler's long-held refusal to team up with a
state-controlled company.
</P>
<P>
   But a provision that was not publicly disclosed Thursday
provides Daimler with a piece of insurance: the right to sell its
shares to the other shareholders _ after three years if it is
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   Manfred Bischoff, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler Aerospace,
defended the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to make a choice _ either we gave more importance to
being a competitive entity or we gave more importance to reducing
government ownership,'' he said Thursday. ``As we would say in
German, it was a small frog to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Company executives close to the deal said Schrempp approached
Lagadere informally in April but negotiations did not become
serious until June. At that point, according to one executive, he
set a deadline of July 14 for reaching an agreement at the
corporate level. If they failed, Schrempp vowed to scrap talks and
seek an American partner instead _ namely Northrop Grumman.
</P>
<P>
   The executives apparently did reach a deal in July, but they
still needed to negotiate an agreement with the French government.
Those talks began in September and did not conclude until last
week.
</P>
<P>
   American reaction to Thursday's deal was muted. ``I don't think
that fundamentally at this point changes anything,'' said Philip
Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief executive. ``It gives them both
an opportunity and a challenge to bring those together. And in the
meantime we are going to be getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, officials are hoping to entice European
military contractors into trans-Atlantic deals. Though pleased to
see the European industry consolidating around a few big players,
officials remain wary that American rivals may be squeezed out of
European markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We favor an evolution toward a competitive trans-Atlantic
model of defense industries,'' said Cheryl Irwin, a Pentagon
spokesman.

 S.F. Turns Its Red Tape Into Digital Form  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Moving to replace red tape with mouse clicks, the city of San
Francisco has launched a Web site that will enable local
proprietors to do business with the city directly from their
computer desktops.
<P>
   The city's 70,000 businesses now can renew their annual business
tax registration, which is due by November 1, at the new San
Francisco CityBusiness site (citybusiness.sfgov.org). Instead of
filling out paper forms, they simply punch in a couple of
identification numbers; rather than writing a check, they can enter
a credit card number to pay the associated fees, which range from
$25 to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Business owners have to wait a week to 10 days to get their
registration certificates, but they get a confirmation number as
soon as they complete the online process, plus follow-up e-mail
later.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the city plans to expand the site with a variety of
other interactive functions, such as paying water bills, ordering
copies of birth and death certificates and eventually paying taxes
and parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   City Treasurer Susan Leal, whose office initiated the project,
presided over the launch ceremony yesterday at City Hall.
Supervisors Gavin Newsom and Mark Leno were on hand to demonstrate
the system by renewing the registrations of their small businesses
on an IBM laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstration got off to a rocky start when Newsom, trying
to renew the registration of his Plump Jack wine store, was greeted
with an error message (``error: failure-hard''). It turned out that
Newsom, ignoring onscreen instructions to select either Visa or
MasterCard, had tried to pay his $150 fee with an American Express
card.
</P>
<P>
   Leno's renewal for his Budget Signs company, however, went
smoothly. Newsom, after finding a Visa card in another pocket, then
tried again, this time successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one more example of the most wired city wiring itself
even more,'' Leno said.
</P>
<P>
   The site was developed by KPMG Consulting in cooperation with
the city's Department of Telecommunications and Information
Services, with additional help from Microsoft. It runs on equipment
donated by Hewlett-Packard and hosted at Qwest Cyber.Solutions, a
joint venture of KPMG and Qwest Communications International, in
San Jose.

 Intel Plans to Acquire DSP for $1.6 Billion  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A billion dollars here, a billion dollars there, pretty soon you're
a giant in the burgeoning communications-chip industry.
<P>
   That, at least, seems to be Intel's battle plan. The company
yesterday said it is shelling out $1.6 billion in cash to acquire
DSP Communications, a leading supplier of digital signal processors
and other chips for cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout is the latest in a series of moves through which
Intel chief executive Craig Barrett is attempting to make his
company a key supplier of chips for networking and communications
products. The company has spent more than $5 billion this year to
acquire companies in this market.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition is an important element of Intel's plan to
become the leading building-block supplier to the Internet,''
according to the company's press release.
</P>
<P>
   Intel still derives the bulk of its revenues from its Pentium
family of microprocessors for PCs, but growth in that market is
slowing and price pressures have squeezed profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's revenues and earnings for the quarter ended September 25
fell slightly short of analysts' expectations, just as they have
done for the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   DSP Communications is headquartered in Cupertino, but as of Dec.
31, 1998, 80 percent of its 230 employees were in Israel, according
to Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The company
specializes in the design of digital signal processors and
companion chips for cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   DSPC's customers include many of the giants in the cellular
world, among them Lucent Technologies, Motorola, NEC, Philips,
Sanyo and Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bier, president and general manager of Berkeley Design
Technology Inc., a Berkeley consulting company that specializes in
digital signal processing, said DSPC's products are not unique,
``but they've certainly been successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the other leading players in the cell-phone
chipset market, including Texas Instruments, LSI Logic and Philips,
are larger companies that would have been more expensive for Intel
to acquire and more difficult to digest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may have been unique in being the only pure-play company in
this field,'' he said. ``And the $1.6 billion price looks very
reasonable when you consider that much smaller, less-established
companies in the embedded telecommunications space have recently
been selling for hundreds of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   In its SEC filing, DSPC reported that it had 52 patents allowed
or pending in the United States, Japan and Israel. The company has
expertise in several cellular technologies used by different
companies and in different countries. Some of its products are
designed for phones that let users connect wirelessly to the
Internet, a market expected to boom in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   Intel CEO Barrett focused on that theme in comments included in
Intel's announcement: ``Cellular technology is emerging as a new
high-speed method of connecting to the Internet and we believe over
time it will become increasingly important for connecting PCs to
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion purchase price values DSPC's shares at $36
each, a premium of almost 29 percent over Wednesday's closing price
of $28.
</P>
<P>
   News of the deal was well received on Wall Street. Intel shares
rose $1.22 to close at $73.43, while DSP's stock soared $6.94, to
$34.94.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Office Fridge Fright  &HT;     By Sam McManis 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Co-workers at Samuel Merritt College in Oakland always
good-naturedly kidded associate registrar Anne Scher about her
healthy eating habits, such as her affinity for all things bran and
a steadfast refusal to let refined sugar pass between her lips.
<P>
   But it was Scher's ominous-looking natural food drink, the color
and texture of which she acknowledged looked like ``pond scum,''
that made colleagues warily move their casserole dishes and roast
beef sandwiches to another shelf.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks went by, and still the drink remained untouched _ even by
Scher herself. No one mentioned it; apparently, they didn't want to
get near this presumably toxic substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It finally exploded inside the refrigerator, completely
covering the ceiling, walls and everyone's food with bright green
pond scum,'' said Scher, who spent two hours on her hands and knees
with a sponge cleaning up the mess. ``My co-workers found this very
amusing.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Scher's office-mates had a sense of humor. Discarded
horrors lurking in office fridges are the bane of many a workplace
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Be it pungent chicken chow mein in Styrofoam boxes left over
from Reagan's first term, carrot juice that dripped to the bottom
shelf and became as indestructible as titanium or an unrecognizable
entree that has grown blue hair and seems to be moving, a messy,
malodorous fridge can chip away at a worker's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Long considered a workplace perk, office fridges provide
employees a chance to save money and eat something to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Several surveys also point out that American workers have
chosen, for the sake of productivity, to eat lunch at their desks
rather than eat out.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the office refrigerator has led to abuses
that have turned it into a battleground among grousing employees
and a breeding ground for bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   That has caused many companies to assign workers _ usually
administrative staff _ to regularly clean the mess. Kathie Dills,
president of the Berkeley-Vallejo chapter of the International
Association of Administrative Professionals, said her large
corporation in San Francisco now has specific cleanliness rules
after a big fridge fallout a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worked pretty well, but generally, it's still the women
who clean up,'' Dills said. ``Although I have seen some of our
partners wipe things down occasionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, refrigerator wars remain a relatively harmless
workplace irritant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bosses who are psychotic and people being laid off _ those are
the big traumatic events in the workplace,'' said Bob Rosner, who
hosts a Web site ( &LR; www.workingwounded.com &LR; ) &LR;   &LR; that provides an
outlet for workers to vent and get advice. ``But I'd say, on a
day-to-day basis, I get more mail on pebble-in-the-shoe stuff like
office refrigerators than the important stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, when you're sitting there for eight hours a day,
workers pump these little things like a bad fridge smell into major
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it from a veteran office temp in San Francisco, who didn't
want to give her name for fear of reprisal _ nearly every company
she has done time with has had a fridge fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come across that refrigerators that, you know, the food
must have been there a million years,'' she said. ``It's, like,
growing hair. You open the Tupperware container, and you go, `Oooh,
that's terrible.' I've found that, in the offices I've worked in,
the bigger the company, the worse the fridge. There's always a sign
on the front that says, `Take out by Friday,' but they always
forget to put what year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees say they don't understand how co-workers can
leave leftovers in the refrigerator for so long that they start to
resemble science experiments in food preservation gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is, few will cop to ownership of the
bacteria-spawning wedges of decaying lunch leftovers. Fewer still
will volunteer to clean this repository of once-edible rubbish.
</P>
<P>
   Even professionals shy away from such unenviable tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of college kids' fridges,'' says a manager of
High Marks Janitorial Service, which cleans many office buildings
in San Francisco. ``Food will sit there a month before somebody
says, `What is this?' As a general rule, janitorial services won't
go in a fridge to clean unless specifically asked to do it for an
additional charge. We charge about 30 bucks extra. But it's not
something we like to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But somebody, someday, must do it. Usually, it is one fastidious
person disgusted with slovenly colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Orr, a vice president at Tsantes &AMP; Associates, a Campbell
public relations firm, embarrassed her co-workers last year by
complaining about their office fridge in the Wall Street Journal.
It seems Orr was tired of being the office nag and cleaning up
after everyone else, so she went public with the firm's dirty
little secret.
</P>
<P>
   The public flogging apparently had the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy to report that our fridge has been clean and
odor-free for quite some time,'' Orr said. ``We still get the
occasional yogurt left in there with the expiration dates older
than my car, but for the most part, everyone is pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   For some, the cleanup is therapy itself. Cheryl, a marketing
executive from the East Bay who declined to give her last name,
used to volunteer to clean the office fridge. ``Sometimes, people
would ask me why if they happened by while I was at it,'' Cheryl
said. ``The same curious people would just stuff whatever into the
fridge and leave dirty dishes in the sink and just move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosner says the top office complaint to his Web site involves
brown-bag criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman told me about a psychotic co-worker who opened a
sealed box of chicken, ate six of the seven pieces, put the bones
back and re-sealed it,'' Rosner said.
</P>
<P>
   Debra Ebling, an East Bay lawyer, has a similar tale of woe.
``Someone finally put a Post-it note that read, `I spit in this
jar' on a jar of food, obviously hoping this would stop anyone from
taking it,'' she said. ``A friend of mine ... saw this and couldn't
resist putting his own note that read, `So did I.'''
</P>
<P>
   In drastic cases, the leftover problem has made the fridge so
hideous that the only viable option is to toss it and buy a new
one.
</P>
<P>
   This happened in a Philadelphia law firm a few years ago, when a
lawyer, an avid hunter, brought a decapitated fox head in a box and
stored it there until he could get his secretary to make
arrangements with a testing laboratory to determine whether the fox
was rabid. Employees who opened the fridge were horrified.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one went near (the fridge) for weeks after that,'' she
said, noting that the company bought a new refrigerator shortly
afterward.

GIRARDI MOVES TO FRONT; BROSIUS SHORT ONE DOUBLE: NIELSEN RATINGS
UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jorge Posada is the catcher of the future, but as far as Yankees
Manager Joe Torre is concerned, Joe Girardi is the catcher of the
present.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi was scheduled to start Game 2 of the American League
Championship Series against the Boston Red Sox last night, and team
with David Cone _ a departure from the way Girardi and Posada
shared responsibilities during the regular season. Posada made
about 60 percent of the starts behind the plate, teaming with
Orlando Hernandez, Cone and Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the Yankees are in the midst of the playoffs, Torre
is going with the catcher with whom the pitchers have been the most
comfortable, and in Cone's case, that has always been Girardi.
Cone's earned run average is more than a run lower with Girardi
behind the plate than it is when Posada catches him and, of course,
Girardi was the catcher on the day this season when Cone pitched
his perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough in relation to Jorge, but I'm trying to give David
every benefit _ even though David has never expressed a preference,
one way or the other,'' Torre said. ``Since Cone hasn't pitched for
a while, I wanted to put Joe back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada went into the 1998 season as the primary catcher, and at
that time, the Yankees were committed to his developing into an
everyday catcher for the 1999 season. But when the season was over,
the Yankees surprised Girardi by exercising his $3.4 million option
for this season _ at Torre's suggestion _ and Posada has not played
as much as he would have liked.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi is also expected to catch Games 3 and 4 in Boston, where
Roger Clemens and then Pettitte will pitch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BROSIUS' BID COMES UP SHORT
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius hammered a two-run homer in his first at-bat in
Game 1 on Wednesday night, to keep the Yankees close at 3-2, then
added a triple in his next plate appearance when his blooper fell
out of the grasp of the diving Trot Nixon in right field and rolled
into the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit a single in the seventh inning, leaving him only a
double away from becoming the first player in major league history
to hit for the cycle _ a single, a double, a triple and a home run
_ in a post-season game. ``I knew that if I had a chance, it would
probably be tonight because I got that triple out of the way
early,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius, however, struck out in his last at-bat, which hardly
diminished his impact on the game.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RATINGS ARE UP &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By RICHARD SANDOMIR &QC;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Game 1 of the ALCS on Wednesday night produced a 10.8 national
Nielsen rating for Fox, an increase of 74 percent from the league
championship game the network showed on the same night last year,
between Atlanta and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, on Channel 5, the game generated a 24.4 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The game started with an 8.4 rating from 8:14 to 8:30 p.m. and
peaked at an 11.5 from 9:30 to 10. When Bernie Williams hit the
game-winning home run in the bottom of the 10th inning, the rating
stood at 11.3.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC, Game 2 of the Mets-Braves NLCS posted a 7.3 preliminary
overnight rating, down from a 9.8 for a Cleveland-Yankees ALCS game
last year. For Game 1 of the Mets-Braves series, NBC posted a 10.8
rating, up from a 9.2 in 1998.

 REPUBLICANS PILLORY McCAIN IN DEBATE OVER SOFT MONEY  
(th) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate opened five days of debate on the
campaign finance bill, Republicans bitterly turned on one of their
own Thursday, demanding that Sen. John McCain of Arizona prove his
contentions that special-interest contributions to political
parties are corrupting Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually personal exchanges consumed most of the morning
and illustrated how high passions run on an issue that affects
lawmakers quite personally.
</P>
<P>
   The rancor also showcased the difficulties faced by McCain and
Sen. Russ Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat, in their effort to ban
the unlimited and unregulated six-figure donations to the political
parties known as soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary dialogue in a chamber that usually strives for
comity began when Sen. Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican who
has been a steady opponent of the bipartisan legislation, began
reading statement after statement made by McCain, who has made his
stand against special-interest money a foundation of his bid for
the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone must be corrupt for there to be corruption,''
McConnell said, and he challenged McCain to come forth with
specific charges against individual senators.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can there be corruption if no one is corrupt?'' McConnell
asked, ``That's like saying the gang is corrupt but none of the
gangsters are.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain instead read passages about the culture of money in
Washington from a new book by Elizabeth Drew, ``The Corruption of
American Politics.'' But he refused to name names, saying, ``I am
not in the business of identifying individuals or attacking
individuals. I am attacking a system. I am attacking a system that
has to be fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, several Republicans refused to relent, pressing for
precise examples of corruption from McCain, a maverick who has
irritated many in his party with his stands against pork-barrel
spending, for overhaul of the campaign finance law and for
antismoking legislation. The few Democrats on the floor watched for
the most part in fascinated silence as Republicans tore into one of
their own presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Sen. Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota,
inquired of McConnell how long he planned to ``continue with this
attack on Senator McCain on the floor?''
</P>
<P>
   Although the House passed comprehensive legislation to overhaul
the campaign finance law by a 252-177 vote last month, McCain and
Feingold have repeatedly fallen at least eight votes short of the
60 they need to steer their companion bill past a Senate
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   So this year, in an effort to change the dynamics, they scaled
back their bill to focus mainly on the soft-money ban and dropped
efforts to regulate issue advocacy advertisements by outside
groups, which are often thinly disguised campaign commercials.
During the next five days of debate and amendment efforts that
McCain has described as a ``dynamic process'' the two senators hope
to craft a bill that can pick up additional votes to overcome a
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the new bill has won only one additional supporter,
Sen. Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas. And the new strategy
could just as easily risk losing votes for the bill as gaining
them. The League of Women Voters, for example, has already
withdrawn its previous support for the legislation, saying it is no
longer comprehensive enough.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the kind of pitfalls that could be ahead, the
Senate by voice vote Thursday approved a seemingly innocuous
amendment offered by McConnell to change Senate rules to require
senators to report any ``credible information'' of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But the amendment had a little-noticed second effect: through a
parliamentary tactic it created a nearly insurmountable threshold
for McCain and Feingold to meet to overcome an expected filibuster
against their legislation by McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   To stop a filibuster against a change in Senate rules requires
67 votes instead of the usual 60 votes. But aides to McCain said he
had enough votes to overturn McConnell's amendment and replace it
with a slightly different one. And McConnell, having demonstrated
just how wily a master he is of Senate rules, told reporters later
that he would not insist that his opponents come up with 67 votes
to fight his filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved an amendment requiring quick disclosure
of campaign contributions on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As senators argued across a long day over whether the current
system of campaign financing was by its very nature corrupting, one
of the sharpest exchanges came between Sen. Robert F. Bennett,
Republican of Utah, and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett noted that a $2.2 million sewer project for the 2002
Winter Olympics that he had sponsored was mentioned on the Web page
of McCain's presidential campaign as an example of the kind of pork
barrel spending that results from the contributions of special
interests. He demanded that McCain identify the contributions that
he believed had made Bennett propose the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who gave the soft money?'' Bennett asked. ``How much was it
and where did it go?''
</P>
<P>
   McCain replied that he had said only that campaign contributions
were a main ingredient in pork barrel spending. And he read a
dictionary definition of corruption as ``the impairment of
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, he took on Bennett over the practice, common
in Congress, of inserting money for special projects into spending
bills. McCain said he had written to Bennett in 1997 about the Utah
senator's efforts to insert money for the 2002 Winter Olympics into
spending bills without congressional hearings.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said that when he never received a response he personally
gave Bennett a copy of the letter a year later. ``The people of
Arizona would at least like to have a hearing before their tax
dollars go to the state of Utah,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Then another Republican senator with a project listed on
McCain's Web site _ Slade Gorton of Washington _ began a similar
wrangle.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the day, the debate covered more familiar
ground.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell, who heads the Senate Republicans' campaign committee,
argued that the McCain-Feingold legislation even in the scaled-back
form he derided as ``McCain-Feingold lite'' contains contribution
limits that violate constitutional guarantees of free speech.
McConnell called it ``one of the tragedies of our time'' that the
bill ``is allowed to be advanced as reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure's supporters said that large campaign contributions
were causing pervasive cynicism about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only a crucial issue to the health and future of
Congress, but also for democracy itself,'' Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that if he had his way, the Senate would pass
public financing of campaigns.

PROSPERITY AS REDEMPTION FOR A BOOMER GENERATION  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (af)  
 By TOM REDBURN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody knows that journalism thrives on bad news: natural
disasters, wars, financial crashes. Where would newspapers be
without them?
</P>
<P>
   So when a book comes along titled ``The Long Boom: A Vision For
the Coming Age of Prosperity,'' the natural reaction of any
self-respecting economics reporter or editor is to examine it with
a jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   For what if its message _ that the world stands on the edge of a
``global economic expansion on a scale never before experienced'' _
turns out to be true? In that case, the job of covering the economy
in the future, I have to confess, would probably be a lot less
engaging than it has been in the thrilling upheavals of the two
decades I've been writing or editing articles about economics and
business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Who wants to write an unending series of upbeat stories? Who
wants to read them? People pay a lot more attention to the economy,
after all, when things are going badly than when they are going
well. Even the current obsession with getting rich in the stock
market is built on the fear that it may all fall apart at any
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite my clear interest in finding fault, ``The Long Boom''
(Perseus Books, October 1999), is not so easy to dismiss.
</P>
<P>
   The book's central thesis, first propounded in an exceptionally
long article written by Peter Schwartz and Pete Leyden in Wired
magazine in 1997, is by now quite familiar. ``We have gone from an
economy driven by the production of tangible things to one driven
by intangible ideas,'' they argue. The global economy is in the
midst of a ``40-year period from 1980 to 2020 encompassing a
critical shift from an Industrial Age economy to an Information Age
economy, or a Knowledge Economy, or what we simply call the New
Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   While still controversial among economists, this kind of
thinking has been accepted for years in the technology centers on
the West Coast. It is reflected in the writings of everyone from
Peter Drucker to Paul Hawken, whose seminal 1983 book, ``The Next
Economy,'' grew out of futurism scenarios developed at the Stanford
Research Institute. Even Alan Greenspan is a convert.
</P>
<P>
   And it turned out to be more prescient than the fashionably
pessimistic East Coast views of the 1980s, expressed in critically
acclaimed books like ``The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers,'' by
Paul Kennedy, a professor at Yale. He predicted the decline of the
United States as a world power only a few years before America's
chief strategic rival, the Soviet Union, fell apart and its chief
economic challenger, Japan, entered decade-long stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   But the pessimists have been swept from the field, and American
optimism about the nation's technological and economic superiority
is running rampant. So what now? ``If we do it right, it's an
opportunity to build a vastly better world,'' said Schwartz,
visiting New York the other day with Leyden, in a wide-ranging
conversation. ``This is the reverse of World War II. This is about
more than simply protecting what we've got against the sea of
darkness.''
</P>
<P>
   The allusion to World War II is revealing. Millions of baby
boomers harbor a not-so-hidden envy of their parents' great
crusade. ``Saving Private Ryan'' and Tom Brokaw's paean to ``The
Greatest Generation'' have touched a chord: Making money doesn't
compare to ridding the world of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong, of course, with recognizing the nobility
of that heroic struggle. Self-sacrifice is morally superior to
self-indulgence. But sometimes that wisdom slops over into a
yearning for another war to fight, a hankering simply to risk death
for a greater cause.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where ``The Long Boom'' gets interesting. For what
the authors are really doing is trying to infuse that hoariest of
cliches _ the moral equivalent of war _ with real meaning for
generations who, one hopes, will never experience a real war.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, they offer an ideology for college-educated
knowledge workers, who will soon be the largest class in America.
They advocate globalization and open markets, and while not
particularly anti-government, they are vaguely libertarian in
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   They see rapid growth built on technologies like fuel cells and
genetic engineering as capable of improving the environment rather
than degrading it. ``It's an anti-Blade Runner vision of the
future,'' Leyden said.
</P>
<P>
   The payoff from all this in 25 years or so, they argue, will be
to pull perhaps half the world's population out of subsistence
living into a vast, well-educated global middle class. The average
life span would lengthen tremendously. The risk of global warming
would disappear.
</P>
<P>
   I've got my doubts. They underestimate the threat of deep
cultural conflict and a backlash against technology that would
result from fast growth. They tend to congratulate the high-tech
centimillionaires of Silicon Valley simply for doing what they do
best: getting rich. And their vision is too New Agey for my taste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, their dream looks superior to the likely alternatives.
Growth is indeed better than stagnation. Peace beats war. If that's
not so good for reporters, so be it.

   Catch the story the other day about the possible involvement of
five University of Tennessee football players, a baseball player
and a female athlete in academic irregularities involving four
tutors going back to 1995? The school recently held four football
players out of a game, then reinstated them a week later after its
own investigation found them to be clean.
</P>
<P>
   But the crux of the tale _ that some at the school knew about
these allegations but didn't act on it for a long while _ has yet
to be addressed publicly by Tennessee officials.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was a startling revelation that two top instructors
in the Dodgers' minor-league system were accused by more than one
person of physically and verbally abusing players.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Then this week he hired a new director of minor leagues.

Internet, where the concept of sports journalism continues to be
regarded by the mainstream as one of the great oxymorons of the day
_ basically because any moron who has access to a computer can make
his own Web site, shovel information out there and claim to be a
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   As this communication renaissance has taken off on the Internet
over the last five years, we've been told that sports sites are one
of the strongest driving forces of the Web. Yet, in one way, the
Internet model of reporting is perceived to have been set by
scavenger Matt Drudge, who built the Monica Lewinsky-President
Clinton scandal into something that led to a governmental
shakedown.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee story, first reported on ESPN.com, and the Dodgers
story, broken by KFWB-AM (980) sports anchor and former longtime
radio-sports-talk host Joe McDonnell on his site
(www.la-sports.com), have rattled some cages in high places as
well. Although these examples are seen almost as aberrations in
this medium, they could set the tone nationally and locally for
what original Internet sports reporting will be about.
</P>
<P>
   Each has one thing other start-up wanna-be sites can not attain
so easily this early in the game _ a track record of credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at where the information is coming from,''
said John Marvel, the executive editor of ESPN.com, who comes from
years of newspaper writing. ``How you set yourself apart is by your
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel like we're pioneering a great medium, probably like
the guys who started in TV in the mid-'40s. We know everyone can
put up a site, but we play by the same rules of journalism here.
We're not Matt Drudge throwing up stuff and hoping it sticks. We
never want to embarrass ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is good journalism on the Web. When people start
understanding that, the credibility factor goes up. We're proud of
what we do and you'll probably see a lot more original reporting as
other sites start to understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee announced last week that there would be no NCAA
investigation into academic fraud after an internal probe found no
rules violation. University president J. Wade Gilley was quoted in
the local press as calling the original story ``speculation and
rumor'' and that ``ESPN.com is not the judge, jury and
executioner.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee did, however, interview a former academic counselor
who was a key source in the ESPN.com story.
</P>
<P>
   Marvel's man on the Tennessee story was Tom Farrey, a former
Seattle Times reporter who once did a story in 1992 about a
University of Washington quarterback who took a $50,000 loan. That
led to the school, which had just won the national championship,
going on probation and the resignation of coach Don James.
</P>
<P>
   Farrey was tipped off to the Tennessee story by an e-mail from a
student-athlete at the school.
</P>
<P>
   With the backing of ESPN, one of the first all-sports sites that
the Net users embraced, ESPN.com has become a news force in itself.
In fact, ESPN ``SportsCenter'' didn't report the story until
!ital!after!off! ESPN.com broke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a great advantage in those four letters,'' Marvel
agrees. ``People know who we are, even though we go independently
of the TV. We've also built a reputation on our own. It's not as if
we're just `Joe's Website.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although, in this instance, it's not that different from a real
Joe's site.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell started his two years ago with a URL (thebignasty.com)
that was more an extension of his sports-talk show persona. When he
started at KFWB earlier this year, he revamped his site, included
links to many of the Internet newspaper sites and put up an
interactive poll. But what he found is that it not only gave him an
outlet to express his opinions on what was going on, but to become
a breaking-news site.
</P>
<P>
   When McDonnell posted his Dodgers story earlier this month, it
included Malone's quote that ``there's no validity to it'' and
``from what you're telling me, it seems like there are some people
around here with axes to grind. What really upsets me is they don't
have the guts to come directly to me with their complaints. Why
they would go (to the media) instead of me is mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The mainstream media _ including this newspaper _ checked out
these allegations but has not advanced the story. The Dodgers,
meanwhile, announced Wednesday that they promoted Jerry Weinstein
from minor-league catching coordinator to director of player
development. He will oversee all aspects of the Dodgers'
minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   McDonnell compares Net sports reporting to what he had to go
through with radio in the '70s when he was one of the first to
cover a team on a full-time basis as a reporter. Media credentials
to events weren't easy to come by, and it was difficult to
establish credibility right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate that phrase that you've got to pay your dues, but
unless people know where the information is coming from, it's not
credible,'' said McDonnell, who has also had many Lakers
player-transactions on his site before the local newspapers, radio
and TV get wind of it. ``The bad reputation (of the Internet) is
from people who don't want to admit it's a force. People have a
fear of the truth sometimes, and I don't think a lot of the sports
journalists out there have the guts to go with the same
information. I'm not intimidated.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor will he slow down. McDonnell's site has increased traffic to
his site from about 1,200 visitors a day to about 6,000. He says
eventually he could see himself dedicated full-time to the site
(which will soon change its name to lasports2000.com). But without
a corporate backer such as ESPN.com has, McDonnell has managed only
to break even with his daily operation of the site, which includes
hiring a Web master.
</P>
<P>
   Since few individuals have figured out how to make their Web
sites financially viable without strong advertisements, it's
difficult to maintain the stature of a full-time reporter and gain
the recognition that comes with that.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't deter McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evolution of this will come much quicker than many
think,'' said McDonnell. &QL;

HOW BOARDS DEAL WITH LAZY DIRECTORS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Minn., Mass., Fla., Texas)  (af) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though their numbers have been under downward pressure in recent
years, they are still far from an endangered species: Deadwood
directors who occupy seats on corporate boards but rarely bother to
attend meetings or keep abreast of company matters.
</P>
<P>
   Because most companies lack any formal mechanism for regularly
culling and restocking their boards, corporate governance experts
say, even notoriously disengaged directors might hang on for years,
routinely renominated every proxy season simply because fellow
directors are loath to embarrass their own by dropping them from
the proxy ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, some companies have tried to keep their
boards fresh and involved, by adopting mandatory retirement ages or
imposing ``term limits'' of 10 or 15 years' maximum tenure. About
half the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 now have one rule
or the other, according to the Investor Responsibility Research
Center, a group that studies corporate governance.
</P>
<P>
   While they have had some effect, though, such measures have been
criticized as arbitrary and ill-aimed, removing the best directors
as well as the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``All too often, companies use term limits as a substitute for
thorough evaluations,'' said Donald S. Perkins, a former chairman
of Jewel Companies who has served on a number of corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the focus has shifted to another approach, familiar to
many a middle manager but still new in the clubby world of the
boardroom: Performance evaluations.
</P>
<P>
   Few companies have yet taken the idea as far as International
Multifoods in Wayzata, Minn. The company's three-pronged policy
calls for each of the company's eight directors to confidentially
evaluate the board as a whole, the other seven directors
individually, and themselves; the compiled evaluations are
considered by the company's nominating committee when directors'
three-year terms expire. Still, the effort by International
Multifoods seems to represent the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing two things,'' said Roger Raber, chief executive
of the National Association of Corporate Directors. ``Companies are
moving more toward board evaluations, as opposed to term limits.
And more are going toward a peer review process, in which board
members evaluate each other individually, instead of just
evaluating the board as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Promoting a healthy level of board turnover has taken on greater
urgency as more companies find themselves selecting younger
directors, often turning to candidates in their 40s, corporate
governance experts say. Against this background, many companies
cast a critical eye on mechanical solutions like term limits.
</P>
<P>
   Term limits are now used by only about 8 percent of for-profit
companies, but interest in director evaluations is growing,
according to a recent survey of Fortune 1000 company directors by
Korn/Ferry International, a executive search firm. One in five
respondents said their companies already evaluated directors
individually, but 73 percent said they should.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate governance experts are divided over board
evaluations. Some critics say they are often conducted in ways that
undermine their effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see some pretty funny schemes going on at boards, where the
evaluations are done as if to see who is the best-liked person in
the room,'' said Jay Lorsch, a business professor at Harvard
University who has served as a consultant to some 25 boards over
the last four years. The standard of conduct applied is often
``both homogenous and superficial,'' he said, adding that he thinks
better results are achieved by having an outside consultant write
the evaluations after interviewing directors.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts say that's fine in theory but problematic in
practice. ``The problem with the outsider model is that it's very
hard to find that outsider whom the entire board trusts,'' said
Phil Lochner, a former Securities and Exchange Commissioner who now
sits on a number of corporate boards.
</P>
<P>
   Lochner prefers term limits; he thinks evaluating individual
directors properly is difficult and can be unfair if the company
has no written performance standards for them, as most do not.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some companies are forging ahead. At International
Multifoods, Gary Costley, the chief executive, acknowledged that
getting peer review started at his company has been ``tricky''
because, he said, directors tend to have thin skins and large,
fragile egos.
</P>
<P>
   The board came around to the idea after Costley first submitted
to formal evaluation himself, and showed he was prepared to take
criticism. ``I don't think you can have an effective board
evaluation process unless you first have an effective CEO
evaluation process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some Multifoods directors have resigned, Costley said.
And, he added, a few prospects have shied away from joining the
board because of the evaluation system.
</P>
<P>
   The resistance doesn't surprise some experts, who think
evaluations will be a short-lived boardroom fad. ``People feel very
funny about offending the people they work with,'' said Charles
Elson, a law professor at Stetson University in St. Petersburg,
Fla. An oil and gas company on whose board he sits, Nuevo Energy in
Houston, recently considered and rejected an evaluation system.
``We thought term limits would be more effective over all,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard H. Koppes, a lawyer at Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue in
Sacramento, Calif., who specializes in governance issues, wonders
whether even perfectly frank evaluations can achieve much. Many
directors will remain unwilling or unable to shape up, he said, and
boards will probably opt to tough out their tenure rather than
confront them.
</P>
<P>
   An article by Koppes in Corporate Governance Advisor, a
professional journal, proposes an alternative for keeping boards
fresh: setting a maximum average tenure and replacing long-tenured
directors only when the board as a whole exceeds the maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Under his plan, boards with a healthy mix of new and old
directors would not lose valuable members to an arbitrary term
limit, but stale boards would get an objective signal to bring in
new blood.
</P>
<P>
   So far, governance experts have given Koppes high marks for
trying to make term limits less arbitrary. But many wonder whether
there might not be a simpler way for companies to freshen their
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nominating committees should do their job right and elect
people for two or three years and then reassess them,'' Lorsch
said. ``But I suspect that only 15 to 20 percent of companies do
this.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CONE'S INVISIBLE CLIFF  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When David Cone strode to the mound at Yankee Stadium
for the first inning last night, he knew there was an invisible
cliff there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I relish this opportunity; I've been in this position a lot,''
he had said, alluding to a 5-2 record in nine other post-season
starts since he joined the Yankees in 1995. ``But who knows what's
going to happen on down the line?''
</P>
<P>
   On down the line.
</P>
<P>
   For David Cone, that's a euphemism for the invisible cliff. For
what's going to happen when it's time for George Steinbrenner to
decide if an aging right-hander who will be 37 years old next
season should be pushed over the cliff of the Yankee payroll. If
the principal owner hasn't already decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year,'' Cone said last weekend in Texas, ``I can honestly
say that this may be my last chance to pitch in the playoffs for
the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Cone didn't mean just his chance to pitch last night's second
game of the American League Championship Series with the Boston Red
Sox, he meant for whenever the Yankees need him to pitch if they
get to the World Series for the third time in four years.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, the cliff that is invisible now might be all too
visible. To everybody, not just Cone.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone were elsewhere next season, he would be a victim of what
might be called the Curse of the Perfecto.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells pitched a perfect game against the Minnesota Twins
in 1998, then was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays for Roger
Clemens. Cone pitched a perfect game against the Montreal Expos on
July 18 and now he could be in his last days as a Yankee, but he
knows why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I let a big year get away from me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Cone's perfect game, his record was a snappy 10-4
with a 2.65 earned run average. Since then he was 2-5 with a 4.28
ERA; in his last five starts, he was 1-2 with a 6.00 ERA. Over all,
he was 12-9 with a 3.44 ERA. (second best in the AL behind Pedro
Martinez, the Red Sox ace).
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, but not what it might have been with a stronger finish.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough to keep the Yankees from slotting Cone as their
fourth starter in the division series with Texas. When the Yankees
swept, he was inserted as the Game 2 starter against the Red Sox
behind Orlando (El Duque) Hernandez, the Game 1 starter. He is also
expected to start Game 6 at the Stadium next Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' Cone said, ``that post-season is a whole
different animal, and I'm well rested.''
</P>
<P>
   His arm has been under the Yankee microscope ever since he had
surgery to remove an aneurysm in 1996. The next season tendinitis
in his right elbow put him on the disabled list. In 1998 he had a
20-7 record but needed extensive medical treatments to get through
the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The invisible cliff now in Cone's future, of course, is what
baseball free agency is all about now.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time a franchise stockpiled its best players with
one eye on the payroll. But now, no matter how successful a
franchise is, both eyes are on the payroll. All those multimillion
dollar contracts in free agency can be a double-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cone has earned in excess of $50 million over the last
decade with the Mets, the Blue Jays, the Royals, the Blue Jays
again and the Yankees, suddenly he might no longer be worth the $8
million he earned this season.
</P>
<P>
   At least Cone might no longer be worth $8 million to
Steinbrenner, who next season will need to ante up fresh millions
for Derek Jeter, Mariano Rivera, Andy Pettitte and Jorge Posada as
the Yankees' payroll soars higher than this season's record $85
million.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those millions for Jeter, Rivera, Pettitte and Posada
are likely to come from the millions that the principal owner
probably will not want to pay Cone.
</P>
<P>
   Just because Cone might not be worth $8 million to the Yankees
doesn't mean he won't be worth $8 million, if not more, to the Mets
or the Orioles next season. Remember how the Orioles jumped to sign
Jimmy Key when the Yankees decided his left arm wouldn't endure a
three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   But for David Cone, the Mets would be ideal: a return to the
other New York franchise for a year-round New Yorker with an upper
East Side apartment.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't take him any longer to get to Shea Stadium than it
does to get to Yankee Stadium for all those post-season games the
last five years.

 &HT;    Florida expecting Irene to make landfall as tropical storm
 &HT;    By A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hurricane Irene changed paths Thursday
as easily as a cross-country driver abandons the homogenous
interstate for a more aesthetic highway. But Irene's scenic route
now stands to traverse Palm Beach County and the Treasure Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Through most of the day Thursday _ while feeder bands of rain
doused much of South Florida _ Irene seemed to be headed north
across Cuba and into the eastern waters of the Gulf of Mexico. But
by early afternoon, the Category 1 hurricane had taken a jog to the
east as if lured by billboards advertising the glories of the
Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   Experts now expect Irene to head over the heart of the
peninsula, across Key West, the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee,
past Disney World and the Space Coast before sailing out to sea
over Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the ones in her path, Irene should grow tired as
the journey continues. Within about 12 hours of making Florida
landfall _which is expected today _ it should be a tropical storm,
said National Hurricane Center meteorologist Chris Robbins. That
means shredding winds will be few, but there's no protection from
the water.
</P>
<P>
   By noon Saturday, much of Palm Beach County stands to get 10 to
20 inches of rain _ falling with little respite in sustained
sheets, experts said _ on top of the more than 6 inches that
saturated some portions of the county Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The worst weather for South Florida and the Treasure Coast
should occur between midnight tonight and early Saturday evening,
meteorologists said. Total rainfall could be equal to the rain from
Hurricane Floyd that devastated parts of the Carolinas, Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``the soil is different down here so we can handle
the rain much better than North Carolina can. But when you're
talking 15 inches of rain, particularly in urban areas, you're
looking at a lot of water.''
</P>
<P>
   The precipitation won't end there, National Weather Service
meteorologist Jack Gross predicts, although there's no accurate way
to estimate how bad it will be after that.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency management officials planned to open hurricane
shelters to help those who need refuge from the storm.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, shelters at the South Florida Fairgrounds
could hold up to 800 people, said Assistant County Administrator
Vince Bonvento. The shelters are operated by the American Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   The county's traffic and road and bridge department also expects
a busy weekend dealing with flooding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already responding to some reports of localized
flooding,'' Bonvento said. ``That's our biggest concern right now,
and should be for the next four days.''
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday afternoon, the National Weather Service had issued a
flood watch, tropical storm warning and hurricane watch for Palm
Beach County. Irene was expected to cause local flooding in
low-lying neighborhoods, possibly as far north as Kissimmee, South
Florida Water Management District officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricanes draw energy from warm water _ and much of the
southern third of Florida is covered with the warm waters of the
Everglades and Lake Okeechobee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really matter how deep that water source is,''
Robbins said. ``It could be a foot of water but it's still a source
of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that Irene could intensify over South Florida, he
said, but the warmth will certainly keep the storm from dissipating
as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   That will likely worsen the drowning of the already waterlogged
</P>
<P>
   Everglades and Lake Okeechobee's marshes, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding also could hamper the $495 million restoration that
the district and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is carrying out
on the Kissimmee River, and is already affecting some farms in the
Glades, said Water Management District operations manager Tommy
Strowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades is waterlogged from years of unusually high
water, causing trees on its myriad, teardrop-shaped islands to wilt
while bobcats and deer seek refuge atop levees and boat ramps,
Strowd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain we're getting is going to make that situation much,
much worse,'' Strowd said.

A NUCLEAR SAFETY VALVE IS SHUT OFF, BUT U.S. MAINTAINS OTHER
SAFEGUARDS

   WASHINGTON _ The test ban treaty defeated in the Senate
Wednesday was a critical foreign policy objective of the Clinton
administration, but it was far from the only component of the
government's strategy to control the proliferation of nuclear arms
_ which embraces a menu of measures ranging from broad treaties to
tailor-made solutions like sanctions aimed at rogue countries.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, according to arms control experts, the Senate action was
unlikely to have immediate effects on Washington's efforts, for
example, to curb nuclear developments in such countries as North
Korea, Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no single solution to the problem of proliferation,
only multiple, complementary solutions, and the Senate has just
taken away one of the solutions,'' said Michael Krepon, president
of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a research institute that examines
arms control issues.
</P>
<P>
   Almost since the advent of nuclear weapons, Washington has
marshaled a variety of carrots and sticks in its efforts to combat
proliferation and restrict nuclear arsenals. These include arms
control agreements with individual nuclear powers like the old
Soviet Union; economic and political incentives to persuade
non-nuclear countries not to build the bomb, and the threat of
political and economic isolation against those who develop, test or
install nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech in July, the administration's senior arms control
official, John Holum, acting under secretary of state for arms
control, listed seven major elements in the administration's
policy, starting with the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty of the
1960s and the recent test ban treaty. He mentioned inducements to
North Korea that include $40 million a year in fuel from the United
States and the building of two power plants financed by South Korea
and Japan in exchange for a freeze by Pyongyang on its plutonium
production.
</P>
<P>
   He also mentioned sanctions, which in the 1990s have been
imposed by Washington as punishment for bad nuclear behavior or
lifted as a reward for improved conduct. Of sanctions, Holum
acknowledged that ``nobody likes them much.''
</P>
<P>
   And he cited more intrusive inspections of nuclear plants that
are being carried out by the International Atomic Energy Agency,
based in Vienna, as being important.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the administration is pushing forward on a
series of traditional arms control treaties with Russia. The Start
2 treaty, which calls for the reduction of the nuclear stockpiles
of the United States and Russia, has languished in the lower house
of the Russian Parliament since 1993 and looks highly unlikely to
be approved before legislative elections there in February. Linked
to the passage of the Start 2 treaty are negotiations on Start 3,
which would reduce arsenals from their peak in the Cold War by 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and President Boris Yeltsin of Russia agreed
in June to begin talks on Start 3, although administration
officials acknowledge that the cuts required by Start 3 would face
heavy opposition in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of the failure of nonproliferation measures
against nations such as Iraq and Iran, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott has started pushing another possible deal with
Moscow. That is a modification of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty
of 1972, a move that would allow Washington to build a limited
missile defense system as a shield against the weapons of emerging
nuclear states. ``We're looking at protection from a handful of
missiles from the nations that the Central Intelligence Agency sees
as having nuclear capacity a dozen years down the road,'' an
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a special panel led by former Defense Secretary
Donald Rumsfeld warned that North Korea and Iran could strike
American territory with ``little or no warning.'' A follow-up
report gave ominous scenarios of what potential enemies could do
against the United States over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the Russians view the modification
of the 1972 treaty as an effort to strip them of their last
vestiges as a superpower, making the success of the new discussions
fairly dim.
</P>
<P>
   The most unpredictable and perhaps toughest problems for
Washington, however, lie with what Holum called in his policy
address ``the hazards.'' He listed India and Pakistan, Iraq, Iran
and North Korea. Most of these have been addressed with a mixture
of what Krepon of the Stimson Center called individually tailored
``incentives and disincentives'' to stop them from developing
nuclear capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after India and Pakistan each tested nuclear weapons last
year, the Clinton administration imposed a series of economic
sanctions against the two countries and led the effort to curb
lending by international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as an incentive to get both to sign the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty, the sanctions were eased. India pledged to agree to the
treaty after the elections that were just held. Pakistan offered to
follow suit once India signed. Both these promises are now at risk.
</P>
<P>
   For Iraq, the medicine was largely economic sanctions and U.N.
inspections of suspected nuclear facilities. But Saddam Hussein has
refused to allow the inspectors back since last November's
airstrikes, and the sanctions appear to be crumbling.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. resolution under discussion offers Iraq the possibility
of easing sanctions in return for a new inspection regimen. Whether
it will be adopted by the Security Council remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has tried to deal with Iran by
placing sanctions on 10 Russian institutes suspected of helping
transfer missile and nuclear technology to Tehran. The sanctions
prevent the United States or private businesses from trading with
the institutes. But such sanctions, officials said, do not deal
with another, virtually untouchable problem: the flight of poorly
paid and neglected Russian nuclear scientists to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics on the Clinton administration's approach to North Korea
complain of a ``cycle of extortion'' by the Communist authorities.
Fear of North Korea's intentions intensified last year when it
fired a missile that could potentially land weapons on the United
States and when it threatened to repeat the exercise again this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton ordered the relaxing of a total trade
embargo, imposed in 1950, in exchange for a temporary halt to tests
of North Korea's long-range missiles.

   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Citing a continued rise in the number of
Americans without health coverage, Hillary Rodham Clinton called
for ``quality, affordable health insurance for everyone in the
country,'' saying Thursday it would be a mistake to abandon the
goal because of her failed effort to change the system six years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, in back-to-back speeches on health care, also
sharply criticized Medicare cuts that had been embraced by
President Clinton to balance the budget in 1997, saying they had
proved damaging to hospitals, particularly in New York. ``These
cuts went too far,'' Mrs. Clinton declared. ``They have caused too
much pain and are cutting into too much muscle and bone.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks by Mrs. Clinton, during a trip across the already
snow-dappled Adirondack region, offered the first glimpse into how
she intends to make health care a central subject of her expected
campaign for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   She delivered two 30-minute speeches on the subject Thursday,
expressing concern about ``the growing ranks of the uninsured'' and
what she described as the collapse of trust in the health care
system among patients, doctors, nurses and health care
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton strongly defended her effort in 1993 and 1994 to
persuade Congress to pass a universal health care system, and said
its failure would not discourage her from pursuing the issue again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud that we did try to help millions of people who
don't have insurance in this country,'' Mrs. Clinton told hospital
administrators meeting Thursday morning at a resort on Lake George.
``We were right to be concerned. But clearly we need a different
approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stop moving forward, you have two choices: You can
turn your back on a problem and do nothing and help no one, or you
can learn from the past and from your mistakes and try a better
way,'' she said. ``And that's what I think we still have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton did not dwell on the mistakes that led to the
collapse of her health care initiative but suggested they involved
the tactics of winning its approval and its ambitious scope, not
the actual goal of providing universal coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond setting the general goal of providing ``quality,
affordable health insurance for everyone,'' Mrs. Clinton did not
offer any details of how she would like to see that accomplished.
``I don't have a plan to unveil today,'' she said here, in a speech
to the New York State Nurses Association. ``That's going to take a
lot of time with a lot of people working together.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mrs. Clinton was more forthcoming in discussing
health care issues that are now being debated in Washington,
particularly the fallout of the Balanced Budget Act that Clinton
signed in 1997. That measure cut the growth of Medicare spending by
$115 billion over five years, an amount that was more than was
originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
   The cuts have drawn a storm of protest from hospital
administrators and health care union leaders, including Dennis
Rivera, the head of 1199 and one of Mrs. Clinton's most powerful
supporters. The president has also now said that the cuts were
deeper than intended, and the administration, along with
Republicans and Democrats in Congress, have offered a variety of
proposals to restore some of the money.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had joined a delegation of New York officials in
the White House in lobbying against the cuts, but Thursday was the
first time she had spoken out directly against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Congress must not recess until it has addressed this
problem,'' she said. ``This must be fixed. And it needs to be fixed
this year.'' Mrs. Clinton did not say which plan she preferred.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the first lady did not mention her likely Republican
opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. Nonetheless, her decision to
embrace health care as an early issue in her campaign reflects a
conclusion by her advisers that the topic plays to Mrs. Clinton's
strength, given her public identification with the topic, while
underscoring what they see as a weakness for the mayor, given his
identification in New York with efforts to cut health care
spending.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to draw one contrast with Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton
repeatedly returned to legislation being debated in Congress to
regulate health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate and House have produced different versions of the
bill; the House version would permit patients to sue HMOs. Mrs.
Clinton strongly supports that bill. Giuliani has said he supports
some aspects of it, but has so far declined to either endorse or
oppose the pending bills.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's remarks were laced with criticism of health
maintenance organizations, notwithstanding the fact that they had
been one of the pillars of her own original health care plan.
Thursday, she suggested that the rise of the organizations helped
to account for the decline in trust in the health care system that
she said has become widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's restore common sense,'' she said. ``Let's restore trust.
Let's restore the professional judgment and discretion of the
physicians, the caring of the nurse, as what really drives health
care.''

TREASURY AND FED REACH COMPROMISE ON BANKING OVERHAUL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After decades of bickering over control of the
nation's banking system, the Treasury Department and the Federal
Reserve announced on Thursday that they had reached an agreement,
resolving one of the last outstanding issues in the fight to
overhaul the nation's financial system.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, brokered in the early morning by Lawrence
Summers, Treasury secretary, and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Fed, was disclosed shortly before lawmakers met to reconcile the
few remaining differences between competing measures that had
already passed in the Senate and the House.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation still has privacy and lending provisions that
the White House says fail to adequately protect consumers and the
disadvantaged, but the compromise significantly increased the odds
of passage of a sweeping financial services bill that President
Clinton may ultimately agree to sign. The legislation would repeal
laws like the Glass-Steagall Act, fashioned by the banking crisis
of the 1930s, that had sharply limited the ability of banks,
securities firms and insurance companies from expanding into each
other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Treasury-Fed agreement puts us closer than ever before to
writing financial-services-modernization legislation,'' said Rep.
Jim Leach, R-Iowa, who is chairman of the conference committee.
``Let's finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists said the deal was certain to put pressure on the
lawmakers to change the legislation in a way that the president
would be able to sign it. Still, by Thursday evening, the measure
under discussion still had provisions, objectionable to the White
House, that watered down the Community Reinvestment Act. That act
requires banks to make loans to minorities, residents of inner
cities, farmers and others who have historically had trouble
getting credit.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said on Thursday night that the president
still intended to veto the legislation unless major changes were
made on the provisions in the Community Reinvestment Act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those provisions, there was broad optimism on Thursday
that Congress was nearing completion on legislation that would
significantly reshape the nation's financial services industry.
</P>
<P>
   For years, a central stumbling block to overhauling the system
has been an arcane regulatory turf fight between the Treasury
Department's Comptroller of the Currency, which supervises
nationally chartered banks, and the Fed, which oversees bank
holding companies. By allowing insurers, bankers and investment
bankers to enter each other's business, any new legislation would
have to prescribe a corporate structure for the new financial
conglomerates, and as such, would ultimately dictate which agency
had primacy.
</P>
<P>
   The debate traces its roots to the establishment of the Federal
Reserve in 1913, and the tension that followed between the Fed and
the executive branch over both of the banks and the carrying out of
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now has no practical significance for either consumers
or most banks. But it has been an enduring struggle between two of
Washington's power centers. The squabbling between a long line of
Treasury secretaries and Fed chairmen had inevitably stalled any
efforts at trying to eliminate the legislation adopted during the
Great Depression and later that has limited the cross-ownership of
banks, insurers and investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed wanted financial service conglomerates to keep their
banking, insurance and securities functions separate and under the
umbrella of a holding company. The Treasury proposed giving banking
companies the option of organizing financial service companies as
operating subsidiaries of the parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury maintained that it needed to play a big role in
bank oversight so that the executive branch could carry out
economic policy. But over the years officials at the Fed had two
replies.
</P>
<P>
   One was that the central bank would be unable to carry out
monetary policy without some control over a large portion of the
banks. Greenspan also maintained that financial conglomerates
should organize under a holding company so as to prevent the banks
from using certain government subsidies to their advantage as they
expand into new areas like investment banking and insurance. Those
subsidies include deposit insurance backed by the federal
government, access to credit through the discount window and a
Federal clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement brokered a few hours after midnight on Thursday
morning by Summers and Greenspan is as complex as you would expect
to get from the two economic engineers and Ph.D.'s.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that under the compromise, both
agencies would continue to play significant roles in overseeing the
nation's banks and emerging financial conglomerates. The deal
provides for operating subsidiaries of banks to underwrite
securities. After five years, a subsidiary could also engage in
merchant banking activities if jointly approved by the Federal
Reserve and the Treasury. Banks interested in insurance
underwriting and real estate development would have to set up
separate affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also imposes certain other financial safeguards
intended to protect the banking components of a financial
conglomerate because those units have insured deposits ultimately
backed by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement requires, for instance, that the aggregate asset
value of the financial subsidiaries of a bank not be greater than
80 percent of the bank's assets. And the equity capital in the
subsidiaries cannot be greater than 20 percent of the bank's equity
capital. Finally, the assets of all the financial subsidiaries of a
bank would not be able to exceed $50 billion.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES FEEL THE PAIN AND GO ON  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The glare was direct and distinct, Clint Eastwood in a
pinstriped baseball suit, though it was obviously unrehearsed.
After one question, Paul O'Neill had heard enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to feel it once in a while,'' he said, ``but the
story is Boston and New York. I'm getting tired of talking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't really have to. The sight of O'Neill earlier in the
night sliding on his back and turning over on his side told the
story about a fractured rib and a player who had talked his way
into Game 1 of the American League Championship Series Wednesday
night. O'Neill made the catch on Troy O'Leary's sinking,
sixth-inning liner in the Yankees' 4-3 victory, turned over on his
side, his rugged face a contorted mask.
</P>
<P>
   He picked himself up, stiffly and slowly. A stadium full of
Yankee fans let him know they appreciated the effort, felt his
pain. Later, both he and Derek Jeter made a point of saying we
shouldn't make too much of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wasn't going to play hard,'' Jeter rationalized, ``he
wouldn't have put himself in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the rare subject in sports that doesn't require too
much talk. We can see for ourselves that some athletes play when
their bodies say don't. Some athletes don't. Some make an attempt
when they're not feeling well and proceed to not run fast enough to
suit the critics. But those who make millions of dollars are never
more publicly hailed than when they drag their aching bodies across
the big-game landscape, and when they win.
</P>
<P>
   We have seen Paul O'Neill's sixth-inning grimace on other faces
and remembered them with a fondness unmatched. However long he
waited to test his bad back, Pedro Martinez pitched himself into
Red Sox lore in Cleveland Monday night. A wincing Kirk Gibson
struck the supreme World Series pose hitting his mind-bending home
run in 1988. Michael Jordan a couple of years ago, sick to his
stomach during the finals in Salt Lake City, was never more
unearthly and human at the same time. Pete Sampras serving an ace
in a U.S. Open match when he appeared more likely to faint was
never more appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, I remember reading in the newspaper that Mickey Mantle
had bled right through his uniform during the 1961 World Series. It
is an image, a young boy's sense of true heroism, that has endured
for 38 years and more than a few less flattering Mantle tales.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill didn't bleed, didn't hit a home run, didn't get the ball
out of the infield in five at-bats. Had the Yankees lost, one of
the post-game questions Joe Torre would surely have heard was why
he let O'Neill convince him he could play at all.
</P>
<P>
   Torre could have talked himself into a healthier outfield
situation, but he is loyal to the veterans who have helped him win
here and he also seems to sense that vulnerability has been and
remains a most appealing and effective staple of his Yankee teams.
They have a payroll escalating toward $100 million. They won more
overall games than any team in history last year. They are owned by
a man who considers failure to be everything but the ultimate goal.
Yet, the impression is that rooting for these Yankees is not like
rooting for U.S. Steel.
</P>
<P>
   You start with the manager, a cancer patient last spring, and
his 68-year-old bench coach, Don Zimmer, limping through the season
and bouncing up from the recent dugout shot he took to the ear. Go
through the lineup, and there is Scott Brosius dealing with the
trauma of burying his father, while Chuck Knoblauch's father
battles Alzheimer's and the second baseman struggles with his own
throwing dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte's father had open-heart surgery and the pitcher
feared he would be traded out of New York in the middle of the
summer. Roger Clemens was one confused future Hall of Famer for
much of the season. Monday night's designated hitter, Chili Davis,
is contemplating his last season after 19 in the major leagues.
Thursday night's designated hitter, Darryl Strawberry, took another
wrong turn in his life following his own cancer scare. Thursday
night's starting pitcher, David Cone, was trying to nurse his
well-worn right shoulder through one more post-season night.
</P>
<P>
   The franchise has had a long tradition of greatness mixed with
tragedy, but this Yankee team has carved its own niche for public
professionalism amid personal pain.
</P>
<P>
   So Paul O'Neill, without another word, picked up his glove again
Wednesday night and trotted out to right field for Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kid gives everything he's got out there,'' Red Sox
Manager Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Some kid, at the advanced baseball age of 36. But that's the way
he made people feel. &QL;

EVEN AGAINST ALL ODDS, THE METS STILL BELIEVE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon accompanied manager
Bobby Valentine on the field for Thursday's workout at Shea Stadium
and then made his way around the diamond, shaking hands and patting
backs in a conspicuous show of support for his team.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with the Mets down by 0-2 to the Atlanta Braves in
the National League Championship Series, the players probably wish
Wilpon had a tank or two he could lend them so they could try to
make some sort of dent in the Braves' machine that is threatening
to flatten the Mets. The Mets' charter flight from Atlanta got in
so early Thursday morning that Valentine slept in his office rather
than drive home to Connecticut. Valentine said he slept just fine,
but you have to wonder.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have lost 11 of 14 games against the Braves this
season, and it says something about how dire their predicament is.
Even with Games 3 and 4 and a potential Game 5 at home, the players
use the recent debacle that nearly short-circuited their run to the
playoffs _ the bleakest moment of the season _ as a reason to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last bit of the season will help us because we went
through a tough stretch and we were able to turn it around,'' John
Olerud said. ``We know we can persevere even when things don't look
good.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are some glaring differences between now and then,
then being three weeks ago. When the Mets had lost eight of nine _
including five to the Braves _ to nearly scuttle their playoff
chances, they had the opportunity to pull out of their offensive
tailspin and begin a five-game winning streak against the Pirates,
who were essentially sporting a Class AAA lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Mets will have to pull out of their slide and win four
of the next five games against a team they have not beaten twice in
a row all season and against an all-star pitching rotation that, in
eight face-to-face meetings over the last three weeks, has held the
heart of the Mets' lineup _ Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura _
to an astonishing 14 for 93 (.150) at the plate. Piazza admitted
Thursday that the Mets may be guilty of trying to get everything
back with one swing and thus overswinging, a symptom of pressing
that was also on display during the regular-season free fall.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, contrary to all rational thought, the Mets insist there
is hope. Wilpon gleefully recalled that the Mets were down by 0-2
to the Red Sox in the 1986 World Series before prevailing with a
few miraculous moments _ anyone remember Bill Buckner? _ that might
still make anything the Mets could pull off this weekend look
pedestrian. More recently, the Mets beat up on Greg Maddux and
Randy Johnson within the last two weeks and Arizona had beaten the
Mets seven of nine times in the regular season, but could manage
just one victory in the three-of-five-game division series.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you looked at it based on past performance, the
Diamondbacks should have won that series,'' Olerud said. ``The same
is true of this series. Based on past performance, the Braves
should win this series. It's not like we've gotten blown out. We've
played them well. It's discouraging to keep coming up just short.
Everybody believes we can get it turned around and we're that close
to beating these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in looking for the bright side as the losses to the
Braves keep piling up, it is this: With the exception of one 16-0
loss in July, no Mets' loss to the Braves was by more than six runs
and eight of the 11 losses were by three or fewer runs. And on
Friday night, the Mets have Al Leiter, who has pitched superbly in
four of the biggest and most pressure-packed games of the season: a
victory at Yankee Stadium to snap an eight-game losing streak the
day after three coaches were fired; the victory over Atlanta on
Sept. 29 to break the seven-game losing streak; the one-game
playoff victory over Cincinnati to clinch the wild card and,
finally, the victory over the Diamondbacks that sent the Mets to
the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every inning we've played we've had a chance,''
Valentine said of the Braves. ``I think things eventually even out.
Balls that hit the foul pole miss the foul pole. Against the
Diamondbacks we had the bases loaded and hit it over the fence and
it turned. We haven't had that turn in this series yet. It's not
like there's a defeatist attitude and we're up against an immovable
object. We've been pushing a long time and it's moving slowly. When
it starts moving, then sometimes it's an unstoppable motion.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Mets' clubhouse opened to reporters Thursday, Piazza
was slouched as comfortably on a sofa as if he were in his own
living room, watching a baseball highlight show that spent plenty
of time spotlighting the Mets' improbable and fairy-tale surge into
the postseason and then their destruction of Arizona. There was the
wild pitch that allowed Melvin Mora to score to beat Pittsburgh and
the domination of the Reds and Edgardo Alfonzo's grand slam and
Todd Pratt's home run.
</P>
<P>
   As various Mets arrived and hooted at their favorite moments, it
was a warm reminder that the Mets have been in much worse
predicaments before and, like a still-beloved New York team that
waited until next year season after season, they somehow prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take our team over their team every day,'' Piazza said of
the Braves. ``I think a lot of people would agree with me. I look
back to when the Dodgers finally beat the Yankees in 1955 after,
what, 10 times trying? People say that's no comparison _ there's
more money in the game now, the guys are different. The Braves are
that sort of monkey you have to get off your back.''

 &HT;    Why Ramsey slaying rivets America
 &HT;    By Jay Croft and Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More than 600 American children younger than 9 were
murdered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Only one is familiar to the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
   The slaying of JonBenet Ramsey was a rock-solid sensation from
the start and elevated the 6-year-old beauty to the realm of
iconic, one-name celebrities such as Cher or Madonna, Jackie or
Diana.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny-tot pageant winner found brutally murdered in her family's
mansion the day after Christmas. Millionaire businessman and former
beauty queen for parents. Perversely compelling videotape of the
perky little girl cavorting in makeup and costumes like a
20-year-old showgirl. A suggestion of sexual abuse. Police
suspicion clouding the parents. The couple's nationally televised
plea for help finding the killer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts were absolutely the stuff of which high drama is
made, and high tragedy,'' said Christopher Mueller, a law professor
at the University of Colorado in Boulder. ``It has all the
ingredients of a media story. It was destined to be just as big as
the O.J. Simpson case.''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, after the district attorney sent a grand jury home and
said no one has been charged in JonBenet's death, the mystery
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to know why,'' said Bruce Howell, 57, of
Raleigh, N.C., among the audience watching the taping of a CNN show
on the subject Thursday in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants justice,'' said his friend Faye Perry, 50, of
Zebulon, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, as he considers appointing a special
prosecutor to investigate, recognizes the magnitude of this mystery
_ as a criminal case and a national story. ``It has all the makings
of a mystery,'' Owens said. ``And I just wish it was fiction, but
it's true.''
</P>
<P>
   Even friends of John and Patsy Ramsey _ who now live in Atlanta,
where JonBenet was born and buried _ understand what makes the
horrible event enduring news, piquing reporters from the tabloids
as well as The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone (from the national media) who wasn't there (in Boulder
this week) would be a fool,'' said Barbara Sanders, 56, of Sun
Lake, Ariz., who became close to Patsy Ramsey when they shared the
trauma of ovarian cancer. Standing across from more than 100
reporters and a cluster of TV satellite trucks Thursday, Phil
Robertson expressed his disgust that the case remains such a draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absurd,'' said the 65-year-old Boulder resident.
``I wonder how many journalists are over in Pakistan. That's a real
story.''
</P>
<P>
   But as many Americans remained gripped by the bizarre chain of
events and speculation, with countless Internet postings and Web
sites as evidence of the near-obsession with the case, the
possibility of an indictment was clearly big news.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dimensions that have fueled the story for so long are
questions about the competence of police and prosecutors, said Bob
Steele of the Poynter Institute, a national center for media
studies in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Journalism has an obligation to report that meaningfully and
fairly,'' he said. ``You will find cases of children who die at
home, and a good number of them are unsolved. There is that kind of
continuing interest in that by the public. We should not be ashamed
to have an interest in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ermini of the the National Center for Missing and Exploited
Children agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that as exploitation, but I can see where interest
is generated,'' Ermini said. ``I'm not disturbed by (the focus on
this case) at all. It's important that the general public knows
that these types of incidents occur.''
</P>
<P>
   National reporters in Boulder said the TV-friendly nature of
JonBenet's videotaped life gave the story impact. The video images
of the girl dancing and singing, dolled up for the various
competitions she entered during her brief life, stayed in our
minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came into everybody's home,'' said the Chicago Tribune's
Maurice Possley. ``Now, even if you're in Chicago, people follow
this case, and there was a feeling that if there was any
resolution, we should be here.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN field producer Betty Anderson, who also worked the O.J.
Simpson trial, said, ``When you mix all that together, the prurient
interest is what draws the American audience, and nobody wants to
admit it.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times' Michael Janofsky added race to the litany.
``Mainstream media tends to put a minority face on crime,'' he
said. ``But when the face of crime is white, we always seem to be
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   People magazine writer Vickie Bane said the story was catapulted
to national prominence only after the Ramseys gave an interview to
CNN on Jan. 1, 1997, a week after their daughter was found
strangled in the basement of their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Ramseys helped create, early on, some of their own
media,'' Bane said. ``They might have spoken to the police first''
if they wanted to keep a lower profile.
</P>
<P>
   In death, JonBenet found fame ``bigger than her mother ever
dreamed,'' Bane said. ``It's very sad when you consider that this
little child has been on the cover of People magazine four times.
Can you imagine the celebrities who would covet that?
</P>
<P>
   ``And what we've lost in all of this is that she was just a
little girl. I think in all this, she has become a character, and
she was a real, live, breathing little girl who's not here
anymore.''

FOR BABBITT, A WEARYING EXONERATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Wis.)  (th) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By the standards of some recent independent counsel
investigations, the 19-month inquiry of Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt was relatively quick, leak-free and legally painless _
ending as it did with the prosecutor's announcement on Wednesday
that no charges would be brought against Babbitt or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel, Carol Elder Bruce, said in an interview
Thursday that she had handled the case like the dozens of
corruption cases she handled as a federal prosecutor for the U.S.
attorney's office in the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated it as I believe the Justice Department would handle
any significant corruption case,'' she said. ``The guiding rule of
the office was that we were focusing on the events and the
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   While her approach might seem swift when measured against that
of other independent counsels, for Babbitt the road to exoneration
was long and rocky. And, to his supporters, exoneration came only
after an investigation that never would have even reached a grand
jury _ before which Babbitt testified for two days _ if it had not
been for the independent counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   That law died unceremoniously in June after two decades of
controversial inquiries involving high-ranking officials from both
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Bruce's announcement that she had uncovered
insufficient evidence to warrant charges against Babbitt in his
handling of an Indian gambling project, the secretary has not
commented on the decision except for a brief statement from his
office expressing ``gratitude'' but not surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and associates said Thursday, however, that Babbitt, a
former two-term Arizona governor who began his tenure at the
Interior Department as one of the most accomplished members of the
Cabinet, had been wearied and wounded by the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, Babbitt's case seemed to raise the question of
whether he was a victim of a phenomenon that he described in an
interview last month as the ``permanent culture of the
criminalization of political differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce's inquiry centered on the question of whether Babbitt
committed perjury in congressional testimony in 1997 about an
Interior Department decision to reject an application by three
Indian tribes that wanted to operate a gambling casino in Hudson,
Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The perjury issues were coupled with allegations of possible
political influence-buying, in large measure because several tribes
that opposed the gambling permit, and benefited from the Interior
Department's denial of it, later contributed $230,000 to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Before deciding that those allegations were unsupported by the
evidence, Ms. Bruce and her staff interviewed 450 witnesses and
examined more than 630,000 pages of documents. Investigators also
evaluated issues like the relationship between the Interior
Department and the White House and how the Democratic Party sought
soft-money contributions for party-building purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce would not discuss the details of the Babbitt case, or
her views of the evidence, or even whether her appointment was
necessary. Despite Babbitt's discomfort, however, her handling of
the case contrasted sharply with the seemingly endless inquiries by
some other independent counsels.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at last count, Ms. Bruce, who was appointed in
March 1998, had spent only $3.9 million as of last March 31,
according to most recent figures compiled by the Congressional
Research Service. That is much less than some other independent
prosecutors have spent while investigating other Clinton Cabinet
officers with mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Smaltz, who was appointed in March 1994, had spent $21
million by March 31 in an inquiry into the activities of former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, the research service said. That
inquiry ended last December with the acquittal of Espy on
corruption charges.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Barrett, who was appointed in May 1995, spent $10
million in his inquiry into former Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros. The investigation ended last month when Cisneros pleaded
guilty to a single misdemeanor of lying to federal agents about the
extent of payments to a former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Ms. Bruce's focus was built in by the narrow charter
for her inquiry that was drafted by the Justice Department.
Republican critics complained that Attorney General Janet Reno had
kept the focus narrow to prevent Ms. Bruce from turning her case
into a wider investigation of campaign finance issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bruce said Thursday that her charter from the Justice
Department allowed her to adequately investigate the Babbitt case.
``From our perspective, if we felt it was necessary to get a
broader mandate to get to the bottom of our case we would have
sought that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Sept. 8 with Diane Rehm, whose program is
broadcast on public radio stations around the country, Babbitt said
that, in light of his experience, he now advised students that ``if
you're going to be in a high-profile position, the first thing
you'd better do is have some lawyer's insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary added: ``The worst moments were when I got hauled
up before a Senate investigating committee, then a House
investigating committee, then the Justice Department, then the FBI,
then a special prosecutor. And there's kind of a lynch mob
mentality in the press, to be frank. There wasn't any kind of a
presumption of innocence; it was a presumption of guilt. But the
system ultimately does work. The justice system does work. But it
wasn't pleasant.''

BASEBALL COLUMN: METS' BIG THREE ARE SCARY PUSHOVERS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe no one should be surprised that John Olerud,
Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura are not hitting Atlanta Braves
pitchers in the National League Championship Series. The men who
make up the middle of the New York Mets' lineup did not hit the
Braves' pitchers during the season, either.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud, Piazza and Ventura have a grand total of 1 hit in 21
times at bat as the Mets have lost the first two games in the NL
series, which resumes with Game 3 Friday night at Shea Stadium.
That embarrassing achievement has reduced their collective 1999
batting average against the Braves to .173 from .194. They hit .309
against everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   As an indication of their paucity of productivity, they have a
slugging percentage of .220 against the Braves. Against the rest of
the league? It's .541.
</P>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that the Mets have lost 11 of the 14 games the
teams have played this year? Is there any reason to think the
outcome of the next two games, or more, if the Braves need more,
will be any different? Can the Mets win without the middle of their
lineup hitting?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think for long,'' Piazza said. ``We've done it before.
You just have to completely minimize your mistakes and we haven't
been doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes like the manager's admittedly leaving his starting
pitcher in the game a batter or two too long, batters' bunting when
they are not supposed to be bunting, pinch-hitters' being used or
not used at questionable times. A few hits from the middle third of
the batting order could negate such mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to try to sugarcoat it,'' Piazza said Thursday
after working on his problems in batting practice. ``We're just not
swinging the bat well. There's nothing else you can say. Maybe it's
poor pitch selection, maybe some mechanical flaws, which we've been
working on today.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who missed the last two games of the division series
with a stiff, swollen left thumb, has no hits in seven times at bat
in this series. Three times he batted with runners on base, twice
with runners in scoring position. In losses by scores of 4-2 and
4-3, a hit here or there could have made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can turn it around,'' the catcher said. ``A
couple key hits. We've been getting guys in scoring position. We
just haven't been able to push them across. They've been getting
timely hitting from everybody on that ball club. When you have guys
on first and third and nobody out, you have to push a run across.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has failed to hit in six at-bats while Olerud has a
single in eight at-bats. His single moved a runner to third, from
where he scored on a Piazza groundout, but Olerud failed to hit
with three other runners in scoring position. Collectively, the
three have one hit in nine at-bats with runners on base and one in
seven with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura suffered a strained right shoulder when he was picked
off at second base in a division series game, but he said the
shoulder was not affecting his hitting. What is? ``Poor swings,''
he said. ``Give credit to their pitching,'' the third baseman
added. ``You'd like to have better swings, but sometimes that's the
result of good pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said of his pitchers: ``We're hitting
good spots and they're pitching their game, that's all. No magic.''
</P>
<P>
   Olerud said he thought he had had some good at-bats in spite of
appearances. ``I just haven't gotten hits on them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who did not hit well in his previous two postseason
series with Los Angeles, said he believed he was aware of what his
recent problems have been and worked on them Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's bad mechanics that creates bad swings which
doesn't translate into base hits,'' he said. ``I think I've been
pulling off the ball. That's the first sign that you don't trust
yourself. I'm trying to cover both sides of the plate. I've been
thinking about too many pitches. Instead of just picking out a
pitch out overthe plate where I know I can get it and put a good
swing on it, I'm thinking pitch away, pitch down, pitch in, pitch
up. I've always been a zone hitter. If a pitch is in my zone, it
doesn't matter what it is; I know I can hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza related a story he heard about Sparky Anderson making out
his lineup for a game in the 1984 World Series. ``A friend
suggested he should put this guy in because he was due,'' Piazza
said. ``Sparky said, `The World Series is for people who are doing,
not for people who are due.''' Piazza paused for a moment, then
said: ``I believe eventually I'm going to be doing. But for now I'm
due, as are a few guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The test of the trio's timeliness will come Friday night when
they face Tom Glavine, the left-hander in the Braves' rotation. In
their careers, they all have hit Glavine better than they have the
other Braves starters: Piazza .372, Olerud .364, Ventura .333.
Piazza, in fact, hit a two-run home run against Glavine three weeks
ago, and eighth-inning singles by Piazza and Ventura knocked him
out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   But Olerud cautioned that past performance does not guarantee
anything. ``I think Glavine can be a real tough pitcher and is a
tough pitcher,'' the first baseman said. ``I don't think the past
has a whole lot to do with this game tomorrow. It's a new game. We
have to take advantage of the at-bats we have.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Exultant cries of ``We're No. 2'' and ``I'm No. 3''
rang out on Wall Street Thursday as hundreds of people who would
never be confused with competitive athletes learned that they had
been deemed ``all-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Institutional Investor magazine published the results of its
annual popularity contest for stock analysts, instantly inducing
daydreams about even bigger bonuses among those who made the list
and grumbles from those left off it. In the research departments of
securities firms, no other event creates as much tension as the
release of the ``I.I. rankings'' for one simple reason: money.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Kentucky Derby of the analysts' year, and just as in
the Derby, you can cash in if you win, place or show.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market, an I.I. ranking will vault an analyst into the
million-plus category,'' said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice
president at G.Z. Stephens, a Wall Street recruiting firm. ``If his
incumbent employer doesn't pay him at least $1 million, someone
else will come along and snatch him away for that amount.''
</P>
<P>
   For each of the last 28 years, Institutional Investor has polled
managers of mutual funds and pension funds to find out which
analysts they considered the best at their jobs. Then, in its
November issue, the magazine publishes its All-America Research
Team, a ranking of the top three analysts and some runners-up in
each industry sector and a tally of the totals for each firm.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. claimed the most spots on the
list, with 56, its fifth year on top. Merrill nosed out a
hard-charging Salomon Smith Barney, which had 55 spots on the list,
up from 46 and fourth place in 1998. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP;
Co. and Goldman Sachs Group, which tied for second place last year,
wound up third and fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poll's importance has definitely increased in the last
three to five years,'' said Kevin McCaffrey, director of United
States equity research at Salomon Smith Barney, part of Citigroup.
``That's because corporate America is paying executives more in
stock and stock-related incentives, and they are more interested in
what the top analysts have to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people in the stock research business say they think
entirely too much weight has been placed on the poll, leading
analysts and their firms to resort to tricks to improve their
standings.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have been caught cheating, filling out ballots for
themselves. Others have been caught in tugs-of-war over their
allegiances.
</P>
<P>
   For example, consider what happened to Alex Cena last year.
Cena, an analyst of wireless-phone companies, left Bear Stearns to
join Salomon Smith Barney last summer, several weeks before
Institutional Investor published its 1998 survey.
</P>
<P>
   But Bear Stearns tried to claim credit for Cena's No. 1 ranking
anyway, contending that he left the firm after the magazine's
cutoff for publication, according to people who were involved in
the dispute. To settle the issue, Cena produced a dated receipt for
the movement of his belongings from Bear Stearns' office to
Salomon's, these people said, and the magazine credited Cena to his
new employer.
</P>
<P>
   The big role the poll plays has not gone unnoticed outside the
industry. The Wall Street Journal has been compiling its own
ranking of analysts for several years, measuring them by the
accuracy of their picks.
</P>
<P>
   Now another competitor looms: TheStreet.com, the online
information site. In the summer, it hired away Laurie Meisler, who
had long overseen Institutional Investor's poll. Ms. Meisler, who
has lured some of her former co-workers from the magazine, plans to
start publishing competing rankings early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The research director at one investment bank, weary of the
emotions the annual publication of the poll arouses, said, ``We
need another poll like we need a hole in the head.''

 &HT;    Authorities say they won't give up on Ramsey case
 &HT;    By Craig Schneider
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Boulder District Attorney Alex Hunter vowed to
continue investigating the JonBenet murder case Thursday, and noted
that the girl's parents have not been removed from investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to quit on this case,'' said Hunter during an
afternoon news conference. He added that John and Patsy Ramsey
``have not been eliminated from the investigation ... They're not
excluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Boulder Police Chief Mark Beckner acknowledged that John and
Patsy Ramsey remained under the ``umbrella of suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The status of this investigation has not changed so
significantly as to change that characterization,'' Beckner said.
</P>
<P>
   The remark infuriated John Ramsey's brother, Jeff Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely ridiculous,'' said Jeff Ramsey, who
lives in metro Atlanta. ``John and Patsy Ramsey have been
investigated for three years. What's it going to take to get
Boulder authorities to see they are barking up the wrong tree?''
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, who is mulling the
appointment of a special prosecutor, does so. ``That would be fine,
if he helps us solve this crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Owens, who got only a mild show of support from Hunter, expects
to decide in a week or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to second-guess the governor,'' he said. ``We are
interested in the pursuit of truth. If he can assist in that, we
won't stand in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, speaking to 100 reporters gathered at the Boulder
Justice Center, said Thursday he has an ``aching heart'' regarding
the lack of an indictment, but that he felt no sense of failure.
``We find no reason to give up heart,'' said Hunter. ``We may never
get there, but we're not going to stop trying.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckner took a more subdued tone on the future of the
investigation, stressing that while the case will remain an open,
ongoing probe, ``There's not all that much to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Police will probably not be working on the case daily, he said,
and the ``Ramsey Room,'' established for the case, probably will be
assigned to another use.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hunter nor Beckner would say whether the grand jury of
12 Boulder residents ever voted on any indictments, or whether they
had written a report on its findings.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Hunter announced only that the grand jury had
completed its work, adding, ``Yet I must report to you that I and
my prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient
evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has
been investigated at the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was convened 13 months ago when the investigation
became bogged down in disputes between the police and district
attorney's office. At Thursday's 40-minute news conference, Hunter
referred to those kinds of problems, saying, ``We're all human
beings, and I've certainly made mistakes in this case. We've had
some people in this case who got off track, lost objectivity, and
forgot that their charge is to follow the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet, a 6-year-old star of child beauty pageants, was found
beaten and strangled the day after Christmas in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Her father said he discovered the body in the basement of the
family's Boulder home in the afternoon, about seven hours after his
wife said she found a ransom note demanding $118,000 for the girl's
safe return.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner discounted critics who say the case was ruined when
police allowed John Ramsey to search the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that mistakes have made this an unsolvable case is not
accurate,'' the police chief said. ``Circumstances and evidence
that raise questions for us today are not the result of a
contaminated crime scene. Yes there are things we should have done
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the grand jury process helped police advance the
case. ``But all the pieces have to come together, and we do not
have a puzzle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Beckner would not say whether he thought the evidence
warranted any indictments.
</P>
<P>
   While the two law enforcement figures insist the case will
continue, William Pizzi, a Colorado University law professor and
former federal prosecutor, said a grand jury coming up empty-handed
most often spells the death knell on a case. ``Sure the case will
remain open, but I don't expect much to come forward,'' he said.
``After all, what else could they have. This is the end of the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the two officials' comments Thursday, Christopher
Mueller, also a Colorado University law professor, commented:
``It's very hard for a public official to say they are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his news conference, Beckner was asked by a
reporter whether the case required new evidence to be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got some, we'll certainly take it,'' responded the
police chief.

JONBENET RAMSEY'S PARENTS ARE STILL SUSPECTS, PROSECUTORS SAY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to delete repeated words in 7th and 8th grafs)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Prosecutors who failed to win a grand jury
indictment on Wednesday in the killing of JonBenet Ramsey said
Thursday that the girl's parents are still suspects in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have not been eliminated from the investigation,''
Alexander M. Hunter, the Boulder City and County district attorney
said, referring to John and Patsy Ramsey, who found their
6-year-old daughter strangled and beaten in the basement of theirr home almost three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter made his assertion during an afternoon news conference,
where he and fellow prosecutors stressed that efforts to learn who
killed JonBenet would now be returned to the Boulder Police
Department. The department's initial investigation, which drew
widespread criticism for actions in the hours after the girl's body
was discovered, ended on Sept. 13, 1998, when the grand jury began
hearing evidence in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury was dismissed on Wednesday after the prosecution
team determined that it did not have sufficient evidence to bring
the case to trial. Hunter described the grand jury as ``a phase of
a continuum'' in the investigation and said that with persuasive
new evidence, he would consider convening another panel.
</P>
<P>
   As Hunter announced he was turning over the case to the police,
Gov. Bill Owens of Colorado said at a news conference in Denver
that he was appointing a team of seven legal experts, including the
state attorney general, Ken Salazar, to consider whether he should
appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the case. That would
take the investigation out of the hands of the Boulder police.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice demands that we evaluate every legal opinion that
might help us determine who killed JonBenet Ramsey,'' Owens said.
``This advisory team will help me decide if appointing a special
prosecutor will further the interests of justice in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The advisers are expected to conclude their work this month.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a seven-term Democrat, said he did not want to ``second
guess'' Owens, a Republican elected last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything that might make it more difficult
for him to make an objective determination,'' Hunter said. ``We are
interested in the pursuit of the truth of this case. If he can
assist in that, I don't think any of us would stand in his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the prosecutors who joined him at the news conference,
Hunter looked somber. He described feeling an ``aching heart'' for
their inability to present enough evidence for an indictment and
their unanimous decision not to charge anyone in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he declined to answer many questions that would have shed
light on the status of the case, including details about the grand
jury's work over the last 13 months, the reason prosecutors did not
call the Ramseys to testify before the panel or any steps the
Boulder police probably will take in future efforts to identify a
killer.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did he offer any opinion about the quality of work by the
Boulder police detectives, inasmuch as local investigators did not
secure the crime scene for many hours after Ramsey found the body
of his daughter in the basement of his house.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before reporters after Hunter, Chief Mark Beckner, of
the Boulder Police Department, mounted a strong defense of his
department and its work throughout the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been made out of alleged mistakes early in this
case,'' Beckner said. ``Yes, there are things we should have done
differently. Any time a crime scene is disturbed, it creates
problems for the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However,'' he added, ``to say that mistakes have made this an
unsolvable case is not accurate. Circumstances and evidence that
raise questions for us today are not the result of a contaminated
crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   In promising that the authorities would press ahead with the
investigation, Hunter tried to build public confidence by reminding
reporters several times that prosecutors sometimes wait 10 years or
more to develop enough evidence for an indictment and arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really do believe we need to follow the evidence and go
where it takes us,'' he said, without elaborating. ``The evidence
in this case gives us a belief that it deserves our best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said investigators were working on ``a broad spectrum of
leads,'' including forensic evidence, Hunter and Beckner said,
which could lead them back to JonBenet's parents, who remain the
only suspects that Hunter and other prosecutors ever have
identified in the case. The Ramseys have steadfastly professed
their innocence and on Wednesday, after the grand jury was
dismissed, said: ``We take no satisfaction in this result because a
child killer remains free and undetected. Somebody out there ought
to be pretty scared tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys did not respond immediately Thursday to Hunter's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case, Beckner added, `'is not dead in the water.''

 RICHARD B. SHULL, 70, STAGE AND SCREEN ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard B. Shull, an actor whose Walter Matthau-like
face was familiar from television and film and who was portraying
D.W. DeWitt in the current Broadway production of ``Epic
Proportions,'' died Thursday in Manhattan at the age of 70. His
wife, Deborah Thomas Shull, said the cause was a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Shull was perhaps best known for his television performances as
Alex Holmes on ``Holmes and Yoyo,'' Lieutenant Gillis on ``Hart to
Hart,'' Jack Towne on ``Lou Grant'' and Diana Rigg's co-star on her
show ``Diana.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Epic Proportions,'' a comedy that opened Sept. 30 to mixed
reviews, marked Shull's third play under the director Jerry Zaks.
The others were ``The Marriage of Bette and Boo'' at the Joseph
Papp Public Theater, for which he received an Obie Award in 1985,
and ``The Front Page'' at Lincoln Center Theater in 1986. A
spokesman for ``Epic Proportions,'' Bill Coyle, said Shull's role
will be filled by his understudy, Larry Cahn, until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   In his review of ``The Front Page'' in The New York Times, Frank
Rich _ who once described Shull as ``that amusing character actor
who looks like a bloated fish'' _ singled out the performer for
praise. ``Richard B. Shull, forever wincing as if life were one
long embarrassing encounter with a whoopee cushion, plays the
incompetent sheriff `Pinky' as the exact kind of backroom `moron'
that he's called _ moronic enough to permit a jailbreak but not so
stupid that he neglects to hire his relatives at city expense for
the search party,'' Rich wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Shull portrayed Dr. Migraine in Bill Irwin's ``A
Flea in Her Ear'' at the Roundabout Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The actor also appeared in ``Minnie's Boys'' in 1970; ``Goodtime
Charley,'' for which he received a Tony award nomination in 1975;
``Oh, Brother!'' in 1981; ``Ain't Broadway Grand'' in 1993 and
``Victor/Victoria'' in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   He has been described as the bright spot in films like ``Private
Parts,'' ``Housesitter'' and ``Splash.'' He also appears in the
upcoming independent feature ``Two Family House.''
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing ``Unfaithfully Yours'' for The New York Times in
1984, Vincent Canby said Shull ``would be completely at home in an
authentic Sturges comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Shull's marriages to Margaret Ann Haddy and Peggy J. Barringer
ended in divorce. His third wife, Marilyn S. Swartz, died in 1997.
Besides his wife, there are no survivors. &QL;

 &HT;    Bad-call fallout: Umps must work as `a team'
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Umpire Rick Reed's midnight confession early Thursday
that he blew a critical call in Game 1 raised two questions. First,
why aren't all umpires similarly frank in the face of a blown call?
And how often is Reed going to hear about it from Red Sox fans
Saturday in Boston, when he calls the plate in Game 3?
</P>
<P>
   Jimy Williams had another question: Why didn't Reed ask for help
on what might have been the most critical play of the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the umpires) are a team,'' said the Boston manager.
``They work together. I don't know a lot about umpiring but I do
know the closer you are to a play, the tougher it is to see
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Reed who called Boston's Jose Offerman out at second base
in the top of the 10th when it was clear both before and after the
replay that New York second baseman Chuck Knoblauch dropped Scott
Brosius' throw. Instead of two men on and no out, the Red Sox had
one out with a man on first, which changed quickly on a double-play
ball by Brian Daubach.
</P>
<P>
   Late after the game, Reed said, ``I thought he had possession
before he dropped the ball. After we went in and looked at the
tape, we decided that wasn't the case. As an umpire, it was my job
to get it right. I didn't. You feel bad about it. I feel awful.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Williams gave a five-minute address on the issue,
blaming his own ``brain lapse'' for not asking Reed to check with
his fellow umpires on the call. During the League Divisional
Series, Williams watched Cleveland's Travis Fryman awarded a
disputed home run in the second inning of Game 5 after the crew
conferred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not mad and I'm not saying we would have scored,''
Williams said. ``But when I think about what (ump) Jimmy Joyce told
me in Cleveland, `We just want to get it right,' whether it's in a
playoff game or the 85th game of the season, it shouldn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was some kind of process,'' New York manager Joe
Torre said, ``that would allow the umpires to help each other in a
lot of different plays, I have no objection to that. I've seen that
in a lot of instances.''
</P>
<P>
   Just not in Wednesday night's game. And before anyone started
talking about instant replay, Williams said this: ``I think the
human element is beautiful. Maybe the game is a lot like life, so
why put something like (replay) in there?''
</P>
<P>
   MINDING MARIANO
</P>
<P>
   Torre doesn't like to use closer Mariano Rivera on a two-inning
basis as he did in Game 1, but the Yankees have been able to twice
this postseason, thanks to the stretched playoff schedule that
features off-days three times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think once he realized that he didn't have to strike people
out,'' Torre said, ``and (pitching coach) Mel (Stottlemyre) worked
with him on the different type of fastballs he throws, he has been
a lot easier to go to consistently because he doesn't use many
pitches. To me, 22 or 23 (Wednesday) for two innings was pretty
damn good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, I never got out there thinking two innings but with an
off-day (Friday) and what happened in the Division Series with the
every-other-day scenario, it's easier to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivera went into Game 2 with five scoreless postseason innings,
which, when added to the last 28 regular season appearances, ran
his scoreless streak to 35 2/3 innings without allowing a run. His
career postseason ERA dropped further to 0.45, the lowest by anyone
with a minimum of 30 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ETC.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had precautionary X-rays taken of his left instep
after being struck by a foul ball while hitting in the ninth in
Game 1. X-rays were negative. ... Red Sox health report: Pedro
Martinez has reported no stiffness after pitching Monday and is on
schedule to start Saturday. Reliever Rich Garces was not available
Thursday due to a muscle discomfort under his right arm pit. ...
Brosius finished one double shy Wednesday night of becoming the
first place to hit for the cycle in the postseason. He led off the
ninth needing to double off Boston's Derek Lowe and struck out ...
One of the most unlikely Red Sox fans is rooting for Boston. ``I'm
pulling for the Red Sox,'' Babe Ruth's daughter, Julia Ruth
Stevens, 82, said from her winter home in Sun City, Ariz. ``It's
the end of the century, and I think it is high time (they won).''

NEW YORK'S NEMESIS, ROCKER, HAS SOME NICE THINGS TO SAY ABOUT THE
METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few of the Atlanta Braves players were already
scattered around the field at Shea Stadium for Thursday night's
workout when one player rushed out of the tunnel and onto the
field. The jersey was familiar, the number 49 on the back with
Rocker emblazoned above the number. But the Fu Manchu on the face
did not match.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko, the Braves hard-hitting left fielder, had swapped
jerseys with reliever John Rocker, a move that was funny Thursday
night, but might be a little risky Friday when the Mets and Braves
take the field for Game 3 of the National League Championship
Series. With the Mets limping back home facing a 2-0 deficit in the
four-of-seven-game series, Rocker has provided more fire for the
fans than the play of the hometown team has.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I wouldn't do it tomorrow,'' Klesko said. ``I told
him if I survived for a few minutes, it would be safer for him to
come out. Do they check for guns and ammunition here?
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I'd go out there for him to see how it was. I'm
actually protecting our save guy. We've got a couple of first
basemen. It was just to have some fun, stay loose. I just think
going out and having fun, there is so much pressure anyway, keeping
these guys loose is the main thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who has engaged in a back-and-forth dialogue that has
made him a target, not only of the fans, but also of Mets Manager
Bobby Valentine, was not so lighthearted about the debate. He has
been an object of scorn by the fans, particularly in the three-game
series at Shea during the final week of the regular season. But he
has managed to overcome it by dominating the New York batters.
</P>
<P>
   When reporters surrounded his locker after the workout, Rocker
did not want to continue any of the commentary on New York fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we get started, if you don't have any constructive
questions about the series, which is the only important thing, then
I've got nothing to say,'' he said. ``I'll talk about the series
and that's it. I know a good many out there think I'm just kidding,
and they'll ask me some questions about the fans anyway. If you do,
I'll cuss you out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to defuse the situation. I think it's funny.
This is the first time the Mets have made the playoffs in 11 years
and all you care about is comments we say about the fans. I don't
know, it seems to me there's a bigger story there, two very good
teams on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rocker did stick to his word throughout most of the
interview, expressing respect for a Mets team that he believes is
not out of this series yet, and he even had kind words for hitters
like Mets third baseman Robin Ventura, whom Rocker has struck out
the five times he has faced him. He did manage to stick in a dig at
the fans he knows will be waiting to boo him if he gets the call
from the bullpen on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the same situation it was last time when I got
booed and then I struck out the side on 14 pitches,'' he said. ``I
find it more fun, more enjoyable for myself, to pitch in front of a
hostile crowd that's jeering me as opposed to one that's cheering
me. I get a lot more fired up when the situation is like that. It's
just the kind of personality I've got.''
</P>
<P>
   With the emotional reliever expected to serve as a lightning rod
for the Mets fans, the rest of the Braves were actually excited
about the prospect of playing in front of a sold-out stadium that
they expected to be loud, for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be wild and crazy,'' said Chipper Jones, who is
probably second only to Rocker in the hearts and minds of the fans.
``It was wild and crazy up here the last week of the season and it
wasn't even the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to hear things we haven't heard before and hopefully
the guys will wear their earplugs and concentrate on the game,'' he
said. ``It can act as a motivational factor. I think most of the
guys are going to tune it out as much as they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is going to get booed before I do when they call the
players out, so hopefully they'll get all booed out by the time
they get to me. Somehow I doubt that though.'' &QL;

FIRST AMERICAN TO PAY $25 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY D. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In the largest penalty of its kind to date,
California's biggest title insurance company will pay $2.5 million
to settle charges it made illegal kickbacks to real estate agents,
State Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Ana-based First American Title Co. will pay $1.25 million
in fines and penalties and $1.25 million to fund a consumer
awareness program.
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious violations occurred in the company's Los
Angeles office, which was not allowed to take any new orders on
Monday as part of the penalty. It still was able to service
existing orders and customers.
</P>
<P>
   That office also will be forced to halt its marketing activities
for five business days at a later date, the state said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   First American, with revenues of about $2.06 billion nationally,
has 125 offices throughout the state and a 22 percent market share.
In Los Angeles County, the company has a main office in Glendale
and three other customer service offices.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators determined that First American solicited
business from real estate agents by providing a variety of
inducements, including trips to Las Vegas, ski trips to Utah and
tickets to concerts and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The state maintains consumers were harmed because real estate
agents are supposed to find the best possible price for a title
search, not one offering them a kickback.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for title services in California vary from company to
company and are filed with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement saying it was taking the matter
seriously and has been implementing programs to ensure the
questionable marketing practices outlined by the insurance
department do not reoccur.
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth and by far the largest penalty levied upon a
title company since the state began an aggressive policing of the
industry in 1996. Earlier this year, Chicago Title Co. was fined
$235,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the egregious inducements,'' insurance
department spokeswoman Dana Spurrier said of the harsh penalty.
``It's almost as if they were flagrant and were hoping to get
caught, because they certainly did hide it once our investigators
started looking.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the marketing ban a death sentence for the company's
Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will they lose customers, they will probably lose
some of their staff,'' Spurrier said. ``We're sending a very strong
message to the title insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Etta Bandy, First American spokesman, said she would not
speculate on how the marketing ban would hurt the company and noted
existing orders could still be serviced during the five-day
blackout.

YANKEES AND METS ARE IN, AND THAT BRINGS OUT THE POLAR PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I am in conflict, too.
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't choosing between the Yankees and the Mets be as
easy as choosing between the Beatles and the Stones, Apple and IBM,
Lancaster and York, Good and Evil? It's just brand equity. Two ball
teams.
</P>
<P>
   But no. Ever since Dr. Margaret Mead and the sports pundits who
also considered themselves anthropologists proclaimed the Yankees
and the Mets rival tribes, their fans have been made to define
themselves by the choice. When it merely leads to bar fights over
who would win a Subway Series, there is no harm done. But when
cultural, class and economic divisions are perpetuated, we have
trouble here on River Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The anthro pop quizzes drive me nuts. Do you like opera? You're
a Yankees fan. Do you shop at Kmart? You're a Mets fan. And this is
supposed to be whether your seat is behind the dugout or behind the
right fielder. Do you call them drapes or curtains, a couch or a
sofa? From that answer, someone will be able to tell you that the
rich man you admire is either Fred Wilpon or George Steinbrenner.
Do you perceive cancer or mental illness as the frontier of health
care discussion? From that answer we know you identify with either
Joe Torre (recovering from prostate treatment) or Bobby Valentine
(reveling in mood swings). This is sick.
</P>
<P>
   And the lunch-pail versus humidor construct, polyester versus
linen, Figaro versus Count Almaviva, is basically lame. The Mets of
the '80s personified the stinking cigars of Wall Street, while
Yankee Stadium has for years been overrun with low-rent slobs.
</P>
<P>
   And not only is this lame, it also leads to the easy, dangerous
thinking that there are only two kinds of people in the world, and
the twain will never meet or merge or morph. Yea and behold, we
call these polar people, Yankees or Mets.
</P>
<P>
   So where does that leave me? I love them both. Differently.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in the Bronx, as were my father and mother, and so my
diapers were pinstripes (chalk stripes, actually, but that just
leads us back to drapes and couches). My father wasn't impressed by
Joe DiMaggio because he had grown up with the Babe.
</P>
<P>
   During my childhood in Queens, there were three major league
teams and no regional pressure. I always felt that Giant fans were
arrogant front-runners and Dodger fans were sweatily righteous, but
I did not make my choice based on rooting for the equivalent of
U.S. Steel. I always thought the Yankees were the true
outsider-immigrant-striver team. They were the best because of
merit, not because swells trooped up to the Polo Grounds or poets
found Elysium in Ebbets Field.
</P>
<P>
   And then I met the Mets on my first important out-of-town
assignment. I brought my glove to their opening spring training in
1962, which was also the first time I tried to hit major league
pitching _ actually, it was a sore-armed coach throwing batting
practice. For me, it might as well have been Whitey Ford. I have
never lost respect.
</P>
<P>
   That day, I just went to the bar and let Mets manager Casey
Stengel talk and drink me under the table. He had also been manager
of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, three of the most interesting New York ballplayers of
my times have been both Mets and the Yankees. David Cone as a young
wise guy was one of those rich, victorious, out-of-control '80s
Mets. He was accused of flashing in the bullpen. He was an outlaw
hero of the tell-all tomes. Perfect David Cone is now an elder
statesman of the Yankees locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry, brought up before his time by the greedy
Mets, never quite fulfilled his promise (Mets' management billed
him as ``the next DiMaggio'') but he enjoyed and destroyed himself
in the garden of earthly delights. Who resurrected him? The Boss.
</P>
<P>
   And Marvelous Marv Throneberry, promoted as the quintessential
Met when the team was lionized as the worst in baseball (it was the
rebirth of irony), had come up as a Yankees bonus baby. He roamed
the outfield with the Mick, pinch-hit in the 1958 World Series.
Years later, he said: ``I kind of think of myself as a former
Yankee, not a Met. A man is always sentimental about his first
team.''
</P>
<P>
   So, you see my problem and I see yours.
</P>
<P>
   Let's leave it at this: There are only two kinds of people in
the world; those who duck foul balls and those who stand up to
catch them.

 &HT;    Chipper Jones struggling in field, at plate
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chipper Jones is on the defensive and it has nothing
to do with Mets fans. It's his bad case of the bobbles.
</P>
<P>
   He had a late-inning error in each of the first two games of the
NLCS to put men on base in the worst of times. He has three errors
in six postseason games. When he failed to field what looked to be
a simple grounder to third by Melvin Mora in the eighth, the Mets
drew to within one run 4-3 after Edgardo Alfonzo doubled Mora in.
It took heroics by John Rocker and John Smoltz to save the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky to make only one error in the first game,'' said
Jones, who had a rough time getting a grip on several balls his
way, including one on a double-play chance that cost Greg Maddux a
run. ``(Wednesday's) could have really cost us the game. I want to
prepare myself so it doesn't happen tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Hence, Thursday afternoon's digging in the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took, as he described it, more groundballs during the
Braves' workout at Shea Stadium than he's taken in three years,
trying to get himself back on track defensively before Game 3
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of inconsistent hops, little bit of bad play
on my part,'' Jones said. ``Fielding is as much a feel thing as
hitting and when you don't feel comfortable out there, you get
yourself in trouble. ... Hopefully I'll get some better hops and
have better concentration.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as his hitting is concerned, Jones has struggled to find
a balance between how to be patient and still not miss the
occasional good pitch to hit he sees. It would seem to get even
harder with a pack of angry Mets fans ready to make his weekend
long. But hitting coach Don Baylor thinks Jones is in the perfect
setting to break out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes the arena here,'' Baylor said. ``Over there in
Yankeee Stadium, he was as locked in as I've ever seen him, even
more so than the Mets series (in Atlanta).''
</P>
<P>
   Jones was 3-for-9 in three games at Yankee Stadium with a
double, a homer, two runs scored, six walks and zero strikeouts.
That set him off on his way to a second half that made him the best
candidate for the National League MVP.
</P>
<P>
   MORE TALK
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing about Rocker's comments after the Braves' win in
Game 2, when he said ``To hell with New York fans, they're stupid
anyway. We beat them 20 out of 26 times and they still say we
(stink),'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said this:
</P>
<P>
   ``How many Mets fans has he met? That's kind of interesting. I
don't know (if it will come back to haunt him). He's another one
with really good ability. When you can throw 96 and throw it where
you want it and have a hook like he has, I guess it's easy to make
any comment you want to make.''
</P>
<P>
   LINEUP WATCH
</P>
<P>
   Mets left fielder Rickey Henderson, who left Game 2 with
light-headedness, was feeling well enough on Thursday to take
batting practice and had Valentine predicting he'd be OK for
tonight's game.
</P>
<P>
   That may be good news for the Braves after Henderson's
replacement, Mora, homered, reached on an error and scored two
runs. Henderson, meanwhile, is 0-for-6 in the first two games.
PRICE OF FAME
</P>
<P>
   After he hit the first of two NLCS home runs in the Braves' 4-2
win in Game 1 on Tuesday night, Eddie Perez was asked to do an
interview with ESPN on the field a while after the game.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he finished, the Braves clubhouse doors had been
locked and Perez couldn't get back in. He called his friend and the
Braves usual catcher in the limelight, Javy Lopez, on his cell
phone to see if he could let him back in the Braves' clubhouse, and
Lopez was on his way home, laughing at Perez's predicament.
Eventually, Perez called Braves security and they let him back in
the clubhouse.

BOEING BEATS FORECASTS FOR 3RD CONSECUTIVE QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also DAIMLERCHRYSLER) 
(mk) 
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing its financial rebound, Boeing Co. beat Wall Street
earnings estimates for the third consecutive quarter Thursday and
promised more good news to come.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, the world's largest aerospace company and the nation's
single largest exporter, said its third-quarter profit grew 37
percent as its formerly ailing passenger-jet business improved its
efficiency. Net income for the quarter was $477 million, or 52
cents a diluted share, compared with profit of $347 million, or 36
cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 4
percent, to $13.28 billion from $12.72 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn 49 cents a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial. Shares of Boeing soared
$3.125 Thursday, to $43.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some decent productivity in the quarter,'' said
Howard Rubel, an aerospace and military industry analyst at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's stock was battered last year in the wake of production
problems at its flagship commercial airplane division in late 1997,
which forced the company to halt production of its 747 and 737
jetliners for a month. Boeing has continued to suffer because it
sold many of its jets to airlines at steep discounts while its
costs soared.
</P>
<P>
   The company has since tried to streamline factory production, a
process that appears to be bearing fruit. At the passenger jet
division, quarterly profit was $501 million on sales of $8.5
billion, in contrast to a loss of $142 million on revenue of $7.8
billion in the quarter a year earlier. Operating profit rose to 5.9
percent from a negative 1.8 percent in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crisis last year, Boeing warned that
production of the 747 jumbo jet, which is the company's most
profitable airplane, might fall to one a month because of the
economic crisis in Asia. But the company announced Thursday what
analysts and investors had assumed for months: 747 production will
remain at two a month next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strengthening Asian economy looks like it will give us a
smooth landing,'' Philip Condit, Boeing's chairman and chief
executive, said Thursday during a conference call with analysts. He
also predicted that demand for Boeing's passenger jets would remain
flat in 2001 rather than decline from next year's projected level,
as the company had previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing raised its forecast for its full-year operating profit
margins to a range of 5.5 percent to 6 percent this year from its
prediction of 4.5 percent in January. Next year's profit margins
are expected to be 5.5 percent to 6.5 percent, Boeing said, up from
a forecast of 3.5 percent to 5 percent earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Deborah Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said the
company hoped to do better than that next year, even though
Boeing's revenue is expected to decline by $11 billion as
deliveries of passenger jets decline to 480 from 620. ``Our
challenge is to attempt to have 2000 earnings be equal or exceed
1999,'' she said. ``That would require us to get to operating
margins of about 7 percent for the total company.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worried that Boeing might be cutting too much.
Research and development spending was down for the third
consecutive quarter. It has fallen 28 percent in the first nine
months of this year, to $1 billion from $1.4 billion in 1998. But
Ms. Hopkins said the decline was temporary and that Boeing had
earmarked enough research money to finance new planes, including a
larger version of the 747.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Boeing generated $1.1 billion in cash during the latest
quarter after spending $1 billion buying 2.25 million shares of its
own stock. It now has $2.8 billion in cash on its balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said that he was not worried by recent gains by Airbus
Industrie, the European consortium, which has received orders for
329 jets this year, compared with 138 for Boeing, according to
Merrill Lynch. Confirming a report that Frontier Airlines was the
latest airline to choose Airbus' narrow-body planes over Boeing's
737, Condit said that Boeing could not match the low price offered
by Airbus and still make a profit.

GM REPORTS TURNAROUND ON EARNINGS IN THIRD QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Demand for pickup trucks, sport utility vehicles and
minivans helped the General Motors Corp. earn $877 million in the
third quarter, a significant turnaround from a $309 million loss in
the period a year eariler.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was caused by an expensive strike in the summer of
1998. Excluding the impact of the strike, GM's net income rose 34
percent in the third quarter compared with the period a year
earlier, on revenue of $42.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   All figures have been adjusted to reflect GM's spinoff in May of
its giant auto-parts division, Delphi Automotive Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   While GM has operations around the world, the largest share of
its profits came from its home market, where buyers have been
trading in their cars for hefty trucks that carry high profit
margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly one of the big contributors here in North America
would be full-sized trucks,'' J. Michael Losh, GM's chief financial
officer, said in an interview. ``We've been running at high rates
of production and sales all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said GM had earned high profits because
buyers were snapping up record numbers of new models from all auto
makers. ``It was good,'' said David B. Healy, an auto analyst at
Burnham Securities, of GM's third quarter. ``But it was all due to
volume increases for the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter profit of $1.33 a diluted share, contrasting
to a loss of 52 cents a share in the period a year earlier, was on
the high end of the range of analysts' estimates. The consensus
among analysts was that GM would earn $1.24 a share, with some
expecting earnings as low as $1.15 a share and some expecting
profits as high as $1.35 a share, according to First Call, a
Boston-based investment research firm. GM shares fell 12.5 cents
Thursday, to $65.
</P>
<P>
   The company surprised analysts by piling up even more cash than
expected during the quarter. GM ended the quarter with $16.7
billion in its rainy-day fund, even after it spent $386 million
between July 1 and Wednesday buying back its stock. The company has
now bought back 63 percent of the $4 billion in stock it promised
to buy back in March 1998. Since January 1997, GM has bought back
stock worth $7.5 billion, or about 15.6 percent of its outstanding
shares.
</P>
<P>
   GM's North American automotive sales business contributed $671
million to the company's profits this quarter. Its financing and
insurance arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corp., came in
stronger than expected, adding $393 million, up from $313 million
in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
   GM's European automotive business contributed $32 million, and
together, those three units offset losses elsewhere for the
company. ``The overall results show the strength of operating as
one globally integrated company,'' said John F. Smith Jr., GM's
chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   While the third-quarter automotive net margin was 1.7 percent
companywide, it was 2.3 percent in North America, still short of
the company's 5 percent goal. GM's third-quarter market share in
the United States was 28.9 percent, well up from the 24.1 percent
during the period a year earlier, when GM sales plunged because of
a strike that shuttered nearly all the company's factories for two
months. The market share remains well below the 31.7 percent GM
held just two years ago, in the third quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Even those sales are coming at a price, as GM, like most of its
competitors, offers generous rebates, discounted leases and other
incentives that crimp profits. In the third quarter, those
incentives averaged about $1,610 a vehicle, down from the $1,732 in
the third quarter last year but well up from the $992 average in
the third quarter of 1997 and more than double the $764 average in
the third quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A strike last year at two auto-parts factories cost GM $965
million after taxes in the third quarter, or $1.48 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The Hughes Electronics division lost $30 million in the third
quarter, in contrast to a $43 million profit a year earlier. The
losses came as revenue increased to $2 billion from $1.5 billion,
primarily because of the growing number of subscribers to its
DirecTV unit. While GM owns Hughes, it is traded as a separate
tracking stock. GM is evaluating whether to sell or spin off the
unit.
</P>
<P>
   GM was the first auto maker to report third-quarter results.
Other auto makers are expected to announce strong third-quarter
profits later this month. The Ford Motor Co. is scheduled to
announce its results on Monday, and the consensus among analysts is
that it will earn 85 cents a share, up from 80 cents in the third
quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler is scheduled to announce its results during the
last week of October, and analysts are expecting earnings of $1.25
a share. The company was formed in November when Daimler-Benz of
Germany bought the Chrysler Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Ford increased its dividend by 9 percent. Ford's
fourth-quarter dividend will rise 4 cents, to 50 cents a share.

USC'S ORGERON GETS HIS POINT ACROSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Each Monday, millions of wrestling fans watch
``The Rock'' strut before a television camera, and sooner or later,
yell his trademark slogan: ``Know your role, and shut the hell
up.''
</P>
<P>
   If USC assistant football coach Ed Orgeron could get residuals
from that comment, he might not need to work anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Rock, aka Rocky Maivia, is really Dwayne Johnson, a former
University of Miami defensive lineman coached by Orgeron before
becoming a famous wrestler. And somewhere along the line, Johnson
borrowed Orgeron's coaching mantra.
</P>
<P>
   It's the most-visible example of the influence Orgeron has on
players. On the practice field, his loud comments, intense nature
and hard-driving manner are impossible to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   An outsider might think he's crazy, listening to him yell during
practice. Free safety David Gibson remembers the first time he saw
Orgeron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was completely nuts,'' Gibson said. ``I didn't
know his background. I thought, `I'm going to have to deal with
this guy?' You can't ignore him if you had earplugs.''
</P>
<P>
   But first impressions of Orgeron are usually far from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the heart of the defense,'' Gibson said. ``He wants to
win more than we do. He's an old-school type of coach. He's
positive. He's not negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron's coaching tactics are hard to dispute. He has molded
USC's defensive line into the most impressive unit on the team, and
done it with only one certain NFL prospect _ defensive tackle Ennis
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron has developed a group of linemen that were somewhat of a
mystery and turned them into consistent playmakers. Defensive
linemen Ryan Nielsen, Matt Childers, Lonnie Ford and Shamsud-Din
Abdul-Shaheed are all exceeding expectations this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want them to feel like pro material. I want them to feel
like national champions,'' Orgeron said. ``When they walk out of
the tunnel, I want them to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why his players perform. They might fear
Orgeron in a first meeting, but are quickly won over and fiercely
loyal. He's the most popular assistant on the coaching staff
because of his fairness with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no favoritism. Everybody is equal,'' defensive end
Ford said. ``He talks to Ennis just like he talks to
third-stringers. You know your role every week. He just flat out
tells you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats us like men. If you have something to talk about,
you can come up to his office. I respect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron said his coaching style comes primarily from working at
Miami under former coach Jimmy Johnson. He stayed with the
Hurricanes when Dennis Erickson was hired and coached star linemen
Cortez Kennedy, Russell Maryland and Warren Sapp.
</P>
<P>
   One of Orgeron's favorite pictures hanging in his house shows
him standing on the sideline during a game against Florida State.
It's a fourth-and-1 situation, and Orgeron has Sapp standing behind
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine having a line like that, with Warren Sapp on
the sideline?'' Orgeron said.
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing coaching ascent for Orgeron. He was young and
successful and his future was limitless at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the fast track at 29. We were winning national
championships,'' Orgeron said. ``We went two years without losing a
game. We went five years without losing a home game. You get a
false sense of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   It all changed in 1992. According to police records, Orgeron was
arrested after a fight in a Baton Rouge, La., bar in which he
head-butted the bar manager. He was charged with second-degree
battery _ a felony _ and police said he was ``highly intoxicated''
when he was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron was also charged with failure to leave the premises and
misrepresentation during booking. The charges were eventually
dropped at the request of the bar manager.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Orgeron resigned from Miami and took a year off from
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I had a major setback,'' Orgeron said. ``That's been
seven years ago, and I'm still very cautious in everything I do.
I've slowed down. My priorities have changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron made the slow climb back into coaching, with one year at
Nicholls State in Louisiana before being hired at Syracuse in 1995.
He came to USC when coach Paul Hackett hired him in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   His personal life has also changed dramatically since Miami.
Three years ago, Orgeron went on a blind date while Syracuse was
playing in the Liberty Bowl. Two months later, he was married.
</P>
<P>
   ``I normally don't go on blind dates, but when I met Ed, it was
all over,'' Kelly Orgeron said. ``It was one of those, `Oh oh. He's
the one.' Everybody was shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Orgeron was as surprised as everyone else the first time
she saw her husband's aggressive coaching style, but she also saw
the side unknown to casual observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me how he acts at home or after a game,''
she said. ``Curiosity gets the best of them. He is very
intimidating to most people, but once they get to know him, he's a
big Teddy Bear. Once he comes home, he's Mr. Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Orgeron's lifestyle has changed so much that most of his spare
time is spent around his 7-year-old stepson, Tyler, and 19-month
twin sons, Parker and Cody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I met Kelly, I was set to stay single and coach,''
Orgeron said. ``It's nice to have a home and not carouse. Very
rarely do I go out. I'm home changing diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't lost his intensity when football is concerned. He
dismantled a chair last year before the Stanford game to prove a
point to his linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always riled up with somebody, but he says everybody gets
in fights with their brothers and sisters,'' defensive tackle
Bernard Riley said. ``We're a family. He's there to protect us.''

FIRST AMERICAN TO PAY $2.5 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the largest penalty of its kind to date,
California's biggest title insurance company will pay $2.5 million
to settle charges it made illegal kickbacks to real estate agents,
State Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Ana-based First American Title Co. will pay $1.25 million
in fines and penalties and $1.25 million to fund a consumer
awareness program.
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious violations occurred in the company's Los
Angeles office, which was not allowed to take any new orders on
Monday as part of the penalty. It still was able to service
existing orders and customers.
</P>
<P>
   That office also will be forced to halt its marketing activities
for five business days at a later date, the state said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   First American, with revenues of about $2.06 billion nationally,
has 125 office throughout the state and a 22 percent market share.
In Los Angeles County, the company has a main office in Glendale
and three other customer service offices.
</P>
<P>
   State investigators determined that First American solicited
business from real estate agents by providing a variety of
inducements, including trips to Las Vegas, ski trips to Utah and
tickets to concerts and sporting events.
</P>
<P>
   The state maintains consumers were harmed because real estate
agents are supposed to find the best possible price for a title
search, not one offering them a kickback.
</P>
<P>
   Rates for title services in California vary from company to
company and are filed with the state.
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement saying it was taking the matter
seriously and has been implementing programs to ensure the
questionable marketing practices outlined by the insurance
department do not reoccur.
</P>
<P>
   This is the eighth and by far the largest penalty levied upon a
title company since the state began an aggressive policing of the
industry in 1996. Earlier this year, Chicago Title Co. was fined
$235,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's because of the egregious inducements,'' insurance
department spokeswoman Dana Spurrier said of the harsh penalty.
``It's almost as if they were flagrant and were hoping to get
caught, because they certainly did hide it once our investigators
started looking.''
</P>
<P>
   She called the marketing ban a death sentence for the company's
Los Angeles office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only will they lose customers, they will probably lose
some of their staff,'' Spurrier said. ``We're sending a very strong
message to the title insurance industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Jo Etta Bandy, First American spokesman, said she would not
speculate on how the marketing ban would hurt the company and noted
existing orders could still be serviced during the five-day
blackout.

SUN MICROSYSTEMS SAYS PROFIT ROSE AND OUTLOOK IS STRONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sun Microsystems Inc. reported earnings for its
first fiscal quarter that exceeded analysts' estimates by a couple
of cents, as the maker of work stations and servers continued to
gain market share. Revenues were well above estimates as well, and
Sun executives predicted more strong growth for this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Sun reported its results after the close of the market. Its
shares had closed at $89.40625, up 0.03125 cent.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 15, Sun reported earnings of $271.1
million, or 33 cents a diluted share, more than twice the $113.9
million, or 14 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 25 percent, to $3.12 billion from $2.49 billion in
the first quarter of fiscal 1999. First-quarter 2000 earnings
reflected a charge of $3.5 million incurred in the acquisition of
Star Division Corp. and a related increase of $1.3 million to Sun's
income tax provision.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Sun to earn 31 cents a share, according to
First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sun executives said the company's success came at the expense of
its traditional competitors, particularly Hewlett-Packard Co.,
which warned earlier this month that its fourth-quarter revenue
growth would fall at the low end of estimates, primarily because of
slow sales of its Unix servers. They said Sun had also taken market
share from IBM and had benefited from the delayed delivery of
Microsoft Corp.'s Windows 2000 operating system, the successor to
Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really seems like we're distancing ourselves from the
pack,'' Michael E. Lehman, Sun's vice president for corporate
resources and chief financial officer, said in a telephone
interview. ``HP's out there forecasting a low-ball number, while
our results are almost blown away.'' For the December quarter,
``we've got a strong backlog, and people should probably think
about revenue growth in the low 20s,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the quarter, Sun acquired Star Division and certain
assets and liabilities of Star Division Software-Entwicklung und
Vertriebs GmbH, a German producer of office productivity
applications that compete directly with Microsoft's offerings but
run on Sun's Solaris operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McNeely, Sun's chairman and chief executive, said in a
conference call with analysts that more than one million people had
downloaded these applications from Sun's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of being NT road kill, Solaris has widened the gap,''
McNeely said. ``The one thing NT had that we didn't have was a
wonderful productivity suite. Now, with Star Office, people are
saying, `Why do I need the NT thing?''' he said.

PATRIOTS, NFL WARN: NO NEW ROAD, NO STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEG VAILLANCOURT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots, the National Football League,
and Boston business leaders warned Thursday that without a new
access road, the team's proposed $250 million stadium in Foxborough
will not be built.
</P>
<P>
   While the Patriots and NFL officials insisted they were not
issuing an ultimatium, they said that an access road that would
make it easier for luxury suite patrons to leave the stadium is
crucial to marketing and financing the project. A vote by
Foxborough residents on a proposed zoning change to allow
construction of the access road may come as early as next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to draw a line in the sand, but we need to clear
up a misperception that we can somehow build the stadium without
this access road,'' said Andrew Wasynczuk, the Patriots' chief
operating officer. ``That's just not the case. Without this road,
the new stadium project cannot and will not go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials went even further, noting that the league's
precedent-setting agreement to help finance the new Foxboro Stadium
played a key role in keeping the team from moving to Hartford,
where Connecticut had promised the Patriots a publicly financed
stadium package worth more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NFL's financing is contingent upon the access road,'' NFL
executive vice president Roger Goodell said in a telephone
interview. ``When we reached an agreement with the state and town
officials on a new stadium last spring, everyone agreed it included
a new access road. For the project to move forward, we need all the
parties to live up to their commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Foxborough, a small group of residents whose homes abut
the proposed access route off North Street said they think the
Patriots are bluffing. And with a town vote on the project expected
next month, the opponents are pressing their neighbors to reject
the access road.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can just build a stadium without the road, or build
another road somewhere else,'' said Karen Lovejoy, a North Street
resident. ``It's not do-or-die.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic consultants for the Patriots and supporters of the plan
including the town's three selectmen, an independant town
consultant and state highway officials point to studies suggesting
that the access road would actually improve traffic for Foxborough
residents.
</P>
<P>
   North Street is now open to general stadium traffic on game
days, but the access road would be restricted to less than
one-third of premium seat holders and Foxborough residents. As a
result, the team argues, most North Street residents would see a
clear improvement in game day traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some residents are not convinced. ``I don't belive they
will make it better for me,'' said Pam Boudreau, another North
Street resident. ``I don't see why luxury seat holders can't just
wait another 15 minutes to preserve my neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But ensuring easy access is a crucial element in the team's
marketing strategy as it continues to hawk luxury suites to
Boston's corporate community.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the access road, you might as well put out a tombstone
over the whole deal,'' warned Boston attorney Paul Kirk, who led
the effort to keep the Patriots in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Access has always been a key element, not just for the guy
with a cigar and big Cadillac, but for the average fan and
Foxborough residents,'' said Boston advertising executive Jack
Connors. ``You can't suddenly separate one element of the
package.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Robert Kraft pulled out of the Hartford deal in late
April, when it became clear Connecticut couldn't deliver on its
promises and after the NFL and local business leaders brokered a
last-minute deal with Governor Paul Cellucci, Senate President
Thomas Birmingham and House Speaker Thomas Finneran to provide $70
million in infrastructure assistance for a new Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In return, NFL officials, anxious to retain the television
revenues from the much larger Boston media market, agreed to
contribute to the financing for a stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Legislature requires construction of an
access road for the new stadium. However, to build the road,
Foxborough must first change the town's zoning code, a move that
requires a two-thirds vote at a town meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Keenly aware of the signs around town opposing the access road,
team officials have stressed that under a proposed agreement, the
town would receive a significant increase in stadium revenues _
from $1.1 million to $1.8 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The new 68,000-seat stadium would have roughly 80 luxury suites,
costing between $150,000 to $300,000 for a package of 12 to 36
seats. In addition, there would be 6,000 club seats. While about
half the luxury seats have been sold, the remaining seats will be
marketed after the town gives the project final approval, team
officials said. The Patriots hope to play their first game in the
new stadium in 2001.

 &HT;    N.Y. trash talk its only fire left
 &HT;    By Steve Hummer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There is little suspense left for the field of play.
The New York Mets can't hang. Couldn't a month ago; can't now. They
need to be swept away, taking the Bobby Valentine dugout pantomime
with them.
</P>
<P>
   So, we turn to the seats for our entertainment. While the Braves
are busy transforming Flushing from proper noun to verb, we can be
amused by the clever antics of the New York fans. They're so cute
when aroused; almost human.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to hear things we've never heard before,'' said one
of the Shea Stadium favorites, the Braves third baseman, Chipper
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Really? Never before? These are ballplayers, not monks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I wish you could sit in the dugout and hear it,'' Jones
said. ``Sometimes clever. Sometimes offensive. Most any comment has
a lot of those magical four-letter words.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Atlanta fans are fair-weather, then these people are the
storm. They enjoy being the angry red on the Doppler radar of
sports. Either way, the attitude in the stands will make no
difference in the final result. Just that the louder the voice, the
sweeter the moment when it is silenced.
</P>
<P>
   The stage is set for some interesting background noise when the
NLCS resumes here Friday. The Shea mob targeted Jones while he was
ruining the Mets' regular season. And he fired back, writing them
off as fashion pretenders, just killing time until they could slip
into their fall wardrobe of Yankee pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than further inflaming the situation, they'd be better
off just letting C. Jones snooze. They need to get some new Eddie
Perez or Brian Jordan material. Maybe Andrew Dice Clay can rip off
a few low-brow put-downs for them in time for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Jones has another hope. ``Maybe he (John Rocker) will get booed
before I do _ but somehow I doubt it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' hyperactive closer has earned himself special notice
from the friendly folk of the five boroughs. There's not nearly
enough trash talk in baseball, but Rocker may be trying to fix
that. ``To hell with New York fans,'' he declared after Wednesday's
win. ``They're stupid anyway. We beat them 20 out of 26 times, and
they still say we (stink). Well, if we (stink) so bad, how come
they can't beat us? They're a tired act.'' On a Thursday morning
Atlanta radio spot, Rocker promised plenty more smack after the
Mets were dismissed. He's probably saving the A material for Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday afternoon, when the team emerged for an off-day workout
at Shea, Ryan Klesko came out in Rocker's jersey. ``I'm Rocker's
dummy. He'll stay inside for a few minutes. If it's safe, he'll
come out,'' Klesko joked. Rocker later came out with ``Klesko'' on
his back, and they all laughed off the tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, he's just a good ol' Georgia boy who doesn't see a lot of
hospitality here,'' said his protector. The real test of Klesko's
nerve, however, would be to slip into the Rocker-wear tonight, when
there are people in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he's one of the guys who said something, but please
don't tell me what it was,'' manager Bobby Cox said of his
mercurial closer.
</P>
<P>
   All this is fun to talk about. It fills in the competitive
cracks in this series. As for practical impact, there isn't any.
Rocker says he loves the abuse _ ``I prefer playing before a
hostile crowd to one that's cheering me,'' he said. The Braves are
a good road team _ 47-34 during the regular season, even expressing
much love for the Astrodome during the Division Series. They don't
need approval to play well.
</P>
<P>
   Bring on a full-throated New York. It really shouldn't matter.

SHARES OF UNISYS SLIDE 37 PERCENT; REVENUE FIGURES ARE CITED 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shares of the Unisys Corp. fell 37 percent Thursday
after the technology company said revenue in the third quarter had
increased by 4 percent, a figure below investors' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expressed surprise at the sharp drop because Unisys'
results were hardly a disaster, especially since the company had
met its profit forecasts. Investors, they said, seemed to be
unusually quick to abandon the company on a mere whiff of bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market punishes a company with a revenue shortfall, so I
thought it would be down a few points,'' said William J. Milton, an
analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman. ``But this is shocking.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed at $29.5625, down $15.6875, or 37.13
percent, with an unusually heavy 23 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   Milton attributed part of the sharp drop to the trend among
investors to pick stocks that have ``momentum.'' As soon as a
company's growth falters, these shareholders rush to bail out.
</P>
<P>
   Unisys, an old-line maker of ``big iron'' mainframe computers,
has been struggling to find a niche in today's tough market. Its
chief executive, Lawrence A. Weinbach, has focused on technology
services _ helping companies develop and operate their computer
systems _ while focusing its computer business on building powerful
machines to run Microsoft's Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday, the strategy had seemed to be working.
</P>
<P>
   ``This company, under Larry Weinbach, has done nothing but meet
and beat expectations,'' said Steven Milunovich, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. ``So when they disappoint, it makes it that much
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Unisys earnings were $138 million, up 48 percent from a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The third-quarter earnings included a one-time tax benefit of
$22 million, partly offset by a charge of $12 million, reflecting
the cost of buying back high-interest debt. Excluding these items,
the company earned 40 cents a share, above the 36 cents that
analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, were more focused on the company's sales
than on its profits. Revenue rose 4 percent, to $1.87 billion. The
company said that the rising dollar had hurt its sales. Without the
effect of currency fluctuations, its revenue would have increased 7
percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that revenue in its service unit increased 4
percent, less than the 11 percent to 12 percent expected, because
of shortfalls in its computer networks unit.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, there was a delay in financing for a big project
for the Internal Revenue Service, and it lost several project bids
because competition drove the price too low, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is erring on the side of making money rather than
growing revenue, which is a very mature approach,'' Milunovich said
of Weinbach.
</P>
<P>
   Offsetting the shortfall in revenue from services, the company
said its sales of hardware were ahead of expectations. But it said
that this was probably a temporary gain, because its customers had
accelerated purchases to avoid installing new equipment right
before the year 2000 date change, and thus hardware sales would
probably fall off sharply in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, Unisys predicted that its revenue would increase by
just 4 percent for the entire year. But it said it would meet
earnings forecasts for the fourth quarter and that revenue would
accelerate next year, once concerns about Year 2000 computer
problems had passed.
</P>
<P>
   It also announced that executives who ran two of its three
largest divisions had resigned ``to pursue other opportunities.''
They were Gerald A. Gagliardi, 51, who ran the maintenance and
service division, and Lawrence C. Russell, 60, who oversaw the
consulting unit.

EDITORIAL: FIDDLING WITH FEDERALISM  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Oct. 15:
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's ongoing reappraisal of the limits of federal
power moved into new and treacherous terrain on Wednesday when the
justices heard arguments in one of the term's most significant
cases _ a test of Congress' authority to bind states to the federal
law barring age discrimination in employment and, more broadly, its
authority to enforce the fairness principles embedded in the 14th
Amendment's equal protection clause.
</P>
<P>
   Bolstered by the court's recent string of lamentable 5-4
decisions elevating states' rights at the expense of federal power,
a lower appeals court ruled that Congress could not subject states
to federal lawsuits by employees who charge they are victims of age
bias. The court's response here, and in two other prominent
federalism cases this term, will tell whether the agenda of the
``states' rights five'' _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, Anthony Kennedy and
Sandra Day O'Connor _ includes a radical narrowing of congressional
leeway to legislate national remedies to protect basic civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate outcome may not be known for months, but the
comments by some of the justices were not heartening. ``The statute
does not mention the 11th Amendment,'' said Justice O'Connor,
suggesting she believes that the federal age-discrimination law at
issue violates the court's 1996 edict that Congress may wipe out a
state's sovereign immunity only when going after some specific
discriminatory harm and when it unequivocally indicates it is
overriding that immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the facts show otherwise. Congress amassed piles of
testimony and other evidence before concluding that age
discrimination is a national problem that afflicts public as well
as private employers. Furthermore, by defining the terms
``employer'' and ``employee'' to include the states, and by
expressly allowing private lawsuits against a ``public agency,''
Congress made no secret of its intent to override the 11th
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said Thursday that he found it ``extraordinary'' that
Congress had concluded that arbitrary and irrational age
discrimination was a violation of the Constitution's guarantee of
equal protection in the absence of a court decision defining it as
such. But Congress traditionally has gone further than the courts
in affording legal protection to vulnerable groups, and the very
language of the equal protection clause gives Congress that right.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia also said Thursday that he did not find age
discrimination to be irrational as a general matter. The danger is
that this glibly dismissive attitude will become the basis for a
sweeping constitutional ruling constricting the ability of Congress
to define and legislate protection for civil rights, and calling
into question a slew of existing civil rights laws, including the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Equal Pay Act and even,
potentially, a portion of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   To hold states immune from private age-discrimination suits in
federal court, the government argues in its brief, ``would be an
extraordinary and unwarranted departure from both text and
history'' of the Constitution. It can only be hoped that, upon
careful reflection, a majority of justices will agree.

CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS PAY FOR BANK SERVICE FEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When it comes to bank service fees, consumers in
California pay a high price for the convenience of automated teller
machines and regular checking accounts, according to a recent
survey.
</P>
<P>
   California consumers are paying $202.39 to maintain a regular
checking account, slightly lower than the national average of
$217.32, but still 15.4 percent more than the $175.43 paid by
consumers in Nebraska, the Washington-based U.S. Public Interest
Research Group said Thursday in its latest annual national survey
of bank fees in 33 states and the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Californians also are forced to maintain some of the highest
average balance requirements to avoid fees, with a required minimum
balance averaging $811 for checking accounts, ranking California
33rd out of 34 states.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 526 banks surveyed, California's ranking of 12
different cost factors is collectively a below-average 25th
overall, said Janine Benner, a consumer advocate with the
California Public Interest Research Group. Those costs include
checking account monthly fees, ATM fees, bounced check fees,
minimum balance requirements and the number of banks offering free
checking.
</P>
<P>
   Bank industry officials were quick to criticize the survey,
saying the fictitious examples didn't reflect reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The survey is flawed because of the way it was calculated,
they used a fake customer who over-used bank services,'' said John
Stafford, a spokesman with the California Bankers Association.
``Most consumers avoid bank fees by balancing their check book,
using their own banks' ATMs, not bouncing checks, and generally
knowing what services their bank charges fees for and avoiding
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sharon Woodson-Bryant, a spokeswoman with Union Bank of
California: ``We don't feel the scenario presented in the survey
represents the average consumer.''
</P>
<P>
   Stafford disputed the annual fees for Californians, calling them
``abosulte nonsense.'' Consumer fees in California represent less
than 7 percent of bank revenues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benner defended the survey by saying the fees were taken from
the banks' own brochures.
</P>
<P>
   CalPes the survey will encourage consumers to shop around
for a bank, said Benner. ``We want them to choose a bank that
charges them the least amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The report ``Big Banks, Big Fees,'' found in California, only 11
percent of banks surveyed offered either free checking without any
restrictions or free checking with direct deposit, ranking the
state 28th out of 34.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the survey found the states with the lowest banking
costs for consumers were Nebraska, followed by Missouri, Utah,
Colorado and Arkansas. The highest cost states were New York,
Florida, Texas, Michigan and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found:
</P>
<P>
   Almost 12 million American families can't afford bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
   92 banks out of 526, or 17 percent, offered free checking
accounts, with no fees and no restrictions, other than no return of
canceled checks. By comparison, 45 percent of credit unions offer
free checking without restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The average cost to maintain a checking account at credit unions
was $111.59 or less than half what big banks charge.
</P>
<P>
   Bank customers paid on average $23.08 in 1999 for bouncing
checks, up 10 percent from 1997, when customers paid only $20.91;
$5.12 in 1999 for receiving someone else's bounced check, up from
$4.87 in 1997; and ATM surcharges imposed on other banks' customers
averaged $1.35 this year.
</P>
<P>
   The USPIRG survey comes as California becomes the center of
attention nationwide over ATM fees charged by local banks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the Santa Monica City Council gave final
approval to an ordinance that will outlaw the practice of charging
``double'' fees at ATMs. Barring any legal actions, the new
ordinance will take effect Nov. 11, said City Clerk Maria Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The California Bankers Association has not filed suit against
Santa Monica, but Stafford said, ``We are preparing legal action.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure would bar banks from charging fees for use of their
ATMs by non-customers. It would not affect the power of banks to
charge fees to their own customers who use other banks' ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks practice of `double-dipping' charges at ATMs is
anti-consumer and anti-comptetitive. Consumer choice doesn't work
here because people cannot avoid high ATM fees,'' said Santa Monica
City Councilman Kevin McKeown in a statement. ``We hope that other
local governments will enact similar consumer protections.''
</P>
<P>
   Next month, residents in San Francisco will vote on Proposition
F, a ballot measure to prohibit ATM charges. CalPIRG supports the
measure, Benner said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen other California cities and counties will also be
considering ATM fee ordinances in the coming months, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the City Council unanimously approved a measure
Wednesday instructing City Attorney James K. Hahn to draft an
ordinance similar to the measure that past in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will help and encourage other cities, counties and the
state to pass similar ordinances,'' said Benner.

ROBITAILLE IN GREAT SHAPE TO PASS HIS IDOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What child is this leading the league in goals in
Year 1 after Gretzky? He's from Quebec, but it's not Vincent
Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   He's solid as a gold bar, but it's not Patrick Marleau.
</P>
<P>
   He's goofy, but it's not Joe Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Robitaille is 33, but he's playing like it's 1988. That 20
on the Kings left wing's jersey could pass as his age. Neither
Father Time nor any opposing skater has been able to slow him out
of the gate in his 14th NHL season.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille has seven goals and 10 points in five games for the
Kings (3-1-1), who play at Calgary tonight. San Jose's Owen Nolan
was second with six goals going into Thursday's game against
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille has triggered more flashing red lights than the
entire Philadelphia Flyers team had before Thursday and they're
supposed to be thisclose to the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly nobody expected the 171st pick in the 1984 draft to
one day be thisclose to catching his childhood idol _ Maurice
``Rocket'' Richard _ on the NHL's all-time goal scoring list. And
yet there he stands at 524 goals, 21 shy of supplanting Richard as
the league's 17th most prolific goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   At his current breakneck pace, Robitaille would overtake Richard
shortly before Thanksgiving. Not that we're counting any blessings
before they've been bequeathed.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. fans have been tantalized like this before, most recently
in late May when Dodgers outfielder Raul Mondesi sat atop the
league in home runs. Mondesi's brush with glory lasted about as
long as an odd-man rush.
</P>
<P>
   It would be presumptuous to say this could be Robitaille's
crowning season, especially with that 63-goal jewel from 1992-93
embedded in our memories. If Robitaille never reaches that number
again, he shouldn't fret:
</P>
<P>
   It's quite conceivable nobody will.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL didn't have a 50-goal scorer last year. It certainly
wasn't for a lack of trying that Anaheim's Teemu Selanne, the
league leader, came up three goals short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoring 30 goals today is a lot harder than it was seven years
ago,'' said Robitaille, who managed 39 in 82 games in 1998-99.
``The goalies today play a different style than they used to.
They're too good.''
</P>
<P>
   Goaltenders are getting bigger, stronger and more athletic.
Unlike the upright netminders of yesteryear, they'll fall to the
ice at the drop of a shooter's shoulder, effectively taking away
the lower half of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille has changed with the times. In the summer of 1998, on
the heels of his fourth consecutive mediocre, injury-marred season,
he stepped up his conditioning routine. Since then Robitaille has
attacked the weights with the same ferocity he does loose pucks in
and around the crease.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked himself into such great shape _ the better to give
his shots a lift _ his muscles didn't lodge a single protest
despite being subjected to five games in eight nights to start the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a lot stronger,'' Robitaille said. ``I feel better
physically and mentally. When I get in battles in front of the net
I feel really confident because I know I can (stand my ground).''
</P>
<P>
   It helps that his linemates have much better aim than any
paperboy. Jozef Stumpel and Ziggy Palffy are terrific at reading
the ice and putting the puck right there on the doorstep for
Robitaille. Their passing is pretty enough to make a grown man
whistle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys are such skilled players,'' Robitaille said.
``Playing with them you're going to get more scoring
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   You're also bound to pick up a little Slovakian. That's the
native tongue of both Stumpel and Palffy. They've already taught
Robitaille how to say ``I'm doing good.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, don't they know he's incapable of bragging in any
language?
</P>
<P>
   A few other phrases Robitaille has overheard, well, he can only
guess their meaning. ``The other day Stumpy and Ziggy were talking
in Slovakian and I think they were mad at each other,'' he said,
laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that's not the Canadian ``eh'' punctuating Robitaille's
sentences, it's a contented ``heh, heh, heh.''
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille is happy, he knows it and he's not afraid to show it.
It's a far cry from his days with the New York Rangers, two endless
seasons that saw Robitaille endure injuries and insults.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were tough years in New York,'' Robitaille said,
referring to the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons that preceded his
return to L.A. ``It's not that I didn't like New York. I just
forgot that it's still a game and you've got to enjoy it. I put a
lot of pressure on myself to be the player I thought I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   L.A. fans, having watched Robitaille grow from a kid who could
barely speak English to the Kings' gracious spokesman, have a
proprietary interest in him. He is from Canada, but he is of
Southern California. He is L.A. hockey's bridge from Marcel Dionne
to the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille never thought he'd stick around long enough to catch
Richard, the former Montreal superstar. He never considered himself
that good. To him, he's just, you know, Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly would be an honor to pass him,'' Robitaille said.
``It's pretty special we're even able to talk about it today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow comes with no guarantees. Gretzky, a teammate of
Robitaille in L.A. and New York, didn't muster more than 38 goals
in any season after his 33rd birthday. Then there's Mark Messier,
another New York teammate, who had 47 goals at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille can't be sure how the pucks will fall for him. All he
knows is he'll keep playing hard until his _ ahem _ luck runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play every game like it's my last game,'' Robitaille said.
``We'll see what happens in the end.'' &QL;

CANADIAN REGULATORS FILE CHARGES AGAINST EXECUTIVE AT COREL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Canada's top securities regulator has charged Michael
Cowpland, the president and chief executive of Corel Corp., one of
the nation's largest computer software makers, with unlawfully
profiting from insider trading in the company's shares and lying
about his activities.
</P>
<P>
   Three charges against Cowpland, and one against his personal
holding company, were filed in the Ontario Court of Justice on
Thursday by the Ontario Securities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The charges relate to a sale in August 1997 of one-third of
Cowpland's Corel shares for $20.4 million (Canadian), or about
$13.9 million (United States), shortly before unexpectedly poor
financial results were released.
</P>
<P>
   The commission contends that Cowpland sold the Corel shares
based on insider knowledge ``that Corel would fall short of its
forecasted sales for the third quarter of 1997 by a significant
margin.''
</P>
<P>
   It further says that Cowpland, when interviewed by regulators
about the sale, made statements that were ``misleading and
untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Corel said Cowpland continued to deny all
accusations of insider trading. It also said company activities
would not be affected by what the company called a private matter
between Cowpland and the securities commission.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1997, Corel, best known for its WordPerfect and CorelDraw
software, had indicated to investment analysts that third-quarter
sales would be about $94 million (United States). During the first
week of August, the securities commission said, Cowpland was told
by his staff that sales would only amount to about $63 million,
although this was not publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the securities commission, Cowpland then instructed
his sales staff to place inventory with Corel's largest distributor
to make up the shortfall, even though the distributor's inventories
were already high.
</P>
<P>
   Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 14, Cowpland sold about 2.4 million
Corel shares at prices ranging from $8.20 to $8.80 (Canadian) a
share.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, the securities commission says, the distributor
agreed to buy $70 million (United States) worth of software, but
Corel also agreed to accept returns of $18 million worth of goods.
In early September 1997, the commission says, Corel realized that
much of its $70 million sale could not be booked for the quarter
and in a press release the company said it expected to report a
loss of $32 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors sensed trouble in advance of Corel's press
release warning of the loss. In the three weeks between Cowpland's
stock sales and the company's statement the stock fell to $6.80
(Canadian) from $8.90.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following three weeks it slipped as low as $5.05
(Canadian).

DESPITE TYCO'S DEFENSE, SHARES FALL AGAIN

 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investors brushed aside Tyco International's
aggressive defense of its accounting practices Thursday, pushing
its stock down $10 more, to $87, amid fears about the company's
three-year acquisition spree.
</P>
<P>
   The selloff has dropped shares of Tyco, one of the highfliers of
the current bull market, by 18 percent since the start of the week,
when an investment manager wrote a detailed critique of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco's chief executive, L. Dennis Kozlowski, said he was
outraged by the ``false and baseless'' report, which was published
by David W. Tice, a Dallas fund manager and prominent short-seller.
Speaking to Wall Street analysts in a conference call Thursday
morning, Kozlowski added, ``There is no risk that investors will
wake up one day and find out'' that ``there's something wrong with
the way we've been recording revenue or the way we've been
recording margins.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts continued to support the company Thursday,
saying they thought its earnings remained on course for this year
and next. ``It was very reassuring,'' said Jack Blackstock, an
analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, referring to the call.
</P>
<P>
   But investors are clearly alarmed, reflecting both broader
concerns about the health of the stock market and specific worries
about Tyco, which has spent about $30 billion on acquisitions over
the last three years. Tyco sells electronic components, fire
prevention devices, alarm systems and medical products, among other
items.
</P>
<P>
   Separate from Tice's criticisms, a well-known evaluator of
corporate accounting methods issued warnings about two of Tyco's
acquisitions, AMP Inc. and the United States Surgical Corp., before
the conglomerate took them over.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Financial Research and Analysis Inc., run out of
Rockville, Md., by Howard Schilit, told clients in March 1998 that
AMP's earnings were weaker than they appeared because the company
had adopted new accounting methods and was experiencing a rise in
inventories. Tyco bought AMP, then the world's biggest maker of
electronic connectors, for $12 billion in April.
</P>
<P>
   The research center also warned clients twice in 1996 about
United States Surgical, which had long drawn criticism for its
financial practices. Tyco bought the medical supplies company in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The center has won a following for calling attention to earnings
troubles before the stock market has reacted to them.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brad McGee, a Tyco spokesman, said that AMP's business had
since rebounded and that United States Surgical had solved its
accounting problems before Tyco bought it. ``They're completely
different companies today,'' McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors began dumping shares of Tyco this week after they
found out about the critical report by Tice's firm. It said that
Tyco had taken overly large write-offs related to its mergers to
inflate future earnings and that its cash flow had been deceptively
weak.
</P>
<P>
   The company said Thursday that Tice did not bother to call the
company so that executives could explain the situation. As an
example, Mark H. Swartz, Tyco's chief financial officer, cited
Tice's highlighting of the large amount of money set aside for job
cuts even after many layoffs had been announced. In fact, Swartz
said, payments to former employees must continue even after they
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Tice stood by his report Thursday and said the company had not
returned his firm's phone calls.

EDITORIAL: THE SENATE'S HARMFUL VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Oct. 15: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's forceful and focused performance at
Thursday's news conference must mark the beginning of a sustained
White House effort to limit the damage inflicted by the Senate's
reckless vote Wednesday against the nuclear test ban treaty. It
will be up to Clinton to convince other nations, including those
that have already signed the treaty, like Russia and China, and
those that have not, like India, Pakistan and North Korea, that the
United States remains committed to observing its provisions and
eventually ratifying it in a new Senate vote. In these and other
ways, his administration must demonstrate America's continued
determination to reduce nuclear dangers throughout the world. The
Senate should want to send exactly the same message. Unfortunately,
it did not.
</P>
<P>
   With its abrupt scheduling, rushed debate and needless negative
vote on the test ban treaty, the Republican Senate majority all but
abdicated its constitutional responsibility to play a thoughtful
and deliberative role in the shaping of American foreign policy. It
also undermined Washington's ability to provide diplomatic
leadership on one of the most important questions facing the world
today _ controlling the development and spread of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   With the United States now the world's foremost military and
economic power, senators as well as presidents must rise to the
challenge of international leadership, helping to project the moral
vision of the American people onto the global arena. Too many
senators failed this crucial test.
</P>
<P>
   Senators have a complex and serious role to play on foreign
policy matters. Their duty is not to assent passively to every
presidential initiative, but to engage their own minds and
consciences, particularly on grave questions of war, peace and
treaties. Too many Republican senators shortchanged that duty by
allowing the majority leader, Trent Lott, and a handful of
committed treaty opponents to turn the test ban issue into a
partisan arm-wrestling contest with the White House and Senate
Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At no time in the ludicrously compressed Senate debate was the
country offered a serious alternative Republican view of how to
contain the alarming development of nuclear weapons in South Asia
and their potential spread to such troubled areas as the Middle
East and the Korean Peninsula. Instead, many opponents spoke as if
the United States could afford to turn its back on international
arms control treaties and address the spread of nuclear weapons
solely through superior military strength. As Clinton noted
Thursday, that kind of armed isolationism makes little sense and
offers no real security at the dawn of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   America's most honored foreign policy tradition is
bipartisanship. The Senate so rarely votes to reject major treaties
that the last comparable precedent was Woodrow Wilson's defeat over
the Treaty of Versailles nearly 80 years ago. That disastrous
decision weakened Washington's voice in international affairs. This
one threatens to do the same unless Clinton manages to keep alive
some momentum for nuclear arms control and the Senate returns to
its traditions of serious and constructive foreign policy debate.

DE NIRO AND PARTNERS DISPUTE GIULIANI VERSION OF NAVY YARD DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Reeling Thursday from the collapse of a deal to build
a $150 million sound stage complex at the city-owned Brooklyn Navy
Yard, actor Robert De Niro and top executives of Miramax Films
disputed Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's account of where the deal stood
before it fell apart.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani said that the city had made no formal
commitment to Miramax, and he cited the word ``explore,'' which
appeared three times in the press release that first announced the
project, as evidence that there had been no agreement other than to
explore the plans.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement released Thursday, De Niro and Harvey
Weinstein, the president of Miramax, said: ``In getting us to agree
to a press conference on May 3 to announce the plan, the mayor told
us that we had a deal. All that remained to do was `dot the i's and
cross the t's.'''
</P>
<P>
   De Niro and Weinstein also said they thought that the city would
have benefited more from working with them. ``There is no question
that our proposal, from the leading film producers on the East
Coast, is better for Brooklyn and the needs of the city,'' they
said.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing Wednesday that the deal with Miramax had fallen
through, Giuliani said that the project would go forward, but that
it would instead be built by a different development group, headed
by Douglas C. Steiner, the son of David S. Steiner, who is a New
Jersey financier.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said that the Steiner group offered ``a much better
deal for the city'' that would provide about $60 million more in
rent revenue and would not require the city to make a $25 million
loan for the project, as the Miramax deal would have.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, at his daily news conference at City Hall on Thursday,
reacted angrily to the assertion that there had been a more formal
commitment to Miramax. ``I think I showed you the press release
yesterday,'' the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   Told that regardless of the release, De Niro and Weinstein had
disputed the mayor's account, Giuliani said: ``Well, that's some
other world. That's some other world, other than the world of
equity, fairness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word in the press release, repeated three times, is
explore. It was written as explore, it meant explore. Explore means
there is no deal to any sensible, fair and honest person.''

CONGRESS QUESTIONS OLYMPIC OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Members of a congressional investigating
subcommittee subjected representatives of the Olympics to sharp
questioning Thursday over allegations of corruption in Atlanta's
and other cities' applications to have the games awarded to them.
</P>
<P>
   The comments of the congressmen, such as Rep. Ron Klink's
assertion that the International Olympic Committee ``has allowed a
shameful system to continue,'' gave an indication of how the
questioning is likely to go when Juan Antonio Samaranch, the
Olympic committee's president, appears before the panel on Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The governing body of the International Olympic Committee is to
meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Dec. 11 and 12, and Francois
Carrard, the director general of the Olympic committee, said that
it would introduce changes to meet allegations that the Olympics
had been awarded to cities by a self-perpetuating group of
selectors more interested in lavish gifts than the best sites for
the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Klink, a Pennsylvanian, is the ranking Democrat on the panel,
the commerce subcommittee on oversight and investigations, and
members of both parties jumped in with their skeptical questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C., said that Congress should give
serious consideration to a bill that would remove the tax deduction
that American corporations get for sponsoring the Olympics, an
action that could cripple the games.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who is the co-sponsor of that bill,
said, ``The culture of greed and corruption that led to the Salt
Lake City scandal has been flourishing for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Waxman was referring to the lavish gifts and other improprieties
that were discovered after the 2002 Winter Games were awarded to
Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the subcommittee, Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich.,
said: ``We were hoping that Salt Lake City's actions were an
aberration, but, sadly, as the Atlanta report so graphically
confirms, Salt Lake City was not an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   The report he referred to was made by Griffin Bell, a former
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Klink asked William Payne, the former chairman of the Atlanta
committee for its 1996 Olympics, to explain huge expenditures made
by the committee for people who would be selecting the Olympic
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atlanta officials paid $11,987 for the IOC official from Libya
to travel from Tripoli to Zurich to Geneva back to Zurich to
Atlanta then to Chicago then back to Atlanta then to Zurich then to
Malta and finally back to Tripoli,'' Klink said.
</P>
<P>
   After listing many similar trips by another Olympics official,
this one from Ireland, Klink asked Payne, ``Weren't you trying to
buy his vote?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we weren't,'' Payne answered.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Payne acknowledged that ``Atlanta's bidding
effort included excessive actions, even thought processes, that
today seem inappropriate but, at the time, reflected the prevailing
practices in the selection process and an extremely competitive
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Those kinds of practices should not be permitted in
the competition for future Olympic bids.''

OVER TIME, BRUINS' VETERAN DEPTH VANISHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With seven senior starters, UCLA is one of the
least experienced teams in the Pac-10. But youth shines brightest
when the Bruins substitute; 16 of their 22 second-string players
are freshmen and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of veteran depth is traceable to 12 players who have
quit the team in the last three years _ including the man who would
be quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent departure was left tackle Kris Farris, who
bypassed his senior season and entered the 1999 NFL draft. But for
long-term impact, nothing tops the forced retirements of two
members of coach Bob Toledo's first recruiting class.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Anselmo Zamano was challenging for a starting job as
a freshman in 1996 when he shredded every ligament in his knee at
Michigan. Several surgeries later, Zamano can run, but a return
seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going to be a super player,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Dylan Aquino, who would be a junior this season, was
considered Cade McNown's eventual successor, but a congenital
neurological problem in his neck forced him to quit in '96.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he'd be our starter (this season),'' Toledo said.
``He was going to be a good quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Other departed players include: cornerback Damian Allen (track
and field); defensive lineman Jesse Simms (did not enroll);
linebackers Ramogi Huma (medical) and Mike Wiley (medical);
fullback Mark Verti (medical); and linemen David Plenty-Hawk
(personal), Scott Weigand (personal), Matt Pentecost (track and
field), Jeff Wright (personal) and Dave Wilford (grades).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of guys either hurt or leave,'' Toledo said.
``That's why (the 60-man travel squad) has 40 freshmen and
sophomores.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback tales: In DeShaun Foster's absence (sprained ankle),
senior Keith Brown and junior Jermaine Lewis once again will share
the tailback duties. They combined for 105 yards against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   If Brown or Lewis is injured, seldom-used redshirt freshman
Kenny Pritchett, of Crescenta Valley, will be promoted to
second-string.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case, the Bruins snared walk-on Mike Vanis off the
scout team and practiced him with the starters.
</P>
<P>
   Infection update: As of Thursday evening, reserve guard Ed
Anderson was the only player expected to miss Saturday's game
against Cal because of an upper respiratory infection that has
afflicted 15-20 players.
</P>
<P>
   Review of the week: Defensive tackle Pete Holland, a history
major and six-time member of the director's honor roll, has agreed
to review a book each week for the Daily News. This week: ``A View
from Above'', by Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although somewhat autobiographical, this book is not about
Chamberlain's life story. Rather, it's a collection of opinions
(`Wiltisms') and observations made by one of the NBA's most
outlandish alums. In it, we learn not how Wilt became Wilt, but
what being Wilt has taught him about the world _ a world about
which he has a unique perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ```View' is not a masterpiece of literature, but its content is
as compelling as any fiction. Some of his opinions and statistics
are astounding enough to memorize, from the 100-point game to the
20,000 _ well, you know. Overall, the book is an incomparable and
honest insight into the man who himself was peerless.''
</P>
<P>
   Rating: 2{ sacks (out of four).

BOEING EXECS, ANALYSTS UPBEAT ABOUT EARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Thanks in large measure to significant improvements in
its once-troubled commercial airplanes unit, The Boeing Co.
Thursday delivered a stronger than expected quarterly earnings
report that delighted analysts and sent its stock soaring nearly 8
percent on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Executives were upbeat about the future and the progress that
has been made in turning around the company's core business.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial profit margins are much better than previously
forecast, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Asia is bouncing back from its economic woes, they said, and
Boeing will be able to maintain production of its most profitable
commercial airplane _ the 747 _ at two per month in 2000. That
alone will result in an additional $1 billion in revenue next year.
</P>
<P>
   And 2001 is looking better for airplane deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an outstanding quarter _ strong results, solid program
performance, some significant wins and improved outlook for the
future,'' Boeing Chairman Phil Condit said during a morning
conference call with analysts and the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``In short,'' he added, ``we are making real progress toward our
goals.''
</P>
<P>
   For the third quarter, Boeing had profits of $477 million, or 52
cents a share. That was 37 percent higher than for the third
quarter of 1998. Excluding non-recurring items, third-quarter
earnings per share were 56 cents in 1999. The consensus estimate of
analysts surveyed by First Call had been that Boeing would earn 49
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's revenues rose 4.4 percent to $13.28 billion from $12.72
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street reacted by sending Boeing's stock up sharply. It
closed at $43 5/8, up $3 1/8 a share. On a day when stocks were
generally mixed, Boeing accounted for 16.8 points of the Dow's
advance of 54.45.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very, very good quarter,'' said Peter Jacobs of
Seattle's Ragan-MacKenzie firm. ``Clearly, the commercial airplane
operations are on the road to recovery. While they still have a
ways to go, they are ahead of schedule and there is an increased
level of confidence that they can continue to show solid
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's commercial airplane unit accounts for about 60 percent
of the company's business.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, as Boeing attempted to ramp up production to
record levels, its commercial operations fell apart. Production
lines in Renton and in Everett were disrupted by bottlenecks and
planes were delivered late to customers. The problems cost Boeing
billions in unanticipated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Boeing suffered a loss of $178 million in 1997, its
first red ink in a half century. Commercial boss Ron Woodard was
fired last September and replaced by Alan Mulally, one of the stars
of the company's successful 777 program.
</P>
<P>
   But production in the factories began to slowly improve,
especially in the second half of 1998. Even so, some analysts were
predicting late last year that Condit himself was in trouble and
might be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer such talk on Wall Street. Boeing recently
negotiated a new labor contract with its machinists and Condit was
credited with playing a key role.
</P>
<P>
   Production at Boeing's factories has steadily improved this
year. With one quarter left in 1999, production efficiencies under
a new management team are clearly starting to kick in, analysts
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's commercial airplanes unit earned $501 million on
revenues of $8.5 billion in the third quarter, compared with a loss
of $142 million on revenues of $7.8 billion a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Thursday's conference call, analysts were
especially interested in Boeing's commercial profit margins for the
quarter. That's one of the best ways to judge the company's
improving efficiency, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   Although commercial revenue was down about 16 percent from the
second quarter, margins were up. (Revenue was down because Boeing
delivered fewer airplanes in the third quarter, though it remains
on target to deliver a record 620 planes this year).
</P>
<P>
   Boeing delivered a record 559 airplanes in 1998, and made
nothing on them.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial group posted a 3.9 percent profit in the first
quarter of 1999 and 4.3 percent in the second quarter. For the
third quarter, the commercial margin was 5.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Debby Hopkins, Boeing's chief financial officer, said the
company's margin forecasts for 1999 and 2000 have been revised
upwards.Commercial margins in 2000, previously forecast to be 1 to
3 percent, will instead be from 5.5 to 6.5 percent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, Boeing's margins for all its businesses will range
from 5.5 to 6.5 percent. That's up from earlier projections of 3.5
to 5 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Total revenue will be down in 2000, which means Boeing will be
under even more pressure to improve margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is to attempt to have 2000 earnings be equal or
exceed 1999,'' she said. ``And that requires us to get to operating
margins of around 7 percent for the total company.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Boeing will deliver a record number of planes this year,
it has said it will deliver only 480 planes next year, a result of
Asia and a slowing demand worldwide for new airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, revenue in 2000 will be about $49 billion, or about
$9 billion less than the $58 billion forecast for 1999, the company
said Thursday. That's an improvement of about $1 billion over
previous projections. The new figure reflects the production of 10
more 747s next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than producing 14 jumbo jets in 2000, Boeing will build
24.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due in part to the improved Asian economy, we are able to
maintain 747 production rate at two per month through 2000,''
Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boeing has not yet announced its projected deliveries
for 2001, it had previously warned 2001 would be worse than 2000.
That may not be the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that strengthening of the Asian market, right now we are
saying that 2001 looks sort of like 2000,'' Condit said. ``It was
not that long ago that we thought 2001 would be significantly less
than 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, the industry analyst, said he was figuring that Boeing
would deliver only 426 planes in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a couple more quarters for investors to fully
believe that's possible,'' he said of Condit's comment that 2001
deliveries may match those in 2000. ``Boeing will have to show a
good rebound in landing new orders which have been very soft this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's commercial orders are down significantly this year. It
lags well behind European aircraft maker Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus had 343 orders in the first nine months compared with 154
for Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing had 480 firm orders through the third quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Whitlow, who tracks Boeing for Safeco Corp., said Airbus is
winning more than 65 percent of new airplane orders this year. For
all of 1998, Airbus had about 46 percent of the total orders for
commercial jets with more than 100 seats.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Airbus is even beating Boeing on orders for widebody
jets, which has long been Boeing's market strength, Whitlow said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a concern,'' he said. ``Airbus continues to make market
share gains ... It's a worrisome trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said Thursday he expects Boeing's order book to improve
in the fourth quarter. A big order from International Lease Finance
Corp. that was announced at the Paris Air Show in June has not yet
been added to Boeing's tally because contract details are still
being worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the total, Condit said he does not worry about
orders. The key is deliveries, he said. By that measure, Boeing is
far ahead of Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really matters is what comes out the factory door and
what gets paid for,'' Condit said. ``This is the only industry in
the world that I know of that tries to track on an order rate.
Everybody else works on sales, or deliveries.''

N.Y. COURT BACKS LAW TO WITHHOLD LEGISLATORS' PAY WHEN BUDGET IS
LATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York's highest court upheld a bitterly
contested law Thursday that calls for withholding the pay of state
legislators when a state budget is late, bolstering efforts to
speed up the state's notoriously slow budget-making process.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-1 ruling, the Court of Appeals overturned a lower court
decision that declared the new law unconstitutional on the ground
that it had the potential to coerce the state Legislature into
passing a budget and thus curbed its legal authority and
independence.
</P>
<P>
   In December, as part of a deal with Gov. George Pataki to raise
the salaries of lawmakers for the first time in a decade, the
Legislature agreed to pass a law that would penalize legislators if
a budget was not in place by the April 1 deadline: They would not
be paid until one had been passed.
</P>
<P>
   The law, the only one of its kind in the nation, was considered
an important victory for Pataki, a Republican whose tenure has been
marked by passage of the latest budgets in state history. That
happened despite his promise to deliver budgets on time, which he
made in 1994, when he first ran for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But the law was immediately challenged in court by 14 Democratic
state legislators, who maintained that it gave the governor
coercive powers over the Legislature that were unconstitutional.
The 14 plaintiffs either voted against the new law or were elected
in November and had not taken office when it passed.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded decision May 21, Justice Richard Huttner of
state Supreme Court in Brooklyn found that the law gave the
governor a coercive power over the Legislature, violating the state
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When even one legislator, by dint of economic circumstance, is
coerced into passing a budget that may require him or her to
sacrifice conscientiously held beliefs, then the entire process is
tainted,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals rejected the plaintiffs' claim of coercion.
Writing for the majority, Judge Joseph Bellacosa said that all
lawmakers ``are entitled to the presumption that they act only in
accordance with and fulfillment of their oaths of office.''
</P>
<P>
   The court also rejected the plaintiffs' assertion that the new
law violated the constitutional separation of powers by
transferring power from the Legislature to the governor, noting
that the law had been passed by both houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature has decided to restrict itself and discipline
its own work and power in this fashion,'' Bellacosa wrote. He added
that the law was a ``credit to the legislative branch's internal
management practices,'' not a surrendering of power.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision elicited predictable responses from both sides. The
law's opponents said that it could subvert the legislative process,
while its supporters said that it gave lawmakers a powerful
incentive to do their work in a timely manner.
</P>
<P>
   State Senate Republican Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, who was
one the law's chief sponsors, issued a statement Thursday afternoon
chiding Democrats for bringing the lawsuit instead of focusing on
completing the budget on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that this issue has been resolved by the court,'' he said,
``I once again urge all parties to renew the effort to enact budget
reform so that we can help restore the public's confidence in our
ability to do our jobs well and to do them within the parameters
set by law.''
</P>
<P>
   But Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, a Democratic Assemblyman from
Manhattan who was one of the plaintiffs, said the ruling was not
just a setback for lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed,'' Grannis said. ``But the real losers are
the citizens of New York, who will never know whether we have
passed a budget because we believed it was the right budget or
because we wanted to get our pay to feed our families.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the legal wrangling it spurred, the law did not produce,
in its first year, anyway, the result its supporters desired: the
adoption of a budget on time. Instead, lawmakers adopted a budget
Aug. 4, 126 days into the current fiscal year, tying the record for
lateness.
</P>
<P>
   To get by, many legislators borrowed money or dipped into their
savings accounts. If anything, some lawmakers said, the law served
only to deepen the hostilities between the Legislature and the
governor, whose pay was not withheld.
</P>
<P>
   For more than two decades, it has been almost impossible for a
timely budget to be adopted in Albany. The budget has been late 21
times since 1975, largely because the Legislature has been divided
during that period, with the Assembly controlled by Democrats and
the Senate in the hands of Republicans. &QL;

KLAN TO SUE CITY AFTER BEING DENIED RALLY PERMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., N.J., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Ku Klux Klan group plans to sue the administration
of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani after being denied a permit to hold a
``white pride'' rally in New York City, leaders of the white
supremacist group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department turned down the Klan's application on
Wednesday night, citing a state law that prohibits people wearing
masks from congregating publicly, except at authorized masquerade
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Klan leaders, who refused to march without their fearsome white
hoods and masks, called the state's antimask law unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our First Amendment right'' to wear masks, said the
rally's organizer, Jeffery Berry, the national imperial wizard of
the Church of the American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. Berry, of
Butler, Ind., said hoods are essential to the Klan. ``It's no
different than a bride wearing her veil, or the wives of Indians
and Arabs wearing theirs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union plans to represent the Klan,
saying that challenges to antimask laws had been successful in
Tennessee and Indiana. ``People have a right to engage in peaceful
rallies, even if their message is repugnant, bigoted and
wrong-minded, which the Klan message is,'' said Norman Siegel,
executive director of the civil liberties group, which has
represented other hate groups that have been denied rally permits.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said Supreme Court decisions protect the right to
anonymous political activity. The masks also protect the identity
of Klan members, who fear political retribution for their extreme
views, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The group applied for a permit to hold a rally of 50 to 80
people outside the state Supreme Court in lower Manhattan on Oct.
23.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration has denied rally permits to other
contentious groups and fought losing court battles to keep them
from marching.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Giuliani praised the Police Department's decision to
deny the permit. ``Why wouldn't you hold a hate organization to the
letter of the law?'' he said, adding that the Klan is a
``disgusting, horrible organization that represents the very worst
of American history, and maybe it represents the very worst of what
can exist in a human soul.''
</P>
<P>
   James Sheely, the Klan's grand dragon for the Realm of New York
and New Jersey, said the American Knights wanted to be the first
Klan group to march in New York City, with its many parades. ``It's
getting to the end of the century, and we should be the ones to
make history in the largest city in the United States,'' he said.

EDITORIAL: NEW YORK LEADS ON CLEAN AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, Oct. 15: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki has decided to force power plants in New York
State to make dramatic cuts in the smokestack emissions that cause
smog and acid rain, beyond the reductions mandated by federal law.
This is a salutary move that will not only help New Yorkers but may
well have important repercussions nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's plan, which needs no legislative approval, would cut
two kinds of pollution _ sulfur dioxide, the main cause of acid
rain, and nitrogen oxide, which causes smog and also contributes to
acid rain. The sulfur dioxide cuts, to be achieved by 2007, would
exceed federal requirements for that year by 50 percent. The
nitrogen oxide cuts would exceed federal targets by about 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The move sends two pointed messages _ one to the Midwest, the
other to Washington. For years, New York and other Northeastern
states have suffered from windblown pollution originating in aging,
coal-fired power plants in a half-dozen or so Midwestern and border
states. Recent calculations by clean-air officials in Albany
suggest that no more than 20 percent of the acid rain problem in
the Adirondacks and other upstate areas arises from the state's own
power plants. However, the Midwestern and border states have argued
that New York has long inflated these figures and, further, should
take action against its own dirty plants before asking them to do
the same. Pataki has now called their bluff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Pataki's plan provides a model for fair competition
in the power industry that Congress, which has not yet figured out
how to deal with the uncertain new world of utility deregulation,
would do well to emulate. Under deregulation, consumers will be
able to buy their power from almost anywhere, and inevitably they
will gravitate to the cheapest producers. Unfortunately, the
cheapest power tends to be produced by the dirtiest plants, those
using plentiful, inexpensive coal. That puts the newer, cleaner but
more expensive gas-fired plants at a competitive disadvantage. The
Pataki plan would level the playing field, at least inside the
state, because New York's coal-fired plants will now have to invest
in expensive systems to filter pollution.
</P>
<P>
   But because consumers will someday be able to buy power from
anywhere in the country _ including coal-fired plants in the
Midwest _ New York's action will count for little unless Congress
levels the playing field nationally, requiring dirty power plants
elsewhere to make similar investments in pollution controls. There
are several bills before Congress that would require such
investments, end the special ``grandfather' clauses that have long
exempted Midwestern plants from federal rules, require significant
investments in clean-air technologies and encourage energy
efficiency and renewable energy sources. But these will go nowhere
without significant White House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, most of the leadership on clean air these days
seems to be found in the Northeast, particularly New York. There, a
political odd couple _ Pataki and Eliot Spitzer, the democratic
attorney general _ have between them devised a creative legal and
regulatory strategy to compensate for Washington's indifference.

 FREDERICK BELEN, 95, HELPED AUTOMATE POSTAL SYSTEM  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick Christopher Belen, a Washington lawyer who helped
speed the work of the country's growing post office through the
establishment of regional distribution centers and the five-digit
ZIP code, died on Wednesday at Arlington Hospital in Virginia. An
Arlington resident, he was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Belen had a long engagement with the U.S. Post Office, before it
became the Postal Service, at a time when its work load increased
many times.
</P>
<P>
   A former congressional aide, Belen had served as counsel, chief
counsel and staff director of the House Post Office and Civil
Service Committee from 1946 to 1961, when he was appointed
assistant postmaster general for operations.
</P>
<P>
   He served as deputy postmaster general, the second in command,
from 1964 to 1969. In addition, he was a former director of special
studies for the department.
</P>
<P>
   He helped to design, start and oversee the automation of mail
processing and delivery. The innovations of the 1960s included a
network of regional distribution centers and the zone improvement
plan inaugurated in 1963, familiarly known as the ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   The code's first three digits denote the section of the country
to which an item is destined, while the next two signal a certain
local post office or zone of the addressee. For being the chief
architect who put the system in place, the Post Office Department
gave him its first Benjamin Franklin Award ``for exceptional
leadership'' in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Lansing, Mich., Belen graduated from Michigan State
University in 1937 and earned a doctor of law degree at George
Washington University in 1942. He then served as an officer in
World War II and helped organize the domestic intelligence and
security operations of the Army Transportation Corps.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the post office, he practiced law, handling
legislative and postal affairs for clients like United Parcel
Service.
</P>
<P>
   He was president of the National Democratic Club, a political
and social gathering place in Washington, in 1974-75.
</P>
<P>
   Belen's survivors include his wife of 56 years, Opal Marie
Sheets Belen; a son, Frederick Jr. of Herndon, Va.; a sister, and
three grandchildren.

<P>
   Thomas Lake, the former president of Eli Lilly &AMP; Co., the
multinational pharmaceutical concern, and former chairman of the
Lilly Endowment, one of the largest private foundations in the
nation, died on Sunday at his home in Carmel, Ind. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was melanoma, said a spokeswoman for the endowment,
Gretchen Wolfram.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a coal miner, Lake was born on Jan. 6, 1919, in
Westmoreland County, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Temple University in Philadelphia and worked
as a pharmacist until he enlisted for service in the Army in 1941.
Upon being discharged in 1945, he became a major in the Medical
Administrative Corps.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career in sales at Eli Lilly in 1946 and became
president in 1973. He retired in 1976 but remained a director until
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, who was also active in the effort to renovate downtown
Indianapolis in recent years, was the chairman of the Lilly
Endowment from 1977 to 1992 and was its president from 1977 to
1984. The foundation is a leading source of grants for education in
theology and for community development projects, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   Lake is survived by his wife, Marjorie; a daughter, Karen Lake
Buttrey of Indianapolis, and one sister, Katherine Snyder of New
Kensington, Pa.

POSTAL SERVICE WILL ALLOW SIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Private mailbox holders will avoid the stigma of
having to identify their addresses as ``PMBs,'' the U.S. Postal
Service has declared.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the agency announced late in the day, customers who
rent mailboxes can also use the number sign -- also known as or the
tic-tac-toe sign -- in their mailing addresses and still expect
their mail will be delivered. The new rule, which is designed to
cut postal fraud, is expected to go into effect in April, USPS
spokeswoman Terri Bouffiou said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision may seem minor -- there's not that much difference,
after all, between a PMB and a . But business owners were furious
when the post office first suggested the PMB change, saying it
would make their legitimate businesses -- previously ``located'' in
Suite 200 or Unit 150, for example -- appear suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of mailbox sites also accused the Postal Service of
trying to drive business to the quasigovernmental agency's own post
office boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision is good news for us because it would have had a
big impact if everyone had to use PMB in their address,'' said
James Bae, manager of Mail Box World in suburban Northridge.
``People would have probably decided just to get a post office box
instead.''
</P>
<P>
   Private companies usually charge $10 to $12 per month, compared
with $5 a month for a post box, but offer additional services such
as mail forwarding, parcel preparation and delivery through
companies like Federal Express.
</P>
<P>
   Briti Haynes, owner and manager of Wall Street Connection in
Tarzana, said many of her customers had expressed reservations
about using PMB as part of the address.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people use us as their business mailing address, and
the PMB would have made them look questionable,'' she explained.
``They didn't like it at all. I don't know what their reaction will
be about the number sign, but I don't think it will be as
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   The USPS, which kicked up a strong negative reaction when it
proposed that all mail destined for privately rented boxes carry
the PMB designation, portrayed its decision as a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new regulations strike a balance between protecting
privacy, supporting small business growth and enhancing our arsenal
in the fight against mail fraud,'' said Chief Postal Inspector
Kenneth Weaver in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   As previously proposed, the new rules will still bar renters
from using the potentially misleading terms suite, office, bureau
or unit No. If those are used, the mail will be returned to sender.

SWISS OFFER IS ANOTHER TEST FOR HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Her name is not as important as her unhappy past,
which comes back to stalk her every now and then.
</P>
<P>
   What you need to know is that she was once a young woman in
Poland, and, being a Jew, she had to flee when the Germans invaded
in 1939. But there was no refuge in the Polish countryside, not for
her. She spent the next years as a slave laborer in a series of
factories in Germany and Poland. The end of World War II found her
in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Later, she made her way to
America and, ultimately, the Lower East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   This unadorned recitation of basic facts does not do justice to
her ordeal. Be assured that she went through a lot. And now, in her
80s, she is reluctantly reliving it all over again so that she can
assert her claim to compensation from a $1.25 billion fund that
Swiss banks propose to create.
</P>
<P>
   You have probably heard of the fund. Through it, the Swiss hope
to wash their hands of lawsuits accusing them of having profited
from the blood, sweat and tears of victims of the Holocaust. Late
next month, a federal judge in Brooklyn is supposed to decide if
this billion-dollar solution amounts to a fair settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there are bureaucratic hurdles to surmount before
anyone sees a dime. One is a questionnaire, with a deadline of next
Friday for completion, asking Holocaust survivors to tell their
stories in detail _ not just Jews but also Gypsies, homosexuals,
Jehovah's Witnesses and people with physical or mental
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page form can be daunting, especially for someone
getting on in years. That was certainly true for the woman from the
Lower East Side, who sought guidance from Beth Zeidel, a social
worker at Selfhelp Community Services, a New York agency that
assists those who suffered Nazi persecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to go get the scraps of paper that she'd kept,'' Ms.
Zeidel said. ``Just having to sit there and go over it again in
this pointed way was traumatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not cry. She does not cry, this particular lady. She's
not a histrionic type. But when she said to me, `I don't want to go
into any more detail,' I knew that was it. We had to stop and have
some tea. It was a way for her to come back to the present.''
</P>
<P>
   This woman is hardly alone in her anxiety. Elihu Kover,
Selfhelp's director of social services, says that since July his
agency has led 1,300 Holocaust survivors through this phase of the
Swiss settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Many are traumatized by having to make another painful journey
through time. Others are confused by a process that has its share
of complexities, including the questionnaire, which is intended
merely to give information to the court. Those qualifying for
possible reparations fall into broad categories, naturally
including people who had Swiss bank accounts, but also those who,
like Ms. Zeidel's client, were slave laborers for companies that
may have banked in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they are not obligated to fill out the questionnaire
to stake a claim, some survivors cannot shake a fear that all will
be lost if they miss next Friday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the confusion is the fact that the Holocaust,
suddenly, is being relived on many fronts. Reparations settlements
are in the works not only with the Swiss banks but also with
European insurance companies, Austrian banks, German companies that
used slave labor and museums holding art once looted by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Billions are at stake. And still ahead is perhaps the trickiest
question of all: how to divvy up the money. Do you simply cut each
victim a check, or do you devise something arguably more creative?
</P>
<P>
   A billion dollars _ or two or three _ will not stretch far if
spread among all Holocaust survivors, estimated by the World Jewish
Congress at 500,000 worldwide and 40,000 in the New York region.
For that reason, some say it would be far more effective to pool
the reparations money, to create a health insurance fund, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Among those urging this solution is Menachem Rosensaft, founding
chairman of the International Network of Children of Jewish
Holocaust Survivors. ``If you provide 10 years' worth of medical
coverage, you will, unfortunately, cover the vast number of the
survivors,'' Rosensaft said.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``unfortunately'' because it is lost on no one that the
clock is running. At Selfhelp, 59 percent of the clients are over
80. For some, it is getting late, very late indeed.

EX-TROJAN BARNUM DELIVERS MESSAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just in case USC wasn't taking its rivalry with
Notre Dame seriously, former fullback Terry Barnum delivered a
fiery speech after practice Thursday, while brandishing the
symbolic Shillelagh, which goes to the winner of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   The usually soft-spoken Barnum, who also played for Alemany
High, forcefully addressed the team on the importance of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``From our half of the rivalry, we need to bring the emotion
back. There needs to be some understanding of what this game
means,'' Barnum said. ``This is a part of their legacy. This is the
game they will remember. There's nothing like playing Notre Dame at
Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnum, who is the business manager for USC's school of Letters,
Arts and Sciences, and is working on his master's degree, was asked
to speak to the Trojans by coach Paul Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what record a team has, this is the game people
remember,'' Barnum said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnum's comments were greeted by applause from the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's got a lot of fire and pride,'' quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst said. ``It's interesting to hear from a guy who didn't do
too well against Notre Dame and UCLA. And how he remembers his time
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he will take the Shillelagh, which is a Gaelic war
club and resembles a wooden mallet, to South Bend and place it in
the locker room for the team to view before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys said don't take it on the plane, we don't
want to give it back,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Running back shuffle: It appears tailback Sultan McCullough and
perhaps even Malaefou MacKenzie or Frank Strong could get more
carries behind starter Chad Morton this week, as Hackett tries to
offer a different look against Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad will take a couple series, then will have another guy
take a series,'' Hackett said. ``Attacking a defense with a guy
that doesn't have the same style can shake them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said McCullough would probably be the No.2 tailback, but
MacKenzie and Strong would also play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about Chad. You need all of them in a game like
this,'' Hackett said. ``You've got to control the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not? Wide receiver Kareem Kelly said it's not easy to
tell if the offense will improve from last weekend based solely on
practice performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always have good practices,'' Kelly said. ``It all depends
on the game on Saturday. We just need to execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Best against the best: Hackett has had USC's first-string
offense going against the first-string defense this week. He said
he would continue this method the rest of the season, as the
Trojans begin holding shorter practices, particularly once daylight
savings time ends.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   A growing wave of lawsuits by cities and states against makers
of tobacco, guns _ and now lead paint _ has reignited a fierce
debate over the role of lawyers and the enormous fees they can earn
in legal actions brought by public officials.
</P>
<P>
   The issue erupted after prominent plaintiffs' lawyers, hired by
state attorneys general to sue cigarette makers, earned billions of
dollars in contingency fees as a result of the $246 billion in
settlements with the companies. Now some of those same lawyers,
whose earnings are contingent upon their winning a percentage of
any jury award or settlement, have been hired by states and cities
to sue gun makers and lead paint producers.
</P>
<P>
   As part of business counteroffensive against the trend, the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce will soon begin an intensive lobbying campaign
to get legislatures to drastically restrict states' use of
contingency lawyers. Recently, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas also
signed a law, backed by companies, that sharply limited the ability
of the state's attorney general to hire contingency-fee lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The question has split legal experts. Economically strapped
elected officials need the skills and resources of outside lawyers
to handle difficult cases, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It levels the playing field because the other side is relying
on very skilled lawyers,'' said Robert L. Rabin, a professor of law
at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   But the interests of those lawyers can conflict with those of
the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees can be out of line with the amount of work and effort
that is actually put in,'' Rabin said.
</P>
<P>
   Some cities suing the gun industry have decided to use their own
lawyers, rather than outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation proposed by the Chamber of Commerce, any
outside lawyer who contributed more than $250 to the campaign of a
public official would be barred from being hired to pursue a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wootton, the executive director of Institute for Legal
Reform at the United States Chamber of Commerce, said that
provision would restrict influence peddling. Plaintiffs' lawyers,
though, have contributed largely to Democratic candidates, while
the business interests they sue have traditionally supported
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The law would also prohibit a state from changing any laws that
could affect litigation while the state was suing an industry or
even contemplating such a lawsuit, Wootton said.
</P>
<P>
   Wootton said limiting the use of contingency lawyers was a vital
issue for industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is one of the biggest threats facing American
industry today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest such challenge came on Tuesday when Rhode Island
Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse said his state would sue eight
paint companies and a lead industry group to seek payment for the
treatment of children poisoned by lead paint and for its removal.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be handled by the law firm of Ness, Motley,
Loadholt, Richardson &AMP; Poole of Charleston, S.C., which represented
some two dozen states in tobacco cases, earning hundreds of
millions in fees in the process. Rhode Island will pay 17 percent
of any award or settlement to the firm, which is financing the
lawsuit and talks with other states about similar actions.
</P>
<P>
   Other tobacco veterans are also posed to jump in. Richard
Scruggs, a Pascagoula, Miss., lawyer who represented that state and
some 20 others against cigarette makers, has had talks with public
officials interested in suing. And Steve Berman, a Seattle lawyer
who represented several states, including Washington, in their
tobacco case, said he has discussed lead paint lawsuits with two
attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have challenged in court contentious industries that
have successfully fought legislative restrictions or regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Many legal experts believe that such high-powered law firms can
play a valuable role in public litigation because they have
financial resources to spend years, if necessary, tracking
documents, interviewing witnesses and aggressively fighting
pretrial motions.
</P>
<P>
   John Coffee, a professor of law at Columbia University said he
believed that it would be a ``disaster'' for the public if the type
of legislation being promoted by the Chamber of Commerce was
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But Coffee also voiced concerns about potential conflicts
between lawyers who donate heavily to the campaigns of officials
who can hire them. And other legal experts said that outside
lawyers could have a financial stake in settling a case that might
be at odds with the broad public's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public might have been interested in getting more
concessions from cigarette companies in return for taking less
money'' said Susan Koniak, a professor of law at Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, the plaintiff's lawyer in Seattle, said he believed that
outside lawyers representing states cut the best deals possible in
striking settlements with tobacco companies. But he acknowledged
that some of the huge legal fees awarded in those cases had fueled
the larger controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, lawyers representing the first three states that
settled _ Florida, Mississippi and Texas _ were awarded $8.2
billion in fees. The staggering fees prompted public uproar,
particularly in Texas, where one lawyer, Mark D. Murr of Houston,
who appeared to play little role in the litigation, sought $260
million in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Faced by a state investigation, Murr, whose request was
supported by the former Texas Attorney General who hired him,
backed down. But this year, Republican lawmakers with the backing
of business groups passed legislation requiring the state attorney
general to have contingency-fee contracts approved by a board
appointed by top state officials. Legal fees could not exceed
$4,000 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Utah legislators also passed a bill this year requiring that
state's attorney general to get approval from the governor before
filing a civil lawsuit. But after state Attorney General Jan Graham
threatened to challenge its constitutionality, she struck a deal
with lawmakers under which her office will keep the governor
appraised of any litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Cities who are heading the legal assault against gun makers have
taken different stances on outside lawyers. While some like New
Orleans, Atlanta and Newark. N.J., have hired lawyers involved in
tobacco cases under contingency deals, others like Chicago are
using their own lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Berman, the Seattle plaintiff's lawyer, said those various
approaches have apparently created some conflicts. Recently, for
example, when lawyers representing several cities suing gun makers
and a few states considering such actions meet with manufacturers
cities who had hired outside lawyers were excluded from the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Along with suing gun makers and paint producers, some of the
tobacco lawyers like Scruggs have also filed actions against health
maintenance organizations, claiming that they failed to provide
policyholders with promised benefits.
</P>
<P>
   And Coffee, the law professor, said he would not be surprised if
similar actions by public entities like cities soon followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look over the horizon, the filings on behalf of state
plaintiffs tend to come after the lawsuits filed on behalf of
individuals,'' he said.

PANEL: ANCIENT KENNEWICK MAN APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN ASIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The controversial bones known as Kennewick Man look
more Asian than European or Native American, potentially
jeopardizing tribal legal claims to the remains.
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed scientific panel concluded in a report
released Thursday that the skeletal remains look most like the
Ainu, an indigenous sub-population in Japan with ancient roots in
southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennewick man has the strongest (skeletal) affinity with
southern Asians, not Native Americans or Europeans,'' said Joseph
Powell, a physical anthropologist at the University of New Mexico
and member of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   But this ethnic identification will not end the battle over who
controls the remains.
</P>
<P>
   New radiocarbon dating tests to be released in a few weeks could
tip the balance in favor of Native American claims.
</P>
<P>
   Should the tests confirm the 9,000-year-old estimate of the
bones, then the federal government is obliged to declare the
remains Native American, said Frank McManamon, chief archaeologist
for the U.S. Interior Department and lead scientist on the
Kennewick Man panel. Under federal law, ``Native American'' is
defined as any population living here before the arrival of
Christopher Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   If existing tribes can then show a direct link to Kennewick man,
they will control the remains and, scientists fear, the bones will
be lost to further study.
</P>
<P>
   Proving a link could require comparing the DNA of Kennewick Man
and existing Native American tribes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it will be necessary,'' said Alan Schneider, the
Portland, Ore., attorney representing scientists suing for access
to Kennewick Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't accept the federal government's time-dependent
definition of Native American,'' Schneider said. The only possible
way for modern Native Americans to establish any direct connection
with these bones, he said, would be if DNA testing demonstrates a
shared genetic history.
</P>
<P>
   Kennewick Man has become a test challenge to the federal Native
American Graves Protection Repatriation Act of 1990, which gives
Indian tribes authority to claim remains deemed Native American.
</P>
<P>
   Eight leading scientists have sued in U.S. District Court in
Portland for the right to examine the remains because the bones
could help with the study of prehistoric human migration in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Magistrate John Jelderks last year convened a panel of
experts to answer the question of whether Kennewick Man is Native
American or not. It was that panel's findings that were released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like asking if the woolly mammoth is either an Asian or
African elephant,'' Powell said. ``We did the best we could.''
</P>
<P>
   But the whole debate is frustrating, Powell said, particularly
since the ethnic identification of such ancient remains may not
mean that much anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were asked to do a (racial) typology of the remains and
stick them into these existing categories,'' he said. ``It's like
saying there are only three colors in the world and we were
supposed to pick one.''
</P>
<P>
   In reality, Powell said, humans should be viewed as a color
spectrum _ especially farther back in time. ``At some point, we all
go back to the same ancestor,'' Powell said.
</P>
<P>
   The question, he said, is whether today's racial categories mean
much when looking at people 9,000 years ago. But that's not the
question the federal judge ordered Powell and his colleagues to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Powell said the bones look most like an Asian type but not much
like modern Asian skeletons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't look like any modern group,'' Powell said. ``What
this means in terms of its connection to the tribes, we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   The connection is not just academic because of the scientists'
challenge of the federal law governing control over ancient
remains.
</P>
<P>
   The law as written is simple, but Kennewick Man shows in
practice it is anything but.
</P>
<P>
   The bones washed out of the Columbia River in Washington state
in July 1996 and immediately became the focal point of a dispute
between local tribes and a group of scientists led by Doug Owsley
of the Smithsonian Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Richland, Wash., archaeologist Jim Chatters initially identified
the bones as an ancient ``Caucasoid'' _ a largely obsolete
anthropological term (like Mongoloid or Negroid) that has
persistently been misinterpreted in media reports to indicate the
bones appeared to be that of an ancient Caucasian.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just won't go away,'' Chatters said Thursday. ``I get
blamed for that but I never said Caucasian. ... I'm exhausted with
all this.''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of ancient Europeans peopling the New World
thousands of years before Columbus was seized upon by some
scientists who sought to block Indian claims on the bones.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Stanford, a Smithsonian anthropologist and one of the
plaintiffs seeking to study Kennewick Man, has repeatedly
emphasized that without study ``you can't rule out'' the chance
that an ancient European somehow ended up on the Columbia Plateau
9,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford is a leading proponent of the notion that Europeans may
have made it to the New World before the Asian migration across the
Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Most scientists believe the Americas were first populated by
ancient Asian people who walked _ or perhaps used boats _ to cross
over from Siberia to Alaska when global sea levels were much lower.
</P>
<P>
   David Meltzer, a paleoanthropologist at Southern Methodist
University, said ``there's no archaeological evidence to support''
Stanford's theory of an early European migration to America.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the myth of the ancient white man prompted a group
devoted to Norse mythology called the Asatru Assembly to also lay
claim to the bones of Kennewick Man based on their belief that he
might be a wayward Viking.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle over control of the remains has severely
limited study of the skeleton. Nonetheless, some information about
the ancient traveler has come to light.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Stein, a University of Washington archaeologist, and Gary
Huckleberry, an archaeologist at Washington State University,
evaluated sediments collected with the bones and found ash from the
massive volcanic explosion of Mt. Mazame nearly 7,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``So it appears to be at least that old,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   John Fagan, a private archaeologist from Portland and an expert
in stone tools, evaluated the spearpoint fragment found embedded in
Kennewick Man's hip. Fagan believes the spearpoint _ a prehistoric
style known as a Cascadia point _ was stabbed in Kennewick Man
sometime during his teenage years.
</P>
<P>
   In general, Kennewick Man was estimated to be a well-muscled man
in his 40s or 50s who had led a rough life.
</P>
<P>
   The bones are being held for the duration of the lawsuit in
secure storage at the Burke Museum on the campus of the University
of Washington.

WHEEL MAKER BENEFITS FROM INDUSTRY SURGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Superior Industries International Inc., a wheel
maker for numerous vehicle manufacturers, is expected to report a
big gain in third quarter earnings Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of six analysts by First Call pegs Superior earnings at
50 cents a share, up from 28 cents in the year ago period.
</P>
<P>
   Superior's earnings report was expected to be issued before the
market opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying we're comfortable with the First Call
estimates,'' said R. Jeffrey Orenstein, the company's investor
relations officer.
</P>
<P>
   The prior year's third-quarter results reflect the impact of a
strike by auto workers against General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   That work stoppage reduced Superior's shipment of wheels to the
big auto maker during the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the company's production is up in step with
that of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For example, BMW said this week 1999 is shaping up to be its
best year in the United States, with sales up 19 percent to 116,308
units through September. The company's global sales are up 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Superior is an original equipment manufacturer for the German
auto maker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superior continues to perform very well and benefit from a
strong industry buildup,'' said analyst Eric Goldstein at Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Hoselton at McDonald Investments Inc. also gives kudos to
Superior's management.
</P>
<P>
   ``The management at Superior is excellent. They have been able
to translate that higher production rate down to their earnings.
These guys are good,'' he said.

EARL EVANS, 89, PIONEERING BIOCHEMIST 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ill., Md.) (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Earl Alison Evans, a pioneering biochemist who built up one
of the nation's leading biochemistry departments at the University
of Chicago, died on Oct. 5 at a hospital in Chicago, where he
lived. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a professor emeritus and former chairman of the
department of biochemistry and molecular biology at the university,
was an early researcher into the use of radioactive isotopes to
study metabolism and the use of a group of viruses known as
bacteriophages to study the workings of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   He also pioneered the use of a short-lived carbon isotope, 11C,
produced in the cyclotron at the University of Chicago by his
colleague Louis Slotkin, and used it to show that animal cells,
like photosynthetic plants, were capable of using carbon dioxide
for the synthesis of carbohydrates, a process called CO2 fixation.
His work with the isotope brought him the Lilly Medal in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, he became chairman of the department and recruited
acclaimed scientists including Konrad Bloch, who won the Nobel
Prize in 1964 for his radioactive-tracer work on cholesterol
biosynthesis. Evans stepped down as chairman in 1972, but continued
to teach until 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Born on March 11, 1910, in Baltimore, Evans earned his
bachelor's degree from Johns Hopkins University and a doctorate
from Columbia University. He joined the faculty at Chicago as an
instructor in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his work at Chicago, Evans spent one year, 1939, as a
research fellow with Hans Krebs, who won a Nobel Prize in 1953.
During World War II, Evans was the principal investigator in
malaria research for the federal government's Office of Scientific
Research and Development. After the war, he was the scientific
attache in the U.S. Embassy in London for two years.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, David Lasswell of Chicago.

MILITARY LEADER DECLARES HIMSELF PAKISTAN'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS throughout; note new byline and dateline) (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ The new military ruler of Pakistan imposed
martial law shortly after midnight Friday, suspending the
constitution, dismissing the Parliament and dashing hopes of a
quick return to civilian rule in the world's newest nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, the army chief who led a brutally
efficient but bloodless coup on Tuesday night, also proclaimed
himself chief executive of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   His soldiers sealed off the Parliament and its legislative
offices here in the capital, and they continue to hold Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and some of his closest aides under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   As dawn broke Friday, the Parliament, the Supreme Court and the
prime minister's headquarters were deserted, without a soldier in
sight.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration came in the form of a broadcast in the middle of
the night. Pakistan's government-run television station, seized by
Musharraf's forces Tuesday night. It displayed, in tose-up,
a copy of what looked like a hastily drafted document declaring
martial law in everything but name. Instead, the document referred
carefully to a ``state of emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole of Pakistan will come under the control of the armed
forces of Pakistan,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The constitution of Pakistan does not permit the army to remove
a prime minister or Parliament unless the military formally
suspends the constitution under martial law.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was drafted Thursday as Musharraf and his
lieutenants met at the army's general headquarters in Rawalapindi
with the figurehead president of Pakistan, Rafiq Taraz, and several
of the nation's leading constitutional scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The coup against the increasingly unpopular prime minister,
Sharif, was a cause for celebration in the streets and the salons
of Pakistan. But the news of the declaration of a state of
emergency may be more sobering.
</P>
<P>
   There had been hope here that Musharraf, whose swift coup was
evidently well prepared and executed, also had a plan to hand
control of Pakistan back to civilian rulers in a matter of days or
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But for now the governance of 135 million people, the leadership
of a 500,000-man army and the control of a simmering political and
military confrontation with India, Pakistan's nuclear-armed
neighbor, is in the hands of a man who, in his own words, is ``not
a political or constitutional expert.''
</P>
<P>
   The army was the last remaining institution in Pakistan with
real power, since Sharif, though he was elected by a landslide in
1997, squandered much of his own power and authority while trying
to strip the courts, the presidency and rival political parties of
theirs. The result, Mussaraf said in his address to the nation this
week, also broadcast in the dead of night, was that ``all the
institutions'' of civil society had ``been played around with and
systematically destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has endured military rule for 25 of its 52 years as a
nation, and some of those years were marked by violent repression.
But the army seized power, in part, because political leaders in
Pakistan repeatedly have proved themselves unable to lead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Sharif was dismissed by the president _ legally, under
the constitution _ for corruption and incompetence; his
predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, was twice dismissed, in 1990 and 1996,
on essentially identical charges.
</P>
<P>
   Though the United States had cautioned against a coup, it has
worked closely with military rulers in Pakistan before. The last
military dictator of Pakistan, General Mohammad Zia ul-Haq,
received more than $3 billion in military aid from the United
States and served as a close confidant of the Central Intelligence
Agency and a Cold War ally of Washington's in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   He died in a still-unexplained air crash in 1988, ending an
11-year reign that began when he arrested and hanged his
predecessor, Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Ms. Bhutto's
father.
</P>
<P>
   International calls for a return to democracy mounted in the
days since the coup. In his news conference on Thursday, President
Clinton addressed the coup's leaders, saying: `` `You should not do
it. It's not necessary, it will hurt your economy and endanger your
future.' That is our message to Pakistan, and we hope they will
move to a civilian government as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf moved quickly to purge the government of potential
enemies. He dismissed and arrested the military intelligence chief,
Lt. Gen. Khwaja Ziauddin, who went to Washington last month to warn
the CIA about the growing likelihood of a military coup. He also
fired the chief of the national airline, Shaheed Kahkan Abbassi,
whom the army accused of conspiring with Sharif to capture or kill
Musharraf as he returned to Pakistan on Tuesday evening on a
commercial flight from Sri Lanka, where Sharif had sent him on an
official visit.
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to have been a coordinated move, the Pakistan
International Airlines jet carrying Musharraf was denied permission
to land at the nation's largest airport, in Karachi, at the very
moment Sharif dismissed the general. As the plane ran short of
fuel, the army, in a swift response, seized the control tower and
within hours had taken control of the nation.

   Musharraf had been Sharif's handpicked choice for army chief a
year ago. But the two men have been at loggerheads over Sharif's
decision to withdraw the Pakistan-backed forces that occupied a
section of Indian-held Kashmir over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The military felt that Sharif had bowed to pressure from Clinton
by agreeing to the pullout, and then tried to blame the military
for the failed military adventure.

K-SWISS PROFITS REBOUND

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- K-Swiss Inc., which has been hammered by Wall
Street recently, reported it had more than tripled its
third-quarter profits to come in at the top end of analysts'
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic shoemaker, which saw its stock decline 30 percent
on Oct. 5 in the wake of a disappointing Y2K orders forecast,
posted earnings Thursday of $9.34 million, or 80 cents a share,
compared with $3.03 million, or 26 cents a share, in the 1998
period.
</P>
<P>
   It had disclosed on Oct. 5 that profits would range between 70
and 80 cents a share, and the First Call forecast from two analysts
tracking the stock was 75 cents. Sales more than doubled to $80.13
million, slightly above the company's forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The impressive numbers, issued after the stock market closed,
may not carry much weight on Wall Street since Steven Nichols,
chairman and president, issued a warning in a statement that opened
by saying he was pleased with the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very nature of the footwear industry and its reliance on
futures orders, however, keeps us constantly looking past immediate
results and focusing at least six months in advance,'' he said.
``Initial indications from our backlog reflect some uncertainty and
cautiousness among retail accounts, a disproportionate share of
which was concentrated in some of our larger customers, due to the
current selling environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichols said selling of current shoes continues to be strong and
the company's research had found strong consumer acceptance of
first-quarter offerings.
</P>
<P>
   K-Swiss stock gained 75 cents to close at $17 a share Thursday
but it has lost more than 40 percent of its value this month and is
70 percent below its all-time high of $57.75 in late May.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-month earnings also more than tripled, rising to $29.36
million, or $2.55 a share, from $8.33 million, or 77 cents a share,
and sales rose 94.1 percent to $235.88 million.
