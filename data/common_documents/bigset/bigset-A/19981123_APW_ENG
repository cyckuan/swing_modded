Death toll rises to 91 in central Vietnam

	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Flooding caused by heavy rains in central
Vietnam has claimed 91 lives, and local officials said Monday the
number was expected to rise as they receive more reports.
	   The floods affected several hundred thousand people in one of
Vietnam's poorest regions. No damage estimate was available, but it
was believed to be in the tens of millions of dollars.
	   Downpours of up to 1.185 meters (nearly four feet) Thursday
through Sunday submerged large swaths of land. Rain was still
falling Monday, so while water levels were receding in some areas,
they still were rising in others.
	   Parts of Highway 1, the major north-south artery, remained
submerged. Only trucks with high clearance were being permitted on
the stretch from Danang to Quang Ngai to the south.
	   The rice paddies that flank the two-lane highway were so heavily
inundated that only the roofs of one-story houses jutted above the
water's surface.
	   On the 30-kilometer (20-mile) stretch from Danang to Hoi An,
crowds gathered at three places to see bodies of drowning victims.
	   The central government said it was providing 2 billion dong
(dlrs 143,000) in relief funds for Danang, where city officials
were using five canoes to ferry in food to about 50,000 people who
were forced to upper floors of their homes in one district.
	   They said it may take many days for the water, two to three
meters (six to 10 feet) deep in some places, to recede.
	   Floods and storm control committees from eight central provinces
said they have provided 1 million dong (dlrs 70) each for burial
costs to families who lost loved ones.
	   The Quang Nam floods and storms control committee said about
200,000 families live in submerged areas in that province alone.
Local authorities are providing food to them.
	   A government delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung is touring the affected areas.
	   Residents of the tourist town of Hoi An were looking for food
and starting to clean the mud from their historic homes and
streets, where motorized traffic traditionally is banned. On
Saturday, the water was 1.8 meters (six feet) deep in some areas.
	   The floods and storm control committees said 24 people had died
in Danang province, 14 in Quang Nam, 16 in Thua Thien Hue, 11 in
Quang Ngai, nine in Binh Dinh, eight in Phu Yen, six in Khanh Hoa
and three in Daklak.
	   Among the fatalities was a Myanmar sailor on a Panama-flag ship
who was strangled by a lifebuoy rope as the ship was being
evacuated after breaking anchor and drifting onto rocks.
	   Two previous floods in the region in the last month killed 69
people and caused dlrs 22 million in damage. Until mid-August, the
region was suffering from its worst drought in at least half a
century.

	   In San Francisco, Steve Young threw two of his four touchdown
passes in a 17-point third quarter, keeping San Francisco a game
behind Atlanta in the NFC West.
	   San Francisco (8-3) was ahead by one point when Young, who had
three first-quarter turnovers, hit a wide-open Garrison Hearst near
midfield. Hearst sprinted untouched to complete an 81-yard
touchdown play.
	   Sean Dawkins' second fumble after a catch preceded Young's
8-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice, putting San Francisco up 28-13
in the third quarter. Young, who passed for 290 yards, also had a
pair of 8-yard scoring passes to Terrell Owens in the second
quarter.
	   Young's performance came after New Orleans (5-6) led 10-0.

North Korea denies infiltrating spy ship into South Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea on Monday denied
infiltrating a spy boat into South Korean waters last week, calling
the allegation an anti-North smear campaign.
	   A suspected North Korean spy boat crossed the fog-shrouded
buffer zone into South Korean waters off the west coast early
Friday but sped away after South Korean marines fired at it.
	   South Korean military investigators concluded that the boat had
attempted to land or ferry back espionage agents in South Korea.
They believed the boat's mission was thwarted before it reached
shore.
	   ``The loudmouthed intrusion incident is a product of
premeditated anti-North smear campaign of the bellicose elements of
the puppet military who seek tense inter-Korean relations and
showdown,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency said.
	   ``They are launching a smear campaign aimed to make an
impression as if the North were a source of the tense situation,
synchronized with U.S. President Bill Clinton's trip to South
Korea,'' it said.
	   During a four-day visit to South Korea which ended early Monday,
Clinton strongly warned North Korea against developing nuclear and
chemical weapons.
	   The North's infiltration attempt led South Korean marines and
navy to go on alert in Kanghwa, a strategic island near the western
sea border with North Korea.
	   Seoul's Defense Ministry earlier denounced the infiltration as a
``reckless provocative move.''
	   An armistice, not a peace treaty, ended the 1950-53 Korean War
and the Koreas remain technically in a state of war. Their border
is the world's most heavily guarded, with nearly 2 million troops
deployed on both sides.

Death toll in Indonesia's ethnic, religious violence rises to 13
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RAISES death toll from 6 to 13 with discovery of bodies in
burned gambling hall; ADDS Habibie comment, student protesters
boycotting classes at one university.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescue workers on Monday pulled seven
bodies from a gutted gambling parlor that was burned by Muslim
mobs, raising the death toll to 13 from ethnic and religious
violence.
	   Many Christian schools, meanwhile, were closed after riots on
Sunday in which mobs of Muslim youths set fire to churches and
attacked Christians. Soldiers patrolled riot-hit areas in north
Jakarta, but there were no fresh reports of unrest.
	   The seven newly discovered victims burned to death or died of
smoke inhalation, said Edward Bachtiar, an official of the
Indonesian Red Cross.
	   Two were members of the ethnic Chinese minority, which is often
targeted during social strife, partly because it dominates trade
and commerce. Also, most Chinese in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia
are Christian or Buddhist.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is at the center of student protests
over his plans to change Indonesia's political system, blamed
unidentified agitators and urged restraint.
	   ``I call on the people not to be easily provoked to take actions
to serve the purpose of a certain group that wants to disintegrate
the nation,'' Habibie said.
	   Without elaborating, a prominent Muslim leader said that thugs
had carefully planned the riots, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid, the head of the country's largest Islamic
group, Nadhlatul Ulama, and opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
condemned the violence.
	   ``We have to be careful with cruel actions made under a
religious pretext,'' they said in a statement.
	   The weekend violence came amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as inflation
and unemployment rates soar.
	   Habibie has been under pressure to speed up his reform program
in the wake of the resignation in May of former authoritarian
leader Suharto. Opponents say Habibie, once a protege of Suharto,
is not serious about introducing true democracy.
	   The Sunday riots broke out a little more than a week after
deadly clashes between students and security personnel also
triggered rioting. As many as 17 people died during the earlier
clashes. The last died Sunday at a hospital.
	   Hundreds of anti-government students boycotted classes at Atma
Jaya Catholic University on Monday, which reopened for the first
time since at least half a dozen students were fatally shot in
fighting around the campus on Nov. 13.
	   Dozens were reported injured in Sunday's clashes between the
Muslim majority and Christians originally from the eastern city of
Ambon.
	   Troops desperate to restore order fired shots and volleys of
tear gas to break up rock-throwing crowds that officials said had
burned four churches and ransacked seven others.
	   Muslim residents who disapprove of gambling burned the betting
parlor and said their attacks were retaliation after rumors that
the Ambonese had attacked mosques.
	   ``We feel very sad because we're still far from the hope of
solidarity between religious communities,'' said Father Roy
Djakarya of the Jakarta Roman Catholic Archdiocese. ``Why do we so
easily judge rumors without thinking about the truth behind them?''
	   On Sunday, the Indonesian Red Cross recovered six bodies,
including five Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken
bottles.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However,
religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy.

Newspaper: British businesses want government to join Euro soon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ More than 100 British business leaders have signed
a statement urging the government to join the European single
currency soon after it is established.
	   The statement, published Monday in the Financial Times, said,
``The best policy for Britain is one based on the assumption that
we will join.'' And the leaders warned that staying out
indefinitely ``would pose a serious threat to our future prosperity
and to our influence in the world.''
	   The business leaders stopped short of asking for a definite
timetable for membership. They also backed Prime Minister Tony
Blair's decision to stay out of the first wave of countries
entering the single currency, but warned the government should not
wait too long before joining.
	   ``Membership of the single currency, if it works well, will
promote trade, investment and economic growth. Each of these help
to create jobs,'' the statement said.
	   It was signed by 114 senior business people, including the heads
of British Aerospace, British Airways, EMI Group and Glaxo
Wellcome. The Financial Times said the estimated combined turnover
of all the companies listed was 200 billion pounds (dlrs 320
billion), equivalent to about 25 percent of the country's gross
domestic product.
	   Eleven members of the 15-nation European Union are committed to
launching the currency on Jan. 1. Blair says he is prepared to join
the Euro when it is in Britain's interest to do so, but has set no
deadline.

Hospitals nationwide on alert for disease from La Nina
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Health Ministry told medical
centers nationwide to be on alert to prevent the spread of disease
from flooding caused by La Nina, news reports said Monday.
	   Flooding is expected in all of Malaysia's 13 states due to
heavier than usual monsoon rains from the La Nina weather
phenomenon. Thousands of people recently have had to evacuate their
homes in three northern states.
	   Abdul Aziz Mohamood, the health ministry's deputy
director-general, said state chiefs have been told to watch for
signs of water-borne diseases such as Hepatitis A, cholera,
typhoid, diarrhea and food poisoning.
	   Hospitals and clinics around the country were told to ensure
they have enough medicine to cope with any outbreaks, Abdul said,
adding that contingency plans should be made to rush victims as
quickly as possible by air, sea and land to medical facilities.
	   He added that state officials have been instructed to maintain
proper hygiene in food preparation at relief centers where flood
victims were currently being housed.
	   ``Food has to be cooked properly for immediate consumption, and
not stored overnight. The toilets need to be clean at all times and
steps must be taken to ensure that rubbish is not strewn all over
to attract flies,'' he said.

Steinbrenner reportedly set to sell Yankees
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with source telling AP no deal has
been completed and that Steinbrenner will not be selling general
partner shares. &QL; 
 &UR; By HAL BOCK &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ George Steinbrenner reportedly has reached an
agreement in principle to sell the New York Yankees to Cablevision
Systems Corp. for dlrs 550 million to dlrs 600 million.
	   As part of the sale, Steinbrenner would remain in charge of
day-to-day operations of the team.
	   NBC Sports said the deal was agreed to on Thursday and called
for Steinbrenner to turn over full ownership of the team to the
cable network for dlrs 600 million.
	   A source familiar with Steinbrenner's negotiations, speaking on
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press no deal has been
agreed to. The source said any sale would involve only
Steinbrenner's limited partner shares and that he would retain his
shares as managing general partner.
	   The managing general partner has control of a team's operations.
	   The Daily News reported the sale would be completed after Jan. 1
for tax reasons and said it called for Cablevision to buy 70
percent of the team for dlrs 550 million.
	   Cablevision president James Dolan, whose father is chairman of
the company, said Sunday he would not comment on ``rumors or
speculation.'' He said Cablevision ``maintains an active interest
in the future of our relationship with Mr. Steinbrenner and the
Yankees.''
	   Howard Rubenstein, who handles public relations for
Steinbrenner, confirmed the Yankees' owner had been talking with
Cablevision chairman Charles Dolan but said there was nothing to
announce.
	   If the deal goes through at either of the reported prices, it
would be a record for a baseball team and the second-highest price
ever paid for a sports franchise behind the pending dlrs 1 billion
sale of the English soccer team Manchester United to Rupert
Murdoch.
	   Earlier this year, Murdoch paid dlrs 311 million for the Los
Angeles Dodgers and Alfred Lerner paid dlrs 530 million last month
for the rights to a National Football League expansion team in
Cleveland.
	   Charles Dolan and his brother, Larry, were finalists for the
professional American football team with a bid of dlrs 500 million.
Earlier, Charles Dolan became a major player in sports with the
purchase of Madison Square Garden and that arena's two pro U.S.
teams, the National Basketball Association's New York Knicks and
the National Hockey League's New York Rangers.
	   Part of that purchase included Madison Square Garden Network,
which holds broadcast rights to the Yankees in a 12-year, dlrs 486
million deal that expires in two years. By purchasing the team,
Cablevision assures itself of retaining those rights, a major asset
for the network.
	   Cablevision, the country's sixth largest cable company, also
owns Radio City Music Hall, a chain of New York City home appliance
stores and the Broadway show ``The Scarlet Pimpernel.''
	   Talks have gone on for some time between the Yankees and
Cablevision and Steinbrenner reported on them to his limited
partners during two days of meetings in Cleveland last week.
	   Steinbrenner, 68, led a group that paid dlrs 10 million to
purchase the Yankees from CBS in 1973. He has seen the value of the
team zoom, particularly with two World Series championships in the
last three years and a record 125 victories last season.

South Korea's Muju to bid to host 2010 Winter Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea's central government will
endorse a provincial government's bid to play host to the 2010
Winter Olympics, a Cabinet minister said Monday.
	   Culture and Tourism Minister Shin Nak-Kyun told a Cabinet
meeting that the Seoul government hopes to stage the 2010 games in
Muju, 200 kilometers (120 miles) southeast of Seoul.
	   Muju hosted the Winter University Games in 1997, a biennial
sports festival mostly for college athletes.
	   South Korea's capital Seoul was host to the 1988 summer
olympics.
	   The Winter Olympic Games so far have been staged only twice in
Asia _ both in Japan in 1972 and 1998.
	   A total of 18 facilities are needed to host the Winter Olympic
Games and Muju plans to use 11 existing facilities and build seven
others, Shin said.
	   The International Olympic Committee is scheduled to select the
site of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games by 2003.
	   The provincial government of North Cholla, in which Muju is
located, plans to submit an official bid for the 2010 Winter
Olympics by 2002.

Singapore ready to assist economically troubled neighbor Malaysia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said
Monday his country is willing to provide funds for economicaly
troubled Malaysia on ``very favorable terms.''
	   Goh did not name a figure, though Singapore is believed to be
ready to put together a substantial aid package for the neighboring
country.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Goh said the aid could take the form of
a direct loan from the Singapore government, a financial guarantee
or a Singaporean purchase of Malaysian bonds.
	   The two countries, whose ties have been strained in recent
months, are also negotiating a new water agreement. Singapore
imports about half its daily water needs from Malaysia.
	   ``The two proposals are win-win, because Singapore will provide
or raise funds for Malaysia on very favorable terms,'' Goh said.
``These funds will help Malaysia meet its financial requirements
and overcome its economic challenge.''
	   Saying negotiations are still under way, Goh said was
``premature to go into details today'' on the amount of funds.

Jones has track world at her feet
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ She's the world's fastest woman.
She's a global superstar. She's a threat to win five _ repeat five
_ gold medals at the 2000 Sydney Olympics.
	   If Marion Jones keeps this up, America might even notice.
	   Track and field is big in Europe but still struggling for
mainstream respect in the country that produces its biggest names.
	   Take Jones, who says she's better known overseas than in the
states. Eager to help revive the sport at home, she realizes the
challenge is formidable.
	   ``It's going to be difficult for me, a young 23-year-old who's
running quite fast, to kind of put the sport on her shoulders in
the U.S.,'' she said. ``There have been so many great athletes that
have come before me and have left the sport now, and if they
couldn't rekindle the sport in the States, it's going to be very
difficult for little old me to do it.''
	   Jones said she prefers to let her stunning results speak for
themselves.
	   ``All I can do is continue to run fast and hopefully have
sensational performances on the track,'' she said. ``It's going to
be everybody else's job to get the word out that track and field in
the United States is the best in the world and it's time we get
recognized.''
	   Jones is getting plenty of international recognition. She was
honored Sunday night in Monaco as the International Amateur
Athletic Federation's female athlete of the year, a prize she also
won in 1997.
	   The men's award at the glittering gala was presented to
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie, who set four world records (2,000
and 3,000 indoors, and 5,000 and 10,000 outdoors) to establish
himself as one of the greatest distance runners of all time.
	   Jones, a former University of North Carolina basketball star,
became the first woman in 50 years to win the 100 meters, 200
meters and long jump at the USA Championships.
	   She compiled an overall winning streak of 37 events that was
snapped only when Heike Dreschler beat her in the long jump at the
World Cup in Johannesburg, South Africa.
	   Jones became the second fastest woman of all-time behind
Florence Griffith Joyner, clocking a best of 10.65 seconds in the
100 and 21.62 in the 200 _ both in Johannesburg.
	   She also won the women's overall IAAF Grand Prix title and was
one of three athletes (along with Gebrselassie and Morocco's Hicham
El Guerrouj) to share the dlrs 1 million Golden League jackpot for
going undefeated in her event.
	   Jones' 1998 feats could be modest in comparison to what she has
targeted in the next two years: a total of nine Olympic and world
championship gold medals, and maybe a world record or two.
	   Jones said she's skipping the entire 1999 indoor season _
including the March 4-7 world indoors in Maebashi, Japan _ to
prepare for her medal assaults at the Aug. 20-29 world outdoors in
Seville, Spain, and the 2000 Olympics.
	   ``Four (golds) is the goal in Seville, setting up for five the
next year in Sydney,'' she said.
	   Jones said she'll compete in the 100, 200, long jump and one or
both of the relays (400 and 1,600 meters) in Seville. She plans to
do all five in Sydney.
	   The long jump is the event in which Jones believes she has the
biggest room for improvement. She had the three longest jumps of
the 1998 season, including two efforts of 7.31 meters.
	   ``I think 7.40 or 7.50 is still possible,'' Jones said.
	   That would put her in reach of the record of 7.52, set by
Russia's Galina Chistyakova in 1988.
	   Jones is also chasing the glamorous records in the 100 (10.49)
and 200 (21.34), both set by the late Griffith Joyner in 1988.
	   ``(The records) mean a lot in the back of my mind,'' Jones said.
``But that's not the goal when I step on the track. It would be
great for the records to fall in any race. But I'm not going to say
that's going to happen. Maybe down the line in a couple years.''
	   A Russian reporter wanted to know how Jones wants to be called
now that she's married. She wed U.S. shot putter C.J. Hunter in
Raleigh, North Carolina, on Oct. 3.
	   ``Jones,'' she said. ``Just Jones.''
	   Remember the name.

Indonesian banks to tap U.S. Export-Import Bank loan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Seventeen Indonesian banks are to open
letters of credit to tap a dlrs 1 billion trade-financing loan
provided by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a local newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The daily Bisnis Indonesia quoted Nana Supriana, the deputy head
of international affairs at Bank Indonesia, the central bank, as
saying seven of the banks are state-owned banks.
	   The remaining 10 are private banks licensed to conduct
foreign-exchange transactions.
	   He said half of the trade-financing loans were allocated to
state banks.
	   Nana didn't disclose the names of the banks. He said each of the
private banks is entitled to open letters of credit of up to dlrs
50 million.
	   Several countries have pledged trade-financing loans to
Indonesia to back letters of credit because of a widespread lack of
confidence in the country's banks.

World Bank says a second crisis looms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK THORNTON
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Poor people displaced by Asian
economic problems could cause an environmental crisis as they
attempt to scratch subsistence livings in local forests, a World
Bank official said Monday.
	   Dr. Ken Newcombe, senior environmental adviser to the World
Bank, said he calls environmental degradation ``the other Asian
crisis.''
	   ``What is happening behind the scenes has become the dark side
of the Asian miracle,'' Newcombe said.
	   He and other World Bank environmental experts are visiting
Australia hoping to find a way to alleviate the environmental
disaster they see as imminent.
	   ``The wealth crisis put poorer people back onto the subsistence
economy as the market collapsed and these people are falling back
on the forests,'' Newcombe said.
	   He hopes Australia will encourage regional nations to invest in
their future by saving their forests.
	   Newcombe said forest protection is an essential step in
mitigating the effects of greenhouse gases and their negative
effects on the world's climate.
	   His delegation hopes to persuade Australia to push for
sustainable use of developing countries' forest resources and to
join the World Bank and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) as
founding members of a Global Forest Alliance.
	   Newcombe said the alliance aims by 2005 to get countries to
place 50 million hectares (123,550 acres) of new forest under
protection plus 200 million hectares (494,200 acres) of the world's
production forests under independently certified sustainable
management.
	   ``The alliance is about nothing more than capturing the best
team and bringing them to bear on forest loss and degradation,'' he
said.

European Union, Vatican urge Philippines not to resume executions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The European Union and the Vatican
have urged the Philippines to cancel its first execution in 22
years and repeal the death penalty, Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said Monday.
	   The scheduled execution of Leo Echegaray, convicted of
repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, has triggered a
debate over the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   Siazon said the European Union and the Vatican recently sent
messages urging the government to abolish capital punishment,
arguing it would not reduce widespread crime.
	   President Joseph Estrada has been informed of the appeals but is
unlikely to change his earlier decision not to pardon Echegaray,
Siazon said. ``We have our national laws. We have to follow the
law,'' he told reporters.
	   Estrada said Echegaray's execution would deter similar crimes.
	   Last week, Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court issued an order to National Prisons Director Pedro
Sistoza to execute Echegaray. Ponferrada fixed an execution date
but ordered Sistoza not to reveal it publicly.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said the execution would likely
occur next year.
	   Sources at the justice department say the earliest date that
could be set for the execution is Dec. 16, when all legal
requirements, including the publication of revised execution rules,
would be completed. However, an execution is unlikely at that time
because of the Christmas season, forcing officials to postpone it
until sometime in January.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Under government rules, Echegaray would only be informed of his
impending execution after sunrise on execution day. Lawyers have
appealed to Ponferrada to inform Echegaray of the execution date so
he could prepare for it but the judge turned down the request.
	   Prison chaplain Roberto Olaguer said Echegaray has accepted his
fate but is requesting that Philippine officials allow him to
formally marry his common-law wife before he is put to death.
Echegaray has four children with her and a stepdaughter whom he was
convicted of raping.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for heinous crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter crime, and that
crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

U.S. Ambassador summoned to Malaysia's foreign ministry
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Malaysia
was summoned to the foreign ministry Monday to hear Malaysia's
opinion of Vice President Al Gore's support for an anti-government
movement.
	   ``We reiterated Malaysia's position that Gore's speech was an
incitement of lawlessness and not simply a call of democracy as
claimed,'' Foreign Ministry undersecretary John Tenewi Nuek was
quoted as saying by the government news agency, Bernama.
	   The U.S. embassy did not immediately return phone calls.
	   In a controversial speech last week, Gore praised the ``brave
people of Malaysia'' who have demanded democracy in line with the
political reform movement started by jailed former deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad commenting Sunday on Gore's
remarks called them ``disrespectful'' and ``offensive.'' Foreign
Minister Abdullah Badawi has said the remarks were tantamount to
inciting violence and supporting terrorism.
	   On Friday, U.S. Ambassador John Malott defended Gore, saying he
only called for democracy and was not inciting people to violence.
	   The foreign ministry also conveyed to Malott that Malaysians
were ``shocked'' by his statement that appeared to question
democracy in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   Malott, in an interview with a local newspaper, had said
Malaysia could not be called a democracy just because it held
elections. Mahathir, now Asia's longest-serving leader, has been in
power 17 years.
	   ``Democracy is not simply having elections,'' Malott said in the
interview. ``Stalin held elections. Even Hitler held elections.
Democracy is a process of allowing all views to he heard, of
allowing the competition of ideas.''
	   Nuek told Malott that countries should not comment on the
affairs of other nations.
	   ``Such an idea will only lead to the law of the jungle in the
relation between countries,'' Nuek said.
	   Malott was quoted by Bernama as saying relations between the
United States and Malaysia were ``much better than (people) think
it is.''
	   ``In the long-term, I have nothing but optimism for our
relationship,'' the U.S. ambassador said.

Asia is front line against global TB epidemic, WHO boss warns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with news conference.
 &UR; By PATRICK McDOWELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Global efforts to control a
tuberculosis emergency risk failing unless the disease _ the top
infectious killer of adults _ is contained in Asia, the World
Health Organization warned Monday.
	   Gro Harlem Brundtland, WHO director general, urged governments,
donors and international organizations to bring political will to
bear in a new, global anti-TB initiative to stop the spread of the
disease and prevent more deadly forms from developing.
	   ``Our ability to control TB pivots on Asia _ now the epicenter
of the world,'' said Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway.
``If we cannot control TB in Asia, we will never stop TB
globally.''
	   Brundtland's appeal came in videotaped remarks prepared for the
opening of a four-day Global Congress on Lung Disease, bringing
together 1,500 lung disease experts from 90 countries. It is the
largest such meeting held in Asia in a decade.
	   The WHO fears that the Asian economic crisis could lower living
standards and increase the spread of communicable diseases, while
state health programs face funding cuts.
	   Six Asian countries _ Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia,
Pakistan and the Philippines _ account for 4.5 million of the 8
million new cases of tuberculosis illness a year, the WHO
estimates.
	   ``A disease that many of us believed might disappear in our
lifetime is killing more people than ever today,'' said Richard
Bumgarner, senior management officer of the WHO's tuberculosis
program.
	   Globally, nearly 3 million of those who become sick with
tuberculosis every year die, making it the worst infectious disease
killer among people older than five. Childhood vaccinations for
tuberculosis wear off in adulthood. There is no adult vaccine.
	   Though tuberculosis is curable, normal treatment is a six-month
program of taking medicine daily. Many people, especially the poor,
stop after a month or so, once they start feeling better.
	   That can leave the strongest TB bacilli still in the lungs,
resistant to drugs and ready to infect new people. This
multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis _ MDR-TB to specialists _ costs
100 times more to treat and usually proves fatal.
	   The evolution of drug-resistant tuberculosis is converging with
the spread of AIDS, which destroys the immune system that normally
prevents tuberculosis infection from developing into illness.
	   The WHO estimates a window of opportunity exists over the next
decade to prevent a tuberculosis explosion.
	   In a report released Monday, the WHO said the best hope of
curing patients and preventing the spread of drug-resistant
tuberculosis is to get sick people to finish their treatment.
	   The most workable way is called DOTS, or Directly Observed
Treatment, Short-course. It means getting someone to physically
observe a TB patient take his medication every day _ volunteers,
health workers, a work supervisor _ and monitor their progress
until they are cured.
	   The WHO says that more than 100 countries are using DOTS. In the
half of China where the system has been introduced, the cure rate
for tuberculosis has risen to 95 percent.
	   Though the system is labor intensive, the World Bank has judged
it cost-effective when the costs of drug-resistant TB treatment,
lost wages and other factors are taken into account. A WHO study
suggested it could save Thailand dlrs 2.3 billion over the next 20
years.
	   In many countries, tuberculosis is an invisible problem since it
usually affects the poorest people. The affluent are able to afford
medication through the six-month period of treatment.
	   But with the drug-resistant strains, that could change _ the
treatment costs 100 times as much.
	   Donald A. Enarson of the International Union against
Tuberculosis and Lung Disease said that worldwide, tuberculosis
patients suffered greater social stigma than lepers and AIDS cases.
	   Enarson was at a loss to explain the stigma, since the disease
is curable, other than that it was transmitted by breathing.
	   ``You can alter your sexual behavoir,'' Enarson said, comparing
the transmission of AIDS against TB, ``but you can't alter your
breathing.''

Three Thai students arrested for robbery, attempted murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Police arrested three Thai teenagers in
connection with several armed robberies, including one in which
they allegedly shot a man in the eye as he and his wife were
waiting for a bus, a Thai newspaper reported Monday.
	   Police said the three were responsible for at least 10 robberies
around the capital in the past two months, The Nation newspaper
reported.
	   Two of the suspects are technical college students aged 18 and
19 while the third, also 19, is a former student from the same
school.
	   The gang, police said, usually attacked victims at night, at bus
stops and even on some city buses.
	   The three suspects face charges of attempted murder, armed
robbery, and illegal possession of firearms, the newspaper said.
	   The arrests came a week after a much-publicized case involving
five technical college students who allegedly sexually abused two
teenage girls on a city bus before taking them away to be raped,
with no intervention by passengers or conductors.

Philippine stocks close at six-month high; index up 4.4 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The main index on the Philippine
Stock Exchange rose sharply Monday to a six-month high, boosted by
gains on Wall Street, a strong peso and persistent speculation over
negotiations for control of the country's leading
telecommunications company, traders said.
	   Slack demand for dollars lifted the peso in early trading. At
midday the dollar averaged 39.532 pesos, down from Friday's average
of 39.567 pesos.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index climbed 80.57
points, or 4.4 percent, to 1,922.26 after advancing 22.68 points
Friday.
	   Monday's surge placed the index 2.8 percent higher than its
end-1997 close of 1,869.23, and above the 1,900-point mark for the
first time since June 10, when it closed at 1917.89.
	   The broader All Shares Index rose 22.27 points to 614.09 after
gaining 8.86 points Friday. Gainers beat losers 84 to 26, with 31
issues unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. remained the main focus
of trades, capturing around 18 percent of total volume as it
advanced 45 pesos to 1,085 pesos.
	   Other blue chips followed suit, with property stocks showing the
heftiest gains on expectations of softening interest rates.
	   Russell Ong, analyst for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities, said the
market surge confirmed a turnaround in investor sentiment.
	   However, he expressed concern over the fast pace of the market's
advance. ``It's getting overheated ... there could be a
correction,'' he said, advising investors to start taking profits.
	   F. Yap Securities analyst Grace Cerdenia said local developments
are underpinning the market's rise, such as the peso's gains
against the dollar, softening interest rates and speculation over
PLDT.
	   Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. has been seeking control of PLDT
and is still in talks with major shareholders of the Philippines'
dominant telephone company.
	   Over the weekend, a local newspaper said the deal had been
closed and that First Pacific's local flagship, Metro Pacific
Corp., would be the main beneficiary since a foreign company can
own no more than 40 percent of a telecommunications concern.
	   The stock exchange briefly suspended trading of Metro Pacific
Monday until it denied any involvement in the deal.

Clinton visits Guam after cheering troops in South Korea
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES with more Clinton remarks. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAGATNA, Guam (AP) _ After spotlighting American military might
in South Korea, U.S. President Bill Clinton paid respects Monday to
the thousands of Americans killed in liberating this Pacific island
from a harsh occupation in World War II.
	   Clinton also promised the people of Guam to ensure ``that your
voices are heard in Washington, that you are treated fairly and
sensitively by the federal government, that you are consulted
before policies are made that affect your lives.''
	   While residents of Guam are American citizens, they cannot vote
for president and they are represented in Congress by one
non-voting delegate in the House. Clinton won cheers with a pledge
to turn over to Guam 7,300 acres (2,950 hectares) of federal
property including the former naval air station and ship repair
facililty.
	   At a hilltop overlooking the sea, the president placed a wreath
at a war memorial engraved with the names of Americans and
Guamanians who were killed a half century ago. He looked down at
the beach where the Americans from the 3rd Marine Division landed
to lead the liberation struggle.
	   He opened his visit with remarks to leaders of Guam, the
Northern Marianas, Samoa, Micronesia, Palau, the Marhsall Islands
and Micronesia. Clinton said U.S. ties with the islands ``have
enabled us to work together to preserve peace, to foster economic
development across more than a million square miles of the Pacific.
It is a relationship the United States takes very seriously.''

East Timorese students occupy council building in protest against
</HEADLINE>
military

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 East Timorese students
occupied the provincial Parliament Monday amid reports that the
Indonesian military killed more than 40 people last week.
	   The students demanded a total withdrawal of troops from the
former Portuguese colony.
	   Earlier East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop
Carlos Belo, said he had received reports that between 30 and 40
people were killed by Indonesian troops in a series of clashes with
rebels fighting for independence.
	   The alleged slayings took place near the villages of Alas and
Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili.
	   Belo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996, said that only 11
bodies had so far been identified.
	   East Timorese groups in Portugal claim that as many as 50 people
might have been killed.
	   Mario Carrascalao, a former governor in East Timor and now an
adviser to Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, told the Portuguese
news agency Lusa that at least 44 people were killed.
	   The Indonesian military has denied the reports that it massacred
rebels.
	   About 100 riot officers watched as university and senior high
school students forced their way into the Parliament where they
staged a noisy but peaceful rally.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim over the
disputed territory. However, it has been sponsoring talks between
Portugal and Indonesia over East Timor's future.
	   Indonesia has offered to give East Timor autonomy in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was
seriously disturbed by reports of civilian casualties.
	   Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia following reports of
a massacre, Foreign Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said in
Lisbon.

Philippine economy seen sliding into recession in third quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Economists said Monday they believe
the Philippine economy slipped into recession during the third
quarter because of heavy crop losses and lower manufacturing
output.
	   But they said the recession is expected to be brief, with growth
likely to return in the fourth quarter as the impact of declining
interest rates and a more stable peso feed through to the economy.
	   The third-quarter figures are to be announced later this week.
	   While the fall in agricultural output in the third quarter was
not as severe as many economists feared, drought-inflicted crop
losses, coupled with a weak manufacturing sector, are expected to
have caused the economy to slide into recession in the
July-September period, the economists said.
	   Farm production declined 3.23 percent in the third quarter after
falling 11.2 percent in the second quarter.
	   The economists forecast that gross domestic product contracted
by between 0.3 percent and 0.7 percent in the third quarter after
shrinking 1.2 percent in the April-June period. Two successive
quarters of contraction mean that an economy is in recession.
	   The gross national product, which includes money sent home by
millions of overseas Filipino workers, is expected by some
economists to have risen by up to 0.3 percent and by others to have
contracted by roughly the same amount.
	   ATR Securities Inc. economist Luz Lorenzo said relatively strong
performances from the retail and financial services sector helped
support the economy in the third quarter, but the manufacturing
sector continued to be depressed.
	   The manufacturing sector posted a 17 percent drop in its volume
of production in August, with imports of capital goods and raw
materials used in manufacturing falling markedly over the past
several months as economic activity slowed as a result of the
regional financial crisis.
	   Joey Cuyegkeng, research head of ING Barings's Manila office,
said the government's hopes that gains in the services sector would
largely offset the impact of the weak agriculture sector are
unlikely to have occurred.
	   ``I'm not that confident about the performance of the services
sector,'' he said, citing weak bank lending and scant growth in the
transport sector.
	   Lorenzo believes that growth should pick up in the fourth
quarter as the impact of lower interest rates and the stable peso
feed into the economy.
	   But she notes that two devastating typhoons that swept across
the Philippines in October, causing heavy crop damage, may also
have damped fourth-quarter growth.
	   For the full year, the government expects the economy will grow
by between 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent, while many private-sector
economists believe growth will come in just above zero.
	   Budget Secretary Benjamin Diokno said Monday that the
government's growth target is still attainable, and that the
third-quarter data may not be as bleak as some fear.
	   GDP in the third quarter ``could go either way, positive or
negative. But we're still optimistic that we'll end up with
positive growth for entire year,'' he said.
	   In 1999, the economy should get a boost from a sustained period
of low interest rates, helped by the absence of the El Nino weather
condition that ravaged the agricultural sector this year.
	   The government is targeting GDP growth of between 1 percent and
3 percent and GNP growth of between 1.5 percent and 3.5 percent in
1999. Its inflation goal is 8.5 percent.

Habibie promises 1999 election will be held on time
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Refuting allegations that he is
maneuvering to stay in power, President B.J. Habibie on Monday said
he was committed to holding 1999 general elections on time.
	   Habibie, who took office in May after riots and protests helped
dislodge his authoritarian predecessor and onetime mentor Suharto,
has pledged to hold elections in late May or early June.
	   ``I want to reassure the people that there is no plan from my
side and the Cabinet to delay the election,'' Habibie said in a
speech to 600 business executives at the state palace.
	   On Nov. 13, the nation's highest legislative body wrapped up a
four-day session on political reforms that was marred by deadly
clashes between student protesters and security forces. Students
have accused the government of stalling on democratic reform.
	   Habibie, who has said he intends to stand as a presidential
candidate, pledged to quit after the election if the 1,000-member
People's Consultative Assembly meets and elects a new leader.
	   ``The new assembly can elect a new president either a week
after, or anytime they are ready,'' he said.
	   Habibie had originally said the assembly would choose a new
president in December 1999, but dropped that plan after opposition
leaders urged a more prompt presidential poll. The assembly
consists of all 500 Parliament members as well as presidential
appointees.
	   Habibie said he had invited students to join a monitoring
committee that will ensure a free and fair election.
	   He said he has accepted an offer from the United Nations
Development Program to help with the elections. Offers of help have
also come from the United States, Japan, Australia, Germany and
France, he added.

	   Yeltsin has been staying at his country home outside Moscow in
recent weeks after falling ill in October with respiratory
problems. The president's doctors said he was suffering from high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   The president has rarely been seen in public in recent weeks,
raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation of possible new elections.

	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.
	   Yeltsin's wife, Naina, said recently that the president is
struggling with the very cold weather that has hit Moscow in recent
weeks, but that he was capable of handling his duties.

From guns to books: Law review editor recalls days in Chinese gang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NYR 110
 &UR; By BETH GARDINER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It's only a half-hour subway ride from gritty,
crowded Chinatown to the upper Manhattan campus of Columbia
University, where earnest law students hustle purposefully from
classroom to library.
	   But Lawrence Wu, editor-in-chief of the Columbia Law Review, has
come a lot farther than that since he wore his hair spiked and
bleached and quit high school to join a Chinese gang.
	   As a teen-ager, he patrolled his gang's turf on East Broadway
and shook down shopkeepers for protection money. Today, at 23, he
screens scholars' briefs for publication and writes essays on the
legalities of human cloning.
	   ``It's like I've lived really different lives,'' says Wu,
leaning back in his chair at the Law Review's well-outfitted modern
office. ``What's important to me has changed so dramatically. When
I think back to that time, it's like I'm trying to think of someone
I used to know.''
	   As a gang member, Wu narrowly escaped a drive-by shooting and
then an attempted murder charge that scared him out of gangland for
good.
	   ``Things really could have been so different for me,'' he says.
``I could be sitting in jail now, or I could have been dead.''
	   Instead, he's starting his third and final year at one of the
nation's toughest law schools and preparing for a career as a
corporate tax attorney. As law review editor, he's reached the top
of the academic heap.
	   Wu, neatly dressed in a button-down shirt and khaki pants, says
it was ordinary teen-age rebellion that drew him to the gang.
	   Born to Chinese immigrant parents in Woodside, Queens, he was
raised by his mother, a librarian, who moved the family to the
wealthier Forest Hills neighborhood when Lawrence was in junior
high. He then won admission to Stuyvesant High School, one of the
city's most competitive public schools.
	   But during his first year, he began skipping classes, picking
fights and hanging out with gang wannabes who dressed in black and
spiked their hair. Wu, who was 6 when his father left the family,
says he felt drawn to the rule-breakers by a desire to lash out
against his mother, a demanding disciplinarian.
	   ``I was just looking to rebel, like a bomb waiting to explode,''
he says. ``It seemed perfect at the time.''
	   What began as a desire to look cool soon escalated into
something more serious. Wu joined a Chinatown gang called Tung On,
or T.O., when he was 14.
	   He dropped out of Stuyvesant, began sleeping at gang apartments
in Chinatown and Flushing, Queens, and cut off contact with his
family for more than a year and a half.
	   The high school's ``gangsters'' were ``all very cosmetic, but in
Chinatown ... things are very different,'' Wu says. ``When I was
there the big thing was controlling heroin and running guns.''
	   T.O.'s leaders also had their hands in prostitution and extorted
money from small Chinatown businesses, Wu says. His own role was
low-level _ he never rose beyond street thug, he says, because he
didn't prove his loyalty by committing murder.
	   ``There were times when I came very close, when I was on runs to
do killing missions but the person wasn't there,'' Wu says. ``I
proved myself because I got into a lot of fights, but I hadn't done
the ultimate yet.''
	   He recalls strolling along a street in the heart of a rival
gang's territory with a gun stuck up a sleeve of his jacket, hoping
someone would give him an excuse to use it. Nobody bit.
	   ``I would have gotten caught for sure,'' he laughs now. ``It
would have been the end of me.''
	   T.O. was the enforcement arm of a larger tong, or Chinese
fraternal organization, said Peter Kwong, a Chinatown gang expert
and director of Asian-American studies at Hunter College.
	   Wu says he had already begun to think about leaving the gang
when police charged him with attempted murder for a fight in which
a fellow gang member allegedly beat a man with a metal lock. The
case never went to trial, and charges against Wu were eventually
dropped, he says.
	   Frightened by the close call, however, he decided to get out and
moved back home with his family.
	   ``It was a harrowing experience,'' he said. ``It kind of woke me
up.''
	   Wu became Christian and began hanging out again with high school
friends, although he never re-enrolled at Stuyvesant.
	   While his old gang pals were arrested in a police crackdown, Wu
was planning for college. He studied for the high-school
equivalency exam and was accepted at Queens College, where he
struggled to make up for the more than 2 1/2 years of school he'd
missed.
	   Before long, though, he was back on track, earning A's and
dreaming of becoming a lawyer.
	   At Columbia, he works between 40 and 100 hours a week at the law
review and recently won more than dlrs 30,000 from the Paul and
Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans.
	   Many of Wu's classmates at Columbia are shocked to discover the
unassuming editor didn't finish high school, said one friend, Banu
Ramachandran, writing and research editor at the review.
	   ``Most of all when I think of Lawrence, I think of somebody who
is just really friendly and reasonable and down to earth and
respectful of other people,'' she said. ``You don't meet very many
people who get to go to Columbia law school who've really had rough
lives.''
	   Wu's big brother James, 29, remembers worrying about Lawrence
during his gang days but says he never doubted he'd turn himself
around.
	   ``He got lost,'' James Wu said. ``He simply rejected authority
and went the way of the wild. ... He got caught up in that crowd,
and he got swept away, but he found himself again. ... I knew that
he would find his way.''

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: COMBINES previous, ADDS new details on Yeltsin's temperature,
other details &QL;  &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital
with what doctors described as a very high temperature and
pneumonia in the latest health crisis for the Russian leader,
officials said Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics, but the
officials declined to give further details.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin was to meet in the hospital Monday with visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, the Kremlin said.
	   The president has rarely been seen in public in recent weeks,
raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang were to sign a statement on border
demarcation. The summit _ Jiang's sixth meeting with Yeltsin _ will
focus on broad issues of expanding Russian-Chinese cooperation.
	   Yeltsin has been staying at his country home outside Moscow in
recent weeks after falling ill in October with respiratory
problems. The president's doctors said he was suffering from high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.

Cambodian leader Hun Sen says posts in new coalition already
</HEADLINE>
settled &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's top two political parties
have agreed on the division of Cabinet posts in a new government,
Prime Minister-elect Hun Sen said Monday.
	   Bitter enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and coalition
partner Prince Norodom Ranariddh were to meet later Monday to
discuss final details of the government before the new parliament
convenes Wednesday.
	   Hun Sen told reporters after a morning meeting with his outgoing
co-prime minister, Ung Huot, that his Cambodian People's Party and
Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party had reached agreement on which party
will control each Cabinet post.
	   ``The ministries have already been divided up. Everything has
already been agreed upon. What remains to be decided is who will be
the ministers and secretaries of state in the ministries,'' Hun Sen
said.
	   A list obtained Monday of the distribution of ministries,
described as a draft produced by the two parties last week,
indicated as expected that Hun Sen's CPP will have firm control of
fiscal and administrative functions in the new government.
	   The ministries of finance, industry, commerce, planning,
agriculture, public works and foreign affairs will all be
controlled by the CPP, according to the list.
	   FUNCINPEC politicians will head the ministries of justice,
tourism, information, health, rural development and education.
	   The list showed Hun Sen's party controlling 13 ministries and
Ranariddh's party 12, with the two sides sharing the defense and
interior portfolios with co-ministers.
	   Pok Than, a FUNCINPEC official closely involved in the
negotiations, confirmed Monday that the ministries had been divided
up, but said he did not know specifics.
	   After more than three months of political deadlock following the
CPP's narrow victory in July parliamentary elections, Hun Sen and
Ranariddh met at a Nov. 13 summit and agreed to form a coalition
government.
	   The deal will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh
president of the National Assembly. Key to the agreement was the
formation of a new Senate as an upper house of parliament to be led
by CPP President Chea Sim.
	   Hun Sen said Monday that he and Ranariddh would complete a joint
political platform later in the day to be presented to the National
Assembly along with the new Cabinet.
	   A new government is expected to see a return of the foreign aid
and investment that was sharply curtailed last year after Hun Sen
ousted Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup.
	   A legitimate government should also allow Cambodia to reclaim
its seat at the U.N. General Assembly _ under dispute since the
coup _ and make the nation eligible for entry into the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ``All domestic and external affairs require a new government,''
Hun Sen told reporters. ``The living standards of the people and
Cambodia's role in the international arena require a new government
to serve in all fields.''

U.N. envoy head back to Baghdad amid clash on arms documents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Shah departure to Baghdad, newspaper editorials;
CHANGES headline and byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By LEON BARKKHO
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan headed back to Iraq on Monday as Iraq unleashed a new
volley of criticism at the chief U.N. weapons inspector over his
demand for arms-related documents.
	   The papers sought by Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, is spurring a new confrontation between the
government of Saddam Hussein and Butler's UNSCOM which oversees
destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
	   On Sunday, two leading Iraq officials derided Butler's request
as a move to justify a U.S. military strike on Iraq, saying the
government already had turned over all documents relevant to the
arms inspectors' work.
	   Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, left the Gulf state
of Bahrain Monday on a flight to Baghdad. He refused to comment
about the latest controversy as he departed.
	   Monday's state-run Iraqi newspapers said a personal grudge
against Iraq was behind Butler's new demand for documents.
	   ``Butler has personal motives to create a new crisis,'' the
daily Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in a
front-page editorial signed by editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi.
	   ``He (Butler) has explained Iraq's decision to let the
inspectors resume their activities .... as a personal victory which
he believes will enable him to take revenge on Iraq,'' the paper
said.
	   Iraq had asked for Butler's dismissal from UNSCOM as one of its
demands for allowing U.N. weapons inspectors to return to work in
the country.
	   But it reversed its ban on the inspectors' work Nov. 14 when
faced with a likely air strikes by U.S. and British forces in the
Gulf.
	   The arms inspectors returned last week and have been making
visits to potential weapons-making sites daily, with the
cooperation of the Iraq government.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq
insists it has already gotten rid of all proscribed weaponry.
	   Butler's weekend demand for new documents again raises the
prospect of possible American military strikes against Iraq since
U.S. President Bill Clinton had demanded full cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In Korea, where Clinton is visiting, a spokesman for the
National Security Council referred to Iraq's refusal to hand over
documents as an ``insufficient'' response, but said no final
conclusion had been made about the Iraqi move.
	   The spokesman, David Leavy, raised the prospect of an attack,
saying: ``If we conclude Iraq does not intend to live up to its
commitments and UNSCOM can't do its job, we remain prepared'' to
carry out air strikes Clinton canceled last week.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Monday said Butler's demands
were either intended to provoke an attack or to put off a promised
Security Council review of Iraq's cooperation in arms destruction
that the government hopes will lead to easing the sanctions.
	   He said some of the documents requested no longer exist, and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said that Iraq already
has given U.N. inspectors all relevant documents amounting to more
than two million pages.
	   He said Butler was leading ``a savage campaign ... of
disinformation'' to make it seem as if Iraq was not cooperating.
	   Asked if he thought the dispute over documents could provoke
more threats, al-Sahhaf said that U.N. resolutions don't ``say that
if you do not hand over a document that three cruise missiles will
hit your country.''
	   He added: ``This is ridiculous. So whatever party is threatening
that, he will bear the responsibility for that.''
	   Iraqi officials have said they are prepared to let the
inspectors see relevant portion of one requested document _ a log
of chemical weapons used during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. But
they said some of the document concerned Iraq's national security
and could not be shown to the inspectors.

Malaysian Muslims required to get flu shots for Mecca
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Some 35,000 Malaysian Muslims will
be required to get flu vaccinations before setting out for the
annual pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest site.
	   Too many Malaysian pilgrims got sick while mingling with more
than 2 million other Muslims from 100 countries this year in the
annual rite known as the hajj, said Abdul Aziz Mahmood, deputy
director-general of the health ministry.
	   ``Our clinics in the Holy Land were congested with patients,''
Abdul was quoted as saying in the Star newspaper. ``Some of them
could not perform the hajj while some passed away due to
respiratory and lung problems.''
	   Before leaving for next year's rite in the Saudi Arabian city,
some 35,000 Malaysians already registered with the government will
have to be inoculated against flu and meningitis, Abdul said.
	   He added that the shots were most important for the elderly,
children and those with asthma and hypertension.
	   The majority of Malaysia's 22 million people are Muslims.
	   Abdul said the national Pilgrim's Management and Fund Board,
known as Tabung Haji, was considering absorbing the cost, estimated
at 1 million ringgit (dlrs 263,000).
	   He urged pilgrims to take the injections to help reduce high
medical costs incurred during the rite by the pilgrim's board,
which controls financing of the trip.
	   The hajj, a rite that is required of every able-bodied Muslim
who can afford it, has been the scene of stampedes, fires and
political protests that have killed hundreds in recent years.
	   Authorities have said the crowds have made the rite more
difficult to control. Fifty years ago, it drew about 10,000 people
annually. This year's hajj drew 2.3 million Muslims.

as a move to justify a U.S. military strike on Iraq, saying the
government already had turned over all documents relevant to the
arms inspectors' work.
	   Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, left the Gulf state
of Bahrain Monday on a flight to Baghdad. He refused to comment
about the latest controversy as he departed.
	   Monday's state-run Iraqi newspapers said a personal grudge
against Iraq was behind Butler's new demand for documents.
	   ``Butler has personal motives to create a new crisis,'' the
daily Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in a
front-page editorial signed by editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi.
	   ``He (Butler) has explained Iraq's decision to let the
inspectors resume their activities .... as a personal victory which
he believes will enable him to take revenge on Iraq,'' the paper
said.
	   Iraq had asked for Butler's dismissal from UNSCOM as one of its
demands for allowing U.N. weapons inspectors to return to work in
the country.
	   But it reversed its ban on the inspectors' work Nov. 14 when
faced with a likely air strikes by U.S. and British forces in the
Gulf.
	   The arms inspectors returned last week and have been making
visits to potential weapons-making sites daily, with the
cooperation of the Iraq government.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq
insists it has already gotten rid of all proscribed weaponry.
	   Butler's weekend demand for new documents again raises the
prospect of possible American military strikes against Iraq since
U.S. President Bill Clinton had demanded full cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In Korea, where Clinton is visiting, a spokesman for the
National Security Council referred to Iraq's refusal to hand over
documents as an ``insufficient'' response, but said no final
conclusion had been made about the Iraqi move.
	   The spokesman, David Leavy, raised the prospect of an attack,
saying: ``If we conclude Iraq does not intend to live up to its
commitments and UNSCOM can't do its job, we remain prepared'' to
carry out air strikes Clinton canceled last week.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Monday said Butler's demands
were either intended to provoke an attack or to put off a promised
Security Council review of Iraq's cooperation in arms destruction
that the government hopes will lead to easing the sanctions.
	   He said some of the documents requested no longer exist, and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said that Iraq already
has given U.N. inspectors all relevant documents amounting to more
than two million pages.
	   He said Butler was leading ``a savage campaign ... of
disinformation'' to make it seem as if Iraq was not cooperating.
	   Asked if he thought the dispute over documents could provoke
more threats, al-Sahhaf said that U.N. resolutions don't ``say that
if you do not hand over a document that three cruise missiles will
hit your country.''
	   He added: ``This is ridiculous. So whatever party is threatening
that, he will bear the responsibility for that.''
	   Iraqi officials have said they are prepared to let the
inspectors see relevant portion of one requested document _ a log
of chemical weapons used during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. But
they said some of the document concerned Iraq's national security
and could not be shown to the inspectors.

Pressure groups bring people's issues on election agenda

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ India's politicians traditionally seek votes
by appealing to caste and religion. But days before crucial
provincial elections, pressure groups are placing new issues onto
the political agenda: child labor, health and pollution.
	   Over 80 million voters will choose 626 state legislators from
among 5,000 candidates on Nov. 25 in four of India's 26 states.
	   The vote is being seen as the first test of popularity for the
Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party since it came to lead the
federal government last June. In the states of Madhya Pradesh,
Rajasthan and New Delhi, the BJP will square off against its main
rival, the Congress, which led India to independence in 1947 and
for most of the years since then. Local parties are contesting the
election in the tiny state of Mizoram.
	   But more than ever before, public service lobbyists and
voluntary agencies are trying to focus Wednesday's ballot on the
kind of core issues that politicians prefer to address with
platitudes rather than action.
	   In New Delhi, where air pollution is said to kill one person
every hour, candidates read this bold-faced advertisement in
Sunday's mass-selling Times of India newspaper : ``If you want our
votes give us clean air.''
	   The Center for Science and Environment, an environment think
tank which published the advertisement, said its office was flooded
with calls from hundreds of supporters after the ad appeared.
	   ``It's amazing to see the response from common people, from
students, professionals, and those from the middle class,'' said
the center's Anumita Rowchowdhury.
	   Before placing the ad, the center asked the 85 candidates for
the Delhi state assembly to sign a pledge to take specific steps
against polluting vehicles. Only 22 responded. Chief Minister
Sushma Swaraj, whose job in the state government is equivalent to
the federal prime minister, was among those who ignored the appeal.
	   The antipollution campaign was backed last week by a call from
doctors, who urged aspirants to spell out what they planned to do
about citizens' health in filth-clogged cities.
	   Indian studies have found that New Delhi has the world's highest
concentration of airborne particles. Carbon monoxide and nitrous
oxide levels also are above international limits. One of every 10
children in New Delhi suffers from asthma and one in 10 residents
is likely to suffer from cancer, the center said.
	   ``Politicians who are indifferent should realize that we don't
vote for pollution and illness for our children,'' the
advertisement read. ``Clean air has votes too.''
	   Anti-child labor activist Kailash Satyarthi ran into similar
apathy when he urged politicians to take a stand against child
labor.
	   ``Several politicians, including ministers, refused to sign
pledges that they would work against child labor,'' said Satyarthi,
who heads the South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, a high
profile group which helped make child labor an international issue.
	   India was identified last month by the United Nations as home to
the largest number of child workers in the world, with estimates
ranging between 40 million and 100 million underage workers.
	   Many children work in farm fields, restaurants, the carpet,
brick-and firework-making industries, stitch footballs or are
forced into child prostitution.
	   On Friday, Satyarthi's organization brought together nearly
1,000 children aged four to 14 in a demonstration at one of the
busiest intersections in the capital, as they called on politicians
running in the elections to oppose child labor.

WHO calls for stronger fight against major killer in China: TB
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China needs to intensify efforts to wipe out
tuberculosis, the country's most deadly infectious disease, the
World Health Organization chief said Monday.
	   Each year in China, tuberculosis infects 630,000 people and
kills 288,000. The disease is particularly serious in the
impoverished countryside and among rural migrant workers who have
moved to the cities by the tens of millions.
	   Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former Norwegian prime minister who
took over at WHO in July, urged the Chinese government to attack
the disease ``with new vigor'' and provide free or subsidized
treatment.
	   China's health minister, Zhang Wenkang, estimated that 40
percent of the rural areas with TB epidemics lack the modern
treatment techniques WHO recommends, the official China Daily
reported. He called on WHO to provide more funds and technical
assistance.
	   Since 1992, China has improved tuberculosis treatment with
assistance from the WHO and the World Bank, Brundtland said in a
speech at Tsinghua University.
	   On a six-day visit to China, Brundtland has paid courtesy calls
on Chinese leaders and surveyed their efforts to control malaria _
among the best in the region _ and reduce smoking.
	   Some 70 percent of men smoke, and Brundtland warned that
tobacco-related diseases would be ``the biggest public health
threat in the next century.'' A new study shows smoking's effects
will kill about 100 million of the 300 million Chinese men now
under 30.
	   ``These numbers are shocking and we know they will cause
millions and millions of deaths if we are not able to change the
pattern in this huge country,'' Brundtland told reporters after her
speech.
	   She said that she suggested to Premier Zhu Rongji that China
increase taxation on tobacco as a deterrent, and that Zhu told her
it was a good idea.
	   The government relies on cigarette taxes and profits for about
10 percent of its revenues, but says smoking-related fires and
health care cost more than tobacco brings in. In recent years,
smoking has been prohibited in planes, trains and some other public
places.
	   Brundtland, a physician and public-health specialist, also was
promoting the WHO's goal of universal access to health care.
	   China is in the midst of health care financing reform. Many
people in rural areas, where the majority of the nation's 1.2
billion people live, have no health insurance. Urban workers are
being forced to relinquish once free medical care for stripped-down
insurance programs.
	   The WHO chief said that without health services and a focus on
preventing illness, it was impossible to have a ``necessary focus
on human rights.''

Singapore launches futures contract despite Hong Kong ire

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's bid to eclipse its financial
competitors in Asia took a step forward Monday when its monetary
exchange launched a futures contract based on stocks nearly
identical to Hong Kong's benchmark index.
	   The Morgan Stanley Capital International Hong Kong Stock Index
Futures contract was relisted on the Singapore International
Monetary Exchange, or SIMEX, after a one-year break despite
vehement opposition from Hong Kong's stock exchange.
	   Officials from the Hong Kong bourse have said the futures
contract _ based on an index practically the same as the Hang Seng
Index _ may be used by speculators to renew attacks on the Chinese
territory's stock market.
	   Futures allow investors to protect themselves against price
changes by requiring those who hold the contract to buy or sell a
security, currency or commodity at a predetermined price during a
stipulated period.
	   The Hong Kong stock exchange has warned information providers
not to give SIMEX or Morgan Stanley Capital International the
real-time price data required to compile the rival index, and has
cast doubts on the ability of Singapore's exchange to properly
regulate the Hong Kong-linked futures.
	   But fears that the Chinese territory's exchange would thwart the
rival futures contract from the start were temporarily allayed when
it extended a three-month grace period for information venders
providing market data to Morgan Stanley.
	   MSCI may already have sidestepped the problem, however. It
recently released the formula for the rival index on its web site,
allowing any traders with the real-time information to calculate
the MSCI Hong Kong Stock Index themselves.
	   The dispute is likely to eventually subside as ``no exchange
would want to promote disruptive market action,'' SIMEX chairman
Victor Liew said Monday.
	   Singapore's decision to relaunch a contract that enjoyed only
marginal business during five years of previous trading is seen as
part of a move to outdo its principal competitor in the region and
catapult the city-state into a position as Asia's premier financial
center.
	   While Hong Kong has recently intervened to prop up its stock
market, raising investor fears that it has abandoned its
laissez-faire approach for more control, Singapore has been busy
liberalizing its markets and easing previously rigid regulations.
	   Singapore officials say the futures contract isn't aimed at
stealing business away from Hong Kong, and have reassured their
counterparts that Singapore regulators will prevent speculators
from attacking the Hong Kong stock market.
	   Liew said the SIMEX product, rather than hurting Hong Kong
trading, will benefit the Chinese territory.
	   The rival contract ``promotes more market liquidity and better
risk management,'' he said, adding that ``the expanded world of
investors coming to the region will benefit all parties.''
	   Singapore's ``aim isn't to replace'' the Hong Kong futures
contract, but create ``healthy competition'' with it, said Liew.
	   Previous discussions between the exchanges failed to resolve the
issue. It took a meeting between Hong Kong chief executive Tung
Chee-hwa and Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong last week to
soothe fears.
	   The two leaders agreed to have their regulatory authorities
cooperate more closely so that speculators would not take advantage
of ``regulatory arbitrage,'' or differences in trading regulations.
	   Hong Kong traders and analysts greeted the Monday futures launch
calmly, arguing that Hong Kong stock exchange officials were
over-reacting to the potential threat.
	   ``I totally think it's a storm in a teacup,'' Simon Pritchard,
regional strategist with Hong Kong-listed hedge fund Regent Pacific
Group, told Dow Jones Newswires.
	   ``This SIMEX thing may not come to much,'' said Howard Gorges, a
director at South China Securities in Hong Kong. ``Not all of their
instruments in Singapore are successful.''
	   At 12:30 p.m. (0430 GMT), MSCI's Hong Kong Stock Index futures
contract stood at 7,321, below its opening level of 7,280, on
volume of 517 contracts.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES in 3rd graf with Chinese delegation arriving at
hospital, ADDs Yeltsin's age in 4th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital
with what doctors described as a very high temperature and
pneumonia in the latest health crisis for the Russian leader,
officials said Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics, but the
officials declined to give further details.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin was to meet in the hospital Monday with visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin, the Kremlin said. The Chinese delegation
arrived at the hospital in a convoy of cars, sweeping past
journalists waiting at the game.
	   The 67-year-old president has rarely been seen in public in
recent weeks, raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang were to sign a statement on border
demarcation. The summit _ Jiang's sixth meeting with Yeltsin _ will
focus on broad issues of expanding Russian-Chinese cooperation.
	   Yeltsin has been staying at his country home outside Moscow in
recent weeks after falling ill in October with respiratory
problems. The president's doctors said he was suffering from high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.
	   Yeltsin's wife, Naina, said recently that the president is
struggling with the very cold weather that has hit Moscow in recent
weeks, but that he was capable of handling his duties.

Death toll rises to 92 in central Vietnam

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's main highway remained blocked
Monday by flooding that has killed at least 92 people and swamped
hundreds of thousands of homes in one of the country's poorest
regions.
	   The death toll was expected to rise as reports drifted in from
areas where communications have been cut off by downpours from
Typhoon Dawn of up to 1.19 meters (nearly four feet) Thursday
through Sunday. Damage was believed to be in the tens of millions
of dollars.
	   The army, border guards and police were mobilized for relief
efforts in eight central provinces. Danang city officials, who were
using canoes to ferry food to 50,000 people in one submerged
district, planned to drop instant noodles and bread by helicopter
to another.
	   Provincial health officials have been told to prepare medicine
and vaccines to stop possible epidemics.
	   Hundred-meter (hundred-yard) stretches of Highway 1 were under a
meter (three feet) of water, forcing officials to order most cars
and trucks to stay in Danang, where one street was turned into a
virtual parking lot.
	   On both sides of the two-lane highway, water often covered the
rice paddies to the horizon, unbroken except by the roofs of nearly
submerged homes.
	   Although Vietnam's midsection often is hit by storms _ two other
floods in the last month killed 69 people and caused dlrs 22
million in damage _ officials said this was the highest that the
water has risen since the historic floods of 1964.
	   Until mid-August, the region was suffering from its worst
drought in at least half a century.
	   At one point, water reached waist-deep at The Citadel imperial
palace complex in Hue _ site of some of the fiercest fighting in
the Vietnam War _ but was receding Monday. Some districts in the
coastal city remained under water.
	   Residents of the tourist town of Hoi An were looking for food
Monday and starting to clean the mud from their historic homes and
streets, where motorized traffic traditionally is banned. On
Saturday, the water was 1.8 meters (six feet) deep in some areas.
	   The central government said it was providing 2 billion dong
(dlrs 143,000) in relief funds for Danang, where water was still
two to three meters (6 to 10 feet) deep in some places Monday.
	   The Quang Nam floods and storms control committee said about
200,000 families live in submerged areas in that province alone.
	   A government delegation led by Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung was touring the affected areas.
	   The floods and storm control committees from eight central
province said 24 people died in Danang, 14 in Quang Nam, 17 in Thua
Thien Hue, 11 in Quang Ngai, nine in Binh Dinh, eight in Phu Yen,
six in Khanh Hoa and three in Daklak. Three people were listed as
missing.
	   The committees said they have provided 1 million dong (dlrs 70)
each for burial costs to families who lost loved ones.
	   Among the dead was a Myanmar sailor on a Panama-flag ship who
was strangled by a lifebuoy rope as the ship was being evacuated
after breaking anchor and drifting on to rocks.

	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Myanmar police have arrested seven people
for possession of counterfeit dlrs 50 and dlrs 100 U.S. bills,
official newspapers reported Monday. The notes totaled dlrs 950 in

Japan's trade ministry agrees to back up Thai bonds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Believing that Thailand's troubled
economy is poised for a turnaround, Japan's Ministry of
International Trade and Industry has agreed to guarantee dlrs 500
million in Thai public sector bonds.
	   ``We believe the Thai economy has bottomed out,'' Hideo Hato,
director of the ministry's public relations division, said Monday.
``We believe in the stability of the baht.''
	   Hato spoke to Dow Jones Newswires in Bangkok on the sidelines of
a conference between the Japanese ministry and economic ministers
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The guarantees will be in addition to any assistance offered
under Japan's dlrs 30 billion regional assistance fund, Hato said.
They will apply to bonds issued by state enterprises, or possibly
government bonds, as determined by the Thai government.
	   Hato said the ministry has agreed to guarantee the public sector
bonds because the Thai economy is expected to see renewed growth
next year, after a contraction of at least 7 percent this year.
	   Hato said it was possible that the ministry would back up its
guarantee with the purchase of any Thai bonds that could not be
sold.

Vietnam regulates spending for staging ASEAN conferences
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam's Ministry of Finance has
introduced the first ordinance on spending for staging conferences
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, a ministry official
said Monday.
	   Under the regulation, signed by a deputy minister last week,
government agencies or local governments serving as hosts to ASEAN
conferences should not spend more than 2.5 million dong (dlrs 180)
per day per ASEAN guest for hotel accommodation, she said.
	   Local organizers should make use of their own facilities and
rent hotel space only when they cannot meet the requirements, the
ordinance said, with the money coming from their regular budget
allocation.
	   Vietnam has been host to dozens of ASEAN conferences since it
joined the organization in 1995.

England struggles to stave off defeat

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with stumps score; ADDS byline
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Opening batsman Michael Slater
combined with fast bowler Glenn McGrath to put England in a
precarious position in the first Ashes cricket test at the Gabba on
Monday.
	   After McGrath triggered a spectacular England collapse with 5-19
on the fourth morning, Slater hammered 113 off 138 balls to set the
visitors 348 runs to win in a minimum of 99 overs in just over
three sessions.
	   Propelled by Slater's innings and an equally fine 74 by left
hander Justin Langer, Australia declared its second innings on 237
for three.
	   Slater's crackerjack innings followed McGrath's 6-85 as England,
resuming on 299 for four, was bowled out for 375 to give the home
side a invaluable 110-run lead.
	   This was in reply to Australia's 485 in the first innings.
	   England, in the seven overs batting just before stumps Monday,
managed 26 for no loss with openers Mark Butcher and Mike Atherton
on seven and 18 respectively.
	   England needs another 322 runs in a minimum of 92 overs on the
last day Tuesday.
	   History is against England winning the test. The record fourth
innings total successfully chased at the Gabba is 236 for seven by
Australia against the West Indies in 1951-52.
	   The record total successfully chased in Australia was by
England, when it scored 332 for seven at the Melbourne Cricket
Ground in the third test in the 1928-29 series after being set 331
to win.
	   Slater quickly set the order of the innings and reached his
first 50 off 56 balls after skipper Mark Taylor (0) had played on
to Dominic Cork in the fourth over.
	   For the next three hours the 6,343 spectators were treated to
some exhilarating batting as Slater and Langer shredded the England
bowlers to all corners of the Gabba.
	   Slater took a liking to Darren Gough, easily England's best
bowler in the first innings, hitting 50 runs off six overs, 28 of
them in the first three.
	   Slater, playing his first test in Australia since returning to
the side for the tour of India early this year, relished the
ordinary bowling by England as he raced to his ninth test hundred
and the fifth against England off 129 balls.
	   His innings included 13 fours and a towering six off Robert
Croft. When he was finally caught and bowled charging Angus Fraser,
it was a welcome relief for the tourists after some destructive and
demoralizing hitting.
	   Langer holed out to Mullally at long on, but the Waugh twins _
Mark and Steve _ kept the scoreboard ticking before Taylor made the
bold declaration.
	   The day clearly belonged to McGrath.
	   McGrath, 28, destroyed England's resistance with their last six
wickets falling for 76 runs in just 34 overs before lunch.
	   In McGrath's first spell of the day, Graham Thorpe, who had
helped Mark Ramprakash add 75 runs for the fifth wicket, hooked a
catch to Langer at square leg after scoring 77 runs.
	   It was the breakthrough McGrath and Australia was waiting for,
and the rest of the England batting capitulated.
	   Cork miscued a hook in McGrath's next over and England was
reduced to 319 for six before the fast bowler earned a rest after
nine overs.
	   McGrath's 11th five-wicket haul in his 41st test helped him
extend his tally against England to 48 wickets at an average of
21.17 in nine tests.

Jordanian flights to Gaza Airport
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan will fly daily flights into the new
Palestinian airport opening Tuesday in the Gaza Strip, an aviation
official said Monday.
	   Jordan also will take part in the airport's opening ceremony,
flying a Royal Jordanian plane to Gaza on Tuesday, said Jasser
Ziyyad, director of the Civil Aviation Authority. It will carry a
delegation led by Transport Minister Nasser Lawzi.
	   Ziyyad said Jordan and the Palestinians have reached an
agreement to operate one or two flights to Gaza daily. The first
commercial flight will be early next month, operated by the Royal
Wings, Jordan's regional airline, he said.
	   The opening of the Gaza airport, long delayed by Israeli
concerns over security, was agreed to as part of the Wye River
accord signed by Israel and the Palestinians last month in
Washington.
	   The airport will give the Palestinians their first direct
commercial link to the outside world. Until now, sending
Palestinian goods abroad has required shipping through Israel,
sometimes leading to long delays.

Report: Cathay Pacific Airbus dives after losing oxygen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Cathay Pacific Airways Airbus carrying 232
passengers had to make an emergency dive of more than 23,000 feet
(7,000 meters) after losing cabin pressure and oxygen during a
flight from New Zealand, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Pilots of Flight 100 on Saturday were forced to override the
computer flight program and manually dive from more than 31,000
feet (9,450 meters) to 8,000 feet (2,440 meters) in two minutes
after losing oxygen, the South China Morning Post reported.
	   The plane, bound for Hong Kong, was diverted to Sydney, where
passengers changed planes. All the passengers arrived safely in
Hong Kong on Sunday, the paper added.
	   Cathay Pacific did not know why cabin pressure had dropped four
hours after take-off from Auckland, and airline engineers were
currently investigating the Airbus 340 model, it said.
	   ``A co-pilot told me that door seals had caused the problem,''
the Post quoted passenger Tony Allen as saying, adding that air
masks had dropped but ``most of them had no oxygen.''
	   A Cathay Pacific spokeswoman would not confirm whether the air
masks had failed, adding that pilots could have switched off air
supply after oxygen levels were found to be adequate, the paper
added.
	   The spokeswoman added that a rapid descent to less than 10,000
feet (3,050 feet) in altitude was standard practice to restore
cabin pressure, the Post said.
	   Airline officials in Hong Kong did not return calls on the
incident.

Olympic committee told to live more harmoniously
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: corrects spelling of McGeoch in 2nd and 7th grafs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Olympics Minister Michael Knight said
Monday he will contact all Sydney 2000 organizing committee board
members to try to end damaging divisions among them.
	   Prominent board member Rod McGeoch, who helped galvanize the bid
that brought the Games to Sydney, has highlighted the split between
board members recently by claiming he is the victim of a political
vendetta.
	   On Sunday, Prime Minister John Howard criticized the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games, urging board members to
stop their squabbling in order to protect Australia's reputation.
	   His call follows a report in the Sunday Telegraph that Sydney
Games bid organizer McGeoch was considering quitting the board
because of attempts to discredit him.
	   Knight, who is also SOCOG president, said he would be talking to
all 15 board members on Monday urging them to ``take a deep breath,
calm down and get back to working together.''
	   ``The board will be one big happy family very quickly,'' he
said.
	   But Knight had some veiled criticism for McGeoch, saying ``it's
unhelpful when board members are attacking each other in the public
arena.''
	   Knight said the International Olympic Committee had not
contacted him over the political bickering. (djp)

Death toll in Indonesia's ethnic, religious violence rises to 13
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more Habibie comment, government promising to
help rebuild damaged buildings &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescue workers on Monday pulled seven
bodies from a gutted gambling parlor that was burned by Muslim
mobs, raising the death toll to 13 from ethnic and religious
violence.
	   Many Christian schools, meanwhile, were closed after riots
Sunday in which mobs of Muslim youths set fire to churches and
attacked Christians. Soldiers patrolled riot-hit areas in north
Jakarta, but there were no fresh reports of unrest.
	   The seven newly discovered victims burned to death or died of
smoke inhalation, said Edward Bachtiar, an official of the
Indonesian Red Cross.
	   Two were members of the ethnic Chinese minority, which is often
targeted during social strife, partly because it dominates trade
and commerce. Also, most Chinese in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia
are Christian or Buddhist.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is at the center of student protests
for not planning wider changes to Indonesia's political system,
blamed unidentified agitators and urged restraint.
	   ``I call on the people not to be easily provoked to take actions
to serve the purpose of a certain group that wants to disintegrate
the nation,'' Habibie said.
	   Without elaborating, a prominent Muslim leader said that thugs
had carefully planned the riots, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid, head of the country's largest Islamic group,
Nadhlatul Ulama, and opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
condemned the violence.
	   ``We have to be careful with cruel actions made under a
religious pretext,'' they said in a statement.
	   The weekend violence came amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as inflation
and unemployment rates soar.
	   ``If there is a riot every day, economic restoration will slow
down,'' Habibie said. ``Eliminate the feeling of prejudice.''
	   Habibie has been under pressure to speed up his reform program
following the resignation in May of former authoritarian leader
Suharto. Opponents say Habibie, once a protege of Suharto, is not
serious about introducing real democracy.
	   The Sunday riots broke out a little more than a week after
deadly clashes between students and security personnel also
triggered rioting. As many as 17 people died in the earlier
clashes. The last died Sunday at a hospital.
	   Hundreds of anti-government students boycotted classes Monday at
Atma Jaya Catholic University, which reopened for the first time
since at least half a dozen students were fatally shot in fighting
around the campus Nov. 13.
	   Dozens were reported injured in Sunday's clashes between the
Muslim majority and Christians originally from the eastern city of
Ambon.
	   Troops desperate to restore order fired shots and volleys of
tear gas to break up rock-throwing crowds that officials said had
burned four churches and ransacked seven others.
	   The government, which is short of cash because of the economic
turmoil, pledged to help rebuild the damaged buildings.
	   Muslim residents who disapprove of gambling burned the betting
parlor, where Ambonese were working as guards, and said their
attacks were retaliation after rumors that the Ambonese had
attacked mosques.
	   ``We feel very sad because we're still far from the hope of
solidarity between religious communities,'' said Father Roy
Djakarya of the Jakarta Roman Catholic Archdiocese. ``Why do we so
easily judge rumors without thinking about the truth behind them?''
	   On Sunday, the Indonesian Red Cross recovered six bodies,
including five Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken
bottles.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However,
religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy.

Commuters battle to beat Euro-wide rail strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters battled their way to work on packed
subways and jammed roads around the French capital during rush hour
Monday to try and beat a Europe-wide rail strike.
	   France's national train company, the SNCF, said only about one
in three trains was running nationwide Monday morning.
	   High-speed trains linking Paris suburbs to the Metro were also
severely disrupted, with just one in four running on some lines.
The strike began Sunday night, and ends early Tuesday.
	   In France, only Eurostar trains to London were expected to run
normally. Buses replaced Thalys trains from Paris to Brussels,
Amsterdam and Cologne. Only two out of 20 trains between London and
Brussels were to operate.
	   Traffic was also expected to slow Monday in Spain, Belgium,
Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg. Unions were to hand out leaflets
to commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the Netherlands.
	   Workers are protesting plans for more deregulation of the
sector. The European Union executive Commission plans to increase
liberalization in the freight sector from 5 percent to 25 percent
to increase the efficiency of Europe's dense railway network.
	   Unions say they fear that will lead to job losses.

South African vice president meets Russian leaders
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Monday that
relations with South Africa have improved dramatically in recent
years and Moscow looks forward to further strengthening of trade
and other ties.
	   Primakov hailed the improvement in relations since the end of
white-minority rule in a meeting with visiting Vice President Thabo
Mbeki.
	   ``Both sides want this. We are no longer sizing each other up,''
Primakov said at the start of talks.
	   ``Your visit will be useful as well as very pleasant to us,'' he
said.
	   The talks are expected to culminate with the signing of various

era, when it served the government's policy of promoting communism
in Africa. Since the Soviet collapse, it has fallen on hard times.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanyo Securities Co. has decided to formally file
for bankruptcy after the failure of its restructuring efforts, a
Japanese newspaper reported Monday.
	   The medium-size Japanese brokerage house had applied for court
protection from creditors last November as it sought to rebuild its
operations under a corporation rehabilitation law.
	   But in June, the company said it would halt business because it
had been unable to shore up its finances through restructuring or
find a buyer to take it over.
	   Lawyers handling Sanyo's assets will meet officials from the
Tokyo District Court, where the company had filed for protection,
and the government's financial watchdog agency to discuss how to
handle customer accounts, the mass-circulation Asahi Shimbun
reported.
	   As of the end of Japan's fiscal year in March, Sanyo's
liabilities exceeded its assets by some 105.8 billion yen (dlrs 880
million), largely as a result of bad loans held by affiliated
companies, he said.
	   Sanyo expanded its operations aggressively in the late 1980s,
but was hit hard by the collapse of a bubble in Japanese stock and
real estate prices at the outset of this decade.
	   About 1,100 of its more than 2,000 workers have already left.

	   BEIJING (AP) _ Hit by the Asian financial crisis, pledges of new
foreign investment in China dropped 1.5 percent in the first 10
months of 1998 compared with a year ago, a senior trade ministry
official said Monday.
	   Ma Xiuhong, an assistant minister for the Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, said contracted foreign investment
_ promises of future investment _ reached dlrs 39.41 billion in the
10-month period.
	   The total number of projects approved from January-October
declined 4.2 percent to 16,168 from a year ago.
	   Meanwhile, the amount of foreign money actually invested in
China _ also known as its utilized investment _ inched up 0.9
percent over same period to dlrs 35.9 billion.
	   Investment from Asia, which normally accounts for 80 percent of
China's total utilized foreign investment, fell 11-12 percent this
year, but higher flows from Europe and North America have helped to
compensate, she said.
	   Ma said foreign investment for all of 1998 would be about the
same as last year's dlrs 45.3 billion.
	    &UR; _____
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a vote of confidence that Thailand's
troubled economy is poised for a turnaround, a Japanese official
said Monday his country will guarantee dlrs 500 million in Thai
public sector bonds.
	   ``We believe the Thai economy has bottomed out,'' Hideo Hato, an
official at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry. ``We
believe in the stability of the baht.''
	   Hato spoke to Dow Jones Newswires in Bangkok on the sidelines of
a conference between the Japanese ministry and economic ministers
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   The guarantees will be in addition to any assistance offered
under Japan's dlrs 30 billion regional assistance fund, Hato said.
They will apply to bonds issued by state enterprises, or possibly
government bonds, as determined by the Thai government.
	   Hato said the ministry has agreed to guarantee the public sector
bonds because the Thai economy is expected to see renewed growth
next year, after seeing a contraction of at least 7 percent this
year.
	   Hato said it was ``possible'' that the ministry would back up
its guarantee with the purchase of any Thai bonds that could not be
sold.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Seventeen Indonesian banks will open
letters of credit backed by a dlrs 1 billion trade-financing loan
provided by the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a local newspaper reported
Monday.
	   The daily Bisnis Indonesia quoted Nana Supriana, the deputy head
of international affairs at Indonesia's central bank, as saying
seven of the banks are state-owned banks.
	   The remaining 10 are private banks licensed to conduct
foreign-exchange transactions.
	   He said half of the trade-financing loans were allocated to
state banks.
	   Nana didn't disclose the names of the banks. He said each of the
private banks is entitled to open letters of credit of up to dlrs
50 million.
	   Several countries have pledged trade-financing loans to
Indonesia to back letters of credit because of a widespread lack of
confidence in the country's banks.

 &UR; McGrath joins the Ashes greats
 &UR; By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Cricketer Glenn McGrath joined the
ranks of Ashes bowling greats with a bat-numbing effort against
England at the Gabba on Monday.
	   McGrath, 28, is just 16 short of becoming the 10th Australian to
take 200 test wickets after his 6-85 in the first test at the
Gabba.
	   His effort has injected new life into a test that was destined
for a draw and set up a enthralling last day after skipper Mark
Taylor's bold declaration.
	   England needs another 322 runs in a minimum of 92 overs on the
last day Tuesday.
	   McGrath is confident of knocking England over in the second
innings.
	   ``I can't see why we shouldn't do it,'' McGrath said after his
bowling effort.
	   McGrath, who burst into international recognition against New
Zealand in Perth in 1993, clearly relishes the responsibility of
being Australia's No.1 fast bowler.
	   ``It's something I've always wanted to do since I was young,''
he said. ``I prefer to lead an attack rather than be first or
second change.''
	   McGrath, born in Dubbo and raised in Narromine in the New South
Wales bush, watched cricket on television. His most vivid memories
were of Terry Alderman ``taking lbw after lbw'' in the 1989 Ashes
series.
	   An introvert, McGrath admits he still longs for the tranquility
of outback although his cricket commitments have forced him to live
in the hustling inner Sydney with his English girlfriend Jane.
	   He bought a 34,000-acre farm west of Bourke in New South Wales
country as a retreat during the off-season.
	   McGrath, a product of the Australia Cricket Academy, has become
one of the most-feared fast bowlers of his generation.
	   Despite a groin and hernia complication restricting his work
load to three tests in 14 months, he returned with vengeance,
spearheading Australia to a historic 1-0 win in Pakistan with 12
wickets.
	   ``I did quite a bit of work with (Dennis) Lillee at the academy,
that was a great buzz in itself,'' McGrath recalls.
	   ``It's always been there. I've always wanted to play cricket for
Australia as a fast bowler.''
	   McGrath set himself a standard goal of five wickets per game,
and so far enjoys a strike rate of a wicket every 53 balls in his
41 tests, the third best behind countrymen Lillee and Jeff Thomson.
	   His first taste of the Ashes was restricted to just two tests in
1994-95 at home. He took 0-101 in the first test here, and was 12th
man for the next three, before returning with 3-88 and 3-40 in
Perth in the final test.
	   ``I started off that series pretty poorly, but that was probably
one of the biggest learning experiences I've been through in test
cricket,'' McGrath said.
	   ``To play the last test in Perth and take six wickets
kick-started the West Indian tour where things really started to
pick up.
	   ``I look at that as the big turning point in my career,''
McGrath said of the 17 wickets in Australia's historic 2-1 triumph
without an injured Craig McDermott.
	   It gave Australia its first series win over the West Indies in
19 years.
	   He has now taken 48 Ashes wickets in nine tests with three
five-wicket hauls _ the best being 8-38 at Lord's _ as part of a
36-wicket series bag that gave Australia its fifth Ashes series in
a row.
	   Former England captain Mike Atherton is McGrath's ``bunny,''
falling to him 10 times in eight tests.

Myanmar opposition leader says party strong despite resignations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit
out at the government Monday, saying recent mass resignations from
her National League for Democracy had been coerced but that party
members' spirits remained strong.
	   ``The greater the repression, the greater the support for our
movement,'' said Suu Kyi, looking confident and relaxed despite the
unequal battle she is fighting against the military regime.
	   Suu Kyi spoke at a news briefing at her party's Yangon chapter
headquarters a day after the government claimed that hundreds of
NLD members recently quit the party of their own free will.
	   Government spokesman Lt. Col. Hla Min said Sunday the grassroots
members of Suu Kyi's party were frustrated with ``the NLD
leadership's policy of confrontation and divisiveness.'' He said 12
local offices, comprising 1,259 people, had voluntarily dissolved
themselves.
	   The government also reported that of 851 party members detained
in official ``guest houses'' _ including several members-elect of
Parliament _ 384 had returned home. A few have been held more than
four months.
	   ``We want to make clear that all these resignations were made
under coercion,'' Suu Kyi said at her briefing. ``We are heartened
by the spirit of the great majority of the NLD members. The
detention of our elected MPs and others has now entered its fifth
month. In spite of that, the great majority of our members remained
staunch and have not been shaken in their resolve.''
	   She told reporters that the NLD chairman has sent a letter to
the chairman of the ruling junta protesting strongly ``against the
coercive actions ... to bring about the illegal disbandment of the
township committees.''
	   ``Obviously the authorities are trying to shut down all the NLD
offices,'' she said. ``We made it quite clear time and again that
even if they de-register, the NLD we shall continue our work.''
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked
in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over
demands that a Parliament elected in 1990 be convened. The NLD won
the elections, but the military never allowed Parliament to meet.
	   In September, Suu Kyi and her allies began meeting in a
10-member committee to serve in place of a Parliament, a move that
resulted in a marked increase in government propaganda attacks
against her.
	   Responding to the government's assertion that the NLD's call for
convening Parliament has derailed a possible dialogue with the
opposition, Suu Kyi said, ``The door is always open for a dialogue,
but we are not going to call off or back down from our decision to
convene a Parliament.''
	   By doing so, she added, ``we will be opening ourselves up to all
kinds of repression.''
	   Asked if the mass resignations of members could paralyze her
party, Suu Kyi replied: ``The NLD will stand as it always stands _
fighting fit.''
	   ``The political climate now is not good because of the
intransigence of the authorities,'' she said. ``The winds are in
our favor.''

No oil contracts signed for next oil-for-food phase
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed no contracts with foreign
firms for deliveries of crude oil after the current phase of the
oil-for-food deal ends Wednesday, Oil Ministry officials said
Monday.
	   Extending or renewing the six-month deal is a political decision
and the government has not yet given orders to sign new contracts,
the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq had hoped that the current leg, allowing it to export up to
dlrs 5.2 billion in oil, would be the last under the agreement with
the United Nations letting Iraq export limited oil to buy food and
medicine for the 22 million Iraqis.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception to U.N. sanctions,
which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and will
not be lifted until Iraq proves to U.N. arms inspectors that it has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   However, nothing suggests the inspectors will give Iraq a clean
bill of health given the latest standoffs over weapons inspections
and demands for information on past weapons programs.
	   Iraq is trying to persuade the U.N. Security Council to extend
the present phase for another two months since low oil prices hurt
its ability to generate the dlrs 5.2 billion in income.
	   The Oil Ministry officials said they expected the Security
Council to meet Wednesday to decide the next step. They said there
could be an interruption of exports for a few days as decisions are
made on the program.
	   Iraq produces about 2.6 million barrels of oil a day, comparable
to the quota set for it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries before sanctions were imposed. Nearly 2 million barrels
are earmarked for exports.

U.S. ambassador summoned to Malaysia's foreign ministry

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. comment, other details; ADDS byline &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The U.S. ambassador to Malaysia
was summoned to the Foreign Ministry Monday for an earful of
government reaction to Vice President Al Gore's apparent support
for the anti-government movement.
	   ``We reiterated Malaysia's position that Gore's speech was an
incitement of lawlessness and not simply a call of democracy as
claimed,'' the Foreign Ministry undersecretary for the Americas,
John Tenewi Nuek, told the national news agency Bernama.
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Chip Barclay described the meeting as
``cordial'' and ``a useful way to exchange views.''
	   Ambassador John Malott ``used the occasion to remind (the
ministry) that Vice President Gore's speech was neither
inflammatory nor disparaging of any country.''
	   Malott said ``Malaysians should look beyond attempts to miscast
Gore's speech,'' Barclay said.
	   At the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit last week, Gore
praised the ``brave people of Malaysia'' who have demanded
democracy in line with the political reform movement started by
jailed former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   The comments enraged the Malaysian government. Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, commenting Sunday on Gore's remarks, called them
``disrespectful'' and ``offensive.'' Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi has said the remarks were tantamount to inciting violence
and supporting terrorism.
	   Since Anwar's sacking in early September and subsequent jailing
on corruption charges, dozens of anti-government demonstrations
have rocked the usually placid Malaysian capital. Most have been
peaceful, though several have been broken up by water cannons, tear
gas and gunfire.
	   On Friday, Malott defended Gore, saying he only called for
democracy and was not inciting people to violence.
	   The Foreign Ministry also conveyed to Malott that Malaysians
were ``shocked'' by his own statement that appeared to question
democracy in the Southeast Asian nation.
	   In an interview with a local newspaper, Malott had said a
country could not be called a democracy just because it held
elections. Mahathir, now Asia's longest-serving leader, has been in
power 17 years.
	   ``Stalin held elections. Even Hitler held elections,'' Malott
said in an interview with The Star daily. `` Democracy is a process
of allowing all views to he heard, of allowing the competition of
ideas.''
	   U.S. Embassy spokesman Barclay said the ambassador's comments
were not intended to draw a comparison between Malaysia and any
other political regime.
	   ``He was just reaffirming Gore's words that democracy involves a
process,'' Barclay said of Malott's interview.
	   Nuek told Malott that countries should not comment on the
affairs of other nations.
	   ``Such an idea will only lead to the law of the jungle in the
relations between countries,'' Nuek said.
	   Malott said relations between the United States and Malaysia
were ``much better than (people) think.''
	   ``In the long term, I have nothing but optimism for our
relationship,'' the U.S. ambassador said.
	   However, Gore's remarks have triggered a national outcry against
the United States. A hot line was hooked up over the weekend for
callers to register anti-U.S. sentiments.
	   An effigy of Gore was burned at a gathering of several hundred
people carrying anti-American placards in the northern state of
Perlis on Sunday.
	   Radio blurbs urge people to pick up their free Malaysian
mini-flags, and many cars and taxis in the capital have placed them
on their hoods in a show of Malaysian pride.

Hong Kong share prices surge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Share prices in Hong Kong surged Monday,
boosted by cuts in local interest rates.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 281.17 points, or 2.7
percent, closing at 10,514.53. On Friday, the index had lost 79.94
points.
	   Turnover amounted to 8.55 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.09 billion), up slightly from Friday's 8.46 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 1.08 billion).
	   Brokers said shares rose in reaction to Friday's cut in local
interest rates, the second cut in just over a month. Hong Kong
banks also slashed their prime lending rates to 9.5 percent from
9.75 percent.
	   The Hong Kong market was also lifted by Friday's gains on Wall
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 103.50 points,
or 1.1 percent, closing at 9,159.55.
	   Banking shares closed sharply higher. HSBC Holdings rose 11.00
Hong Kong dollars to 197.50, and Hang Seng Bank rose 1.75 dollars
to 68.75.
	   Among properties, Sun Hung Kai Properties rose 1.75 dollars to
57.25, and Cheung Kong rose 75 cents to 58.00.
	   Elsewhere, Hutchison Whampoa rose 1.75 dollars to 57.00, and
Swire Pacific ``A'' rose 40 cents to 35.40.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES 3rd, 4th with meeting with Chinese leader concluded,
spokesman says Yeltsin working, ADDS 5th graf with briefing on
Yeltsin canceled &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital
with what doctors described as a very high temperature and
pneumonia in the latest health crisis for the Russian leader,
officials said Monday.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics, but the
officials declined to give further details.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin met Monday in the hospital with visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, the Kremlin said. The Chinese delegation in a convoy
of cars was seen entering and leaving the grounds of the hospital.
	   A Kremlin spokesman, who declined to be named, said after the
meeting that Yeltsin was ``working,'' but gave no further details.
	   A briefing by Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin on the
president's health, which was announced Monday morning for later in
the day, was later canceled without explanation.
	   The 67-year-old president has rarely been seen in public in
recent weeks, raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang were to sign a statement on border
demarcation. The summit _ Jiang's sixth meeting with Yeltsin _ will
focus on broad issues of expanding Russian-Chinese cooperation.
	   Yeltsin has been staying at his country home outside Moscow in
recent weeks after falling ill in October with respiratory
problems. The president's doctors said he was suffering from high
blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.
	   Yeltsin's wife, Naina, said recently that the president is
struggling with the very cold weather that has hit Moscow in recent
weeks, but that he was capable of handling his duties.

Singapore ready to assist economically troubled neighbor Malaysia

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said Monday that
Singapore is willing to provide funds for economically troubled
Malaysia on ``very favorable terms'' in conjunction with an
agreement on water supplies for his city-state.
	   Goh did not specify a figure, though Singapore is believed ready
to offer a substantial aid package for its beleaguered neighbor.
	   Speaking in Parliament, Goh said the assistance could take the
form of a direct loan from the Singapore government, a financial
guarantee or a Singaporean purchase of Malaysian bonds.
	   The two countries, whose ties have been strained in recent
months, are also negotiating a new water agreement. Singapore
imports about half its daily water needs from Malaysia, and
discussions to renew current agreements have repeatedly broken
down.
	   ``The two proposals are win-win, because Singapore will provide
or raise funds for Malaysia on very favorable terms,'' Goh said.
``These funds will help Malaysia meet its financial requirements
and overcome its economic challenge.''
	   He added that ``in turn, with the new water agreement,
Singapore's long-term supply of water will be secured.''
	   Cautioning that ``we cannot assume yet that we will reach
agreement,'' Goh said it was ``premature to go into details today''
on the amount of funds or the status of the water talks.
	   Goh met his Malaysian counterpart, Mahathir Mohamad, earlier
this month to mend ties after a seven-month hiatus in top-level
meetings between the two neighbors.
	   The surprise visit followed months of squabbling over issues
including alleged airspace violations, the relocation of a border
checkpoint, and an unflattering portrait of past Malaysian leaders
in Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs.
	   Goh said their meetings ``represent a change in attitude on both
sides toward restoring and improving bilateral ties,'' adding that
there is ``a greater chance now that such improvement will be
sustained, especially if we conclude the loan and water
agreements.''
	   Goh shrugged off concerns that by offering financial help to
Malaysia, Singapore might alienate its longstanding ally the United
States, which may block loans to Malaysia because of its capital
controls.
	   ``I myself do not expect the U.S. to object to our assistance
for Malaysia in this particular case, because we're getting
something in return which is of tremendous importance to us over
the longer term,'' said Goh.
	   Malaysia is Singapore's largest trading partner and, though
competitors, their economies are closely intertwined. In addition,
Singapore considers a renewed water pact crucial for its security.
	   On Malaysian claims of Singapore air force intrusions into its
airspace, the island republic ``categorically rejects all these
allegations as being completely without basis,'' said Minister of
State for Defense Matthais Yao.
	   ``It is not reasonable to keep on repeating the allegations
without providing any details to substantiate them,'' he added.
	   Malaysia and Singapore ``should be trying to clear up any
misunderstanding instead of making statements which raise tension
and increase the likelihood that a dangerous situation might
arise,'' Yao said.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ A strike to protest European Union rail
liberalization plans paralyzed train traffic throughout Belgium
Monday and turned the morning rush hour into the main cities into a
crawl.
	   Belgian rail authorities warned the strike of the main Christian
Democrat and Socialist unions would continue throughout the day,
forcing hundreds of thousands of rail commuters to seek alternative
transport home.
	   Traffic jams into Brussels started early and were extra long. By
7 a.m. (0600GMT) traffic was already at a standstill some 40
kilometers (25 miles) out of the capital on the busy highway from
Ghent. Scenes were just as chaotic around northern Antwerp.
	   There are similar strikes in France, Spain, Portugal, Greece and
Luxembourg.

Chinese police question dissident intellectual, detain six others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police seized computers from the offices
of an association of dissident intellectuals Monday and hauled away
seven of the group's members, a rights group reported.
	   Police released Peng Ming, the group's leader, at midday after
questioning him for three hours, but the six others remained in
custody, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China reported.
	   A joint team of police and Civil Affairs Bureau officials
searched the northern Beijing office of the China Development
Union, their second raid since the bureau ordered Peng to disband
the group Oct. 26.
	   Ever since, Peng has tried to be careful, pushing the limits of
legality without being too confrontational. The union's weekly
salon meetings in the Beijing office have steered clear of
political topics. Signs warn participants not to criticize
government leaders.
	   Despite the approach, Chinese authorities remain determined to
squelch perceived challenges to Communist Party rule. Since June,
police have relentlessly pursued dissidents attempting to set up an
opposition party.
	   Peng, a former official and businessman turned political
campaigner, claims his union has attracted 11,000 members
nationwide since it was set up early this year. He hopes the group
will be a force for change when China becomes more open and
pluralistic.
	   The Information Center reported that police also searched union
offices in Chifeng, a city in China's Inner Mongolian region, on
Nov. 16 and subjected 10 of its members to periodic questioning.
	   In Monday's search, Beijing police confiscated two computers, a
fax machine, a photocopier and ``a large number of documents,'' the
Information Center said.
	   Taken away along with Peng were Wen Dehao, Gan Quan, Yi Gai,
Wang Ji'an, Lin Jian and Chu Weiyan.

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 East Timorese students
occupied the provincial Parliament Monday amid reports that the
Indonesian military had killed more than 40 people last week.
	   The students demanded a total withdrawal of troops from the
former Portuguese colony.
	   Earlier, East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop
Carlos Belo, said he had received reports that between 30 and 40
people were killed by Indonesian troops in a series of clashes with
rebels fighting for independence.
	   The alleged slayings took place near the villages of Alas and
Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili.
	   Belo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996, said that so far,
only 11 bodies had been identified.
	   However, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl
denied church reports of many deaths.
	   ``In our view it's not true, because their sources were not
clear,'' he said.
	   East Timorese groups in Portugal claim that as many as 50 people
might have been killed.
	   Mario Carrascalao, a former governor in East Timor and now an
adviser to Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, told the Portuguese
news agency Lusa that at least 44 people were killed.
	   The Indonesian military has denied the reports that it massacred
rebels.
	   About 100 riot officers watched as university and senior high
school students forced their way into the Parliament, where they
staged a noisy but peaceful rally.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim over the
disputed territory. However, it has been sponsoring talks between
Portugal and Indonesia over East Timor's future.
	   Indonesia has offered to give East Timor autonomy in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was
seriously disturbed by reports of civilian casualties.
	   Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia following reports of
a massacre, Foreign Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said in
Lisbon.

Free State score upset victory over Windies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) _ The West Indies touring team
tumbled to an improbable two-wicket defeat Monday against Free
State on the final morning of their scheduled four-day match at
Springbok Park.
	   This was their final warmup game before the first match of a
five-test series begins in Johannesburg Thursday.
	   Seemingly in control of proceedings at the start of play on the
third day, the tourists were bundled out for a lowly 188 by some
accurate seam bowling by Free State debutant Johan van der Wath
(5/26) and South African captain Hansie Cronje (3/22).
	   And it was the same two who were at the wicket when the winning
run was struck by Van der Wath Monday. But it was Cronje who had
hammered the nails that mattered into the West Indies coffin, with
an undefeated innings of 157. He inflicted most of the damage on
Sunday evening, when WIndies captain Brian Lara had enforced an
extra half-hour of play in an attempt to winkle out the remaining
two wickets standing between him and a victory that had seemed
likely when he set the home team a mammoth 438 to win.
	   His decision backfired as Cronje launched an extraordinary
assault on the spin bowlers, who were the only ones allowed to bowl
by the umpires in the gathering gloom.
	   Had Lara taken the new ball when it was due, the umpires would
certainly have called off play for the day, and Lara would have
been able to let his quick men loose with many more runs left for
Free State to chase.
	   Instead, he takes his team into the first test without a win on
tour as yet, and the knowledge that the South African captain has
been dominant with both bat and ball, and is not even the best the
South Africans have to offer in either department.

 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The European Union and the Vatican
have urged the Philippines to cancel its first execution in 22
years and repeal the death penalty, Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said Monday.
	   The scheduled execution of Leo Echegaray, convicted of
repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, has triggered a
debate over the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   Siazon said the European Union and the Vatican recently sent
messages urging the government to abolish capital punishment,
arguing it would not reduce widespread crime.
	   President Joseph Estrada has been informed of the appeals but is
unlikely to change his earlier decision not to pardon Echegaray,
Siazon said. ``We have our national laws. We have to follow the
law,'' he told reporters.
	   Estrada said Echegaray's execution would deter similar crimes.
	   Last week, Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court issued an order to National Prisons Director Pedro
Sistoza to execute Echegaray. Ponferrada fixed an execution date
but ordered Sistoza not to reveal it publicly.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said Sistoza has informed him
that the execution may take place next year. He said he would
petition the Supreme Court to order Ponferrada to reveal the
execution date to the public.
	   Sources at the justice department say the earliest date that
could be set for the execution is Dec. 16, when all legal
requirements, including the publication of revised execution rules,
would be completed. However, an execution is unlikely during the
Christmas season, forcing officials to postpone it until January.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Under current government rules, Echegaray would be informed of
his impending execution only after sunrise on execution day.
Lawyers have appealed to Ponferrada to inform Echegaray of the
execution date so he could prepare for it but the judge turned down
the request.
	   Prison chaplain Roberto Olaguer said Echegaray has accepted his
fate but is requesting that Philippine officials allow him to marry
a longtime girlfriend before he is put to death. The woman is
different from the common-law wife with whom he has five children,
including the stepdaughter he was convicted of raping.
	   Cuevas said the request probably would be rejected because it is
one of the civil rights Echegaray lost because of his conviction.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for heinous crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter crime, and that
crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

China's economic growth to remain strong: report
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's annual economic growth rate is expected
to average at least 7.5 percent from 1998 to 2000 and may even
accelerate to 9 percent after 2000, an official newspaper reported
Monday.
	   In light of the continuing Asian financial crisis and possible
global slowdown, growth of 7.5 percent will be a key
``psychological level'' for China in the next few years, the
People's Daily quoted Wang Jiachun, an official in the Finance
Ministry's general department, as saying.
	   As long as growth remains at a minimum 7.5 percent and the
yuan's exchange rate is kept stable, China will still be able to
attract foreign investment, Wang said.
	   He added that he expected the slowdown in the global economy to
turn around by 2002, which means China's gross domestic product _
the total value of goods and services produced _ will grow even
faster by then.
	   ``There is a possibility that in the next century, the country's
GDP will grow more than 9 percent a year,'' he said.
	   China's GDP rose 7.2 percent in the first nine months this year,
compared with 8.8 percent growth in 1997.
	   Economists estimate China needs 8 percent growth to provide jobs
for the newly unemployed and maintain social stability.

Israeli police fear Christian suicides on Temple Mount
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police are preparing for the
possibility that messianic Christians will try to commit suicide on
the Temple Mount as the millennium approaches, the Jerusalem police
commander said Monday.
	   The government has alotted dlrs 12 million to upgrade security
at the Temple Mount amid concerns that Jewish or Christian
extremists might attack the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques at
the site. The additional money would pay for the deployment of some
400 policemen and security devices such as closed circuit cameras
and sensor pads, Israel radio said.
	   Al Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in the Islamic world.
In biblical times, the first and second Jewish temples stood there.
	   Some Christian cults believe that the destruction of the mosques
will lead to the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple, and this will
hasten the end of the world and the second coming of Christ.
	   The Jerusalem police commander, Yair Yitzhaki, confirmed Tuesday
that 10 members of a Denver doomsday cult, Concerned Christians,
had arrived in Israel. Cult members sold their belongings and left
the Denver area in October.
	   Cult watchers have warned that cult members might head to Israel
on orders from their leader, Monte Kim Miller. Miller has said he
will die in Jerusalem in December 1999 and be resurrected three
days later.
	   Yitzhaki refused to elaborate on the whereabouts of the cult
members in Israel. ``Every additional word I say could harm the
very important work being done now,'' Yitzhaki told Israel radio.
	   Yitzhaki said that ``the matter of messianic activity with the
approach of the year 2000 is a matter we have been dealing with for
a very long time.''
	   Asked about suicide attempts by cult members, he said: ``We are
also preparing for that possibility, which is relatively new,
compared with the other threats against the Temple Mount. It very
much hope we can cope with it, too.''
	   A number of Christians have already rented lodgings in Arab
neighborhoods on the Mount of Olives, which overlooks the Temple
Mount, in expectation that Jesus will return soon.
	   The Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary, is in the walled Old City of Jerusalem, which was
captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. It is
considered the most sensitive spot in the Mideast conflict.
	   A fire started at Al Aqsa in 1969 by an Australian tourist,
Denis Michael Rohan, caused anti-Israel riots in the Palestinian
areas and angry demonstrations throughout the Islamic world.
	   An assault on the site would almost certainly trigger new
violence and undermine the Israeli-Arab peace process.
	   Israel expects millions of Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy
Land during the millennium. The government's anti-terrorism
adviser, Meir Dagan, had proposed security measures to deal with
extremists among the pilgrims, the Prime Minister's office has
confirmed.

China to build more warehouses for grain reserves
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China is spending 15 billion yuan (dlrs 1.82
billion) to expand and build new warehouses for state grain
reserves, the official newspaper China Daily reported Monday.
	   Citing an official with the State Grain Reserves Bureau, the
report said 388 warehouses will have the capacity to store 25
billion kilograms (27.5 million tons) of grain after the expansion
drive is completed. All projects are to begin this year and finish
in time for next year's summer harvest.
	   The investment amount makes up for insufficient funding in years
past, when excess stocks often rotted or were otherwise wasted due
to inadequate storage.
	   China has 15 special warehouses for state grain reserves, the
newspaper said.
	   The actual amount of the country's total reserves _ a classified
figure _ was not given.

Hongkong Telecom agrees to buy rival Internet provider

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hongkong Telecom said Monday it has agreed to
buy the money-losing Internet business of rival Star Telecom
International Holding Ltd. in a deal that would give it slightly
more than half of the territory's booming Internet market.
	   Hongkong Telecom wants to buy Star Internet, a subsidiary of
Star Telecom, for 245.5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 31.5
million). The sale will close only if government approval is
obtained by Dec. 31, Hongkong Telecom said in a statement.
	   Although Hong Kong has no anti-monopoly laws for Internet
service providers, regulators will study the merger's effects on
market competition and consumer interest before issuing any
approvals, said Danny Ng, a spokesman for Hong Kong's
Telecommunications Authority.
	   ``We don't want to jeopardize consumer interest,'' Ng said.
	   It was unclear whether the merger would lead to job losses.
Hongkong Telecom said it would discuss job offers with Star
Internet staff and it would ``expect majority acceptance.''
	   Star Internet employs more than 100 people and was negotiating
with labor representatives Monday, said spokesman Michael Chung. He
declined to disclose details.
	   Hongkong Telecom has been aggressively expanding into new
markets to cushion the loss of revenue it will likely face after
Jan. 1, when it surrenders its monopoly for international direct
dial telephone services in exchange for 6.7 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 858 million).
	   The Internet appears to be a logical place to seek out more
business for Hongkong Telecom, a subsidiary of Britain's Cable and
Wireless PLC.
	   Hongkong Telecom said recently its Internet traffic has grown by
more than 85 percent in the past six months.
	   Hongkong Telecom's Internet operation is the territory's
biggest, with more than 210,000 subscribers, spokeswoman Michelle
Li said. Star Internet is the second largest Internet service
provider in Hong Kong, with about 80,000 subscribers, she said.
	   The deal would give Hongkong Telecom about 53 percent of Hong
Kong's Internet market, Li said.
	   Star Telecom said in a statement that it will use cash from the
sale for general working capital but it doesn't have any specific
plans.
	   Despite the sizable market share held by Star Internet, it has
been a money-loser for Star Telecom, which also provides
radio-paging, data communications, and cellular telephone services,
and is involved in paging and mobile telecom networks in mainland
China.
	   While Star Telecom narrowed its group losses last year, the
losses at the Internet subsidiary came to 15.8 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.03 million) in 1997, up from a 6.1 million
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 782,000) loss in 1996.

Two Ukrainians try to swim to Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli coast guard boats were searching Monday
for two Ukrainians who jumped from a cruise ship and tried to swim
ashore after being refused entry to Israel, Israel radio said.
	   The two were aboard the Cypriot passenger ship Princessa Marissa
and plunged into the Mediterranean about 7 kilometers (4 miles)
offshore, Israel radio said.
	   On Sunday night, the ship had docked in the Israeli port of
Haifa but police refused to allow the two to come ashore.
	   Israel has a growing population of foreign workers, many of them
residing in the country illegally, and is trying to reduce their
numbers by stricter immigration controls.

Chinese retreat behind barricades as Indonesian violence turns

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rina Taufan peers fearfully through
the steel gates that barricade her store in Jakarta's Chinatown,
where mobs ran riot, burned churches and businesses and killed at
least 13 people.
	   ``I heard that they are not satisfied yet,'' the 38-year-old
Chinese immigrant said Monday. ``If they come back, I will be here
too. If they burn next door, I will be dead.''
	   Next door is a gambling house she says has the same owner as one
that was the first target of Sunday's violence. Muslim mobs set
fire to the building and a neighboring Protestant church. They
hacked and beat to death Christian guards from the eastern
Indonesian island of Ambon. More burned to death inside.
	   The violence triggered a rioting spree and attacks on other
Christian churches, a Catholic school and Chinese businesses in the
district, one of the most violent-prone in Indonesia's capital.
	   Standing amid the rubble of his gutted and still-smoking church,
Pastor Johannes Linandi said he was forced to flee when the mob
struck. Luckily, the attack occurred between routine Sunday
services, and only a handful of people were inside.
	   ``They hit me with their fists and with a piece of wood as I ran
out. They had knives but I ran down a street,'' Linandi said.
	   About 90 percent of the parishioners are members of the ethnic
Chinese minority. He said rioters chased the Ambonese guards into
the church and brought in cans of gasoline to start the fire.
	   On Monday, the gruesome search for bodies began as crowds
watched.
	   ``This will fracture relations between religious communities,''
said Suroto, a Muslim construction worker.
	   Observers say Sunday's violence could unleash deep-seated ethnic
and religious divisions that are products of Indonesian history and
have been heightened by the worst economic crisis and political
turmoil in 30 years.
	   ``The Chinese minority are always targeted during times of
unrest,'' said Dede Oetomo, anthropology and linguistics professor
at Airlangga University in Surabaya, Indonesia's second biggest
city.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
of 202 million. But they play a dominant role in the economy, and
this has long invited resentment that has often spilled into
violence.
	   Chinese immigrants were segregated from the indigenous
population under former Dutch colonial rule. Since that time, they
have been regarded as outsiders.
	   Many Chinese were killed in a bloody backlash over an abortive
communist coup in 1965.
	   They continued to stay apart from other Indonesians during the
32-year rule of autocratic ex-President Suharto, said Dede.
	   When student protests and riots helped oust Suharto in May,
thousands of Chinese shops and homes in Jakarta were attacked.
Women's groups say as many as 168 women, most of them Chinese, were
raped.
	   Adding to ethnic tensions are religious ones. Up to 90 percent
of Indonesia's population is Muslim, making it the world's most
populous Islamic nation.
	   The remainder are a mix of Christian denominations and Buddhism.
	   During Sunday's violence, several stores in Chinatown were
burned. Witnesses said ethnic Chinese residents armed themselves
with sticks and knives to protect their homes and stores.
	   Rina, whose husband Johnny Aziz is Muslim, said the peace that
normally exists between Muslim Indonesians and Chinese Christians
is a fragile facade.
	   ``Even though my husband is a Muslim, I can feel the hatred in
the air,'' she said. The couple, who met as college students in the
United States, are considering emigrating to neighboring Australia
to escape the violence.
	   Rioters use religion as an excuse to unleash violence against
Chinese, she said.
	   ``Most Chinese are Christian and they hate Chinese. When they
think of Christians, they think of Chinese.''
	   She said the Chinese were powerless. Police and the military
sided with the Muslims, she said.

Homeless, aged in peril as cold snap hits France
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The death toll from a cold snap across France rose
to six Monday, after police found three homeless men dead. One of
them was found on the steps of a hotel in southern France.
	   After a very cold weekend during which three deaths were
reported, the temperature in Paris on Monday morning was minus 5
Celsius (23 F) _ slightly higher than on Sunday.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower were completely frozen.
	   In Mouthe, eastern France, temperatures fell to minus 21 Celsius
(minus 6 F) on Monday morning.
	   In most parts, temperatures at midday were not expected to rise
much above freezing point.
	   France Info radio said a homeless man was found dead in a car in
northern Paris Monday. Another was found dead in front of a hotel
in the southern city of Marseille. A third was found in the
northern town of Cambrai.
	   The cold weather hitting much of Europe was expected to remain
in France until the end of the week.

Japanese whaling ship stalls off Australia after fire breaks out
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese whaling ship on a government-led
research mission is stalled off Australia's east coast after a fire
broke out on board four days ago, officials said Monday.
	   No injuries were reported from the fire on the Nisshin Maru,
currently drifting 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of
Brisbane, said Shimon Harima, a spokesman for Japan's Maritime
Safety Agency.
	   The fire appeared to be under control, although the crew has not
yet determined whether it has been completely extinguished, said
Hitoshi Yamamoto, a spokesman of Kyodo Sempaku, the ship's
operator.
	   The 7,575-ton Nisshin Maru, carrying a crew of 111, was on its
way to Antarctic seas for Japan's annual research whaling program.
That program has often been criticized because meat from the whales
killed for research is sold on the market, with proceeds going to
the whaling industry.
	   Commercial whaling is banned throughout the world. Japan has
continued with research in an effort to gather evidence that would
persuade regulators to lift the ban.
	   Yamamoto said the crew believed the fire broke out in the
factory section of the ship, part of which is directly above the
engine room. The cause of the fire was not immediately known, he
said.
	   The crew was currently airing out the engine room, which was
believed undamaged by the fire, Yamamoto said.
	   The Nisshin Maru is the mother ship for a five-vessel whaling
team.
	   After assessing the extent of damage from the fire, the operator
will decide whether to send the Nisshin Maru back to Japan or have
it towed to a nearby port for repairs, Yamamoto said.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rioters crashed the wedding, chased
away the guests and wrecked the church. But groom Chandra Gunarto
and bride Threewaty got married anyway.
	   ``It's not how we wanted it to happen. But we have gone ahead
with it,'' Chandra, a 27-year-old sales manager, said Monday.
	   Sunday's wedding was interrupted when an angry mob of Muslim
youths ran through the front doors of the Sacred Heart Catholic
Church after running amok in Jakarta's Chinatown.
	   Thirteen people were killed in the violence and 10 other
churches were burned or ransacked.
	   The mob broke stained glass windows, smashed up pews and
statues, threw Bibles on to a bonfire and wrecked the altar.
	   The couple, the priest and about 60 guests ran to a community
hall at the rear of the church and barricaded themselves in.
	   Anti-riot police broke up the melee with warning shots.
	   ``After that, the priest asked us if we still wanted to get
married. So we had the ceremony in a small prayer room at the back
of the church,'' Chandra said. ``It was very moving. Everyone
cried.''

No oil contracts signed for next oil-for-food phase
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has signed no contracts with foreign
firms for deliveries of crude oil after the current phase of the
oil-for-food deal ends Wednesday, Oil Ministry officials said
Monday.
	   Extending or renewing the six-month deal is a political decision
and the government has not yet given orders to sign new contracts,
the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Iraq had hoped that the current leg, allowing it to export up to
dlrs 5.2 billion in oil, would be the last under the agreement with
the United Nations letting Iraq export limited oil to buy food and
medicine for the 22 million Iraqis.
	   The oil-for-food program is an exception to U.N. sanctions,
which were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait and will
not be lifted until Iraq proves to U.N. arms inspectors that it has
eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   However, nothing suggests the inspectors will give Iraq a clean
bill of health given the latest standoffs over weapons inspections
and demands for information on past weapons programs.
	   Iraq is trying to persuade the U.N. Security Council to extend
the present phase for another two months since low oil prices hurt
its ability to generate the dlrs 5.2 billion in income.
	   The Oil Ministry officials said they expected the Security
Council to meet Wednesday to decide the next step. They said there
could be an interruption of exports for a few days as decisions are
made on the program.
	   Iraq produces about 2.6 million barrels of oil a day, comparable
to the quota set for it by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries before sanctions were imposed. Nearly 2 million barrels
are earmarked for exports.

Courts issue 19 death sentences in 10 months in one Vietnamese

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ The central Vietnam province of Nghe An
has sentenced 19 people to death and three others to life in prison
on drug-trafficking charges this year, a court official said
Monday.
	   They were among 243 drug-related defendants in 115 cases in the
courts so far this year, the official said.
	   Last year, the courts issued only four death sentences on drug
charges, he said, adding that traffickers may find the province
bordering Laos a good place to operate after a high-profile drug
syndicate masterminded by a police captain was uncovered last year
in another province.
	   Earlier this month, an official at Nghe An's Nghi Kim prison
said the facility's death row has been overcrowded by the surge,
with 22 inmates awaiting execution but only 16 cells designed to
hold them.
	   The newspaper Labor reported Monday that provincial police have
arrested 15 heroin traffickers and that many of them would face the
death penalty.
	   The paper estimates that 54 billion dong (dlrs 4 million) have
been used on drugs annually in Nghe An _ equal to about 10 percent
of the provincial budget.
	   The paper quoted provincial police as saying that in some
villages, hundreds of farmers are involved in drug trafficking and
that some families have been involved for two or three generations.
	   Of the 137 people in the province who have been detected as
carrying the AIDS-causing HIV virus, 131 are drug addicts, it said,
adding that 20 people have died so far this year from drug
overdoses.
	   The paper said police in Nghe An have arrested 389 people on
drug trafficking charges in 283 cases in the past 10 months,
seizing 8.5 kilograms (18.7 pounds) of heroin and 289 kilograms
(637 pounds) of opium.

Israeli police fear Christian suicides on Temple Mount
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JACK KATZENELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police are worried messianic Christians
might try to commit suicide on the Temple Mount as the millennium
approaches, the Jerusalem police commander said Monday.
	   The government has alotted dlrs 12 million to upgrade security
at the Temple Mount amid concerns that Jewish or Christian
extremists might attack the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques at
the site. The additional money would pay for some 400 policemen and
security devices such as closed circuit cameras and sensor pads,
Israel radio said.
	   Al Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in the Islamic world.
In biblical times, the first and second Jewish temples stood there.
	   Some Christian cults believe the destruction of the mosques will
lead to the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple, and this will hasten
the end of the world and the second coming of Christ.
	   The Jerusalem police commander, Yair Yitzhaki, confirmed Tuesday
that 10 members of a Denver doomsday cult, Concerned Christians,
had arrived in Israel. Cult members sold their belongings and left
the Denver area in October.
	   Cult watchers have warned that cult members might head to Israel
on orders from their leader, Monte Kim Miller. Miller has said he
will die in Jerusalem in December 1999 and be resurrected three
days later.
	   Yitzhaki refused to elaborate on the whereabouts of the cult
members in Israel. ``Every additional word I say could harm the
very important work being done now,'' Yitzhaki told Israel radio.
	   Yitzhaki said ``the matter of messianic activity with the
approach of the year 2000 is a matter we have been dealing with for
a very long time.''
	   Asked about suicide attempts by cult members, he said: ``We are
also preparing for that possibility, which is relatively new,
compared with the other threats against the Temple Mount. I very
much hope we can cope with it, too.''
	   A number of Christians have already rented lodgings in Arab
neighborhoods on the Mount of Olives, which overlooks the Temple
Mount, in expectation that Jesus will return soon.
	   The Temple Mount, known to Muslims as Haram as-Sharif, or Noble
Sanctuary, is in the walled Old City of Jerusalem, which was
captured by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war. It is
considered the most sensitive spot in the Mideast conflict.
	   A fire started at Al Aqsa in 1969 by an Australian tourist,
Denis Michael Rohan, caused anti-Israel riots in the Palestinian
areas and demonstrations throughout the Islamic world.
	   An assault on the site would almost certainly trigger new
violence and undermine the peace process.
	   Israel expects millions of Christian pilgrims to visit the Holy
Land during the millennium. The government's anti-terrorism
adviser, Meir Dagan, has proposed security measures to deal with
extremists among the pilgrims, the Prime Minister's office has
confirmed.

Laotian prime minister visits Myanmar

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Prime Minister Sisavath Keobounphan of
Laos arrived Monday in Yangon for a four-day goodwill visit at the
invitation of the military government.
	   Senior Gen. Than Shwe, head of the ruling State Peace and
Development Council, greeted Sisavath and his wife at Yangon's
airport. No details of their expected activities were released by
either government.
	   The two sides recently reported progress on demarcation of their
common border, which along with Thailand forms part of the
notorious Golden Triangle opium-growing area.
	   Laos and Myanmar, also known as Burma, are two of the poorest
countries in Asia. Both joined the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations last year. Laotian leaders visited Myanmar in 1992 and
1995.

Israeli police fear Christian suicides on Temple Mount

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli police are preparing for the
possibility that messianic Christians will try to commit suicide on
the Temple Mount as the millennium approaches, the Jerusalem police
commander said Monday.
	   The government has alotted dlrs 12 million to upgrade security
at the Temple Mount amid concerns that Jewish or Christian
extremists might attack the Al Aqsa and Dome of the Rock mosques at
the site. The additional money would pay for the deployment of some
400 policemen and security devices such as closed circuit cameras
and sensor pads, Israel radio said.
	   Al Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest site in the Islamic world.
In biblical times, the first and second Jewish temples stood there.
	   Some Christian cults believe that the destruction of the mosques
will lead to the rebuilding of the Jewish Temple, and this will
hasten the end of the world and the second coming of Christ.
	   The Jerusalem police commander, Yair Yitzhaki, confirmed Monday
that 10 members of a Denver doomsday cult, Concerned Christians,
had arrived in Israel. Cult members sold their belongings and left
the Denver area in October.
	   Cult watchers have warned that cult members might head to Israel
on orders from their leader, Monte Kim Miller. Miller has said he
will die in Jerusalem in December 1999 and be resurrected three
days later.
	   Yitzhaki refused to elaborate on the whereabouts of the cult
members in Israel. ``Every additional word I say could harm the
very important work being done now,'' Yitzhaki told Israel radio.
	   Yitzhaki said that ``the matter of messianic activity with the
approach of the year 2000 is a matter we have been dealing with for
a very long time.''
	   Asked about suicide attempts by cult members, he said: ``We are
also preparing for that possibility, which is relatively new,
compared with the other threats against the Temple Mount. I very
much hope we can cope with it, too.''

	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) _ Rebels killed five people in an ambush
on a car in southern Burundi, and soldiers responding to the raid
killed one of the attackers, the army spokesman said Monday.
	   The raid occurred Sunday near a commune in Makamba province,
about 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of the Burundian capital,
Bujumbura, said Lt. Col. Isaie Nibizi.
	   Makamba is one of four provinces in Burundi where Hutu rebels
have been actively fighting the predominantly Tutsi army.
	   More than 100 people have been killed around Bujumbura this
month in attacks by Hutu rebels and retaliation by government
soldiers.
	   The victims include civilians killed by soldiers on the night of
Nov. 3-4 in Mutambu commune, 35 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of
the capital.
	   Survivors said soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated army killed more
than 100 mainly Hutu civilians in retaliation for a Hutu rebel
attack on a nearby camp for displaced Tutsis.
	   The government, which put the number of dead at 56, later
apologized for the killings and said two soldiers and an officer
had been detained for questioning.
	   The U.N. Security Council condemned the escalating violence in
Burundi and called for a cease-fire and punishment for the
massacre.
	   More than 200,000 people have been killed since 1993 when the
violence erupted after Tutsi paratroopers killed the country's
first democratically-elected president, a Hutu, in a failed coup.
	   Negotiations under the auspices of the Organization of African
Unity chaired by retired Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere have
failed to end the violence.
	   Hutus for 85 percent of Burundi's population of 6.2 million;
Tutsis make up 14 percent.

Death toll in Indonesia's ethnic, religious violence rises to 13
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 179 suspected rioters detained, small student
protests &QL;

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescue workers on Monday pulled seven
bodies from a gutted gambling parlor that was burned by Muslim
mobs, raising the death toll to 13 from ethnic and religious
violence.
	   Many Christian schools, meanwhile, were closed after riots
Sunday in which mobs of Muslim youths set fire to churches and
attacked Christians. Soldiers patrolled riot-hit areas in north
Jakarta, but there were no fresh reports of unrest.
	   Security forces detained 179 people during the riots, said Brig.
Gen. Togar Sianipar, a national police spokesmen.
	   The seven newly discovered victims burned to death or died of
smoke inhalation, said Edward Bachtiar, an official of the
Indonesian Red Cross.
	   Two were members of the ethnic Chinese minority, which is often
targeted during social strife, partly because it dominates trade
and commerce. Also, most Chinese in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia
are Christian or Buddhist.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is at the center of student protests
for not planning wider changes to Indonesia's political system,
blamed unidentified agitators and urged restraint.
	   ``I call on the people not to be easily provoked to take actions
to serve the purpose of a certain group that wants to disintegrate
the nation,'' Habibie said.
	   Without elaborating, a prominent Muslim leader said that thugs
had carefully planned the riots, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid, head of the country's largest Islamic group,
Nadhlatul Ulama, and opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
condemned the violence.
	   ``We have to be careful with cruel actions made under a
religious pretext,'' they said in a statement.
	   The weekend violence came amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as inflation
and unemployment rates soar.
	   ``If there is a riot every day, economic restoration will slow
down,'' Habibie said. ``Eliminate the feeling of prejudice.''
	   Habibie has been under pressure to speed up his reform program
following the resignation in May of former authoritarian leader
Suharto. Opponents say Habibie, once a protege of Suharto, is not
serious about introducing real democracy.
	   The Sunday riots broke out a little more than a week after
deadly clashes between students and security personnel also
triggered rioting. As many as 17 people died in the earlier
clashes. The last died Sunday at a hospital.
	   Hundreds of anti-government students boycotted classes Monday at
Atma Jaya Catholic University, which reopened for the first time
since at least half a dozen students were fatally shot in fighting
around the campus Nov. 13.
	   Elsewhere, about 100 students staged two peaceful protests
against the government.
	   Dozens were reported injured in Sunday's clashes between the
Muslim majority and Christians originally from the eastern city of
Ambon.
	   Troops desperate to restore order fired shots and volleys of
tear gas to break up rock-throwing crowds that officials said had
burned four churches and ransacked seven others.
	   The government, which is short of cash because of the economic
turmoil, pledged to help rebuild the damaged buildings.
	   Muslim residents who disapprove of gambling burned the betting
parlor, where Ambonese were working as guards, and said their
attacks were retaliation after rumors that the Ambonese had
attacked mosques.
	   ``We feel very sad because we're still far from the hope of
solidarity between religious communities,'' said Father Roy
Djakarya of the Jakarta Roman Catholic Archdiocese. ``Why do we so
easily judge rumors without thinking about the truth behind them?''
	   On Sunday, the Indonesian Red Cross recovered six bodies,
including five Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken
bottles.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However,
religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy.

	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Minibus taxis careen through
the crowded roads. Hawkers sell roasted chops and bottles of
whisky. Inside the stadium, marijuana smoke wafts upward as
security guards with whips oversee the crowd filling more than
50,000 unreserved seats.
	   The fans at this recent derby between Kaiser Chiefs and Orlando
Pirates, South Africa's two most popular soccer teams, sing and
sway with African rhythms.
	   Not your typical World Cup scene.
	   But the day captured many of the pluses and minuses of the
rainbow nation's bid to stage the 2006 soccer showpiece.
	   Skeptics point to the country's high crime, bad transportation
system, lack of wealth and disorganized national soccer scene.
	   But South Africa's soccer mandarins brush aside the practical
arguments against holding the World Cup here, in favor of what they
say is more important.
	   It is Africa's turn, and Europe's moral obligation to a nation
emerging from decades of racist rule, where the long-oppressed
black majority lives for soccer.
	   The World Cup ``provides a vision, a focus, for a society in
transition, which is moving from a divided past to a united
future,'' said Danny Jordaan, head of the World Cup bid committee.
	   Jordaan cites the many African players now playing in Europe,
the success of African teams like Cameroon and Nigeria in recent
editions and the ``life-giving force'' that is soccer to the black
population.
	   The committee's news releases even play the Nelson Mandela card,
citing the ``international respect of an almost unprecedented
level'' accorded the freedom-fighting president.
	   Moreover, Europe has had the cup nine times, Latin America five
and the United States once. Africa? Never.
	   England and Germany are in the race for 2006, with other bids
expected from South America.
	   FIFA president Joseph S. Blatter is on record supporting South
Africa's bid _ provided its facilities are up to par.
	   ``There's this sense in world football that Africa deserves to
stage the World Cup one day,'' said Keir Radnedge, executive editor
of London-based World Soccer magazine. ``That's not necessarily
based on any logistical or financial common sense. It's more based
on sentiment.''
	   The bid committee cites the country's relatively good
telecommunications, road network, sophisticated tourist industry
and good weather.
	   And as South Africa travels further away from the international
isolation brought by apartheid, the outside world is arriving.
South Africa hosted the 1995 rugby World Cup, 1996 Africa Cup of
Nations and 1998 athletics World Cup.
	   It lost out on the 2004 Olympics to Athens. But Jordaan said the
country's sports establishment decided to focus on the World Cup
instead of another Olympic bid because it would benefit eight
cities instead of one, and because many of the Olympic sports have
no following here.
	   But despite the sentimental arguments, critics say the problems
may be too great for South Africa to hold the biggest, richest and
most watched sports event on the globe.
	   South Africa's cities are among the most dangerous in the world.
When the West Indies cricket team balked at coming in a pay dispute
this month (November), one of their demands was increased security.
	   On the plus side, ``You don't see (crime) in the stadiums,''
said Molefi Mika, sports editor of The Sowetan newspaper. ``You
wouldn't compare what we have seen in competition in Europe.''
	   Despite the lack of European-style hooliganism, South African
soccer is not immune to the occasional attack on a referee or riot
outside the turnstyles.
	   Public transport is so bad that in many cities most commuters
use private minibus taxis, the terror of car drivers and an
industry riddled with factional violence.
	   Stadium security is another issue. Under apartheid, the police
ignored soccer _ the main sport followed by blacks. So security at
stadiums is handled by private groups, which lack the expertise and
authority of the riot police who inhabit European stadiums.
	   The best stadiums in South Africa are owned by rugby, a
complication, but not insurmountable obstacle, to the World Cup
bid. Soccer officials in England, South Africa's rival for 2006
along with Germany, have chafed at Jordaan's comments that European
stadiums are relics of the 1950s and '60s.
	   Jordaan acknowledges that transportation is a major problem, but
is counting on independent government plans to upgrade the bus and
rail system. The bid committee itself has a 60 million rand (dlrs
10.5 million) budget, all from corporate donors.
	   As for crime, ``eight years from now it will be something that
belongs to our past,'' Jordaan said. The problem is, FIFA makes its
choice in March of 2000. Formal applications are due by the end of
the year.
	   Jordaan sees hope in the composition of FIFA's board _ four
members from Africa and four from Asia, compared to Europe's eight.
The rest come from the Americas and one from Oceania.
	   Germany and England could split the European votes, allowing
South Africa in the back door, though Radnedge says South Africa
shouldn't take the Africa votes for granted.

Bus carrying American tourists attacked in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A bus carrying American tourists had its
windows shattered when a group of assailants shouting anti-American
slogans attacked it with stones and iron rods, the Iran News
reported Monday.
	   The attack is believed to have been triggered by reports in
hardline newspapers accusing the visiting American group of being
U.S. officials and members of the Central Intelligence Agency
posing as tourists.
	   The attack happened Saturday morning as the group arrived in
front of the Esteglal Hotel in northern Tehran where they were
staying, the paper said.
	   The bus was stopped by a group of men who broke all of the
buses' windows before the bus driver sped off to another hotel and
called the police, the paper said.
	   The group of 13 people then received a police escort to their
hotel, said the Iran News. Other accounts said some of the
Americans suffered minor injuries and cuts from flying glass.
	   A radical Muslim group claiming responsibility for the attack
had a slightly different account, saying its members threw stones
at the tourists and injured some as they got off the bus to enter
the hotel, the al-Hayat newspaper reported.
	   The London-based Arabic daily said its office in Tehran received
an anonymous phone call from someone speaking on behalf of the
Fedayeen Islam, or ``Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam,'' claiming
it carried out the attack.
	   ``This is a lesson and a warning to those spies,'' the paper
quoted the caller as saying.
	   A statement from the Fedayeen Islam also claiming responsibility
was made available in Tehran on Monday.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' it said, apparently referring to
President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural exchanges between
Americans and Iranians.
	   Groups of American tourists have been trickling back to Iran
since Khatami, who took office last year, urged informal contacts
between the two countries.
	   The Fedayeen Islam was active before the 1979 Islamic
revolution. It had not been heard of in years until earlier in
November when it threatened to kill any former American hostages
from during the revolution's time who returned to Iran.
	   The students who stormed the embassy in 1979 had invited the 52
hostages to return on the anniversary of the seizure this year.
Most of those who held the embassy are now considered moderates who
support Khatami and his urging of an open society.
	   But a new breed of hard-liners clustered around Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is opposed to any compromise with
the United States.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with new information throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital with
pneumonia and a high temperature, officials said Monday, in the
third health crisis for the Russian president in recent weeks.
	   The 67-year-old president has rarely been seen in public
recently, raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics, but officials
declined to give any details.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin met Monday in the hospital with visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, the Kremlin said. The Chinese delegation in a convoy
of cars was seen entering and leaving the grounds of the hospital.
	   A Kremlin spokesman, who declined to be named, said after the
meeting that Yeltsin was ``working,'' but gave no further details.
	   A briefing by Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin on the
president's health, which was announced Monday morning for later in
the day, was later canceled without explanation.
	   Yeltsin was taken ill in October during a state visit to central
Asia with what was described as a respiratory ailment. He was taken
ill again in late October with what doctors described as high blood
pressure and exhaustion.
	   If Yeltsin is incapacitated, power could be turned over
temporarily to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a top Kremlin aide
was quoted as saying by the Interfax News Service. The premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin briefly assumed presidential powers in 1996
when Yeltsin underwent heart surgery.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff, according to the report.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, a prime minister takes over for
three months if the president dies or can't fulfill his duties due
to serious illness.
	   Savyolova added, however, that her remarks were unrelated to the
president's latest illness.
	   Primakov said on Monday the government was working as normal and
he was not assuming any extra powers, Interfax said.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed on a statement on border demarcation
and discussed bilateral cooperation and international issues, the
Kremlin said.
	   The main outcome of the meeting was the ``similarity of
approaches on virtually all international issues and identity of

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher
Monday, with the key index in Jakarta surging more than 5 percent
despite ethnic violence in Indonesia.
	   Japan's stock exchange and other financial markets were closed
Monday for the Labor Thanksgiving Day national holiday.
	   Indonesian shares closed at a 15-week high as foreign funds
continued to flood the market, dealers said. The Jakarta Stock
Exchange's Composite Index rose 21.335 points, or 5.3 percent,
closing at 424.987.
	   Dealers said that for investors willing to invest in Indonesia,
social and political unrest were expected, and therefore didn't
curb the buying sentiment.
	   Many Christian schools were closed in the country Monday after
riots Sunday in which mobs of Muslim youths set fire to churches
and attacked Christians. At least 13 people were killed in the
violence.
	   Thai stock prices surged Monday in a spillover of foreign buying
in bank and finance stocks from last week, dealers said.
	   The Stock Exchange of Thailand index gained 18.50 points, or 4.9
percent, to 390.43.
	   Philippine shares also closed sharply higher, boosted by Wall
Street's gains on Friday, a strong peso and persistent speculation
over negotiations for control of Philippine Long Distance Telephone
Co.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose
80.57 points, or 4.4 percent, to 1,922.26, its highest close in six
months.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar averaged 39.551 pesos, down
from Friday's close of 39.567 pesos.
	   Share prices in Hong Kong were boosted by cuts in local interest
rates. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 281.17 points, or 2.7
percent, closing at 10,514.53.
	   Brokers said shares rose in reaction to Friday's cut in local
interest rates, the second cut in just over a month. Hong Kong
banks also slashed their prime lending rates to 9.5 percent from
9.75 percent.
	   Malaysian shares closed sharply higher in line with gains on
other regional bourses, dealers said. The Composite Index rose
15.61 points, or 3.4 percent, to 477.17.
	   Elsewhere:
	   SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mostly higher. The Straits Times
Index rose 29.04 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,376.94.
	   TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 53.85 points, or 0.73 percent,
to 7,312.26.
	   WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher, boosted by
solid gains by overseas financial markets, brokers said. The
NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 10.33 points, or 0.5 percent, to
1,986.56.
	   SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed sharply higher, driven by
a surging banking sector. The All Ordinaries Index closed at
2,747.6, up 44.0 points, or 1.6 percent.
	   SEOUL: Share prices closed mixed. The Korea Composite Stock
Price Index fell 3.45 points, or 0.7 percent, to 453.95.

Smuggled Sri Lankans rescued from sinking ship bound for Australia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Naval gunboats rescued 58 Sri Lankans
this weekend from a trawler sinking in the Indian Ocean on its way
to smuggle them into Australia, officials said Monday.
	   After a 30-day ordeal on the cramped vessel, the passengers were
rescued Saturday just hours before the ship slipped under the water
on Saturday 260 miles (420 kilometers) south of Sri Lanka, said
Rear Admiral Haren Amaraweera, a naval spokesman.
	   Passengers told Sri Lankan police that they paid a man in
Marawila, 30 miles (50 kilometers) north of the capital, Colombo,
to organize the 2,500-mile trip. Many sold or mortgaged their homes
to raise the dlrs 7,500 fee. The average Sri Lankan earns dlrs 820
a year.
	   They left during the night of Oct. 22 on board the trawler
``Fathima,'' said Amaraweera. After sailing 1,500 (2,400
kilometers) miles in 12 days, choppy seas forced them to turn back.
	   ``There were no facilities for carrying passengers. They were
just crammed into the hold in inhuman conditions,'' said
Amaraweera.
	   Worse was in store. Halfway back, the ship's freshwater tank was
dislodged by waves and fell into the sea, causing a shortage of
drinking water. On Friday, the engine caught fire and although the
flames were doused, the boat began sinking.
	   The trawler's radio distress signal was picked up by a nearby
merchant ship and relayed to the southern Sri Lankan port of Galle.
Gunboats rushed to the scene, together with trawlers in the area.
	   Naval officials arrested the five-man Sri Lankan crew and handed
them over to police.
	   The passengers may be charged with illegally leaving the
country, punishable by a dlrs 75 fine or three months in jail. They
were being questioned by police, who are hunting for the mastermind
of the smuggling operation.
	   This is the largest group of Sri Lankans caught trying to sneak
into Australia, a popular destination for illegal migrants in
search of work.
	   Several smaller groups of Sri Lankans were arrested and sent
home by Australian police in the last six months after landing in
small boats.
	   One group successfully made the crossing, only to wander for
days in the outback after landing on a wild stretch of coast. Other
groups were shipwrecked near Indonesia.
	   Some have been caught trying to get to Japan and South Korea by
ship, or hiding in trucks going to western Europe, mostly to Italy,
Germany, France and Switzerland, from Russia and the Balkans. Many
have died in these attempts, some being shipwrecked, others
freezing or suffocating while crammed in trucks.
	   Hundreds have simply disappeared, and their families believe
they may have been killed by ships' crews and their bodies dumped
in the sea.

	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - A coal miner died in hospital after being
seriously injured in an accident at a mine in eastern Ukraine,
officials said Monday.
	   The unidentified worker from the Krasnopolivska mine in the
Luhansk region died Sunday after he was badly injured by falling
rocks at an underground shaft on Saturday, the Emergency Situations
Ministry said.
	   About 335 Ukrainian miners have been killed on the job so far
this year, up from 290 for all of last year, according to
government statistics.
	   The death toll in coal mine accidents in Ukraine has been rising
for years as the cash-strapped government has been unable to
modernize deteriorating mines and improve safety conditions.

Suharto's son interrogated by Indonesia's attorney general
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A son of former President Suharto was
interrogated by the attorney general's office over corruption
allegations Monday while troops blocked student protesters from
marching on his father's house.
	   Additionally, senior officials of the ruling Golkar Party have
called for Suharto to be put under house arrest while a new
investigation into his wealth is conducted.
	   On Monday, Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra was questioned as part
of an investigation against Beddu Amang, a former chief of a
state-run food distribution organization, the newspaper Suara
Pembaruan reported.
	   It quoted Anton Sujata, a government lawyer, as saying that
Tommy earlier had been banned from leaving the country.
	   Tommy made no comment.
	   Two other Suharto sons, Bambang and Sigit, also have been
questioned over a series of recent bank collapses.
	   About 30 protesters marched through an exclusive suburb Monday,
demanding that Suharto be put on trial for corruption and human
rights abuses during his 32-year authoritarian rule.
	   The protest was much smaller than other demonstrations in recent
days.
	   Suharto, 77, was forced to quit the presidency in May after a
wave of protests and riots, in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Opponents allege he amassed a fortune and used his power to
enrich his six children and a clique of cronies.
	   Suharto has said he is innocent.
	   On the weekend, Suharto's successor and former protege,
President B.J. Habibie, announced a new inquiry into Suharto's
wealth.
	   Opposition groups denounced an earlier probe by the attorney
general as a whitewash after it failed to identify any wrongdoing
by the ex-head of state.
	   Akbar Tanjung, Habibie's state secretary, who is also Golkar
Party chairman, has reportedly backed calls for Suharto to be
placed under house arrest.
	   The Indonesian Observer said Suharto should also be banned from
overseas travel.

U.N. envoy returns to Baghdad amid clash on arms documents

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan returned to Baghdad on Monday as Iraq unleashed a new
volley of criticism at the chief U.N. weapons inspector's demands
for arms-related documents.
	   The papers sought by Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, are spurring a new confrontation between the
government of Saddam Hussein and Butler's UNSCOM which oversees
destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
	   On Sunday, two leading Iraq officials derided Butler's request
as a move to justify a U.S. military strike on Iraq, saying the
government already had turned over all documents relevant to the
arms inspectors' work.
	   Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, flew in from the gulf state
of Bahrain. He refused to comment about the latest controversy on
arrival, saying only that he expected to meet with Iraqi officials.
	   Monday's state-run Iraqi newspapers said a personal grudge
against Iraq was behind Butler's new demand for documents.
	   ``Butler has personal motives to create a new crisis,'' the
daily Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in a
front-page editorial signed by editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi.
	   ``He (Butler) has explained Iraq's decision to let the
inspectors resume their activities .... as a personal victory which
he believes will enable him to take revenge on Iraq,'' the paper
said.
	   Iraq had asked for Butler's dismissal from UNSCOM as one of its
demands for allowing U.N. weapons inspectors to return to work in
the country.
	   But it reversed its ban on the inspectors' work Nov. 14 when
faced with a likely air strikes by U.S. and British forces in the
Gulf.
	   The arms inspectors returned last week and have been making
visits to potential weapons-making sites daily, with the
cooperation of the Iraq government.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq
insists it has already gotten rid of all proscribed weaponry.
	   Butler's weekend demand for new documents again raises the
prospect of possible American military strikes against Iraq since
U.S. President Bill Clinton had demanded full cooperation with the
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   In Korea, where Clinton was visiting, a spokesman for the
National Security Council referred to Iraq's refusal to hand over
documents as an ``insufficient'' response, but said no final
conclusion had been made about the Iraqi move.
	   The spokesman, David Leavy, raised the prospect of an attack,
saying: ``If we conclude Iraq does not intend to live up to its
commitments and UNSCOM can't do its job, we remain prepared'' to
carry out air strikes Clinton canceled last week.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Sunday said Butler's demands
were either intended to provoke an attack or to put off a promised
Security Council review of Iraq's cooperation in arms destruction
that the government hopes will lead to easing the sanctions.
	   He said, 16th graf pvs

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with quotes from Communist leader in new grafs 18-19 &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital with
pneumonia and a high temperature, officials said Monday, in the
third health crisis for the Russian president in recent weeks.
	   The 67-year-old president has rarely been seen in public
recently, raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics, but officials
declined to give any details.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin met Monday in the hospital with visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin, the Kremlin said. The Chinese delegation in a convoy
of cars was seen entering and leaving the grounds of the hospital.
	   A Kremlin spokesman, who declined to be named, said after the
meeting that Yeltsin was ``working,'' but gave no further details.
	   A briefing by Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin on the
president's health, which was announced Monday morning for later in
the day, was later canceled without explanation.
	   Yeltsin was taken ill in October during a state visit to central
Asia with what was described as a respiratory ailment. He was taken
ill again in late October with what doctors described as high blood
pressure and exhaustion.
	   If Yeltsin is incapacitated, power could be turned over
temporarily to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a top Kremlin aide
was quoted as saying by the Interfax News Service. The premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin briefly assumed presidential powers in 1996
when Yeltsin underwent heart surgery.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff, according to the report.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, a prime minister takes over for
three months if the president dies or can't fulfill his duties due
to serious illness.
	   Savyolova added, however, that her remarks were unrelated to the
president's latest illness.
	   Primakov said on Monday the government was working as normal and
he was not assuming any extra powers, Interfax said.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed on a statement on border demarcation
and discussed bilateral cooperation and international issues, the
Kremlin said.
	   The main outcome of the meeting was the ``similarity of
approaches on virtually all international issues and identity of
positions concerning the prospects of building up close, confident
relations between Russia and China, aimed at strategic interaction
in the 21st century,'' Yeltsin's foreign affairs aide Sergei
Prikhodko said, according to the Interfax.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   ``We wish Mr. Yeltsin recovery,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said in unusually mild remarks at a news conference
Monday. ``But his illness is incurable _ he's an irresponsible
person who is unable to govern the country, and everyone knows
that.''
	   Zyuganov said that in his opinion early elections are
inevitable.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.
	   Yeltsin's wife, Naina, said recently that the president is
struggling with the very cold weather that has hit Moscow in recent
weeks, but that he was capable of handling his duties.

Trains running on schedule in Spain despite European strike call
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Commuter and long-distance train services
were reduced in Spain Monday by the European railway strike, but
the state railway company said there had been little noticeable
effect on morning trains.
	   Trains were running on schedule, the RENFE railway company said.
	   The company said it cut in half the number of trains running on
the long-distance routes and three out of four commuter trains were
in service during morning and evening rush hours.
	   No incidents were reported.
	   Unions, fearing job losses resulting from plans to further
privatize European railways, had called for strikes in Spain,
France, Belgium, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg.

Settlers seize hilltop in land-grab campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers seized a West Bank hilltop on
Monday as part of their campaign to gain control over more land
ahead of the next Israeli troop pullback.
	   In Monday's takeover, settlers of the Elon Moreh settlement
drove a bus to a hill east of the community. The bus was used as a
mobile home, with a generator providing electricity, said Peter
Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West
Bank.
	   The government considers the settler outpost illegal because it
is outside the boundaries of Elon Moreh, Lerner said. It was not
clear whether Israeli troops would order settlers to leave.
	   Since the Oct. 23 signing of the Wye River peace agreement in
Washington, settler groups have seized nearly a dozen hills to
prevent the land from falling into Palestinian hands.
	   Under the peace accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Earlier this month, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
encouraged the settlers, saying they ``should move, should run,
should grab more hills, expand the territory.''

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore legislators mostly endorsed painful
wage cuts at the heart of a multibillion-dollar business
cost-cutting package, but some urged the government Monday to share
the burden by trimming taxes and other charges.
	   To boost Singapore's flagging competitiveness and lift the
city-state out of its first economic downturn in 13 years, a
government-linked panel recently recommended a 10 billion Singapore
dollar (dlrs 6 billion) package reducing corporate costs by about
15 percent annually.
	   Equaling roughly 7 percent of Singapore's entire gross domestic
product, the measures focus on slashing labor costs, primarily
through a proposed 5 to 8 percent wage cut and a 50 percent
reduction in employers' contributions to workers' mandatory,
state-run pension fund.
	   Wage-related cuts constitute 70 to 80 percent of the entire
package, and many Singaporeans _ from blue collar workers to
business and community leaders _ have questioned why workers should
have to bear most of the burden.
	   Members of Parliament debated the recommendations Monday, though
the 84-seat legislature _ with only three opposition members _ is
widely expected to adopt most or all of the suggestions before the
current session ends Tuesday.
	   Minister of Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan urged Parliament to
fully endorse the package, arguing that the government took the
same approach to directly reduce business costs during Singapore's
last recession ``with great effectiveness.''
	   Lee said the measures ``will require a united response from all
Singaporeans to accept the painful cuts.''
	   Most legislators endorsed the main thrust of the package.
	   ``We must also adjust our own living standards,'' said ruling
party member Bernard Chen. ``We have been used to years of high
growth and high wage increases, so much so that we don't know what
bad times are.
	   ``I think we've got to have some pain,'' he added. ``I think
without pain, there can be no incentive to improve.''
	   But some legislators urged the government to dip into its some
120 billion Singapore dollars (dlrs 74 billion) in reserves to help
the economy.
	   ``I urge the government to be bold and draw upon reserves now,''
said legislator and business leader Leong Horn Kee.
	   He said ``public expectation is that the government could
match'' the wage cuts, and suggested bigger rebates on personal
income taxes and reduced levies on hiring foreign workers. Leong
also warned that wage cuts may cause deflation rather than
expansion in this city-state of 3 million people.
	   Opposition leader Chiam See Tong urged the government to move
slowly on the recommendations. If employers' pension contributions
are cut by 50 percent, he said, there should be a matching cut in
workers' payments to the fund.
	   Singapore's leaders also could set an example by accepting a
large salary cut, he said.
	   ``Singapore ministers are reputed to be the highest paid in the
world, so a 25 percent cut in the ministers' salaries shall still
leave them with a lot to live on comfortably,'' he added.
	   He also urged the government to suspend the goods and services
tax until the economic slump is over, and questioned whether the
panel's long-term goal of encouraging risk-taking and
entrepreneurship would ever work in tightly controlled, monolithic
Singapore.

Philippine Airlines, Cathay Pacific discuss retrenchment of PAL
</HEADLINE>
workers &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Prospective investor Cathay Pacific
Airways wants the number of employees at troubled Philippine
Airlines to be slashed from more than 8,000 to 5,000 but PAL has
not yet agreed, Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said Monday.
	   PAL officials have accepted an investment offer from the Hong
Kong-based carrier and the two companies are drawing up a
comprehensive plan to rehabilitate PAL.
	   PAL's chairman and chief stockholder, Lucio Tan, wants to retain
about 8,000 employees to avoid antagonizing the airline's labor
unions, Espiritu said.
	   ``That is the point of disagreement now because Cathay wants a
larger retrenchment,'' Espiritu told reporters.
	   Cathay Pacific officials were not immediately available for
comment.
	   Espiritu said Cathay Pacific may invest as much as dlrs 100
million in PAL but other foreign investors, including the
International Finance Corp., the World Bank's investment arm, are
interested in investing part of that amount.
	   PAL closed for nearly two weeks on Sept. 23 after failing to
persuade its largest union to accept a management-proposed recovery
plan under which its collective bargaining agreement would be
suspended for 10 years in exchange for a 20 percent share of the
company's stock.
	   The union later decided to accept the plan, allowing PAL to
resume domestic flights on Oct. 7 and international flights later.
As part of the plan, the union agreed to allow an unspecified
number of workers to be retrenched as long as the laid-off workers
get separation benefits agreed by both sides.
	   In June, PAL was embroiled in a crippling three-week pilots'
strike that brought the company close to financial ruin. At the
height of the strike, PAL laid off 5,000 of its 13,000 workers to
minimize its losses.
	   PAL says it is unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion of
debt due to mounting losses worsened by its labor problems and
Asia's currency crisis.

Iraqi opposition groups to meet with British officials

post-Saddam Iraq must not break up; ADDS background; EDITS and

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain, the host of a meeting of 16
often-competing Iraqi opposition groups, said Monday that it is
vital for Iraq to remain a united country if the reign of President
Saddam Hussein ends.
	   ``We have got to get across to people that Iraq could be
different, that Saddam Hussein is not permanent, is not the only
voice for Iraq,'' Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said in a
British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview before the meeting.
	   British officials label the meeting the first of a series,
reflecting the greater frankness by the United States and Britain
that a prime aim in ending the stalemate over U.N. weapons
inspections is to topple Saddam.
	   The United States announced last week that it had held talks
with Ahmed Chalabi, head of the the Iraqi National Congress, a
London-based opposition group. The U.S. Congress also has approved
a dlrs 97 million aid package to offer support to Iraqi dissidents.
	   British officials said they would focus on finding common ground
among the opposition groups.
	   ``If and when there is a change of regime in Iraq, it will be
extremely useful to have the opposition groups working together so
Baghdad does not fall into chaos and anarchy,'' Fatchett said.
	   London is a main center for Iraqi exile and opposition groups.
	   At various times, the dissidents have succeeded in bringing
together Shiite Muslim groups, former ruling party officials and
Kurdish guerrillas who sought autonomy in northern Iraq.
	   Opposition groups say they are a key source of information about
Saddam and critical to any rebellion.
	   One London-based group, The Iraqi National Accord, said this
week that it has provided British authorities with a detailed list
of Saddam's international spy network.
	   The document, compiled by Saddam's private secretary, named all
the members of Iraqi intelligence service who pose as diplomats and
was released to the West even before it was on Saddam's desk, the
group said in a report in London's Sunday Telegraph.
	   ``Information like this is priceless in the battle to end
Saddam's tyranny,'' Ayad Alawi, who heads the group, told the
newspaper. ``It shows that often we know more about what is going
on inside Iraq than Saddam. And the more we know, the more damage
we can do to him.''
	   Alawi said Western support is vital.
	   ``There is no point in the West urging Iraqis to overthrow
Saddam if it is not prepared to help,'' he said. ``The first step
toward getting rid of Saddam is to persuade the Iraqi people that
they have friends and supporters outside who can help them
succeed.''

Death toll from Polish cold up to 32
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave that hit Poland a week
ago has killed 32 people, police said Monday.
	   Most of the victims were middle-aged men who had been drinking
alcohol and passed out in the cold, according to Grazyna Puchalska
of the national police headquarters. Other victims included
homeless people, according to police.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
	   The lowest temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15
Fahrenheit) early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES 4th and 5th grafs with Kremlin releasing pictures of
Yeltsin meeting Chinese leader, Yeltsin's appearance &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital with
pneumonia and a high temperature, officials said Monday, in the
third health crisis for the Russian president in recent weeks.
	   The 67-year-old president has rarely been seen in public
recently, raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics, but officials
declined to give any details.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin met Monday in the hospital with visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.
	   Pictures released by the Kremlin showed the two leaders sharing
a joke as they sat in chairs in a reception room, surrounded by
aides. Yeltsin, casually dressed in a sweater, did not look
particularly ill.
	   A Kremlin spokesman, who declined to be named, said after the
meeting that Yeltsin was ``working,'' but gave no further details.
	   A briefing by Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin on the
president's health, which was announced Monday morning for later in
the day, was later canceled without explanation.
	   Yeltsin was taken ill in October during a state visit to central
Asia with what was described as a respiratory ailment. He was taken
ill again in late October with what doctors described as high blood
pressure and exhaustion.
	   If Yeltsin is incapacitated, power could be turned over
temporarily to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a top Kremlin aide
was quoted as saying by the Interfax News Service. The premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin briefly assumed presidential powers in 1996
when Yeltsin underwent heart surgery.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff, according to the report.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, a prime minister takes over for
three months if the president dies or can't fulfill his duties due
to serious illness.
	   Savyolova added, however, that her remarks were unrelated to the
president's latest illness.
	   Primakov said on Monday the government was working as normal and
he was not assuming any extra powers, Interfax said.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed on a statement on border demarcation
and discussed bilateral cooperation and international issues, the
Kremlin said.
	   The main outcome of the meeting was the ``similarity of
approaches on virtually all international issues and identity of
positions concerning the prospects of building up close, confident
relations between Russia and China, aimed at strategic interaction
in the 21st century,'' Yeltsin's foreign affairs aide Sergei
Prikhodko said, according to the Interfax.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   ``We wish Mr. Yeltsin recovery,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said in unusually mild remarks at a news conference
Monday. ``But his illness is incurable _ he's an irresponsible
person who is unable to govern the country, and everyone knows
that.''
	   Zyuganov said that in his opinion early elections are
inevitable.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.
	   Yeltsin's wife, Naina, said recently that the president is
struggling with the very cold weather that has hit Moscow in recent
weeks, but that he was capable of handling his duties.

Trial of jailed Malaysian politician Anwar resumes

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details from two more witnesses &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The politically charged corruption
trial of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim resumed Monday
amid a national outcry against foreigners accused of supporting
him.
	   The Malaysian government had recessed Anwar's trial so it would
not interfere with last week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
summit of 21 Pacific Rim leaders.
	   The weeklong pause, however, only intensified the global
spotlight focused on the Southeast Asian country and the
government's treatment of the former No. 2 leader.
	   U.S. Vice President Al Gore, sitting in for President Bill
Clinton at the APEC summit, expressed support for Anwar's
anti-government reform movement.
	   Gore's words _ in which he praised ``the brave people of
Malaysia'' for their reform movement _ only served to enrage the
government and spark a nationwide outpouring of support for Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar was arrested Sept. 20, two weeks after his firing by
Mahathir sparked massive anti-government protests. The current
trial involves four counts of corruption. Anwar will be tried on
another corruption count, as well as five counts of sexual
misconduct, at a later date.
	   The 51-year-old sacked deputy denies the charges, calling them
part of a political vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor,
Mahathir.
	   On Monday, the defense finished cross-examining the seventh
witness, Mazlan Mohamad Din. The assistant commissioner of police
testified that he was instructed to force two key witnesses to
retract allegations of sexual misconduct against Anwar.
	   An eighth witness, a police clerk, later told the court that she
helped to type a retraction letter written by one of the witnesses.
	   After recess, Zulkifli Mohamad, one of the police officers who
arrested the two people, said they resisted arrest for more than
four hours before police finally broke down the door to the house
they were hiding in.
	   The hearing resumes Tuesday with testimony from the
prosecution's 10th witness.
	   There appeared to be an effort Monday to keep Anwar at a greater
distance from the public. His dock was pushed closer to his
lawyers, making it more difficult for him to communicate with his
family and the media.
	   Riot police once again surrounded the red-brick courthouse in
downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   On Saturday night, police arrested at least four Anwar
supporters, including opposition leader Tian Chua, a human rights
activist who heads an opposition coalition founded after Anwar's
arrest.
	   Anwar's case sparked international outrage when he appeared in
court with a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was
blindfolded by police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   During the APEC summit, top-ranking officials from Australia,
Canada and the United States, as well as Philippine President
Joseph Estrada, angered the government by meeting privately with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, to express concern over her husband's
case.
	   The government has accused Gore of meddling in its domestic
affairs by expressing support for the political reform movement
started by Anwar.
	   U.S. Ambassador John Malott was summoned to the Foreign Ministry
on Monday.
	   ``We reiterated Malaysia's position that Gore's speech was an
incitement of lawlessness and not simply a call of democracy as
claimed,'' John Tenewi Nuek, undersecretary for the Americas, told
the national news agency Bernama.
	   Gore's remarks have triggered a nationalistic fervor. A hot line
was hooked up over the weekend for callers to register anti-U.S.
sentiments.
	   An effigy of Gore was burned at a gathering of several hundred
people carrying anti-American placards in the northern state of
Perlis on Sunday.
	   Radio blurbs urge people to pick up their free Malaysian
mini-flags at Malay-owned companies. Many cars and taxis have
placed the flags on their hoods.
	   Mahathir appeared buoyed by the show of support.
	   ``They voiced their stand because they were disappointed and
humiliated by (Gore's) disrespectful remarks,'' Mahathir told
reporters Sunday. ``I'm impressed by their stand as this is the
real strength of the country.''

Cathay Pacific Airbus dives after losing cabin pressure
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cathay Pacific confirming cabin
pressure dropped but disputing report that oxygen failed; CORRECTS
flight number to CX108, sted 100 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A Cathay Pacific Airways jet carrying 232
passengers made an emergency dive of 23,000 feet (6,970 meters)
after losing cabin pressure during a flight from New Zealand to
Hong Kong, the airline said Monday.
	   Flight CX108 from Auckland was diverted Saturday to Sydney,
Australia, after about three hours in the air. The passengers _ all
of them unhurt _ made it to Hong Kong a day late aboard another
flight, Cathay Pacific spokeswoman Katherine Wang said.
	   The Airbus A-340-300 jet was cruising at 33,000 feet (10,000
meters) when the cabin pressure plunged, so the captain dived to
bring the airplane to a safe level of around 10,000 feet (3,000
meters) within two to three minutes, Wang said.
	   Cathay Pacific took issue with a report in the South China
Morning Post that the plane also had lost oxygen. The newspaper
quoted passenger Tony Allen as saying that air masks had dropped in
the cabin but ``most of them had no oxygen.''
	   Cathay Pacific said the masks were working, but many passengers
apparently had expected they would inflate on their own. The masks
have to be pulled by passengers before oxygen starts flowing, as
flight crews announce at the start of journeys on virtually all
airlines, Wang said.
	   ``Sometimes people fly on an airplane and they never bother to
watch the safety videos,'' Wang said. ``I don't know if the oxygen
masks were needed but the captain deployed them just the same.''
	   The problem was caused by the failure of an air valve in the
pressurization system, Wang said.

Israeli settlers seize hilltop in land-grab campaign
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Jewish settlers seized a West Bank hilltop on
Monday as part of their campaign to gain control over more land
ahead of the next Israeli troop pullback.
	   In Monday's takeover, settlers of the Elon Moreh settlement
drove a bus to a hill east of the community. The bus was used as a
mobile home, with a generator providing electricity, said Peter
Lerner, spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West
Bank.
	   The government considers the settler outpost illegal because it
is outside the boundaries of Elon Moreh, Lerner said. It was not
clear whether Israeli troops would order settlers to leave.
	   Since the Oct. 23 signing of the Wye River peace agreement in
Washington, settler groups have seized nearly a dozen hills to
prevent the land from falling into Palestinian hands.
	   Under the peace accord, Israel is to withdraw from 13 percent of
the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian
campaign against Islamic militants.
	   Earlier this month, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
encouraged the settlers, saying they ``should move, should run,
should grab more hills, expand the territory.''

Sharon, Sharansky discuss trade and development with Jordan

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Israel's foreign minister and trade
minister held talks with Crown Prince Hassan and other officials
Monday aimed at bolstering economic ties with Jordan.
	   The meetings by Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Trade Minister
Natan Sharansky follow talks in Jerusalem last week by Jordan, the
Palestinians and Israel during U.S. Commerce Secretary William
Daley's visit to encourage regional economic cooperation.
	   Government officials, who spoke under customary condition of
anonymity, said the Middle East peace process would be discussed
during the Israelis' meetings, along with Jordan's long-standing
complaints about Israeli obstacles to trade.
	   Jordanian has repeatedly accused Israel of imposing
unnecessarily stringent security measures that hinder the flow of
goods between Jordan and the West Bank, as well as export of
Jordanian goods into the Israeli market.
	   Jordan's trade volume with the Palestinian territories for 1997
stood at 35 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 49 million), of which
only 12.1 million dinars (dlrs 17 million) were Jordanian exports.
Israel exports dlrs 2.5 billion annually to Palestinians.
	   Sharon and Sharansky arrived by helicopter and were expected to
return to Israel later Monday.

Aide to slain lawmaker regains consciousness, talks to police
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALICE LAGNADO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST.PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A badly wounded aide to a murdered
lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police,
who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city,
officials said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, 52, a leader of the liberal Russia's
Democratic Choice party, was shot dead by unidentified assailants
on the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday
night.
	   The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar
in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the
country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leaders and
others have been gunned down in recent years in contract killings
that are almost never solved.
	   The lawmaker's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a
``clear'' mind Monday, testifying to investigators, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. Special police armed with assault rifles were
standing guard at the door of his hospital room.
	   Acting on information from the aide, police carried out raids
and rounded up several suspects, officials said. There were no
further details.
	   Linkov was critically wounded in the head during the attack and
later rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery during the
weekend.
	   Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ that
Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, were the most likely culprits.
	   Over the weekend, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to
call a news conference to say there was no evidence that the
Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in
the killing.
	   Seleznyov responded in kind on Monday, suggesting that the
``extremists from democratic organizations'' might have staged the
murder in order to win local elections set for Dec. 6, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The speaker also threatened to file a libel suit against a St.
Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova edited. The newspaper
recently accused Seleznyov of setting up an illegal fund to finance
a presidential bid and other shady activities.
	   Seleznyov, who has said he might run for president in 2000,
denied the newspaper's allegations on Friday, calling them an
``outright slander.''
	   Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract murder,
an increasingly common crime in Russia.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's
killing as an occasion to lambast the government for its inability
to contain soaring crime. ``That's a result of the (government's)
catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction of the state and the
nation,'' he said.
	   Starovoitova, of the reformist party Democratic Russia, tried to
run for president in 1996 but her registration was turned down for
technical reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in
1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle _ and later joined
the Russian parliament as one of the most vocal defenders of
liberal reforms.
	   Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' and said he would
personally monitor the investigation into her killing.
	   Starovoitova remarried earlier this year and had one son and a
grandson.
	   She is scheduled to be buried on Tuesday at the Nikolskoye
cemetery in St. Petersburg.

Steinbrenner may sell part of Yankees

 &UR; Eds: UPDATE Daily News report to dlrs 525 million sted dlrs 550

 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Baseball's most storied team is on the auction
block.
	   Owner George Steinbrenner is talking with Cablevision Systems
Corp. about selling a major share of the New York Yankees. He would
retain control of the World Series champions in any deal, a source
familiar with the negotiations said Sunday night on the condition
of anonymity.
	   A sale would involve only Steinbrenner's limited partner shares.
He would retain his shares as managing general partner, and thus
keep control of team operations. He owns 59 percent of the Yankees.
	   NBC Sports reported a deal was agreed to last week and said it
called for Steinbrenner to turn over full ownership of the team to
Cablevision for dlrs 600 million. The Daily News Monday said the
deal it called for Cablevision to buy 70 percent of the team for
dlrs 525 million.
	   Steinbrenner denied that any deal had been struck, but said in
Monday's New York Times: ``If it is done, the Steinbrenners will be
in control.''
	   Cablevision president James Dolan declined to comment.
	   A deal that values that Yankees at dlrs 550 million to dlrs 600
million would make it the most expensive North American sports
franchise and the second-most expensive in the world. Rupert
Murdoch is negotiating to take over the English soccer team
Manchester United for about dlrs 1 billion.
	   Steinbrenner, 68, led a group that paid dlrs 10 million to
purchase the Yankees from CBS in 1973. He has seen the value of the
team increase, particularly with its 23rd and 24th World Series
championships in the last three years and a record 125 victories
last season.
	   Cablevision also controls the National Basketball Association's
New York Knicks and the National Hockey League's New York Rangers.
Steinbrenner wouldn't address rumors that Dolan would give him
operating control of those franchises, too.

Philippine stocks close at six-month high; index up 4.4 percent
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with peso closing slightly higher &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The main index on the Philippine
Stock Exchange rose sharply Monday to a six-month high, boosted by
gains on Wall Street, a strong peso and persistent speculation over
negotiations for control of the country's leading
telecommunications company, traders said.
	   Slack demand for dollars lifted the peso slightly. The dollar
averaged 39.551 pesos for the day, down from 39.567 pesos Friday.
It reached a session-low of 39.470 pesos.
	   The 30-share Philippine Stock Exchange Index climbed 80.57
points, or 4.4 percent, to 1,922.26 after advancing 22.68 points
Friday.
	   Monday's surge placed the index 2.8 percent higher than its
end-1997 close of 1,869.23, and above 1,900 mark for the first time
since June 10, when it closed at 1,917.89.
	   The broader All Shares Index rose 22.27 points to 614.09 after
gaining 8.86 points Friday. Gainers beat losers 84 to 26, with 31
issues unchanged.
	   Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co. remained the main focus
of trades, capturing around 18 percent of total volume as it
advanced 45 pesos to 1,085 pesos.
	   Other blue chips followed suit, with property stocks showing the
heftiest gains on expectations of softening interest rates.
	   Russell Ong, analyst for Anscor-Hagedorn Securities, said the
market surge confirmed a turnaround in investor sentiment.
	   However, he expressed concern over the fast pace of the market's
advance. ``It's getting overheated ... there could be a
correction,'' he said, advising investors to start taking profits.
	   F. Yap Securities analyst Grace Cerdenia said local developments
are underpinning the market's rise, such as the peso's gains
against the dollar, softening interest rates and speculation over
PLDT.
	   Hong Kong's First Pacific Co. has been seeking control of PLDT
and is still in talks with major shareholders of the Philippines'
dominant telephone company.
	   Over the weekend, a local newspaper said the deal had been
closed and that First Pacific's local flagship, Metro Pacific
Corp., would be the main beneficiary since a foreign company can
own no more than 40 percent of a telecommunications concern.
	   The stock exchange briefly suspended trading of Metro Pacific
Monday until it denied any involvement in the deal.
	   In currency trading, volume was light because Tokyo markets were
closed.
	   A trader with a foreign bank said the peso tested but did not
breach 39.45 pesos per dollar in early transactions after it became
clear that the central bank would not cut its key overnight
interest rates.
	   The central bank has not lowered its interest rates following
cuts in the United States last week, but some market watchers
believe it still has the capacity to do so. Its overnight borrowing
rate is 13.75 percent and overnight lending rate 15.75 percent.
	   Traders expect the peso to be largely driven by the yen and the
broad direction of regional currencies in coming sessions.

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Against the backdrop of a Puerto
Rican flag, a bouncy, Spanish-speaking youth exhorts Puerto Ricans
to cast their ballots on the side of ``your flag, your language,
your culture!''
	   This isn't an ``independentista'' struggling to cast off a
century of American oppression. This is someone who supports
turning Puerto Rico into the 51st U.S. state.
	   Only a few weeks before a Dec. 13 referendum on possibly
changing the island's ties to the United States, mixed messages,
recriminations and confusion are the order of the day.
	   Disagreements run deeper than merely over what the island should
be. Puerto Ricans can't begin to agree on what it already is. Or
how any result in the referendum should be interpreted. Or whether
the vote should be held at all.
	   Statehood supporters insist they sense an opportunity to move
past voters' long-standing satisfaction with living in a
``commonwealth'' _ a sort of halfway house of Americanness devised
in 1952.
	   ``I don't have the slightest doubt we will win,'' said Jose
Granados Navedo, a leading legislator from the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party.
	   Under commonwealth status, the 3.8 million Puerto Rico residents
are U.S. citizens, but can't vote for president. On the other hand,
they don't pay federal taxes and do get symbols of sovereignty like
an Olympic team and a Miss Universe entry.
	   Commonwealth backers see this as ingenious compromise, the best
of both worlds.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello and fellow statehooders see it as an
embarrassing colonial relic. So, over the objections of opponents
and the fears of supporters, and without the backing of the U.S.
Congress, he called the referendum.
	   On the surface, island residents face five straightforward
options: Continue as a commonwealth; become a U.S. state;
independence; ``free association,'' essentially independence with
treaty ties to the United States; and ``none of the above.''
	   Most of the population is split almost evenly between
commonwealth and statehood, so each side emphasizes images and
messages intended to entice the opponents' electorate.
	   The campaign has been further muddled by the refusal of the
traditionally pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party to support
that option because of how it is defined on the ballot. It's
campaigning for ``none of the above.''
	   The ballot, written by statehood supporters, defines the
somewhat ambiguous 1952 commonwealth law as meaning local
government is ``under the authority of Congress,'' which could
strip islanders of their U.S. citizenship at will.
	   ``We cannot vote for this, because we don't want a commonwealth
that will not guarantee our U.S. citizenship,'' said Jorge de
Castro Font, a Popular Democratic legislator. ``Congress cannot
tomorrow take away our U.S. citizenship.''
	   His party got to write its own, improved definition during a
1993 vote in which commonwealth status beat statehood 49 percent-46
percent, with independence getting about 5 percent.
	   ``They are not willing to accept the truth about commonwealth,''
said Grenados Navedo, the pro-statehood lawmaker. ``When you are
crippled, you cannot pretend you're a jogger.''
	   Former U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh took the
statehooders' side recently, writing in The San Juan Star that
Puerto Ricans' citizenship is indeed ``granted by statute and not
fully protected by the U.S. Constitution.''
	   Commonwealthers warn that statehood would require Puerto Ricans
_ less than a third of whom speak English well _ to be truly
bilingual. Statehooders say that isn't so.
	   Taxation is also an issue. Statehooders say the overall tax
burden would remain the same, or even decrease _ with some funds
shifted from the local to the federal government. Commonwealth
backers say that even if that is true, tens of thousands would lose
jobs in the local public sector.
	   A poll published last week by the newspaper El Nuevo Dia said
statehood had the biggest group of support, 30 percent of the 1,000
people surveyed. Twenty-two percent chose commonwealth and 14
percent picked ``none of the above'' _ suggesting the Popular
Democratic Party has made some inroads in its unusual campaign.
	   Three percent chose independence and 1 percent free association.
The poll had an error margin of four percentage points.
	   Tellingly, 63 percent said the referendum should be postponed.
	   President Clinton has called on Congress, which failed to pass a
bill laying out the path to Puerto Rican statehood this year, to
``respect'' the result of the vote. And there does appear to be
growing impatience with commonwealth on Capitol Hill.
	   But many people doubt the United States would invite into the
union an applicant so ambivalent about the honor.

	   BOBOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Muslim prayer services are conducted
in a Spartan setting down the road from the destroyed mosque. A
volunteer patrol of civilians keeps a nervous watch for Serb
forces. Food is brought in furtively through the forest.
	   With a fragile cease-fire still largely holding, people are
drifting back to this central Kosovo village, and others across the
province, trying to rebuild damaged homes and shattered lives. But
their communities still bear only a semblance of normalcy.
	   In Bobovac, the ethnic Albanian residents struggle to pull
plastic sheeting over gaping holes where their roofs and windows
used to be, despite fears sporadic gunfire in the distance could
signal more trouble to come.
	   Community leaders are assuming their positions once again after
the months-long Serb crackdown on Albanian separatists that killed
hundreds and uprooted hundreds of thousands. Coordinating the
rebuilding, however, is not easy.
	   ``The village is run like it used to be,'' says village leader
Hysni Kryeziu. ``The difference is that the houses are destroyed
and we just can't have the same life.''
	   Less than a third of Bobovac's almost 2,000 residents have
returned. ``The rest don't have anywhere to come back to,'' Kryeziu
says. They are still sheltering in the homes of friends and
relatives in other villages.
	   Bobovac never had any telephones. Mail was collected from the
nearby village of Kijevo. But now, returning residents feel
completely isolated from the outside world.
	   Because of the Serb police presence in Kijevo on one side and
Malisevo on the other, villagers say they are afraid to even
approach those areas. Their only contact with what's happening
outside the village is word from passers-by.
	   But outside contact is not their main worry. ``For now, no one
is even thinking of other luxuries. We are interested only in
rebuilding a room to shelter in,'' Kryeziu says.
	   ``When the Serb police withdraw, we will think of what things
the village needs,'' agrees Xhevat Kryeziu, the local imam, or head
of the mosque, who is not related to the village leader.
	   Those who could find building materials are already repairing
their homes. Residents gather around the village chief as he
measures out plastic sheeting from a large roll left by the aid
organization Oxfam.
	   Men haul planks of wood and tiles to repair their roofs, while
laundry dries in burnt-out doorways and between broken walls.
	   Without outside help from humanitarian groups for building
material and supplies, village life won't be returning to normal in
the foreseeable future, the community leaders say.
	   ``If it depends only on us, it will take a lifetime to rebuild
our lives and homes,'' the imam sighs. ``It will take 50 years.''
	   Residents take turns patrolling Bobovac following the withdrawal
of Serb police. Kryeziu wouldn't say whether the volunteers are
armed.
	   Villagers insist that the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic
Albanian guerrilla force fighting for independence for the Serb
province, is not involved.
	   The tradition of religious ceremonies is being kept alive, even
though the mosque is little more than a burned-out shell. The imam
uses a carpeted but bare room in his home to hold weekly services.
	   A new, dangerous system of obtaining food has emerged.
	   Fear of Serb police has kept villagers away from main roads as
they try to reach other towns for supplies. But while shortcuts
lessen the likelihood of such encounters, getting spotted in woods
or fields means they run the risk of being arrested or shot as
suspected guerrillas.
	   Two shabby wooden crates are set up in the mud at roadside to
display the goods Bobovac villagers have brought back to sell _
cooking oil, sugar, cookies, fruit juices, cigarettes.
	   ``It is very expensive, but it's understandable because they
risk their lives to get it,'' Hysni Kryeziu says.
	   School is out of the question for now. With classrooms smashed,
books burned and desks and chairs missing, teachers have nowhere to
teach.
	   The children risk missing the entire school year, with survival
taking precedence over education. But there is hope the worst may
be over.
	   ``We may be able to catch the last term,'' says Muharrem
Oukolli, a teacher. ``For now, we have other worries and we don't
know who to turn to for help. But we will try, and we won't give up
until we can rebuild our lives.''

Hongkong Telecom agrees to buy rival Internet provider

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hongkong Telecom said Monday it has agreed to
buy the money-losing Internet business of rival Star Telecom
International Holding Ltd. in a deal that would give it slightly
more than half of the territory's booming Internet market.
	   Hongkong Telecom wants to buy Star Internet, a subsidiary of
Star Telecom, for 245.5 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 31.5
million), but competitor Asia Online immediately called the merger
a huge threat that could force little players out of the market.
	   ``Hongkong Telecom is in a position to practice predatory
pricing against would-be competitors and control the introduction
and use of new Internet technologies,'' said Asia Online, which has
about 20,000 subscribers, less than one-tenth of Hongkong Telecom's
Internet customer base even before any merger.
	   The sale will close only if government approval is obtained by
Dec. 31, Hongkong Telecom said in a statement.
	   Hong Kong has no anti-monopoly laws for Internet service
providers, but regulators will study the merger's effects on market
competition and consumer interest before issuing any approvals,
said Danny Ng, a spokesman for Hong Kong's Telecommunications
Authority.
	   ``We don't want to jeopardize consumer interest,'' Ng said.
	   It was unclear whether the merger would lead to job losses if it
is allowed to proceed. Hongkong Telecom said it would discuss job
offers with Star Internet staff and it would ``expect majority
acceptance.''
	   Star Internet employs more than 100 people and was negotiating
with labor representatives Monday, said spokesman Michael Chung. He
declined to disclose details.
	   Hongkong Telecom has been aggressively expanding into new
markets to cushion the loss of revenue it will likely face after
Jan. 1, when it surrenders its monopoly for international direct
dial telephone services in exchange for 6.7 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 858 million).
	   The Internet appears to be a logical place to seek out more
business for Hongkong Telecom, a subsidiary of Britain's Cable and
Wireless PLC.
	   Hongkong Telecom said recently its Internet traffic has grown by
more than 85 percent in the past six months.
	   Hongkong Telecom's Internet operation is the territory's
biggest, with more than 210,000 subscribers, spokeswoman Michelle
Li said. Star Internet is the second largest Internet service
provider in Hong Kong, with about 80,000 subscribers, she said.
	   The deal would give Hongkong Telecom about 53 percent of Hong
Kong's Internet market, Li said.
	   Star Telecom said in a statement that it will use cash from the
sale for general working capital but it doesn't have any specific
plans.
	   Despite the sizable market share held by Star Internet, it has
been a money-loser for Star Telecom, which also provides
radio-paging, data communications, and cellular telephone services,
and is involved in paging and mobile telecom networks in mainland
China.
	   While Star Telecom narrowed its group losses last year, the
losses at the Internet subsidiary came to 15.8 million Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 2.03 million) in 1997, up from a 6.1 million
Hong Kong dollar (U.S. dlrs 782,000) loss in 1996.

Israel frees policemen suspected of trying to attack settlement
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday released three Palestinian
policemen who had been held for 15 months without trial on
suspicion they planned to attack a Jewish settlement.
	   The three were detained on July 14, 1997, near the Jewish West
Bank settlement of Bracha after Israeli troops opened fire on their
car. One of the policemen was injured in the hand.
	   Israeli media reported at the time that the three were armed
with automatic weapons and hand grenades.
	   The incident caused a major crisis in relations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   The Israeli government said the three had been sent by the
commander of the Palestinian police, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, to
attack Bracha.
	   Israel revoked Jabali's VIP pass to cross Israeli territory
without security checks and demanded his extradition. The
Palestinians denied the charge and refused to extradite him.
	   lt was not until the negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians at Wye Plantation near Washington last month that
Israel dropped its demand for Jabali's extradition.
	   The three policemen were released Monday, one day after an
Israeli military appeals court ruled that there was no evidence to
justify their continued detention without trial, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky said.
	   Bushinsky said their release was not part of the Wye agreement
in which Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``There was no deal,'' Bushinsky said. ``The three are not
included in those being released under the Wye agreement.''

Man charged with mass murders goes on trial in Ukraine

<TEXT>
	   ZHYTOMYR, Ukraine (AP) _ A man accused of the worst murder spree
in modern Ukrainian history went on trial Monday, charged with the
deaths of 52 people after a trail of terror across the country.
	   Anatoliy Onoprienko, a forester and sailor who allegedly has
confessed to the killings, was facing 52 charges of killing men,
women and children.
	   ``I look at it very simply. As an animal. I watched all this as
an animal would stare at a sheep,'' Onoprienko said of the
slaughter in a videotaped 1997 police interview obtained by The
Associated Press.
	   The charges against Onoprienko chart a remarkable rampage that
first drew public attention in December, 1995.
	   In western Ukraine, the anxiety became so high that few
villagers ventured outside after dark. Huddled in their houses,
they listened in fear as police patrolled the deserted streets.
	   Authorities launched a nationwide manhunt for the killer, who
left few clues and no live witnesses. A police warrant issued at
the time spoke of a pleasant-looking man of medium height, a good
marksman with his 12-gauge rifle, who was ``exceptionally cruel
toward children.''
	   ``We hardly slept, collapsing on the tables and chairs in the
city police department,'' says Myroslav Rodych, then a traffic
policeman in the western capital of Lviv.
	   The killer continued to elude police, killing another 14 people
in four attacks between Feb. 21 and March 22, 1996.
	   But the net was tightening.
	   Police found the owner of the rifle, who said the weapon was
stolen from him. A list of the man's acquaintances was compiled.
	   In the Lviv region, investigators were checking on all
suspicious people, widely using informants. One report pointed to a
man who was traveling in the region between visits to his
girlfriend in Yavoriv, near the Polish border.
	   Police investigators recall how on April 14, armed officers
followed the woman into her apartment. They saw a balding, lean man
who rushed to grab his attache case but collapsed on the floor when
hit with a machine gun butt. A sawed-off hunting rifle lay inside
the briefcase.
	   In less than four months, Onoprienko, aged 36 at the time of his
arrest, had allegedly killed 40 people, including 10 children. His
total loot in cash, electronic appliances, jewelry and worn clothes
amounted to several thousand dollars at best.
	   Confronted with evidence found hidden at the homes of his lover
and his brother, Onoprienko confessed _ not only to those 40
deaths, but to those of 12 people in 1989, authorities say.
	   In the former Soviet Union, the rampage is matched only by that
of Andrei Chikatilo, convicted and executed in 1994 for killing and
mutilating 52 women and children in neighboring Russia over a
12-year period.
	   Relatives and boarding school teachers describe Onoprienko as a
quiet, reserved youth. The admitted killer says he feels himself to
be a robot, driven for years by a dark force.
	   He has argued that he should not be tried until authorities
determine the source of this force.
	   With a thin face, prominent nose, gray eyes and receding reddish
hair, Onoprienko rambles endlessly about the CIA and Interpol,
unknown powers and revelations. Psychiatrists, however, have ruled
him fit to stand trial.

China rejects Philippine request to raze structures on disputed
</HEADLINE>
reef &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ China has rejected a request by the
Philippine government to demolish buildings being enlarged by
Chinese workers on a South China Sea reef claimed by both
countries, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said Monday.
	   Earlier this month, Manila lodged a diplomatic protest with
Beijing over the construction of the concrete structures on
Mischief Reef in the disputed Spratly Islands. The Philippines says
it believes they could be used militarily.
	   In talks with Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan during the
recent Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meetings in Malaysia,
Siazon said he asked that China remove all structures on the reef,
which lies within the Philippines' 200-mile exclusive economic
zone.
	   Tang rejected that request, Siazon said.
	   ``We asked China to remove them but we're not going to blow them
up. I would not even dream about it,'' Siazon told reporters.
	   He said that China, however, was amenable to possible joint use
of the structures and the countries have agreed to discuss the
details of such an arrangement.
	   Such talks would set aside the issue of ownership and focus on
which country would manage the structures, a role the Philippines
would like to assume, he said.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, who also attended the APEC meetings, discussed Mischief Reef
as well and agreed to settle the dispute peacefully.
	   They endorsed a proposal to form a group of experts who will
find ways to build confidence between the two nations. They also
agreed that natural resources in the area of the reef should be
used jointly by the two nations.
	   Siazon said the experts discussing confidence-building measures
would meet in Manila in January.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said that despite protests
from the Philippines, China is continuing construction of the
buildings.
	   Philippine officials say the new construction violates a 1995
accord between Manila and Beijing to not to unduly stir controversy
over the Spratlys.
	   The Chinese have insisted that the structures provide shelter
for Chinese fishermen and that the repairs were necessary because
of damage from natural causes that might endanger the occupants.
	   The Spratlys, which straddle vital sea lanes in the South China
Sea, are claimed in whole by China, Vietnam and Taiwan, and in part
by Malaysia and the Philippines. Brunei claims one reef.

Kenya milling giant is looking for a partner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI (Dow Jones) _ Unga Group Ltd., the largest milling
company in Kenya, is looking for a partner after it announced a
pre-tax loss of more than Kenya shillings 708 million (dlrs 11.8
million), a company official said Monday.
	   ``We are looking for a company willing and also in a position to
invest in the Unga Group,'' said Ann Kinuthia, Unga Group public
relations manager.
	   She said Unga Group is undertaking a house-cleaning process in
order to make it possible for a another company to invest in it.
	   Kinuthia denied local newspaper reports that negotiations were
underway with a South African milling group to invest in the feed
and milling business of the Unga Group.
	   ``These reports are misleading, we have no particular company at
the moment,'' she said.
	   Kinuthia said currently Unga Group is only in alliance with
South African Nampak Holdings, the largest packaging material
manufacturer in South Africa, as the joint venture Bullpark Ltd. to
manufacture packaging materials.
	   Kinuthia said Unga Group holds 51 percent of the shares in
Bullpark while Nampak holds 49 percent.

Kurd rebel blames two enemies _ Turkish nationalists, military _
</HEADLINE>
for attack on pope &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul
II in 1981 wasn't acting alone, a Kurd rebel leader claims in a
letter made public Monday that tries to win the pope's support
against Turkey.
	   Abdullah Ocalan wrote the pope Nov. 18 while he was still in
custody in Rome, La Repubblica daily said. A Rome court freed
Ocalan two days later, rejecting a Turkish warrant for the
guerrilla chief Turkey considers its most-wanted criminal.
	   Ocalan's letter blames two enemies of the Kurds _ Turkish
nationalists and the Turkish military _ for the May 13, 1981,
attack on the pope in St. Peter's Square. Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali
Agca shot the pope in the abdomen. He is now serving a life
sentence.
	   Agca is a former member of the Gray Wolves, a far-right
nationalist group that is the staunchest opponent to the Kurdish
cause in Turkey. The motive for his attack on the pope has never
been clear; Agca has gone back and forth on claims that the
Bulgarian secret service plotted the attack at the institigation of
the Soviet Union.
	   Agca escaped from a Turkish jail in 1979, two years before the
attack. Ocalan's letter claimed Agca actually was freed by one of
the generals who later took part in Turkey's 1980 military coup.
	   ``This hateful attack on your person should not be considered an
individual act,'' Ocalan wrote. ``Mr. Ali Agca has not told the
truth.''
	   The letter also refers to ``barbarous Turks,'' telling the pope
they destroyed Roman civilization and many are bent on destroying
Christianity, according to the upcoming edition of ``Christian
Family'' magazine.
	   There was no immediate response from either the Turkish
government or the Vatican.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. The conflict has killed 37,000 people.
	   Ocalan insisted in his letter to the pope that he has now
renounced violence.
	   Ocalan is seeking asylum in Italy; an Italian court order
directs him to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany time to
decide whether it wants to pursue extradition on its own terrorism
charges against him.
	   Despite the rejection of Turkey's arrest warrant, Turkish
Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Turkey would make a formal
request for extradition either Wednesday or Thursday.
	   Italy's refusal to immediately surrender Ocalan for trial has
outraged Turkey, Italy's NATO partner.
	   On Monday, a convoy of yellow taxi cabs careened in front of the
Italian Embassy in Ankara, honking horns and flying banners
declaring, ``No to Fiat'' _ although most of the cabs were
Turkish-made Fiat 131s.
	   Economy Minister Gunes Taner said in an interview with Zaman
daily published Monday that he disapproved of the popular movement
to end trade with Italy.
	   ``Don't make hasty decisions such as boycott,'' Taner was quoted
as saying, adding that the government had not approved any of the
boycotts to date.
	   In Turkey, 35,000 troops reportedly are fighting this week to
wipe about a 500-strong band of PKK rebels. Turkish media said
Monday the latest clash has killed 23 rebels and two soldiers.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed more than 50 people in parts of Eastern
Europe and the Balkans, police and other reports said Monday.
	   The early winter weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in
Romania and Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 32 people
died, most of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold
after drinking alcohol.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
	   The lowest temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15
Fahrenheit) early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
	   In Romania, at least 21 people died from the cold and in
weather-related accidents caused by slippery or snow-covered roads
in the southeast since Friday. Temperatures plunged to minus 10
Celsius (14 Fahrenheit) in the pre-dawn hours of Monday.
	   Some 200 people spent more than 48 hours stranded in their cars
after winds whipped snowdrifts across main highways, Army vehicles
rescued most drivers but six people froze to death on the weekend
after being trapped in their cars. Some of the other deaths were
among the homeless.
	   Dozens of trains were canceled and 200 communities were reported
to be without electricity, the daily Libertatea reported Monday.
Some 15 major roads were blocked by snowdrifts as high as 1.5
meters (five feet). Police urged drivers not to travel in snowed in
areas.
	   In Bucharest, dozens of cars smashed into other vehicles and
skidded in the icy conditions. The Emergency Hospital in Bucharest
said it treated 80 people for fractures and frostbite over the
weekend.
	   In Bulgaria, three people died in the northwestern region of
Montana, the daily 24 Chassa reported Monday. Some highways were
blocked and some areas were without power, phones and running
water.
	   The Black Sea ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Constanta in
Romania were closed due to storms, state radio reported Monday.

Thorny issues at first EU meeting for Germany's Lafontaine
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's new Social Democratic Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine made his European Union debut Monday
seeking support for a new left-leaning agenda that shifts the EU's
focus from containing inflation to promoting growth and jobs.
	   On the eve of the monthly EU gathering, Lafontaine dined with
the 10 other ministers from socialist-led governments who set out
plans for enhanced policy cooperation to encourage growth after the
launch of the euro as a shared EU currency on Jan. 1.
	   But after the pledge of unity in the socialist's ``New European
Way,'' ministers confronted divisive issues, including who should
represent the euro-zone internationally, how to coordinate EU
taxation and how to share out the dlrs 100 billion budget among the
15 EU nations.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown warned he
would shoot down proposals to take tax-raising powers from national
governments in favor of some sort of EU-wide taxation plan.
	   ``We have a veto and we will use it if necessary,'' Brown told
reporters.
	   Other EU ministers said increased cooperation is needed after
the launch of the euro to stop investors hopping from one country
to another in search of lower taxes.
	   Ahead of the full EU meeting, ministers from the 11 euro-zone
nations met Wim Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank,
which will set interest rates for the currency bloc.
	   Duisenberg faces pressure from Lafontaine and other socialist
ministers to set lower rates that take account of growth and
employment as well as inflation. They also urged Duisenberg to keep
ministers informed of its policy direction, but Lafontaine denied
any attempt to undermine the ECB's independence.
	   ``We want a dialogue. In a democratic society, such a proposal
for a dialogue is no threat for the ECB's independence,'' he told
reporters Sunday night.
	   The question of who represents the euro-zone in international
meetings, has pitted smaller EU nations against bigger nations
unwilling to give up their seats at international organizations to
make way for any joint euro-bloc representation.
	   ``It's a chance for Europe to speak with one voice (but) there
is a rift between those that have a seat at the G-7 and the
others,'' said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy, who
found scant support for his own bid to represent the euro bloc at
meeting of the G-7 group of world economic powers.
	   There were hints of a compromise as France backed a proposal for
a rotating presidency and vice-presidency of the euro-zone that
would allow one of the smaller nations to have a G-7 place
alongside the EU's existing members _ Germany, France, Italy and
Britain. The ECB would replace the national banks from euro-zone
nations.
	   An even more contentious issue concerns efforts to overhaul the
EU's budget so the Union can afford its plans to bring in up to 12
new members over the next decade, mostly from the former-communist
East.
	   Britain, Austria and others are pushing for a freeze that would
keep spending at current levels until 2006. Less well-off EU
members led by Spain fear such rigor will mean them losing out as
funds start flowing to the even poorer easterners.
	   ``I don't believe this is a positive or constructive way
forward,'' said Rodrigo Rato, Spain's minister for economic affairs
as he arrived for the meeting.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy returned Monday to Baghdad
amid Iraq's latest salvo against the chief weapons inspector, who
is demanding arms-related documents.
	   The papers sought by Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, are spurring a new confrontation between the
government of Saddam Hussein and the U.N. inspectors overseeing
destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
	   On Sunday, two leading Iraqi officials derided Butler's request
as a pretext to justify a U.S. military strike on Iraq, saying the
government already had turned over all relevant documents.
	   The special U.N. envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, flew in from the
gulf state of Bahrain. He refused to comment on arrival, saying
only that he expected to meet with Iraqi officials.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Iraq
insists it has already gotten rid of all proscribed weaponry.
	   Monday's state-run Iraqi newspapers said Butler's grudge against
Iraq prompted the latest demand for documents.
	   ``Butler has personal motives to create a new crisis,'' the
daily Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in a
front-page editorial signed by editor-in-chief Sami Mehdi.
	   ``He (Butler) has explained Iraq's decision to let the
inspectors resume their activities .... as a personal victory which
he believes will enable him to take revenge on Iraq,'' the paper
said.
	   Iraq had demanded the United Nations dismiss Butler before the
threat of U.S. and British airstrikes forced it reverse course Nov.
14 and agree to let U.N. weapons inspectors to return.
	   The arms inspectors returned last week and have been making
visits to potential weapons-making sites daily, with the
cooperation of the Iraq government.
	   Butler's weekend demand for documents again raises the prospect
of possible American military strikes against Iraq since U.S.
President Bill Clinton had demanded full cooperation with the
weapons inspectors, known as UNSCOM.
	   In Korea, where Clinton was visiting, a spokesman for the U.S.
National Security Council referred to Iraq's refusal to hand over
documents as an ``insufficient'' response, but said no final
conclusion had been made about the Iraqi move.
	   The spokesman, David Leavy, raised the prospect of an attack,
saying: ``If we conclude Iraq does not intend to live up to its
commitments and UNSCOM can't do its job, we remain prepared'' to
carry out airstrikes Clinton canceled last week.
	   On Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz said Butler's
demands were either intended to provoke an attack or to put off a
promised Security Council review of Iraq's cooperation in arms
destruction that the government hopes will lead to easing the
sanctions.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and U.S. ground controllers on Monday
guided the first module of the new international space station,
adjusting its orbit for a rendezvous next month with the next
module.
	   The Russian-built Zarya, or Sunrise, module has been smoothly
orbiting Earth since a faultless launch on Friday. ``All Zarya's
equipment has been working without a glitch,'' said Vera
Medvedkova, a spokeswoman for Russian Mission Control.
	   Early Monday, Zarya's orbit was adjusted for the third time
since the launch. After another maneuver on Tuesday, its orbit will
be circularized at around 385 kilometers (240 statute miles).
	   This is the right attitude for a rendezvous with the American
space shuttle Endeavor, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying the
Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew is to capture Zarya using
the Endeavors robot arm and then attach the two modules in three
space walks.
	   According to Medvedkova, Russian ground controllers were guiding
Zarya from a separate control room at the Mission Control outside
Moscow. The hall, built during the Soviet times to handle the
Buran, a Russian cat of the U.S. space shuttle, has been turned
into a control room for the new space station.
	   A separate hall in the same building controls the Russian Mir
space station. Russian space officials had decided to discard the
aging Mir next June, but recently said that its life may be
extended if they are able to raise more funds.
	   NASA has also been monitoring Zarya from its newly inaugurated
Mission Control Center for the international space station at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
	   Zarya's launch was held back for one year because the
cash-strapped Russian space agency had failed meet its obligation
on building a crucial follow-up component that would house the
crew.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, built for NASA by the Russian
Khrunichev company, is designed to serve as a space tugboat in the
early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and
communications.
	   The station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.
	   The station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and
is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United
States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve as an orbital
home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.
	   The new station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of the Russian-made crew module which is
set to blast off next July or August.

Malaysia starts crackdown on illegal workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's crackdown on illegal
foreign workers began Monday in the central state of Selangor with
nine people arrested, a news report said.
	   An amnesty for illegal workers to avoid arrest by returning to
their home countries expired Nov. 15.
	   The state's immigration chief, Dahari Ibrahim, said three
Bangladeshis were picked up for working in factories instead of
plantations as stated in their permits, and three employers were
arrested too.
	   Three Indonesian women, who claimed they were housemaids, were
arrested after they were found working in a metal factory, Dahari
said.
	   They were among 192 workers questioned in the state, the
national news agency Bernama reported.
	   Dahari said that of 28,00 registered foreign workers in Selangor
state, 15,000 had renewed their work permits while another 7,000
had left for their home countries under the amnesty.
	   The amnesty originally had been scheduled to end on Oct. 31, but
was extended to Nov. 15 because of congestion at ferry ports caused
by Indonesians trying to return home before the deadline.
	   Malaysia's other 12 states were expected to crack down on
illegal immigrants soon.
	   Between Aug. 31 and Oct. 31, a total of 141,806 illegal
immigrants had returned to their native countries.
	   Of those, 123,548 were from Indonesia, 8,937 from Bangladesh,
3,191 from India, 2,662 from the Philippines and 1,049 from
Myanmar.
	   Most of the illegal immigrants worked on plantations or in
construction.
	   Deputy Home Minister Tajol Rosli said on Oct. 31 that more than
400,000 immigrants were still in the country, both legally and
illegally.
	   Those without work permits face arrest, fines of 3,000 ringgit
(dlrs 750) and deportation.
	   During Asia's boom years, Malaysia invited millions of foreign
workers to build its modern cityscapes. Now, with rising
unemployment and a plunging economy, they are no longer welcome.

EU confirms African franc peg to euro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with EU-Finance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers
confirmed Monday that the euro can replace the French franc as the
anchor for the common currency used by 15 nations in central and
west Africa.
	   ``The question has been definitively resolved,'' said EU Finance
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. ``The arrival of the euro
will change nothing for the Africans.''
	   The decision, which confirms a provisional ruling taken in July,
should calm fears among the African nations that replacement of the
French franc by the EU's single currency on Jan. 1, would undermine
their monetary stability.
	   Under the agreement, the French Treasury will defend a fixed
parity between the euro and the African nations' CFA franc in the
same way as it now backs the rate of 100 CFA francs to the French
franc.
	   The exchange rate between the euro and the CFA franc will be
fixed on Jan. 1, based on the rate at which the French franc is
absorbed into the euro.
	   The agreement calls on France to inform its EU partners of of
any plans to change the exchange rate between the euro and the CFA
franc. Entry of other nations into the African currency union or
other major changes to the system will need EU approval.
	   Despite assurances from France, the impending demise of the
franc provoked fears in CFA nations that they could fall victim to
the kind of wild financial instability that often plagues African
countries without a peg to a strong Western currency.
	   The CFA franc is used by Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast,
Guinea Bissau, Mali, Niger, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Congo, Gabon,
Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Chad.
	   EU ministers agreed a similar arrangement will peg the currency
of the Indian Ocean island nation of the Comoros to the euro.

WWF urges EU to rethink policy on farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The World Wildlife Fund on Monday
warned that the European Union's policy of subsidizing farmers has
a disastrous impact on the environment and does little to help
develop rural areas.
	   ``The EU's rural policy is a regressive policy. It is making
rich farmers richer and poor farmers poorer, as well as destroying
large parts of Europe's environment,'' Tony Long, the director
European policy of the WWF environmental group said.
	   The EU's Common Agriculture Policy, created to help Europe's
farmers, takes up half of all EU spending and amounts to over 40
billion European currency units (dlrs 50 billion).
	   The EU executive Commission has made proposals on reforming the
CAP, which cannot remain in its present form if the EU is to absorb
several eastern European countries and their millions of farmers in
the next decade.
	   But the proposals, which EU farm ministers are set to discuss
during their two-day session starting Monday, are ``too timid,''
WWF spokeswoman Natasha Yellachich said.
	   Under these proposals, 75 percent of the CAP budget would still
go to EU farmers. Only 3 percent would be used for
agro-environmental measures and 10 percent for ``rural
development'' measures, Yellachich said.
	   The WWF is proposing instead that by the year 2006, 75 percent
of the CAP budget be transformed into funds for rural development.
These funds would be used, for example, to help farmers diversify,
or to encourage people to set up their own business, not just in
farming.
	   ``The number of farmers in the EU has dropped from 15 million to
7 million over the past 25 years. It's time the EU broadened its
rural policy to include other groups of people,'' Yellachich said.
	   Under the WWF proposal, a quarter of the CAP should be spent for
environmental measures.
	   The WWF also wants farmers to receive subsidies only if they
comply with basic environmental standards.
	   ``Currently, 13 out of 15 EU countries are subject to legal
proceedings. In all these countries there are cases of nitrate
levels in water exceeding levels permitted under EU rules,''
Yellachich said.
	   Another example of non-compliance is that olive-growers, who
receive some 2.2 billion ecu (dlrs 2.57 billion) out of the CAP
budget, cultivate the land more and more intensively with complete
disregard for the soil. Yellachich said.
	   ``This leads to phenomenal soil erosion,'' she said.

Philippine court sentences two Chinese to death for illegal drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A Philippine court on Monday
sentenced two men from China to die by lethal injection for selling
illegal drugs to an undercover policeman during a sting operation.
	   Judge Diosdado Peralta of the Quezon City trial court said
William Ong and Ching Deng-ming, alias Robert Tiu, were guilty of
selling nearly 980.50 grams (35 ounces) of methampetamine
hydrochloride crystals.
	   Aside from ordering the death sentence, Peralta also ordered the
two to pay 1 million pesos (dlrs 25,641) each to the government.
	   He dismissed the two men's denial as ``self-serving negative
evidence.''
	   ``It was a frame-up,'' Ching said as they were being led out of
the court.
	   Ong, who said he was a noodle factory worker, claims he was
seized on the street, blindfolded and dragged to a nearby police
station before he was informed that he was being arrested.
	   Ching, who called himself a clothes trader, said he was waiting
for his girlfriend in his car when police arrested him.
	   Court records showed Ong and Ching, who did not have passports,
were arrested in July in Quezon City's New Manila residential
district while selling the drugs, inside a gift-wrapped box, to an
undercover policeman.
	   They said Ong received marked money from a policeman and
signaled Ching, in a car, to come hand over the drugs.
	   Police said the two are believed to have been in the country for
a long time because they are fluent in the main Filipino language.

Report: Bust of Stalin to be put up in Russian high school
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A bust of Josef Stalin will be put up in a Ural
Mountains high school, whose Communist principal wants to honor the
Soviet dictator's role in World War II, a news report said Monday.
	   Millions of people were killed during Stalin's purges and many
Russians detest his memory.
	   But admirers of the dictator have taken no note, and insist that
Stalin managed to mobilize the nation and lead it to victory during
the war, with soldiers hailing Stalin as they went to their death
on the battlefields.
	   The plaster bust in the school in the city of Chelyabinsk will
be put up Dec. 21, the 119th anniversary of Stalin's birth, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   The action was organized by the school principal, who is also
the city's Communist Party leader, Sergei Alabzhin.
	   The bust will become part of the school's ``gallery of heroes,''
which honors World War II military leaders such as Marshals Georgy
Zhukov and Vasily Blyukher, ITAR-Tass said.
	   The bust was financed by donations by World War II veterans, it
said. The report did not say if students or parents were asked
whether they supported the plan.
	   Chelyabinsk is located about 1500 kilometers (950 miles) east of
Moscow.

Vice President sets fire to two tons of turtle shells
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP photos available &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VICTORIA, Seychelles (AP) _ Vice President James Michel set fire
to a pile of two tons of hawksbill turtle shells Monday, vowing
Seychelles had ended its commercial exploitation of the endangered
reptiles.
	   ``In lighting this torch, it is the ultimate symbolic step to
show the world that the exploitation of the shells for crafts ...
is over,'' Michel said during a ceremony on a spotless white beach
at Intendance Bay on the main island of this 92-island Indian Ocean
archipelago.
	   Contestants in the Miss World beauty pageant that culiminates
Thursday and craftsmen who used to make combs, jewelcases and other
articles from the translucent, marbled shells watched from a
distance as molten grey smoke rose, and the shells crackled and
melted in the early morning sun.
	   ``This is our message to the rest of the world on how this small
island stands in the field of environment,'' Michel said.
	   Hawksbill turtles and giant tortoises were once numerous in the
coral reefs and on the sandy beaches of the Seychelles. But hunters
depleted them to satisfy the demand for tortoise shell items.
	   After Seychelles signed the U.N. Convention on Trade in
Endangered Species, the government in cooperation with the World
Bank undertook to re-train craftsmen who had lost their
livelihoods.
	   The government paid about dlrs 115,000 to buy up the remaining
stock of shells that were burned Monday.

Low turnout in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Low voter turnout of slightly more
than 20 percent marked this weekend's Senate elections, in which
the ruling Social Democrats suffered a major blow.
	   Party chairman Milos Zeman acknowledged defeat after his party
scored just three victories in runoff elections for 27 seats in the
81-seat upper chamber of Czech legislature.
	   Zeman called voters ``cowards'' for ignoring the ballot and
blamed his candidates for not campaigning enough.
	   President Vaclav Havel was happy after his favored four-party
coalition led by the Christian Democrats won 13 seats.
	   ``The enlightened minority came to the polls,'' Havel said,
commenting on the low turnout.
	   Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, now opposition leader, called the
vote a draw after his Civic Democratic Party won nine seats. The
unreformed Communist party won the two remaining mandates.
	   In a telephone poll of 504 voters conducted by the Sofres-Factum
agency, a total of 47.5 percent said they were dissatisfied with
the election outcome, opposed to 41.2 percent who were satisfied
with the vote, CTK news agency reported Monday.
	   Most of those dissatisfied said they saw no purpose in having a
Senate, the poll said.

Iran expanding the role of women in the police force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's Parliament has passed a bill
expanding the role of women in the police force, newspapers
reported Monday.
	   Under the new bill passed Sunday, women will be allowed to carry
out most police duties including law enforcement chores previously
reserved for men, the papers said.
	   Women, who under Iran's Islamic dress code must cover all parts
of the body except the face, had previously been employed largely
in clerical and administrative tasks.
	   ``Police can now employ women where they are needed, as long as
they observe Islamic mores,'' Zan newspaper reported.
	   ``Women will be able to administer driving tests, conduct
same-sex body searches, issue drivers licenses, work in vice squads
and run female prisons,'' said the paper.
	   The bill must still be approved by the Guardian Council, which
reviews legislation to ensure it does not contradict Islamic law or
Iran's constitution.
	   President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate who took office last
years, has been championing women's rights and has employed women
in top government posts.

Slum youngsters gain pride through sports association
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NAI101-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By JOHN NENE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ A decade ago, Mathare was known only as
one of eastern Africa's biggest slums.
	   The sprawling shantytown of nearly half a million is renown for
crime, prostitution and home brew liquor known as chang'aa.
	   That was before the Mathare Youth Sports Association came along.
And long before Mathare United _ one of the club's 600 soccer teams
_ qualified last month for Africa's Cup Winner Cup championship.
	   Until the birth of the Mathare Youth Sports Association,
youngsters who lived there were ashamed of their impoverished
neighborhood.
	   ``Most of us had given up hope in life,'' said 23-year-old Pius
Obala, MYSA's deputy chief operations manager. ``We just felt
neglected, and to make matters worse, people always looked at us
scornfully because we were from the Mathare slums.''
	   ``Now, we walk with our chests high, very proud to say that
we're from Mathare,'' he added. ``MYSA has changed the lives of
many youngsters.''
	   Spirits soared on Oct. 10 when MYSA's senior team, Mathare
United, defeated the more experienced Eldoret KCC 2-1 in the Moi
Golden Cup, earning a berth to represent Kenya in the prestigious
Cup Winners Cup.
	   This delights Bob Munro, the godfather of the sports association
that has transformed the lives of thousands of kids in Mathare and
neighboring housing projects.
	   ``What pleased me most was the euphoric mood throughout
Mathare,'' the 56-year-old Canadian said. ``Tens of thousands of
slum dwellers sitting in shacks with candles and kerosene lamps
were all saying `we won,' irrespective of their ethnic or religious
background.''
	   Violence often flares among members of different ethnic groups
packed into Nairobi's vast shantytowns where they have moved from
rural areas in hopes of a better life.
	   There are more than 600 soccer clubs for boys and girls aged
10-18 in the MYSA, which is run by the youngsters themselves.
	   Mathare soccer teams have done well in the annual Dana and
Gothia Cup tournaments in Norway.
	   But the association also runs an award-winning slum clean-up
operation for people of all ages and a program to make kids aware
of the dangers of HIV/AIDS.
	   Every weekend MYSA youth clean up different housing projects in
Nairobi.
	   ``Our aim is to make Mathare and Nairobi as a whole a better
place to live in,'' said deputy garbage collection manager Isabel
Mbuthia.
	   Most members of the association are brought up by single mothers
in conditions of extreme poverty.
	   James Waithaka, a 21-year-old who drives the garbage truck, says
there is a downside to the clean-up job.
	   ``At times we lose appetite because of the stench. Some of us
get sick, but Munro organizes for treatment,'' he said. ``Anyhow,
we're proud of what we're doing.''
	   Moses Ouma, a promising 14-year-old striker, said he liked the
clean-up because ``we're helping to reduce disease in the slums.''
	   When Munro, a specialist in environmental research management
and planning, was growing up outside Toronto, Canadian veterans
returning from World War II introduced him to Little League
baseball and ice hockey, which taught him and other nine-year-olds
discipline.
	   ``So, when I first toured Mathare, I was touched when I saw
small boys playing soccer using paper balls tied with strings. I
felt it was payback time. I had to give back what I gained from the
soldiers,'' he said. ``That's how I formed the MYSA in 1987.''
	   Other MYSA projects include supporting the city's hundreds of
street children when they are arrested and arraigned in court and a
photography club headed by Francis Kimanthi, the captain of the
champion Mathare United, who studied photo journalism on a
scholarship to Hamar Folkehogskole in Norway.
	   The club is completing a ``shootback'' project for which its 30
members have photographed their daily lives and surroundings. A
book of their work will be published.
	   ``It's aimed at helping the youngsters learn a marketable skill,
and tell the story with their own eyes,'' Munro said.

Parliamentary commission clears Ciller in wealth probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be led by 1300 GMT with confidence motion debate opening &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A parliamentary committee Monday opposed
moving ahead with a corruption probe of former Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller, who is accused of illegally amassing a fortune from bank
deals.
	   The vote showed the political alliances being tested in advance
of a Wednesday confidence vote, which is expected to bring down the
government of Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz.
	   Yilmaz' Motherland Party supported Mrs. Ciller in the 12-2 vote,
although Motherland had originally asked for the probe. Parliament
is considered likely to follow the panel's decision.
	   A negative vote would have stripped Mrs. Ciller of her immunity
from prosecution.
	   Analysts believe Yilmaz could seek a governing coalition with
his former arch-rival, Ciller's True Path Party, if he loses the
confidence vote.
	   The government opposition has accused Yilmaz of ties to
organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state
bank. Parliament was expected to open debate on the confidence
motion later Monday.
	   A separate commission looking into Yilmaz' wealth also was
expected to decide whether to cancel his immunity from prosecution.
But the vote was expected to go in Yilmaz' favor with an about-face
from Ciller's party, which initiated the probe and is now likely to
support him.
	   Mrs. Ciller has survived several similar probes into her
accumulation of wealth. Detractors alleged the bulk of the family's
wealth came from illegal bank dealings conducted by her husband,
who ran a private bank that collapsed.
	   Mrs. Ciller claims she built up their fortune from several
hundred thousand dollars inherited from her family.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital with
pneumonia and a fever, officials said Monday, raising new concerns
about his ability to handle his responsibilities amid Russia's
economic crisis. The 67-year-old president has made few public
appearances in recent weeks and has gotten sick at least three
times. The Kremlin said Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics
after being hospitalized Sunday in the government's Central
Clinical Hospital with a temperature of 38.9 C (102 F). In a sign
that the president's condition was not critical, Yeltsin met Monday
in the hospital with visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin. A
Kremlin spokesman, who declined to be named, said after the meeting
that Yeltsin was ``working,'' but gave no further details.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesian rescue workers pulled seven
bodies Monday from a gutted gambling parlor burned by Muslim mobs,
raising the death toll to 13 from weekend ethnic and religious
violence. Many Christian schools remained closed after Sunday's
riots in which mobs of Muslim youths set fire to churches and
attacked Christians. Security forces detained 179 people during the
riots, said Brig. Gen. Togar Sianipar, a national police spokesmen.
Of the latest victims, two were members of the ethnic Chinese
minority, which is often targeted during social strife, partly
because it dominates trade and commerce. Also, most Chinese in
overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia are Christian or Buddhist.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The politically charged corruption
trial of Malaysia's ousted deputy prime minister resumed Monday
amid a national outcry against foreigners accused of supporting
him. The Malaysian government had recessed the trial of Anwar
Ibrahim so it would not interfere with last week's Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit. The weeklong pause, however,
brightened the spotlight on Malaysia. Anwar was arrested Sept. 20,
two weeks after his firing sparked massive antigovernment protests,
and charged with corruption and sexual misconduct. The 51-year-old
sacked deputy denies the charges, calling them part of a political
vendetta orchestrated by his former mentor, Mahathir Mohamad.

	   DETROIT (AP) _ Dr. Jack Kevorkian, the doctor who has helped
dozens of Americans commit suicide, injected a terminally ill man
with a lethal dose of drugs on a videotape broadcast nationally and
challenged U.S. authorities to prosecute him for it. The U.S.
network CBS issued a statement Sunday night defending the story,
saying it went ``to the core of an important national debate'' over
doctor-assisted suicide, which is illegal in many states.
Kevorkian, who advocates helping terminally ill people in pain who
want to end their lives, dared authorities to put an end to his
activities. ``Either they go or I go,'' Kevorkian said on the CBS
news show ``60 Minutes.'' ``If I'm acquitted, they go, because they
know they'll never convict me. If I'm convicted, I will starve to
death in prison, so I will go.'' (US-SUICIDE DOCTOR)
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy returned Monday to Baghdad
amid Iraq's latest salvo against the chief weapons inspector, who
is demanding arms-related documents. The government of Saddam
Hussein and the U.N. inspectors overseeing destruction of Iraq's
most dangerous weapons are sparring over chief inspector Richard
Butler's latest request for documents. On Sunday, two leading Iraqi
officials derided Butler's request as a pretext to justify a U.S.
military strike on Iraq, saying the government already had turned
over all relevant documents. The special U.N. envoy to Iraq,
Prakash Shah, flew in Monday from the Gulf state of Bahrain. The
inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of
mass destruction before the U.N. Security Council will lift
sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait. (IRAQ)

Mandela to visit Russia in 1999
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report that Mandela will visit Russia in 1999 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ South African President Nelson Mandela will visit
Russia in April, 1999 for meetings with Russian leaders, his vice
president announced Monday.
	   The Interfax News Agency said Vice President Thabo Mbeki said
the visit had been set for next spring. Mandela canceled a visit to
Russia last winter amid concerns about his health.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said the invitation to
Mandela had been extended on the instructions of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin.
	   ``We are looking forward to his visit,'' Primakov said.
	   Primakov said his talks with Mbeki on improving ties had gone
well and there were good opportunities to expand relations.
	   ``We rejoice at South Africa's successes and are glad that the
changes that have taken place in that country lately were not
accompanied by any bloodshed and the country is stable,'' he said.
	   Primakov hailed the improvement in relations since the end of
white-minority rule.
	   ``Both sides want this. We are no longer sizing each other up,''
he said at the start of talks.
	   The two sides signed agreements covering protection of capital
investments, cooperation in tourism and sport.
	   Mbeki, who is expected to succeed Mandela when elections are
held next year, is scheduled to deliver a speech at Peoples'
Friendship University.
	   The school was a magnet for African students during the Soviet
era, when it served the government's policy of promoting communism
in Africa. Since the Soviet collapse, it has fallen on hard times.

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ British Foreign Minister Robin Cook
met Slovene counterpart Boris Frlec Monday, on his first visit to
the former Yugoslav republic and would-be member of the European
Union.
	   Cook is also scheduled to meet President Milan Kucan and Premier
Janez Drnovsek and will participate in the official opening of the
British Council in the capital of Ljubljana.
	   Slovenia, a tiny Alpine country of two million, declared
independence from the old Yugoslav federation in 1991. The most
prosperous and developed of all former Yugoslav republics, Slovenia
soon was admitted to NATO Partnership for Peace Program and is
listed as one of potential candidates for the eastward enlargement
of the European Union.
	   Although the country has already started talks on EU membership,
it recently was criticized for being too slow in making its
legislation conform to West European standards.

Taiwan wary on Jiang visit to Japan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BODEEN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ As Chinese President Jiang Zemin prepares
for an unprecedented state visit to Japan, Taiwanese are nervously
wondering whether Tokyo will drop its support for the island in
exchange for better ties to the mainland, the deputy foreign
minister said Monday.
	   ``We understand and respect the reasons behind Jiang's visit,
but we hope that during the visit, Japan will not trade away,
sacrifice or backtrack on Taiwan's interests,'' David Lee told
reporters.
	   Taiwan is doing all it can _ mobilizing its contacts in Japanese
political, media and academic circles to remind Tokyo of its past
commitments to the island, Lee said. So far, Japanese support seems
to be holding, he said.
	   Taiwan's media have been awash with speculation over whether
Japan will make a pledge to the Chinese president over Taiwan
similar to that offered by U.S. President Bill Clinton during his
visit to China in the summer.
	   Clinton pledged not to recognize Taiwan's independence, support
Taiwan's entry into the United Nations or formally recognize the
political split between Taiwan and China. Clinton's words were
viewed as a major encouragement to China in its claims of
sovereignty over Taiwan.
	   Jiang is to embark Wednesday on the first ever state visit to
Japan by a Chinese head of state. Taiwan is expected to be a key
topic of discussion.
	   China and Taiwan divided in 1949, when Mao Tse-tung's Communists
forced Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists to flee to the island amid
civil war. Their current governments are heirs to that struggle,
and Beijing continues to claim Taiwan as a breakaway province to be
reunited with the mainland by force if necessary.
	   Jiang is expected to discuss regional security issues and may be
offered a formal apology from Japan for its invasion and brutal
World War II occupation of China, Lee said.
	   While Taiwan supports such an act of contrition, Lee said
China's Communist rulers have no right to make such a demand
because the Nationalists were China's wartime government and led
the fight against the Japanese.
	   ``We feel Japan should apologize to the Chinese people ... but
we don't feel Japan should apologize to the Chinese Communist
political authority,'' he added.
	   Lee told members of the Taipei Foreign Correspondents Club about
continuing cultural ties between Taiwan and Japan, which ruled the
island as its colony between 1895 and 1945.
	   He also said that China's 1995-96 military exercises aimed at
dampening support for Taiwan independence had led to discussion
about Taiwan's possible inclusion in a regional anti-missile
defense network.
	   China considers Taiwan's inclusion in the proposed Theater
Missile Defense plan involving Japan and the United States as
interference in its domestic affairs.
	   ``China ought to know. If you hadn't committed such provocative
military actions ... then it's likely that Japan and the United
States would still be discussing trade subjects only,'' Lee said.

German government finally starts setting up in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ President Roman Herzog's staff opened its new seat
in Berlin on Monday, the first federal agency to relocate to the
prewar capital in a prelude to the historic, full-scale return of
the government next year.
	   Some 150 staffers for Germany's largely ceremonial head of state
started work in a newly built black oval-shaped building in western
Berlin after closing shop last week in Bonn, the government's home
since the Nazi defeat in World War II.
	   Parliament voted narrowly in 1991 to restore Berlin as united
Germany's capital, after an emotional debate about returning to the
seat of power of the Nazis and the Prussian military state.
	   But wavering over building plans, cost problems, resistance by
bureaucrats and compensation demands by Bonn caused years of delays
in a city marred by 40 years of Cold War division until the Berlin
Wall fell in 1989.
	   Many of the 11,000 federal employees and lawmakers _ including
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder _ will work in temporary quarters when
the country is once again officially run from its biggest
metropolis next September.
	   Schroeder, Germany's first chancellor with no personal memory of
World War II, has given the move new urgency since taking office
last month. He will already hold part of his Cabinet meetings in
Berlin starting next week.
	   To Schroeder, 54, Germany is mature enough not to be dogged by
the past. He has no emotional link to Bonn, a sleepy Rhine River
university town of 300,000 residents on the country's western edge.
	   It doesn't matter that Schroeder's chancellery, near the
refurbished Reichstag parliament building that once abutted the
Berlin Wall, won't be finished until October 2000.
	   In the meantime, he will use a central Berlin building from
which East German communists once ruled.
	   Under the 20 billion mark (dlrs 12 billion) move, some 15,000
government employees will remain in Bonn to help the local economy,
including a large part of the Defense Ministry and Agriculture
Ministry staffs.
	   As Herzog's staff took over their new Berlin building Monday,
employees of the Federal Cartel Office, Germany's antitrust
watchdog, moved into the vacated offices on the Rhine River.

Child actor Vincent Winter dies age 50
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Vincent Winter, who won a special miniature
Academy Award for his beguiling performance as a six-year-old in
``The Little Kidnappers,'' has died at age 50.
	   Winter died of a heart attack on Nov. 2 in St. Peter's Hospital,
Chertsey, near his home at Weybridge, 20 miles (30 kms) from
London, The Guardian newspaper reported.
	   The child actor charmed audiences in the 1953 film _ released in
Britain as ``The Kidnappers'' _ that told the story of two small
boys, orphaned and sent to live with their grandfather in a bleak
area of Nova Scotia at the beginning of the century.
	   The boys wanted a dog, but were denied one by the grandfather.
However, one day, they found a baby in the woods and decided to
keep it secretly as a ``pet.''
	   The Independent, a London newspaper, said in a tribute Monday
that Winter, too young to read when the film was being made, was
taught his lines by verbal repetition. He had such a good memory
that he would say his own lines aloud and then mouth the other
parts.
	   Winter and the other child actor, John Whiteley, were both given
special Oscars for ``outstanding juvenile performances.''
	   Winter was born Dec. 12, 1947 in Aberdeen, Scotland and was age
five when he was discovered by a children's acting coach. While he
found early fame with his role in ``The Little Kidnappers'' and
spent much of his life working in film, Winter never repeated that
level of fame.
	   He acted in the Errol Flynn adventure tale ``The Dark Avenger''
in 1955, and in ``Gorgo'' in 1961. He stared in movies for Disney
such as ``Greyfriars Bobby'' in 1961 and ``Almost Angels'' the
following year.
	   In his teens as good acting roles dried up, Winter studied the
technical side of films. He worked as a production assistant on ``A
Clockwork Orange'' in 1971 and Kenneth Branagh's ``Henry V'' in
1989.
	   Earlier this year, Winter was invited to Hollywood for a group
photograph of former Oscar winners, where he was pleased to
discover that actors Gregory Peck and Dustin Hoffman were admirers
of ``The Kidnappers.''
	   He is survived by his partner of 24 years, Barbara Harley.

Bus carrying American tourists attacked in Iran
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Assailants shouting anti-American slogans
used stones and iron rods to attack a bus carrying U.S. tourists,
the Iran News reported Monday.
	   The attack was believed to have been triggered by reports in
hard-line newspapers accusing the visiting Americans of being U.S.
officials and members of the CIA posing as tourists.
	   The attack happened Saturday morning as the group arrived at the
Esteglal Hotel in northern Tehran where they were staying, the
paper said.
	   Men stopped the bus and broke all of its windows before the
driver sped off to another hotel and called the police, the paper
said.
	   Police escorted the 13 tourists to their hotel, the Iran News
said. Other accounts said some of the Americans suffered minor
injuries and cuts from flying glass.
	   A Muslim extremist group claiming responsibility for the attack
had a slightly different account, saying its members threw stones
at the tourists and injured some as they got off the bus to enter
the hotel, the al-Hayat newspaper reported.
	   The London-based Arabic daily said its office in Tehran received
an anonymous phone call from someone speaking on behalf of the
Fedayeen Islam, or ``Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam,'' claiming
it carried out the attack.
	   ``This is a lesson and a warning to those spies,'' the paper
quoted the caller as saying.
	   The Fedayeen Islam also claimed responsibility Monday in Tehran.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' its statement said, apparently
referring to President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural
exchanges between Americans and Iranians.
	   American tourists have trickled back to Iran since Khatami, who
took office last year, urged informal contacts between the two
countries.
	   The Fedayeen Islam was active before the 1979 Islamic
revolution. It had not been heard of in years until earlier this
month, when it threatened to kill any Americans hostages from the
1979 U.S. Embassy takeover if they ever returned to Iran.
	   The students who stormed the embassy had invited the 52 hostages
to return on the anniversary of the seizure this year. Most of
those who held the embassy are now considered moderates who support
Khatami and his urging of an open society.
	   But a new breed of hard-liners clustered around Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is opposed to any compromise with
the United States.

White doctor appeals prison term in racially charged Zimbabwe case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC;

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ A white anesthesiologist accused of
experimenting on poor blacks appealed a prison sentence Monday
imposed for the deaths of two patients.
	   Lawyers for Dr. Richard McGown said he varied dosages of
morphine injected in the spine to alleviate the pain of patients
undergoing surgery.
	   ``He followed a practice he thought was beneficial,'' attorney
Chris Andersen told the Supreme Court in Harare.
	   McGown, 62, was at the center of a racial storm in 1994 when
lawmakers in the Harare Parliament accused him of experimenting on
black patients and likened him to a ``death camp doctor'' in Nazi
Germany.
	   He was sentenced in 1995 to six months imprisonment for
professional negligence in the death of a 10-year-old black girl
after an appendectomy and a 20-month Asian infant after a
circumcision operation.
	   He was cleared on charges of culpable homicide in the deaths of
three other patients, one of them a white woman, who received
epidural morphine anesthetics.
	   Andersen told the nation's highest court Monday McGown
successfully administered caudal and epidural anesthetics with
morphine to hundreds of patients, including at least 500 children.
	   Breathing complications linked to morphine arose in five cases
where patients died under post-operative care McGown was
responsible for.
	   McGown was charged with causing death through negligence.
Andersen described his prison sentence and the findings of the High
Court judge who sentenced McGown as ``wholly unjustified.''
	   Expert medical witnesses called by the state at his trial failed
to agree on much of the technical evidence but conceded that doses
of morphine McGown administered were sometimes ``just above the
accepted range but not excessive,'' Andersen said.
	   Parliament members in 1994 portrayed McGown as a racist who
deliberately tested the tolerance of blacks to morphine for
research and to win scientific recognition for his work.
	   The case touched off street protests against whites by militant
black students who threatened to attack and mutilate whites unless
McGown received a death sentence.
	   McGown was accused of symbolizing whites who had not shed racist
attitudes long after Zimbabwe, the former British colony of
Rhodesia, became a black-ruled state in 1980.
	   A decision by the appeals court is expected to come in several
weeks.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has guaranteed
the safety of players of Juventus of Turin, who fear they may be
attacked during Wednesday's match in Turkey because of the
country's political tensions with Italy.
	   The Italians are scheduled to play a Champions League match
against Galatasaray in Istanbul. But some Juventus players have
said they would fear for their lives in Turkey, where thousands of
people have taken to the streets over the past week to protest
Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial as a
terrorist.
	   The governing body of European soccer, UEFA, was scheduled to
announce Monday when and where the game would be played.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday. ``We are also considering to ban
demonstrations in Istanbul until the match.''
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned that a ``heavy
hand'' would prevent violence and said the police will not allow
banners bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks
are also banned.
	   Cheerleaders will also be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir said.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with Yeltsin's temperature normal now, him planning to
cancel some meetings this month &QL; 
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin was rushed to hospital with
pneumonia and a high temperature, officials said Monday, the third
health crisis for the Russian president in recent weeks.
	   The 67-year-old president has rarely been seen in public
recently, raising new concerns about his ability to handle his
responsibilities at a time when the Russian economy is in crisis.
	   The Kremlin said Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's
Central Clinical Hospital on Sunday with a temperature of 38.9 C
(102 F). Yeltsin was being treated with antibiotics.
	   Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said Yeltsin's
temperature was normal Monday after treatment. He wouldn't say how
long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital, but added that treatment
for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days, Russian news reports said.
	   In a sign that the president's condition was not critical,
Yeltsin met Monday in the hospital with visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin.
	   Pictures released by the Kremlin showed the two leaders sharing
a joke as they sat in chairs in a reception room, surrounded by
aides. Yeltsin, casually dressed in a sweater, did not look
particularly ill.
	   ``The president was in a good working shape during the
meeting,'' Yakushkin said in remarks, broadcast by Russian
television.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would likely cancel international
meetings set for this month, but will continue to meet Russian
officials at the hospital.
	   Yeltsin was taken ill in October during a state visit to central
Asia with what was described as a respiratory ailment. He was taken
ill again in late October with what doctors described as high blood
pressure and exhaustion.
	   If Yeltsin is incapacitated, power could be turned over
temporarily to Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, a top Kremlin aide
was quoted as saying by the Interfax News Service. Then premier
Viktor Chernomyrdin briefly assumed presidential powers in 1996
when Yeltsin underwent heart surgery.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff, according to the report.
	   Under the Russian Constitution, a prime minister takes over for
three months if the president dies or can't fulfill his duties due
to serious illness.
	   Savyolova added, however, that her remarks were unrelated to the
president's latest illness.
	   Primakov said on Monday the government was working as normal and
he was not assuming any extra powers, Interfax said.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall, but he continues to receive foreign
leaders in Moscow. Last week Yeltsin called off a trip to India.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed on a statement on border demarcation
and discussed bilateral cooperation and international issues, the
Kremlin said.
	   The main outcome of the meeting was the ``similarity of
approaches on virtually all international issues and identity of
positions concerning the prospects of building up close, confident
relations between Russia and China, aimed at strategic interaction
in the 21st century,'' Yeltsin's foreign affairs aide Sergei
Prikhodko said, according to the Interfax.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000.
	   But opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist
politicians have questioned if Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
there has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   ``We wish Mr. Yeltsin recovery,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said in unusually mild remarks at a news conference
Monday. ``But his illness is incurable _ he's an irresponsible
person who is unable to govern the country, and everyone knows
that.''
	   Zyuganov said that in his opinion early elections are
inevitable.
	   The Communist-dominated lower house of parliament, the State
Duma, had been trying to devise legislation to force Yeltsin to
submit to a medical exam to determine whether he was capable of
serving. But the efforts failed earlier this month.
	   The Kremlin has provided little information on the president's
health in recent weeks, releasing tightly-edited TV footage and
photos of Yeltsin, in which he has been seen briefly talking with
ministers and government aides.
	   But Yeltsin had meetings last week with visiting German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and appeared to be in reasonable
condition.
	   Yeltsin's wife, Naina, said recently that the president is
struggling with the very cold weather that has hit Moscow in recent
weeks, but that he was capable of handling his duties.

Report: Attorney general says Suharto could face house arrest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ex-President Suharto could
be placed under house arrest if he attempts to interfere with a new
corruption inquiry against him, a news report said.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Attorney General Muhammad
Ghalib as saying it was possible the former autocrat could be
banned from traveling abroad while the investigation proceeds.
	   On the weekend, Suharto's successor and former protege,
President B.J. Habibie, announced he would appoint a commission of
inquiry to investigate Suharto's wealth.
	   ``If Suharto complicates the investigation, saying that it is
too difficult for him to take part, then the commission could
propose whether or not Suharto be placed under house arrest or
banned from leaving the country,'' Antara quoted Ghalib as saying.
	   Ghalib headed an earlier investigation into graft allegations
against Suharto. However, his efforts were denounced as a whitewash
after he failed to identify any wrongdoing by the ex-head of state.
	   Ghalib said the proposed commission would be independent.
	   The membership and terms of reference of the new inquiry have
not been announced.
	   Some senior members of the ruling Golkar Party, which helped
keep Suharto in power for 32 years, have backed calls for him to be
put under house arrest.
	   ``The purpose is ... if (Suharto) is needed he can be easily
reached,'' Akbar Tanjung, Habibie's state secretary and Golkar
Party chairman, was quoted as saying by the newspaper Indonesian
Observer.
	   Student protesters have called for Suharto to be put on trial
for corruption and human rights abuses during his rule.
	   About 30 protesters marched through an exclusive suburb Monday,
but were blocked by hundreds of troops from approaching the house
where Suharto lives as a virtual recluse.
	   The soldiers stopped them at a park adjacent to the U.S.
ambassador's home.
	   The protest was much smaller than other demonstrations in recent
days during which students called for Suharto to be hanged.
	   Suharto, 77, was forced to quit the presidency in May after a
wave of protests and riots, in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Opponents allege he amassed a fortune and used his power to
enrich his six children and a clique of cronies.
	   Suharto has said he is innocent.
	   On Sunday, former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who
visited Suharto last week, said the former leader was ready to face
any charges laid against him.
	   Meanwhile, one of Suharto's sons was interrogated by the
attorney general's office over corruption allegations Monday.
	   Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra was questioned as part of an
investigation against Beddu Amang, a former chief of a state-run
food distribution organization, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan
reported.
	   It quoted Anton Sujata, a government lawyer, as saying that
Tommy earlier had been banned from leaving the country.
	   Tommy made no comment.
	   Two other Suharto sons, Bambang and Sigit, also have been
questioned over a series of recent bank collapses.

Russia's Chubais calls for union of democratic forces
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ One of Russia's most controversial politicians,
former deputy prime minister Anatoly Chubais, has called for a
union of democratic forces to prevent a Communist return to power,
a news report said Monday.
	   The union ``is needed by the hundreds of thousands who follow
us, who know of the tens of millions who were killed by Communists
in this country, who will not allow a Communist comeback in
Russia,'' Chubais told a meeting of allies on Sunday, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   Many Russian politicians have bemoaned a lack of unity among
Russia's democratic parties and movements, and called for forming a
joint front against hard-liners.
	   But the problem is that Chubais is one of the most hated figures
in the country, and such an appeal coming from him is more likely
to antagonize than unite people.
	   Many Russians think that a state assets privatization program
that Chubais spearheaded impoverished millions while enriching a
few insiders, and blame him for most of the country's woes.
	   Chubais has repeatedly been sacked from President Boris
Yeltsin's government, but made a series of spectacular comebacks.
He now serves as head of energy monopoly Unified Energy Systems.
	   In his speech Sunday, Chubais also took a jab at Communists in
connection with the Friday killing of liberal lawmaker Galina
Starovoitova _ although he did not specifically accuse Communists
of staging the attack.
	   Chubais said that Starovoitova was a hindrance to Communists
``because whatever she was doing was done to prevent that ideology
from winning again.''
	   Starovoitova, 52, a leader of the liberal Russia's Democratic
Choice party, was shot dead by unidentified assailants on the
stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday night.
	   The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar
in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the
country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leaders and
others have been gunned down in recent years in contract killings
that are almost never solved.

Two Saudis executed for rape and murder of teen-age boy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Two Saudi men convicted of raping
and strangling a teen-age boy were beheaded Monday, the official
Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Faris Abdullah al-Shareef and Dasim Fahd al-Subayee were
executed in the Western resort town of Taif, the agency said.
	   The two men were hitchhiking and were given a ride by the young
victim, the agency said. It said they tied him up, put him in the
car trunk and drove off to an isolated place.
	   There they drank alcohol _ which is forbidden under Islam and
banned in Saudi Arabia _ before raping and strangling the young
man, said the agency. They poured kerosene over the victim's corpse
and set it on fire before escaping.
	   The agency did not say when the crime took place.
	   The executions raised to 26 the number of beheadings in the
kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets closed sharply higher
Monday, with the key index in Jakarta surging more than 5 percent
despite deadly ethnic violence in Indonesia. Indonesian shares
closed at a 15-week high as foreign funds continued to flood the
market, dealers said. The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index
rose 21.335 points, or 5.3 percent, closing at 424.987. Thai stock
prices surged Monday in a spillover of foreign buying in bank and
finance stocks from last week, dealers said. The Stock Exchange of
Thailand index gained 18.50 points, or 4.9 percent, to 390.43.
Philippine shares rose 80.57 points, or 4.4 percent, to 1,922.26,
its highest close in six months. Japan's stock exchange and other
financial markets were closed Monday for a national holiday. (ASIAN

	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ It has been a year of low oil prices,
and bets are that OPEC's bad times aren't over yet. As oil
ministers from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
began heading to Vienna for a Wednesday meeting, Algeria's oil
minister Yousef Yousfi went on a four-nation Gulf tour to
brainstorm on how to boost prices, with oil prices hovering around
9 dollars below their group's target of dlrs 21 a barrel. OPEC has
a ``price crisis'' on its hands, Yousfi said Saturday in Kuwait,
his first stop. Also on Yousfi's initerary were Qatar, Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates, all OPEC members. (OPEC)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's new Social Democratic Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine made his European Union debut Monday
seeking support for a new left-leaning agenda that shifts the EU's
focus from containing inflation to promoting growth and jobs. On
the eve of the monthly EU gathering, Lafontaine dined with the 10
other ministers from socialist-led governments who set out plans
for enhanced policy cooperation to encourage growth after the
launch of the euro as a shared EU currency on Jan. 1. But after the
pledge of unity in the socialist's ``New European Way,'' ministers
confronted divisive issues, including who should represent the
euro-zone internationally, how to coordinate EU taxation and how to
share out the dlrs 100 billion budget among the 15 EU nations.
(EU-FINANCE)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The euro can replace the French franc
as the anchor for the common currency used by 15 nations in central
and west Africa, European Union officials confirmed Monday. ``The
question has been definitively resolved,'' said EU Finance
Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. ``The arrival of the euro
will change nothing for the Africans.'' The decision, which
confirms a July provisional ruling, should calm African fears that
replacement of the French franc by the EU's single currency on Jan.
1, would undermine their monetary stability. Under the agreement,
the French Treasury will defend a fixed parity between the euro and
the African nations' CFA franc in the same way as it now backs the
rate of 100 CFA francs to the French franc. (EU-EUROPE-AFRICA)
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ In a vote of confidence that Thailand's
troubled economy is poised for a turnaround, a Japanese official
said Monday his country will guarantee dlrs 500 million in Thai
public sector bonds. ``We believe the Thai economy has bottomed
out,'' Hideo Hato, an official at the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry. ``We believe in the stability of the baht.''
Hato spoke to Dow Jones Newswires in Bangkok on the sidelines of a
conference between the Japanese ministry and economic ministers of
the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. The guarantees will be
in addition to any assistance offered under Japan's dlrs 30 billion
regional assistance fund, Hato said. They will apply to bonds
issued by state enterprises, or possibly government bonds, as
determined by the Thai government. (THAILAND-JAPAN-ECONOMY)

Death toll in Indonesia's ethnic, religious violence rises to 14

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with death toll rising to 14, eight bodies found

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rescue workers on Monday pulled eight
bodies from a gutted gambling parlor that was burned by Muslim
mobs, raising the death toll to 14 from ethnic and religious
violence.
	   Many Christian schools, meanwhile, were closed after riots
Sunday in which mobs of Muslim youths set fire to churches and
attacked Christians. Soldiers patrolled riot-hit areas in north
Jakarta, but there were no fresh reports of unrest.
	   Security forces detained 179 people during the riots, said Brig.
Gen. Togar Sianipar, a national police spokesmen.
	   The eight newly discovered victims burned to death or died of
smoke inhalation, said Edward Bachtiar, an official of the
Indonesian Red Cross.
	   Two were members of the ethnic Chinese minority, which is often
targeted during social strife, partly because it dominates trade
and commerce. Also, most Chinese in overwhelmingly Muslim Indonesia
are Christian or Buddhist.
	   President B.J. Habibie, who is at the center of student protests
for not planning wider changes to Indonesia's political system,
blamed unidentified agitators and urged restraint.
	   ``I call on the people not to be easily provoked to take actions
to serve the purpose of a certain group that wants to disintegrate
the nation,'' Habibie said.
	   Without elaborating, a prominent Muslim leader said that thugs
had carefully planned the riots, the official Antara news agency
reported.
	   Abdurrahman Wahid, head of the country's largest Islamic group,
Nadhlatul Ulama, and opposition leader Megawati Sukarnoputri
condemned the violence.
	   ``We have to be careful with cruel actions made under a
religious pretext,'' they said in a statement.
	   The weekend violence came amid Indonesia's worst economic crisis
in 30 years. Millions of people now live in poverty as inflation
and unemployment rates soar.
	   ``If there is a riot every day, economic restoration will slow
down,'' Habibie said. ``Eliminate the feeling of prejudice.''
	   Habibie has been under pressure to speed up his reform program
following the resignation in May of former authoritarian leader
Suharto. Opponents say Habibie, once a protege of Suharto, is not
serious about introducing real democracy.
	   The Sunday riots broke out a little more than a week after
deadly clashes between students and security personnel also
triggered rioting. As many as 17 people died in the earlier
clashes. The last died Sunday at a hospital.
	   Hundreds of anti-government students boycotted classes Monday at
Atma Jaya Catholic University, which reopened for the first time
since at least half a dozen students were fatally shot in fighting
around the campus Nov. 13.
	   Elsewhere, about 100 students staged two peaceful protests
against the government.
	   Dozens were reported injured in Sunday's clashes between the
Muslim majority and Christians originally from the eastern city of
Ambon.
	   Troops desperate to restore order fired shots and volleys of
tear gas to break up rock-throwing crowds that officials said had
burned four churches and ransacked seven others.
	   The government, which is short of cash because of the economic
turmoil, pledged to help rebuild the damaged buildings.
	   Muslim residents who disapprove of gambling burned the betting
parlor, where Ambonese were working as guards, and said their
attacks were retaliation after rumors that the Ambonese had
attacked mosques.
	   ``We feel very sad because we're still far from the hope of
solidarity between religious communities,'' said Father Roy
Djakarya of the Jakarta Roman Catholic Archdiocese. ``Why do we so
easily judge rumors without thinking about the truth behind them?''
	   On Sunday, the Indonesian Red Cross recovered six bodies,
including five Ambonese who had been slashed with knives and broken
bottles.
	   About 90 percent of Indonesia's 202 million people are Muslim,
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. However,
religious tolerance is enshrined in the national philosophy.

Former Yeltsin spokesman gets Moscow city job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin's former spokesman, fired for
promoting Moscow's mayor as a candidate for prime minister, has
been given a top job in the Moscow city government, officials said
Monday.
	   Sergei Yastrzhembsky was abruptly fired in mid-September after
the prime minister's job went instead to Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has signed an order appointing
Yastrzhembsky deputy prime minister of the city government in
charge of public relations and regional and international affairs,
the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Russian media have said that the slick former diplomat would be
brought into the Moscow government to promote Luzhkov in his likely
presidential bid in the 2000 election.
	   Yastrzhembsky will start in his new post on Tuesday, Interfax
said.
	   Yastrzhembsky was widely credited with giving a smooth,
professional face to the Kremlin press service and frequently
rescuing Yeltsin from his own words and actions.
	   A former ambassador to Slovakia and Foreign Ministry spokesman,
Yastrzhembsky, 44, was appointed Yeltsin's top spokesman in August
1996.
	   He was at Yeltsin's side almost continually, and was frequently
called on to explain the president's sometimes erratic behavior and
incongruous remarks.
	   Luzhkov, a powerful and popular man in Moscow, which he has
turned into Russia's only boomtown, is a potential top choice in
the 2000 presidential election. But it remains unclear how much
support he can muster in the impoverished provinces, which resent
Moscow's wealth.

Norwegian fishermen ends up with whale of a tale
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ When Oivind Arntzen boasts to other sports
fisherman about the one that got away, it'll be a whale of a tale.
	   The pensioner was fishing for herring in northern Norway's
Vestjorden this weekend when he ended up with a killer whale on his
line, the Nordlandposten newspaper reported Monday. He claimed the
killer whale was longer than his 8.3-meter (27-foot) boat.
	   ``It must have bitten the line, or got tangled up in some other
way, because he wasn't on the hook,'' Arntzen was quoted a saying.
	   Even if he had wanted to land the giant catch _ which he didn't
_ Arntzen knew his light fishing line wouldn't hold the killer
whale, which could have weighed several tons. He just reeled in
line to save as much tackle as he could before the killer whale
broke it and swam away unharmed.

Vatican missionary service: Indonesia attacks stem from ethnic,
</HEADLINE>
economic motives too &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ Envy and prejudice _ not just religious
strife _ spurred Muslim mobs in the weekend's fiery attacks on
Christians and Christian churches in Indonesia, the Vatican
missionary news service Fides said Monday.
	   Muslim attackers killed at least 13 people and burned churches
Sunday in Jakarta. Many of the churches were Catholic.
	   ``The major part of the mass media has deemed the conflict
religious in nature, ignoring key ethnic and economic influences,''
Fides said in a statement.
	   It noted many of the victims were from the island of Ambon,
``notoriously envied'' by Indonesians.
	   Other attacks were in neighborhoods of ethnic Chinese, ``where
the difference between the wealth of the ethnic Chinese and the
misery of the natives is much feared and felt.''
	   Indonesia is struggling with its worst economic problems in 30
years. Ethnic Chinese _ overwhelmingly Christian or Buddhist _
dominate trade and commerce there, making them the top targets
during social strife.
	   Fides noted that Indonesian Cardinal Julius Darmaatmadja had
joined other local religious leaders _ Muslim, Protestant,
Buddhist, Orthodox and Hindu _ in appealing for national
reconciliation on Sept. 20.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Commuters in France, Belgium and Greece were caught
up in maddening traffic jams or crammed into subways on Monday,
victims of a massive rail strike called by unions protesting
proposed deregulation.
	   However, the strike called in six countries seriously hit only
three, crippling train services and forcing commuters to find
another way to work.
	   Rail unions, fearing job losses, called the strike in France,
Belgium, Spain, Portugal, Greece and Luxembourg to protest European
Union plans to deregulate the sector to boost competition and
efficiency.
	   But in Spain and Luxembourg, effects were minimal. In Portugal,
rail workers were due to stage a one-hour stoppage just before
evening rush hour.
	   France's national train company, the SNCF, said about one in
three trains was running nationwide Monday. Suburban trains were
also severely disrupted, with just one in four operating on some
lines.
	   ``I'm fed up with this. There seem to be strikes every week,''
said 31-year-old lawyer Stephanie Castela, her face pressed against
a window of the Paris Metro during morning rush hour.
	   ``There are some things you have to be able to guarantee, and
getting to work is one of them.''
	   In France, only Eurostar trains to London were running normally.
Buses replaced Thalys trains from Paris to Brussels, Amsterdam and
Cologne. Only two out of 20 trains were scheduled to run between
London and Brussels.
	   In Belgium, train traffic also was crippled, transforming
morning rush hour in major cities into a slow crawl. Traffic jams
of up to 40-kilometer (25 mile) were reported outside Brussels on
the busy highway from Ghent.
	   In Greece, there were no trains at all, and workers marched to
the Transport Ministry in Athens.
	   Elsewhere, unions were expected to hand out leaflets to
commuters in Germany, Britain, Austria and the Netherlands.
	   Workers are protesting plans for more deregulation of the
sector. The European Union executive Commission plans to increase
liberalization in the freight sector from 5 percent to 25 percent.
	   EU Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock said in a statement
Monday that the percentage of overall freight transport by rail had
declined from 32 percent in 1970 to just 14 percent in 1996. He
said inefficiency had resulted in major job losses.
	   ``On those trends the future is plain and very bleak. Without
change there will be no rail transport in much of the Union by
2012,'' he said.

Myanmar opposition leader says party strong despite resignations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS remarks about the economy; edits thruout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit
out at the government Monday, saying recent mass resignations from
her National League for Democracy had been coerced but that party
members' spirits remained strong.
	   ``The greater the repression, the greater the support for our
movement,'' said Suu Kyi, looking confident and relaxed.
	   Suu Kyi also accused the government of doing little to ease
economic hardship and said the introduction of a new
high-denomination banknote could fuel inflation.
	   Suu Kyi spoke at a news briefing at her party's Yangon chapter
headquarters a day after the government claimed that hundreds of
NLD members recently quit the party of their own free will.
	   Government spokesman Lt. Col. Hla Min said Sunday the grassroots
members of Suu Kyi's party were frustrated with ``the NLD
leadership's policy of confrontation and divisiveness.'' He said 12
local offices, comprising 1,259 people, had voluntarily dissolved
themselves.
	   The government also reported that of 851 party members detained
in official ``guest houses'' _ including several members-elect of
Parliament _ 384 had returned home. A few have been held more than
four months.
	   ``We want to make clear that all these resignations were made
under coercion,'' Suu Kyi said at her briefing. ``We are heartened
by the spirit of the great majority of the NLD members. ... The
great majority of our members remained staunch and have not been
shaken in their resolve.''
	   Asked if the mass resignations of members could paralyze her
party, Suu Kyi replied: ``The NLD will stand as it always stands _
fighting fit.''
	   Suu Kyi said the economy of Myanmar _ also known as Burma _ is
``terrible and inflation is getting out of hand.''
	   After it was announced last week that a 1,000-kyat banknote
would be put into circulation on Nov. 25, ``prices absolutely went
up, so we are waiting for another spiral of inflation,'' she said.
	   The new notes, which will be the highest denomination issued,
will be worth about dlrs 160 at the official rate of exchange, but
only about dlrs 3.10 on the free market.
	   ``The economy is deteriorating by the day and the authorities
are doing nothing effective to stop this deterioration,'' said Suu
Kyi.
	   The government has frequently blamed Suu Kyi for discouraging
foreign investment and aid for the military regime.
	   Suu Kyi, winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, has been locked
in a battle of wills with the ruling council of generals over
demands that a Parliament elected in 1990 be convened. The NLD won
the elections, but the military never allowed Parliament to meet.
	   In September, Suu Kyi and her allies began meeting in a
10-member committee to serve in place of a Parliament.
	   Responding to the government's assertion that the NLD's call for
convening Parliament has derailed a possible dialogue with the
opposition, Suu Kyi said, ``The door is always open for a dialogue,
but we are not going to call off or back down from our decision to
convene a Parliament.''
	   By doing so, she added, ``we will be opening ourselves up to all
kinds of repression.''

Corruption probes opposed as new political pacts tested
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Yilmaz also cleared. Will be
led by 1300 GMT with confidence motion debate opening &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ In a sign of shifting political alliances,
parliamentary committees Monday opposed moving ahead with
corruption probes into Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz and one of his
longtime political rivals.
	   The recommendations to halt the investigations into Yilmaz and
former Prime Minister Tansu Ciller showed the new political pacts
being tested before Wednesday's confidence vote, which is expected
to bring down Yilmaz' government.
	   Analysts believe Yilmaz could seek a governing coalition with
his former arch-rival, Ciller's True Path Party, if he loses the
confidence vote.
	   Yilmaz' Motherland Party supported Mrs. Ciller in the 12-2 vote,
although Motherland had originally asked for the probe into
accusations that Mrs. Ciller's illegally amassed a fortune from
bank deals.
	   Similarly, Ciller's party did an about-face and joined in the
10-5 vote against advancing a probe into the financial dealings of
Yilmaz, who critics claim has ties to organized crime.
	   Parliament is likely to follow the decisions by the two
committees. A negative vote would have stripped them of immunity
from prosecution.
	   The government opposition has accused Yilmaz of ties to
organized crime and tampering with the privatization of a state
bank. Parliament was expected to open debate on the confidence
motion later Monday.
	   Mrs. Ciller has survived several similar probes into her
accumulation of wealth. Detractors alleged the bulk of the family's
wealth came from illegal bank dealings conducted by her husband,
who ran a private bank that collapsed.
	   Mrs. Ciller claims she built up their fortune from several
hundred thousand dollars inherited from her family.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Rina Taufan peers fearfully through
the steel gates that barricade her store in Jakarta's Chinatown
where mobs ran riot, burned churches and businesses and killed at
least 14 people.
	   ``I heard that they are not satisfied yet,'' the 38-year-old
Chinese immigrant said Monday. ``If they come back, I will be here
too. If they burn next door, I will be dead.''
	   Next door is a gambling house she says has the same owner as one
that was the first target of Sunday's violence. Muslim mobs set
fire to the building and a neighboring Protestant church. They
hacked and beat to death Christian guards from the eastern
Indonesian island of Ambon. More burned to death inside.
	   The violence triggered a rioting spree and attacks on other
Christian churches, a Catholic school and Chinese businesses in the
district, one of the most violent-prone in Indonesia's capital.
	   Standing amid the rubble of his gutted and still-smoking church,
Pastor Johannes Linandi said he was forced to flee when the mob
struck. Luckily, the attack occurred between routine Sunday
services, and only a handful of people were inside.
	   ``They hit me with their fists and with a piece of wood as I ran
out. They had knives but I ran down a street,'' Linandi said.
	   About 90 percent of the parishioners are members of the ethnic
Chinese minority. He said rioters chased the Ambonese guards into
the church and brought in cans of gasoline to start the fire.
	   On Monday, the gruesome search for bodies began as crowds
watched.
	   ``This will fracture relations between religious communities,''
said Suroto, a Muslim construction worker.
	   Observers say Sunday's violence could unleash deep-seated ethnic
and religious divisions that are products of Indonesian history and
have been heightened by the worst economic crisis and political
turmoil in 30 years.
	   ``The Chinese minority are always targeted during times of
unrest,'' said Dede Oetomo, anthropology and linguistics professor
at Airlangga University in Surabaya, Indonesia's second biggest
city.
	   Ethnic Chinese make up just 4 percent of Indonesia's population
of 202 million. But they play a dominant role in the economy, and
this has long invited resentment that has often spilled into
violence.
	   Chinese immigrants were segregated from the indigenous
population under former Dutch colonial rule. Since that time, they
have been regarded as outsiders.
	   Many Chinese were killed in a bloody backlash over an abortive
communist coup in 1965.
	   They continued to stay apart from other Indonesians during the
32-year rule of autocratic ex-President Suharto, said Dede.
	   When student protests and riots helped oust Suharto in May,
thousands of Chinese shops and homes in Jakarta were attacked.
Women's groups say as many as 168 women, most of them Chinese, were
raped.
	   Adding to ethnic tensions are religious ones. Up to 90 percent
of Indonesia's population is Muslim, making it the world's most
populous Islamic nation.
	   The remainder are a mix of Christian denominations and Buddhism.
	   During Sunday's violence, several stores in Chinatown were
burned. Witnesses said ethnic Chinese residents armed themselves
with sticks and knives to protect their homes and stores.
	   As rumors of reprisals circulated, people carrying curved swords
and sticks set up makeshift barricades in streets around Muslim
residences, local television showed.
	   Rina, whose husband Johnny Aziz is Muslim, said the peace that
normally exists between Muslim Indonesians and Chinese Christians
is a fragile facade.
	   ``Even though my husband is a Muslim, I can feel the hatred in
the air,'' she said. The couple, who met as college students in the
United States, are considering emigrating to neighboring Australia
to escape the violence.
	   Rioters use religion as an excuse to unleash violence against
Chinese, she said.
	   ``Most Chinese are Christian and they hate Chinese. When they
think of Christians, they think of Chinese.''
	   She said the Chinese were powerless. Police and the military
sided with the Muslims, she added.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Siazon saying Canada also appealing to
Philippines to repeal the death penalty, grafs 3-4 &QL; 
 &UR; By JIM GOMEZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The European Union, the Vatican and
Canada have urged the Philippines to cancel its first execution in
22 years and repeal the death penalty, Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said Monday.
	   The scheduled execution of Leo Echegaray, convicted of
repeatedly raping his 10-year-old stepdaughter, has triggered a
debate over the death penalty that has divided many Filipinos.
	   Siazon said the European Union, the Vatican and Canada recently
sent messages urging the government to abolish capital punishment,
arguing it would not reduce widespread crime.
	   Siazon said he will meet the ambassadors of Canada and the
European Union this week to discuss the issue.
	   President Joseph Estrada has been informed of the appeals but is
unlikely to change his earlier decision not to pardon Echegaray,
Siazon said. ``We have our national laws. We have to follow the
law,'' he told reporters.
	   Estrada said Echegaray's execution would deter similar crimes.
	   Last week, Judge Thelma Ponferrada of the Quezon City Regional
Trial Court issued an order to National Prisons Director Pedro
Sistoza to execute Echegaray. Ponferrada fixed an execution date
but ordered Sistoza not to reveal it publicly.
	   Justice Secretary Serafin Cuevas said Sistoza has informed him
that the execution may take place next year. He said he would
petition the Supreme Court to order Ponferrada to reveal the
execution date to the public.
	   Sources at the justice department say the earliest date that
could be set for the execution is Dec. 16, when all legal
requirements, including the publication of revised execution rules,
would be completed. However, an execution is unlikely during the
Christmas season, forcing officials to postpone it until January.
	   Echegaray is the first among more than 800 death-row inmates to
be scheduled for execution. More than 450 of those on death row
were convicted of rape, including 159 who abused their own children
or other relatives.
	   Under current government rules, Echegaray would be informed of
his impending execution only after sunrise on execution day.
Lawyers have appealed to Ponferrada to inform Echegaray of the
execution date so he could prepare for it but the judge turned down
the request.
	   Prison chaplain Roberto Olaguer said Echegaray has accepted his
fate but is requesting that Philippine officials allow him to marry
a longtime girlfriend before he is put to death. The woman is
different from the common-law wife with whom he has five children,
including the stepdaughter he was convicted of raping.
	   Cuevas said the request probably would be rejected because it is
one of the civil rights Echegaray lost because of his conviction.
	   Between 1924 and 1976, the Philippines executed 84 people.
	   In 1987, a new constitution abolished the death penalty but gave
Congress the option of restoring it for heinous crimes such as
murder, kidnapping for ransom, rape and drug trafficking.
	   Legislators, alarmed by a rise in crime, took that option,
bringing back the death penalty in 1994.
	   Many Filipinos say the death penalty will deter crime, and that
crime remains rampant because no one has been executed.
	   Roman Catholic bishops and other civic groups opposed to the
death penalty say there is no proof of that, and that poor people
are more likely to be sentenced to death because they cannot afford
good lawyers.

Jordan-Syria monitor Yarmouk River waters
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Syria agreed to set up an
early-warning system to monitor the quality of Yarmouk River water
flowing into Jordan, a Jordanian official said Monday.
	   Dureid Mahasneh, secretary-general of the Jordan Valley
Authority, told a news conference the two sides had signed a memo
after two days of talks on the river by a Jordanian-Syrian
committee.
	   He said Syria agreed to set up several stations to monitor the
river's water from its springs in Syria and would report weekly on
quality. Jordan has complained the Yarmouk water had become tainted
by waste water leakage into tributaries in Syria.
	   The two-day meeting ended Sunday, when it was announced the two
side agreed to revive plans to build a 152 million dinar (drls 214
million) dam on the Yarmouk near their border by 2003.
	   Jordan also plans a 50 million dinar (dlrs 70 million) waste
water treatment plant near the border, Mahasneh said.
	   Syria also agreed to Jordan's demands for its full share of
water from the river, about 220 million cubic meters yearly, under
past agreements, he said. Jordan has been getting 135 million cubic
meters annually from the Yarmouk.

Bundesbank chief doesn't rule out rate cut next month
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ Germany's central bank chief on Monday
left open the possibility of lowering interest rates before the end
of the year.
	   Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said the decision would
depend on the European Central Bank's analysis of the economic
situation at a Dec. 1 meeting.
	   ``Then we will see if that still has any meaning for our last
two meetings or not,'' Tietmeyer said on Inforadio
Berlin-Brandenburg.
	   The European Central Bank takes over interest rate policy Jan. 1
for 11 countries, including Germany, that are introducing a single
European currency, the euro.
	   The Bundesbank council still meets Dec. 3 and Dec. 17 before
handing over monetary policy to the ECB.
	   The staunchly independent Bundesbank has rebuffed calls by
Germany's new center-left finance minister, Oskar Lafontaine, to
lower rates to spur the economy and create jobs.
	   Analysts don't expect any Bundesbank initiative before the
switch to the euro.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union farm ministers were
expected Monday to lift a worldwide export ban on the vast majority
of British beef, a milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has
pitted Britain against its EU allies for almost three years.
	   ``The time is right,'' said EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler
ahead of Monday's EU farm ministers meeting which was set to scrap
the ban on deboned beef despite continued opposition from at least
Germany and Austria.
	   The decision will come a long way in ending the ``mad cow''
crisis for British farmers, who were badly hit by the ban imposed
in March 1996. Estimated losses because of the ban amount to over 2
billion pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion). The crisis undermined confidence
in beef throughout the 15 member nations.
	   Monday's expected decision ``will tend to boost the confidence
of the British consumer and presumably other consumers throughout
the EU and our beef trade and our beef producers will get back to
normal,'' said Dr. John Mann, superintendent of Smithfield Market,
Britain's largest meat market.
	   The move to significantly ease the ban was boosted early this
month at a meeting of veterinary experts when eight EU countries
endorsed the beef export plan, against five opposition votes and
two abstention.
	   ``We have a positive advise from the scientists that this
British beef is safe,'' said Fischler. Exports of British beef were
banned in March 1996 after Britain announced a possible link
between ``mad cow'' disease in British beef and a fatal brain
ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Monday's expected decision will be immediately followed by a
campaign to put British beef back on the plates of consumers
throughout the 15-nation EU. Beef exports though will need a final
stamp of approval after another EU inspection round, opening the
way for exports early in the new year.
	   ``We will get the decision we want. We have done what we were
asked to do and can justify Britain's position on the basis of
science and the technical implementation,'' said British Farm
Minister Nick Brown.
	   British government cooperation didn't always come that easy.
	   In the wake of the March 1996 ban, the Conservative government
of Prime Minister John Major tried to get the ban lifted and
threatened a confrontational policy of non-cooperation with the EU.
The Conservative farm minister even refused to heed the call of the
European Parliament to discuss the issue.
	   Relations with Brussels improved considerably when Tony Blair
became Prime Minister in May 1997. EU Farm Minister approved a
resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland in March.
	   Ahead of the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of beef,
totaling some dlrs 1 billion, in 1995.
	   Now British exporters face the task of reclaiming lost markets.
	   ``It will take some time, perhaps a couple of years and then
we'll be back to our normal export trade levels,'' said Mann.

<TEXT>
	   ST.PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A badly wounded aide to a murdered
lawmaker regained consciousness Monday and was talking to police,
who later arrested several suspects in raids around the city,
officials said.
	   Galina Starovoitova, 52, a leader of the liberal Russia's
Democratic Choice party, was shot dead by unidentified assailants
on the stairs of her apartment building in St. Petersburg on Friday
night.
	   The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar
in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the
country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leaders and
others have been gunned down in recent years in contract killings
that are almost never solved.
	   The lawmaker's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, was in a
``clear'' mind Monday, testifying to investigators, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported. Special police armed with assault rifles were
standing guard at the door of his hospital room.
	   Acting on information from the aide, police carried out raids
and rounded up several suspects, officials said. There were no
further details.
	   Linkov was critically wounded in the head during the attack and
later rushed to a hospital where he underwent surgery during the
weekend.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said that Starovoitova had
received threats, the Interfax news agency reported on Monday. He
didn't elaborate.
	   The Federal Security Service (FSB) said that officials were
looking into a ``Moscow trail'' in Starovoitova's killing. The
attackers appeared to know the exact time of her arrival in St.
Petersburg from Moscow late on Friday, FSB spokesman Sergei
Bogdanov said, according to the Interfax.
	   Liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete evidence _ that
Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the lower house of
parliament, were the most likely culprits.
	   Over the weekend, Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin even had to
call a news conference to say there was no evidence that the
Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov, was involved in
the killing.
	   Seleznyov responded in kind on Monday, suggesting that the
``extremists from democratic organizations'' might have staged the
murder in order to win local elections set for Dec. 6, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The speaker also threatened to file a libel suit against a St.
Petersburg newspaper, which Starovoitova edited. The newspaper
recently accused Seleznyov of setting up an illegal fund to finance
a presidential bid and other shady activities.
	   Seleznyov, who has said he might run for president in 2000,
denied the newspaper's allegations on Friday, calling them an
``outright slander.''
	   Starovoitova's murder had all the traits of a contract murder,
an increasingly common crime in Russia.
	   Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Monday used Starovoitova's
killing as an occasion to lambast the government for its inability
to contain soaring crime. ``That's a result of the (government's)
catastrophic policy aimed at the destruction of the state and the
nation,'' he said.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov held a meeting with senior
law-enforcement officials on Monday to discuss Starovoitova's
killing and the situation in the country.
	   He singled out the murder, along with a recent scandal caused by
anti-Semitic statements from a Communist lawmaker, as examples of
Russia drifting ``on the path to fascism.''
	   ``That must be stopped at any price,'' he was quoted by the
Russian news agencies as saying.
	   Primakov added, however, that the government wasn't going to
introduce a state of emergency. ``We will not be taking any steps
that may further rock the society and lead to the dictatorial
trends in the government,'' he said.
	   Starovoitova, of the reformist party Democratic Russia, tried to
run for president in 1996 but her registration was turned down for
technical reasons. She had said she would run again in 2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide on ethnic issues in
1991-92 _ the only woman in his immediate circle _ and later joined
the Russian parliament as one of the most vocal defenders of
liberal reforms.
	   Yeltsin called Starovoitova a ``comrade'' and said he would
personally monitor the investigation into her killing.

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's top two political parties
sealed a deal Monday that will place Prime Minister-elect Hun Sen
and his Cambodian People's Party in firm control of a coalition
government.
	   Bitter enemies just a few months ago, Hun Sen and coalition
partner Prince Norodom Ranariddh joked and laughed as they signed
agreements of cooperation and toasted the new government with
champagne, along with senior members of both parties.
	   The jovial atmosphere gave no hint of the two sides' armed
confrontation last year when Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as his
co-prime minister in a violent coup. But afterward Hun Sen spoke of
the two leaders' past problems as government partners.
	   ``We must continue in a coalition in the interests of the
nation,'' he told reporters. ``Like it or not, we must be together
to build the country. We can avoid Pol Pot, but Hun Sen cannot
avoid Ranariddh, nor can Ranariddh avoid Hun Sen and (CPP
President) Chea Sim.''
	   After meeting for more than an hour, Hun Sen and Ranariddh
signed a joint political platform and a division of Cabinet posts
that will give Hun Sen and the CPP tight control of fiscal and
administrative functions.
	   The ministries of finance, industry, commerce, planning,
agriculture, public works and foreign affairs will all be
controlled by the CPP, according to a list obtained Monday.
	   FUNCINPEC politicians will head the ministries of justice,
tourism, information, health, rural development and education.
	   The list showed Hun Sen's party controlling 12 ministries and
Ranariddh's party controlling 11, with the two sides sharing the
defense and interior portfolios with co-ministers.
	   Lu Laysreng, a senior official in Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party,
confirmed the key postings after the meeting.
	   Hun Sen said he would present the new government to the National
Assembly for approval on Nov. 30, a few days after the legislature
convenes its first session Wednesday to select its leaders.
	   ``Today we laid quite a strong foundation,'' he said. ``The main
issue that remains is joint activities to allow the government to
be formed.''
	   With the CPP and FUNCINPEC controlling a combined 107 seats in
the 122-seat National Assembly, raising the two-thirds vote in
parliament needed to approve the government should not be
difficult.
	   After more than three months of political deadlock following the
CPP's narrow victory in July parliamentary elections, Hun Sen and
Ranariddh met Nov. 13 at a summit and agreed to form a coalition
government.
	   The deal will make Hun Sen sole prime minister and Ranariddh
president of the National Assembly. Key to the agreement was the
formation of a new Senate in parliament to be led by Chea Sim, the
outgoing head of the assembly.
	   A new government is expected to see a return of the foreign aid
and investment that was sharply curtailed after last year's coup.
	   A legitimate government should also allow Cambodia to reclaim
its seat at the U.N. General Assembly _ under dispute since the
coup _ and make the nation eligible for entry into the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations.
	   ``All domestic and external affairs require a new government,''
Hun Sen told reporters earlier Monday. ``The living standards of
the people and Cambodia's role in the international arena require a
new government to serve in all fields.''
	   Hun Sen will apparently present his Cabinet to a full National
Assembly. Lawmakers from the opposition party led by former Finance
Minister Sam Rainsy are to return to Cambodia Tuesday to
participate in parliament.
	   Sam Rainsy and his party's 14 other members of parliament have
remained outside the country since September because of security
concerns. Hun Sen threatened to arrest Sam Rainsy after the
opposition organized massive demonstrations protesting the CPP's
electoral victory.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's under-21 national team beat its Argentine
counterpart 1-0 Monday in a friendly match marking the 100th
anniversary of the two nations' diplomatic relations.
	   Playing before 48,000 spectators at the national stadium,
Shunsuke Nakamura, 20, scored the only goal in the 42nd minute.
	   Nakamura received a pass from Junichi Inamoto, 19, who tried to
break into the Argentine defense line, and sent a looping shot over
Argentine goalkeeper Albano Bizzarri's head into the net.
	   All the players are under the age of 21.
	   Argentina outshot Japan 11-7. Argentina's Juan Serrizuela and
Luciano Galletti each took three shots.

Two Iraqi opposition groups reject London meeting
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Two Iraqi opposition groups Monday
accused Britain and the United States of interfering in Iraq's
internal affairs and criticized a meeting of opposition groups in
London sponsored by Britain.
	   ``We don't accept anyone interfering in such a manner in Iraqi
internal affairs whether by Britain or the United States,'' said a
spokesman of the Syria-based Iraqi Communist party.
	   British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said the meeting
of 16 Iraqi opposition groups was a step in preparing a united
front in case President Saddam Hussein's regime comes to an end.
	   The Iraqi Communist spokesman, who asked to remain anonymous for
his safety, said toppling the Iraqi regime is the responsibility of
the Iraqi people alone.
	   Fadel Ansari, a former senior member of Saddam's Baath Party who
leads a splinter pro-Syrian group in Damascus, said foreign
intervention ``strengthens the regime and does not weaken it.''
	   The Iraqi opposition groups have often quarreled, but British
officials said they would focus on finding common ground among
them.

Tiger Woods arrives for his first tournament on Japan PGA Tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   IBUSUKI, Japan (AP) _ American golfer Tiger Woods arrived Monday
for a Japanese tournament that is fast selling out because of his
popularity.
	   ``People are buying the tickets, saying, `I don't know golf, but
I know Tiger Woods,''' said Tokikazu Niiro, an official of the
Ibusuki Golf Club, site of the 150 million yen (dlrs 1.25 million)
Casio World Open starting Thursday.
	   This is Woods' first tournament on the Japan PGA Tour, although
he played in Japan last year in an exhibition event.
	   Niiro said all 7,000 four-day tickets for the tournament are
sold out.
	   An additional 8,000 tickets for each day are being sold, he
said.
	   A four-day ticket costs 10,000 yen (dlrs 83) and a one-day
ticket 5,000 yen (dlrs 42) for the first two days and 7,000 yen
(dlrs 58) for the last two days.
	   Saburo Tateishi, a spokesman for the tournament, said the
22-year-old Woods arrived at his hotel by helicopter after flying
into Kagoshima Airport in southwestern Japan.
	   Tateishi quoted Woods as saying that ``since my mother is from
Thailand, I feel that Japan is very close to me.''
	   A field of 90 players will compete for a first prize of 27
million yen (dlrs 225,000) on the 7,105-yard, par-72 Ibusuki Golf
Club Kaimon course in Ibusuki, 985 kilometers (616 miles) southwest
of Tokyo.
	   In his first Japan visit, a year ago, Tiger Woods played with
four Japanese in a dlrs 600,000 skins match.

Albania opposition calls for street protests against referendum
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADAM BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's fiery opposition leader on
Monday urged supporters to ``fill the streets of Tirana'' on Monday
to protest the government's apparent victory in persuading voters
to back a Western-style constitution.
	   The call of Sali Berisha, a key figure both in September rioting
in the capital and prolonged unrest last year, raised fears of
renewed violence.
	   On Monday, dozens of police vehicles filled downtown Skanderbeg
Square _ the scene of rioting and gunfire after the September
assassination of Azem Hajdari, a prominent member of Berisha's
Democratic Party.
	   His voice at a near scream, Berisha accused the government of
voting fraud and intimidation in Sunday's referendum meant to give
Europe's poorest nation its first post-communist Constitution.
	   ``I call on everybody in Tirana to take to the streets in self
defense,'' Berisha said.
	   The Constitution is meant to give citizens the right to legally
change their religion and to identify themselves as members of an
ethnic minority. Opposition leaders call these clauses
``anti-Albanian'' and predict many people will turn away from
Islam, the dominant religion, to avoid discrimination while working
in richer, non-Muslim neighbors such as Greece.
	   The constitution also defines property rights and lets the
government expropriate land deemed of national interest. Critics
say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   On his way out of a hotel, Berisha ran into members of the
European Parliament who observed the vote. ``The government
violated the process, and the people will go out on the streets and
show them that is very serious,'' Berisha shouted at them.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which oversaw the balloting, said the referendum was
relatively incident-free and voter turnout was higher than expected
consider a steady rain and a boycott call by Berisha.
	   Albania's Central Voting Committee said Monday more than 50
percent of voters participated. The committee said it may take a
few days to receive turnout results and ballot boxes from remote
regions, delaying referendum results.
	   Berisha disputed the committee's figures, saying no more than 38
percent of the population voted and accused the government of
rigging the elections.
	   Months of political violence last year led to early elections
that spelled defeat for Berisha and forced his resignation as
president. Violence fomented by Berisha supporters paralyzed the
country again earlier this year.

	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's inflation rate hit a record low in
October following a fall in consumer spending because of the
territory's recession, the government reported Monday.
	   The composite consumer price index edged up only 0.1 percent
from a year earlier, the lowest rate of inflation since the
government began keeping such statistics in 1981.
	   It rose by 2.5 percent in September.
	   The government said lower housing rents and declines in consumer
goods and food prices pushed down the inflation rate.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian and U.S. ground controllers on Monday
guided the first module of the new international space station,
adjusting its orbit for a rendezvous next month with the next
module.
	   The Russian-built Zarya, or Sunrise, module has been smoothly
orbiting Earth since a faultless launch on Friday. ``All Zarya's
equipment has been working without a glitch,'' said Vera
Medvedkova, a spokeswoman for Russian Mission Control.
	   Early Monday, Zarya's orbit was adjusted for the third time
since the launch. After another maneuver on Tuesday, its orbit will
be circularized at around 385 kilometers (240 statute miles).
	   This is the right position for a rendezvous with the American
space shuttle Endeavour, which is to be launched Dec. 3 carrying
the Unity connecting module. The shuttle crew is to capture Zarya
using the Endeavors robot arm and then attach the two modules in
three space walks.
	   According to Medvedkova, Russian ground controllers were guiding
Zarya from a separate control room at the Mission Control outside
Moscow. The hall, built during the Soviet times to handle the
Buran, a Russian cat of the U.S. space shuttle, has been turned
into a control room for the new space station.
	   A separate hall in the same building controls the Russian Mir
space station. Russian space officials had decided to discard the
aging Mir next June, but recently said that its life may be
extended if they are able to raise more funds.
	   NASA has also been monitoring Zarya from its newly inaugurated
Mission Control Center for the international space station at the
Johnson Space Center in Houston.
	   Zarya's launch was held back for one year because the
cash-strapped Russian space agency had failed meet its obligation
on building a crucial follow-up component that would house the
crew.
	   The 12.4-meter (41.2-feet) Zarya, built for NASA by the Russian
Khrunichev company, is designed to serve as a space tugboat in the
early stages of the project, providing propulsion, power and
communications.
	   The station, involving 16 nations with the United States and
Russia playing the biggest roles, will consist of more than 100
elements that will take 45 assembly flights to complete. It is due
to be completed by 2004.
	   The station will weigh 500 tons (more than a million pounds) and
is expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion, with the United
States planning to pay dlrs 24 billion. It will serve as an orbital
home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for at least 15 years.
	   The new station will not be inhabitable until at least early
2000, following the launch of the Russian-made crew module which is
set to blast off next July or August.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The death toll from a cold snap across France rose
to six Monday, after police found three homeless men dead. One of
them was found on the steps of a hotel in southern France.
	   After a very cold weekend during which three deaths were
reported, the temperature in Paris on Monday morning was minus 5
Celsius (23 F) _ slightly higher than on Sunday.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower were completely frozen.
	   In Mouthe, eastern France, temperatures fell to minus 21 Celsius
(minus 6 F) on Monday morning.
	   In most parts, temperatures at midday did not rise much above
freezing point. It is rare for temperatures to drop to freezing in
Paris in November.
	   France Info radio said a homeless man was found dead in a car in
northern Paris Monday. Another was found dead in front of a hotel
in the southern city of Marseille. A third was found in the
northern town of Cambrai.
	   About 100 homeless people on Monday staged a sit-in at the
headquarters of the SAMU state-run medical assistance service in
Paris to demand better protection in winter.
	   They were demanding that the state spend more money protecting
them, and that more people are hired to man a special telephone
line for the homeless needing urgent attention.
	   The cold weather hitting much of Europe was expected to remain
in France until the end of the week.

<TEXT>
	   DILI, Indonesia (AP) _ More than 1,000 East Timorese students
occupied the provincial Parliament Monday amid reports that the
Indonesian military had killed more than 40 people last week.
	   The students demanded a total withdrawal of troops from the
former Portuguese colony.
	   Earlier, East Timor's spiritual leader, Roman Catholic Bishop
Carlos Belo, said he had received reports that between 30 and 40
people were killed by Indonesian troops in a series of clashes with
rebels fighting for independence.
	   The alleged slayings took place near the villages of Alas and
Same, 40 kilometers (25 miles) southeast of Dili.
	   Belo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996, said that so far,
only 11 bodies had been identified.
	   However, Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Ghaffar Fadyl
denied church reports of many deaths.
	   ``In our view it's not true, because their sources were not
clear,'' he said.
	   East Timorese groups in Portugal claim that as many as 50 people
might have been killed.
	   Mario Carrascalao, a former governor in East Timor and now an
adviser to Indonesian President B.J. Habibie, told the Portuguese
news agency Lusa that at least 44 people were killed.
	   The Indonesian military has denied the reports that it massacred
rebels.
	   About 100 riot officers watched as university and senior high
school students forced their way into the Parliament, where they
staged a noisy but peaceful rally.
	   Parliament Speaker Mariano Armindo Soares said the students
would be allowed to stay until Tuesday, as they requested.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the
following year.
	   The United Nations does not recognize Indonesia's claim over the
disputed territory. However, it has been sponsoring talks between
Portugal and Indonesia over East Timor's future.
	   Indonesia has offered to give East Timor autonomy in return for
international recognition of Indonesian sovereignty.
	   On Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he was
seriously disturbed by reports of civilian casualties.
	   Portugal suspended the talks with Indonesia following reports of
a massacre, Foreign Ministry spokesman Horacio Cesar said in
Lisbon.

Sol Melia to become world's ninth largest hotel group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish hotel giant Sol Melia announced
Monday it will merge its various units to create a hotel group it
said will be the world's ninth largest.
	   Sol Melia, owned by the Escarrer family, will fully absorb Melia
Inversiones Americanas, which specializes in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the family's private hotel-construction business
Inmotel.
	   Sol Melia, Spain's largest hotel management company, operates
more than 250 hotels and handles some 65,000 rooms in 25 countries.
Founded by Gabriel Escarrer in 1956 with the first Sol Hotel, it
became the center of his family's hotel empire.
	   ``The integration of the three companies into one will provide
greater financial stability that will allow us to maximize
opportunities for future growth and have a leading position in the
world,'' Escarrer, the company's chairman, said in a press release
Monday.
	   The merger operation will be concluded in the first quarter of
1999 and will reduce company costs.

Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon, air raids follow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, killing an
Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said Monday.
	   One hour later, Israeli warplanes raided an area between the
villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north of Israel's
occupied zone in the south.
	   The Israeli jets fired at least one air-to-surface missiles on
the area, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the afternoon attack on the Dabshe outpost in the eastern sector of
an Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
	   A Hezbollah statement said guerrillas targeted an Israeli army
tank at the post, scoring ``direct hits.'' The security officials
said one Israeli soldier was killed and that others may have been
wounded.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel.
	   The Dabshe outpost is some eight kilometers (five miles) north
of Marjayoun, the main town in the enclave Israel has occupied
since 1985.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to drive some 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen from the enclave. Israel
maintains the occupation is necessary to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla raids.

Japanese whaling ship stalls off Australia after fire breaks out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Greenpeace comment from Australia &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese whaling ship on a government-led
research mission is stalled off Australia's east coast after a fire
broke out on board four days ago, officials said Monday.
	   No injuries were reported from the fire on the Nisshin Maru,
currently drifting 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of
Brisbane, said Shimon Harima, a spokesman for Japan's Maritime
Safety Agency.
	   The fire appeared to be under control, although the crew has not
yet determined whether it has been completely extinguished, said
Hitoshi Yamamoto, a spokesman of Kyodo Sempaku, the ship's
operator.
	   The 7,575-ton Nisshin Maru, carrying a crew of 111, was on its
way to Antarctic seas for Japan's annual research whaling program.
That program has often been criticized because meat from the whales
killed for research is sold on the market, with proceeds going to
the whaling industry.
	   Commercial whaling is banned throughout the world. Japan has
continued with research in an effort to gather evidence that would
persuade regulators to lift the ban.
	   Yamamoto said the crew believed the fire broke out in the
factory section of the ship, part of which is directly above the
engine room. The cause of the fire was not immediately known, he
said.
	   The crew was currently airing out the engine room, which was
believed undamaged by the fire, Yamamoto said.
	   The Nisshin Maru is the mother ship for a five-vessel whaling
team.
	   After assessing the extent of damage from the fire, the operator
will decide whether to send the Nisshin Maru back to Japan or have
it towed to a nearby port for repairs, Yamamoto said.
	   In Brisbane, the environmental group Greenpeace said it had
confirmed that Kyodo Sempaku had contacted a salvage company in
Port Moresby, in Papua New Guinea, about using an ocean-going tug
to retrieve the Nisshin Maru. It was likely to be towed to Port
Moresby, said the group, a longstanding opponent of commercial
whaling.
	   ``The Nisshin Maru is Japan's only factory vessel and central to
the whaling fleet operation in the remote Southern Ocean,''
Greenpeace ocean campaigner Denise Boyd said in a statement.
	   ``It is unclear what impact the crippling of the fleet's mother
ship will have on this year's whale hunt,'' she added.
	   Greenpeace said the Japanese hunted in a whale sanctuary in the
Southern Ocean declared by the International Whaling Commission in
1994 to provide protection for many of the great whale species, but
justified its actions by saying the whales were being taken for
scientific purposes.
	   ``Japan continues to kill as many as 440 minke whales every year
for `scientific research' in the internationally recognized whale
sanctuary,'' Ms. Boyd said.

English perfumes waft away as German Wella buys Yardley products
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Some very English scents _ English Lavender, Lily
of the Valley and Sandalwood _ have wafted away, sold to the German
cosmetics and hair care group Wella, receivers for the bankrupt
Yardley group said Monday.
	   Running of Yardley and Co. Ltd. and its parent, Old Bond Street
Holding Co. Ltd., was taken over in August by accountants from the
firm KPMG, charged with selling the 228-year-old company.
	   Wella is buying Yardley's Bath Luxuries division which accounts
for about 40 percent of sales, KPMG said. The price was not
disclosed.
	   KPMG is still looking for buyers for other Yardley ranges,
including Valley, Sandalwood, Tweed and Panache.
	   Under the deal, Wella has bought the rights to use the general
Yardley name.
	   ``This is the receivership's first important brand sale. The
brands will now receive the investment they warrant,'' said KPMG
receiver Tony Thompson
	   Yardley's international Cosmetics and Fragrances businesses,
based in its factory in Basildon, Essex, east of London, continues
to trade.
	   Wella said is it buying Yardley through its Cologne-based
subsidiary Cosmopolitan Comestics, and has set up a London-based
company, Yardley of London, to manage the business.
	   ``We will take into consideration the best traditions of Yardley
as a British company,'' said Wella spokesman Klaus Wolfran.
``Yardley will remain British.''
	   Yardley went into receivership with debts of around 120 million
pounds (dlrs 195 million). KPMG said at the time that debts had
been increasing for several years, making it difficult for the
company to find a way back.
	   Yardley, founded in 1770, became famous for perfumes, powders
and body lotions made from lavender, English rose and spring
flower.
	   In recent years, the company increased its product line to
include bright lipsticks and nail polish.
	   Yardley employs 300 workers and has a manufacturing plant in
Basildon, England, along with operations spreading through
Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore.

President asks parliament to review law on traveling abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The president asked Parliament on Monday
to review a new law, saying it would give police virtually
unlimited powers to bar people from traveling abroad.
	   The recent law abolishes the right to appeal refusals by
authorities to issue passports for reasons of national security.
	   ``Some civil rights might be curtailed for the sake of national
security,'' President Petar Stoyanov said. ``But it should by no
means be the ground for depriving Bulgarian citizens from the right
to travel abroad.''
	   Parliament is bound by law to reconsider any law on request of
the president but is also authorize to override his reservations
after such a review.

	   --
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ A speeding army truck slammed into four
taxis in a Kinshasa suburb Monday, killing at least 12 people,
state-controlled radio reported.
	   Several other people were hurt in the collision, Voice of the
People radio reported without giving specifics.
	   Investigators were trying to determine the cause of the
accident.
	   The victims were all aboard the taxis, the radio report said,
adding that none of the passengers in the army truck was hurt.
	   Those injured in the crash were taken to hospitals in the Meteo
district on Kinshasa's west side, near where the accident happened.
	   Military vehicles, often seen speeding down busy boulevards,
have been a regular sight in downtown Kinshasa since the start in
August of a rebel war against President Laurent Kabila.
	   --
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ The new police force set up by the
joint administration of the Somali capital prepared Monday to don
3,000 uniforms donated by Egypt, but the police chief would not say
when the force would be deployed.
	   The official, Col. Abdi Hassan Awale, said Sunday the police
officers have finished their first round of training to combat
banditry in urban areas. He spoke after arriving from Ballidogle
airport west of Mogadishu where he received the Egyptian uniforms.
	   The police force was established in August by the three rival
warlords who control Mogadishu and have been trying to set up a
joint administration to allow the capital's airport and seaport to
open after being closed for more than three years.
	   Armed robbery carried out by militiamen who were not
incorporated into the police force and who fear losing their
livelihoods is rampant.
	   The new police force is supposed to disarm everyone else found
on the streets with weapons. It is not certain how this will work,
given the large amounts of assault rifles and other weapons readily
available in the city's markets.
	   --
	   EAST LONDON, South Africa (AP) _ The country's top corruption
fighter will undergo tests Tuesday after his release from the
hospital last week.
	   Judge Willem Heath was hospitalized after collapsing Nov. 16
because of internal bleeding, caused by a small ulcer and benign
growths in his lower intestine.
	   ``It's going to take a while still for him to heal. He is still
very weak,'' said Heath's spokesman, Guy Rich. Rich said Tuesday's
tests were a routine follow-up.
	   Heath, 53, heads a special unit investigating corruption.
	   --
	   LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) _ The government offered a seven-day general
amnesty for the surrender of illegal weapons to the police.
	   Police spokesman Alex Chilufya said no arrests would be made of
those surrendering illegal guns, especially military firearms.
	   Announcing the amnesty Sunday, Chilufya said authorities wanted
to rid communities of weapons that contributed to a recent rise in
cases of murder and aggravated robberies.
	   ``People should voluntarily surrender these weapons. We hope the
exercise will yield good results,'' he said.
	   He said Lusaka and the central Copperbelt mining province saw
the largest recent increase in violent crimes. He gave no
statistics.
	   Many illegal weapons are smuggled into Zambia from Angola and
Congo.
	   Former Finance Minister Ronald Penza was shot and killed Nov. 6
in the exclusive Lusaka suburb of Ibex Hill when six gunmen stormed
into his bedroom and demanded money.

Denmark's largest heroin seizure reported

	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Police on Monday said they have made
the country's largest seizure of heroin _ 30 kilograms (66 pounds)
taken from a Dane as he drove off a ferry from Germany.
	   The seizure of the uncut brown heroin, valued at 50 million
kroner (dlrs 8 million), took place last month in Gedser, a
southern port for ferries from Rostock and Luebeck.
	   Police said they had kept quiet about the serizure until now
because of a continuing drugs investigation.
	   The car's driver, a 19-year-old Dane, told police he had been on
a turist trip and that the car was borrowed from a friend. Both the
driver and the friend have been arrested, but their identities have
not been released.

Villagers burn 13 trucks of pulp factory in North Sumatra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A mob burned 13 trucks owned by a pulp
mill in North Sumatra after one of its guards shot and wounded a
villager, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   The Suara Pembaruan said hundreds of villagers clashed with
workers of the company PT Inti Indorayon Utama on Sunday in Porsea
district in the regency of North Tapanuli, about 1,500 kilometers
(937 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   It said that as four truckloads of workers were passing a
volleyball court, a guard on one truck fired on a player picking up
a volleyball on the street the trucks were using.
	   Villagers and environmentalists have accused the company of
pollution, and the provincial parliament has recommended that the
government close it down.

<TEXT>
	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Against the backdrop of a Puerto
Rican flag, a bouncy, Spanish-speaking youth exhorts Puerto Ricans
to cast their ballots on the side of ``your flag, your language,
your culture!''
	   This isn't an ``independentista'' struggling to cast off a
century of American oppression. This is someone who supports
turning Puerto Rico into the 51st U.S. state.
	   Only a few weeks before a Dec. 13 referendum on possibly
changing the island's ties to the United States, mixed messages,
recriminations and confusion are the order of the day.
	   Disagreements run deeper than merely over what the island should
be. Puerto Ricans can't begin to agree on what it already is. Or
how any result in the referendum should be interpreted. Or whether
the vote should be held at all.
	   Statehood supporters insist they sense an opportunity to move
past voters' long-standing satisfaction with living in a
``commonwealth'' _ a sort of halfway house of Americanness devised
in 1952.
	   ``I don't have the slightest doubt we will win,'' said Jose
Granados Navedo, a leading legislator from the pro-statehood New
Progressive Party.
	   Under commonwealth status, the 3.8 million Puerto Rico residents
are U.S. citizens, but can't vote for president. On the other hand,
they don't pay federal taxes and do get symbols of sovereignty like
an Olympic team and a Miss Universe entry.
	   Commonwealth backers see this as ingenious compromise, the best
of both worlds.
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello and fellow statehooders see it as an
embarrassing colonial relic. So, over the objections of opponents
and the fears of supporters, and without the backing of the U.S.
Congress, he called the referendum.
	   On the surface, island residents face five straightforward
options: Continue as a commonwealth; become a U.S. state;
independence; ``free association,'' essentially independence with
treaty ties to the United States; and ``none of the above.''
	   Most of the population is split almost evenly between
commonwealth and statehood, so each side emphasizes images and
messages intended to entice the opponents' electorate.
	   The campaign has been further muddled by the refusal of the
traditionally pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party to support
that option because of how it is defined on the ballot. It's
campaigning for ``none of the above.''
	   The ballot, written by statehood supporters, defines the
somewhat ambiguous 1952 commonwealth law as meaning local
government is ``under the authority of Congress,'' which could
strip islanders of their U.S. citizenship at will.
	   ``We cannot vote for this, because we don't want a commonwealth
that will not guarantee our U.S. citizenship,'' said Jorge de
Castro Font, a Popular Democratic legislator. ``Congress cannot
tomorrow take away our U.S. citizenship.''
	   His party got to write its own, improved definition during a
1993 vote in which commonwealth status beat statehood 49 percent-46
percent, with independence getting about 5 percent.
	   ``They are not willing to accept the truth about commonwealth,''
said Grenados Navedo, the pro-statehood lawmaker. ``When you are
crippled, you cannot pretend you're a jogger.''
	   Former U.S. Attorney General Dick Thornburgh took the
statehooders' side recently, writing in The San Juan Star that
Puerto Ricans' citizenship is indeed ``granted by statute and not
fully protected by the U.S. Constitution.''
	   Commonwealthers warn that statehood would require Puerto Ricans
_ less than a third of whom speak English well _ to be truly
bilingual. Statehooders say that isn't so.
	   Taxation is also an issue. Statehooders say the overall tax
burden would remain the same, or even decrease _ with some funds
shifted from the local to the federal government. Commonwealth
backers say that even if that is true, tens of thousands would lose
jobs in the local public sector.
	   A poll published last week by the newspaper El Nuevo Dia said
statehood had the biggest group of support, 30 percent of the 1,000
people surveyed. Twenty-two percent chose commonwealth and 14
percent picked ``none of the above'' _ suggesting the Popular
Democratic Party has made some inroads in its unusual campaign.
	   Three percent chose independence and 1 percent free association.
The poll had an error margin of four percentage points.
	   Tellingly, 63 percent said the referendum should be postponed.
	   President Clinton has called on Congress, which failed to pass a
bill laying out the path to Puerto Rican statehood this year, to
``respect'' the result of the vote. And there does appear to be
growing impatience with commonwealth on Capitol Hill.
	   But many people doubt the United States would invite into the
union an applicant so ambivalent about the honor.

	   BOBOVAC, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Muslim prayer services are conducted
in a Spartan setting down the road from the destroyed mosque. A
volunteer patrol of civilians keeps a nervous watch for Serb
forces. Food is brought in furtively through the forest.
	   With a fragile cease-fire still largely holding, people are
drifting back to this central Kosovo village, and others across the
province, trying to rebuild damaged homes and shattered lives. But
their communities still bear only a semblance of normalcy.
	   In Bobovac, the ethnic Albanian residents struggle to pull
plastic sheeting over gaping holes where their roofs and windows
used to be, despite fears sporadic gunfire in the distance could
signal more trouble to come.
	   Community leaders are assuming their positions once again after
the months-long Serb crackdown on Albanian separatists that killed
hundreds and uprooted hundreds of thousands. Coordinating the
rebuilding, however, is not easy.
	   ``The village is run like it used to be,'' says village leader
Hysni Kryeziu. ``The difference is that the houses are destroyed
and we just can't have the same life.''
	   Less than a third of Bobovac's almost 2,000 residents have
returned. ``The rest don't have anywhere to come back to,'' Kryeziu
says. They are still sheltering in the homes of friends and
relatives in other villages.
	   Bobovac never had any telephones. Mail was collected from the
nearby village of Kijevo. But now, returning residents feel
completely isolated from the outside world.
	   Because of the Serb police presence in Kijevo on one side and
Malisevo on the other, villagers say they are afraid to even
approach those areas. Their only contact with what's happening
outside the village is word from passers-by.
	   But outside contact is not their main worry. ``For now, no one
is even thinking of other luxuries. We are interested only in
rebuilding a room to shelter in,'' Kryeziu says.
	   ``When the Serb police withdraw, we will think of what things
the village needs,'' agrees Xhevat Kryeziu, the local imam, or head
of the mosque, who is not related to the village leader.
	   Those who could find building materials are already repairing
their homes. Residents gather around the village chief as he
measures out plastic sheeting from a large roll left by the aid
organization Oxfam.
	   Men haul planks of wood and tiles to repair their roofs, while
laundry dries in burnt-out doorways and between broken walls.
	   Without outside help from humanitarian groups for building
material and supplies, village life won't be returning to normal in
the foreseeable future, the community leaders say.
	   ``If it depends only on us, it will take a lifetime to rebuild
our lives and homes,'' the imam sighs. ``It will take 50 years.''
	   Residents take turns patrolling Bobovac following the withdrawal
of Serb police. Kryeziu wouldn't say whether the volunteers are
armed.
	   Villagers insist that the Kosovo Liberation Army, the ethnic
Albanian guerrilla force fighting for independence for the Serb
province, is not involved.
	   The tradition of religious ceremonies is being kept alive, even
though the mosque is little more than a burned-out shell. The imam
uses a carpeted but bare room in his home to hold weekly services.
	   A new, dangerous system of obtaining food has emerged.
	   Fear of Serb police has kept villagers away from main roads as
they try to reach other towns for supplies. But while shortcuts
lessen the likelihood of such encounters, getting spotted in woods
or fields means they run the risk of being arrested or shot as
suspected guerrillas.
	   Two shabby wooden crates are set up in the mud at roadside to
display the goods Bobovac villagers have brought back to sell _
cooking oil, sugar, cookies, fruit juices, cigarettes.
	   ``It is very expensive, but it's understandable because they
risk their lives to get it,'' Hysni Kryeziu says.
	   School is out of the question for now. With classrooms smashed,
books burned and desks and chairs missing, teachers have nowhere to
teach.
	   The children risk missing the entire school year, with survival
taking precedence over education. But there is hope the worst may
be over.
	   ``We may be able to catch the last term,'' says Muharrem
Oukolli, a teacher. ``For now, we have other worries and we don't
know who to turn to for help. But we will try, and we won't give up
until we can rebuild our lives.''

Child labor, health, pollution on agenda for Indian elections

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ India's politicians traditionally seek votes
by appealing to caste and religion, but pollution and child labor
are dominating the agenda for this week's crucial provincial
elections.
	   Wednesday's ballot will test the popularity of the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, in power since June 1997. More
than 80 million voters will choose 626 state legislators in four of
India's 26 states.
	   Public interest groups are trying to focus Wednesday's ballot on
the kind of core issues _ air pollution and underage workers _ that
politicians prefer to address with platitudes rather than action.
	   In New Delhi, where air pollution is believed to kill one person
every hour, a bold-faced advertisement in Sunday's mass-circulation
Times of India newspaper warned candidates: ``If you want our votes
give us clean air.''
	   Indian studies have found that New Delhi has the world's highest
concentration of airborne particles; carbon monoxide and nitrous
oxide levels also are above international limits.
	   The Center for Science and Environment, the think tank that
published the advertisement, said received hundreds of calls from
supporters.
	   ``It's amazing to see the response from common people, from
students, professionals, and those from the middle class,'' said
Anumita Rowchowdhury, a researcher at the center.
	   The center asked 85 candidates for the Delhi state assembly to
pledge to take steps against polluting vehicles, but only 22
responded.
	   The antipollution campaign was backed last week by doctors, who
urged candidates to spell out plans to improve citizen health in
filthy cities.
	   One of every 10 children in New Delhi suffers from asthma and
one in 10 residents is likely to suffer from cancer, the center
said.
	   Anti-child labor activist Kailash Satyarthi found some
politicians refused his request to take a stand against child
labor.
	   ``Several politicians, including ministers, refused to sign
pledges that they would work against child labor,'' said Satyarthi,
who heads the South Asian Coalition Against Child Servitude, a
high-profile group which helped make child labor an international
issue.
	   India has the largest number of child workers in the world, with
estimates ranging between 40 million and 100 million underage
workers, the United Nations said.
	   Many children work in farm fields, restaurants, weaving carpets,
stitching footballs or as prostitutes.
	   On Friday, Satyarthi's organization brought together nearly
1,000 children aged four to 14 to demonstrate at one of New Delhi's
busiest intersections to urge candidates to oppose child labor.
	   In the states of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and New Delhi, the
BJP will square off against its main rival, the Congress, which led
India to independence in 1947 and for most of the years since then.
Local parties are contesting the election in the tiny state of
Mizoram.

Four militants killed in Kashmir as soldiers raid hide-outs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Army soldiers gunned down four foreign
militants after a nightlong gun battle in a Kashmir town, the
military said Monday.
	   Soldiers also raided a dozen villages in the Himalayan state on
Monday searching for militants. One civilian was injured in the
exchange of fire between guerrillas and soldiers, according to
police and military officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   On Sunday night, militants hiding in Badmullah village in
Baramullah district opened fire on soldiers who raided the area
following a tip, said Maj. P. Purushottam, the army spokesman. The
soldiers retaliated, killing four guerrillas after a nightlong
battle, he said.
	   Soldiers recovered several grenades, rifles and rocket
launchers. The area is 70 kilometers (40 miles) north of Srinagar.
The four militants were suspected to be Afghan nationals,
Purushottam said.
	   Soldiers also searched hundreds of houses in nearby villages
looking for guerrillas. Soldiers and militants exchanged gun shots
in one of the areas Monday afternoon. One civilian caught in the
cross fire died on the spot, officials said.
	   In recent weeks, soldiers have stepped up the crackdown on
militants fighting for independence of Kashmir, the only
Muslim-majority state in India, a predominantly Hindu nation of
some 1 billion people.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia is expected to reduce
government expenditures in 1999 to 187 billion riyals (dlrs 50
billion) down from 190 billion (dlrs 50.7 billion) this year, an
economic forecast by the Saudi British Bank said Monday.
	   The reduced figure is due to lower oil prices, the mainstay of
the Saudi economy, the bank report said.
	   Next year's budget plan will be based on expected oil prices of
dlrs 13-14 per barrel, said the report.
	   Oil prices are currently hovering at about dlrs 11 a barrel.
	   The bank predicted that government revenues in 1999 would be
around 155 billion riyals (dlrs 41.3 billion).
	   The bank said the government deficit would reach 40 billion
riyals (dlrs 10.7) by the end of the year, more than double the
previous forecast of an 18 billion riyal (dlrs 4.8 billion)
deficit.
	   ___
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The state-owned Syrian Petroleum Co.
signed Saturday a contract with two world major oil companies to
build a natural gas plant worth dlrs 430 million.
	   America's Conoco Oil Company and France's Elf-Aquitaine will
complete the project in two years. The project is to be constructed
in the Dayr az Zawr, 400 kilometers (250 miles) northeast of
Damascus.
	   Conoco officials said the project will significantly increase
the volume of gas as an energy source used in power stations and
fertilizer plants. Gas forms 40 percent of the power stations' fuel
needs in Syria.
	   The project aims to utilize the gas which is associated with oil
wells that is otherwise wasted.
	   The new plant is have a capacity of 175 million cubic feet a
day. A 250-kilometer (155-mile) pipeline will carry dry gas to
Palmyra, in central Syria. The new gas pipeline will be connected
into the national gas network.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The National Industries Group finalized Monday an
agreement for a 35 million dinar (dlrs 115.89 million) bond issue,
said to be the largest ever in this small oil-rich state.
	   The Kuwait-based Gulf Investment Corp., which is owned by the
six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council, and the Kuwait Financial
Center arranged the 3-year issue.
	   The funds were needed to repay short-term debts and finance
long-term investments, National Industries said in a statement. The
group is a leading manufacturer of building materials and has
interests in a number of Kuwaiti and European companies.
	   ``This issue is the largest Kuwaiti dinar bond issue in Kuwait
to date and we are happy for its successful conclusion,'' said
Hisham al-Razzuqi, a senior National Industries official.
	   ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The state-run Jordan Development Industrial
Bank had net profits of 2.9 million dinars (dlrs 4 million) in the
first three quarters of 1998, a 4 percent increase over the same
period last year, a bank official said Monday.
	   Rajab Al Saad, the bank's director general, said business
activities were up 11 percent, or 152 million dinars (dlrs 214
million), in the annual budget to the end of September over the
same period a year earlier.
	   The increase was due to growth in bank assets, which rose by 27
percent to 61 million dinars (dlrs 85.9 million), and the upgrading
of the bank capital, which doubled to 24 million dinars (dlrs 33.8
million), from 1997, Al Saad said.
	   ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A delegation of more than 100 British
businessmen will arrive in Egypt on Saturday to explore
opportunities for increased trade and investment, the British
Embassy announced.
	   An embassy statement quoted British Ambassador Sir David
Blatherwick as saying the visit was an outgrowth of increased trade
ties between the countries. The mission will be headed by Sir Paul
Nicholson, chairman of the Vaux Group, which has major hotel
interests.
	   The delegations will visit Cairo, Alexandria and the Borg
al-Arab industrial area.

<TEXT>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Pakistan's planned cricket tour in India is
causing a rift between two Hindu nationalist partners in India's
ruling coalition.
	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said over the weekend that
the team from India's hostile neighbor would be welcome and well
protected during the tour scheduled for January. He was responding
to threats by the head of the ultra-nationalist Shiv Sena party in
Bombay, Bal Thackeray, to block the Pakistani cricketers from
Indian soil.
	   Cricket is a passion in both countries, and the sporting rivalry
between India and Pakistan is heightened by the political enmity
that led the two countries to war three times in the last 50 years.
	   The Shiv Sena is one of the smaller partners with Vajpayee's
Bharatiya Janata Party in the federal coalition. But the alliance
between the BJP and Shiv Sena is more important in the state
politics of Maharashtra, of which Bombay is the capital.
	   On Monday, newspapers quoted Gopinath Munde, the state minister
in charge of internal security, as distancing himself from
Thackeray.
	   ``Sports, music and arts should be free from political ill
will,'' said Munde, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party minister in
the state government.
	   Thackeray said Pakistani cricket should be boycotted by
``staunch Hindus'' as long as Pakistan supports the Muslim
separatist insurrection in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state
in predominantly Hindu India. Pakistan denies actively helping the
militants.
	   Shiv Sena is a powerful regional party in Maharashtra state. Its
activists disrupted a test match between India and Pakistan more
than a decade ago by digging up the pitch. The Pakistan cricket
team hasn't played an international match in Bombay, the capital of
Maharashtra state, since then.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government on Monday released
seven people who were detained for a year after they were accused
of spreading Islamic teachings deemed likely to divide Malaysian
Muslims.
	   Another two people taken in last November remained in detention
under the Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention
without trial.
	   The government said the nine had been spreading teachings of the
Shi'ite sect, which is widespread in the Middle East. Most Muslims
in Malaysia follow teachings of the Sunni sect.
	   ``Their activities have caused uneasiness and can divide Muslims
who are followers of the Sunni sect,'' said Deputy Home Minister
Mohamad Tajol Rosli Ghazali.
	   All those released have undergone an Islamic faith
rehabilitation course aimed at creating awareness and making
self-evaluation as a Malaysian Muslim citizen holding to the Sunni
sect teachings, he said.
	   ``The government is confident that all of them have reformed and
repented and have pledged not to repeat their actions,'' Rosli
said.
	   He said three were released with conditions, while the other
four were released unconditionally.

<TEXT>
	   ZHYTOMYR, Ukraine (AP) _ A man accused of the worst murder spree
in modern Ukrainian history went on trial Monday, charged with the
deaths of 52 people after a trail of terror across the country.
	   Anatoliy Onoprienko, a forester and sailor, has confessed to the
killings, his attorney said.
	   ``I look at it very simply. As an animal. I watched all this as
an animal would stare at a sheep,'' Onoprienko said of the
slaughter in a videotaped 1997 police interview obtained by The
Associated Press.
	   Dressed in running shoes, an oversized jacket and a knitted hat,
Onoprienko sat calmly inside an iron cage as court proceedings
began in Zhytomyr, 140 kilometers (87 miles) west of the capital
Kiev.
	   Onoprienko, 39, spoke of growing up in a children's home after
his father left the family and his mother died. During the
proceedings, he never looked at Serhiy Rogozin, his neighbor in the
cage and alleged accomplice in some of the murders.
	   The charges against Onoprienko chart a remarkable rampage that
first drew public attention in December 1995 with the slaying of an
entire family in a secluded village home. Other killings were soon
to follow.
	   In western Ukraine, the anxiety became so high that few
villagers ventured outside after dark. Huddled in their houses,
they listened in fear as police patrolled the deserted streets.
	   Police launched a nationwide manhunt for the killer, who left
few clues and no live witnesses. A warrant issued at the time
described a pleasant man of medium height, a good marksman with his
12-gauge hunting rifle, who was ``exceptionally cruel toward
children.''
	   The killer continued to elude police, murdering a total of 40
men, women and children between Dec. 24, 1995 and March 22, 1996.
His loot in cash, electronic appliances, jewelry and worn clothes
amounted to several thousand dollars.
	   But the net was tightening.
	   In the western Lviv region, investigators were checking all
suspicious people, widely using informants. One report pointed to a
man who was traveling in the region between visits to his
girlfriend in Yavoriv, near the Polish border.
	   Police investigators recall that April 14, armed officers
followed the woman into her apartment. They saw a balding, lean man
who rushed to grab his attache case but collapsed on the floor when
hit with a machine gun butt. A sawed-off hunting rifle lay inside
the briefcase.
	   Confronted with evidence found hidden at the homes of his lover
and his brother, Onoprienko confessed _ not only to those 40
deaths, but to those of 12 people in 1989, including killings
allegedly carried out together with Rogozin, a 36-year-old Afghan
war veteran, authorities say.
	   ``The defendant is calm. He fully admits his guilt,''
Onoprienko's state-appointed attorney, Ruslan Mashkovsky, told
reporters Monday.
	   For months, Onoprienko's trial could not start as Ukraine's
cash-strapped authorities lacked the money to pay for the
proceedings and bring 400 witnesses to Zhytomyr. The Cabinet
finally decided to use a reserve fund and provide the regional
court with 143,000 hryvna (dlrs 41,700).
	   Zhytomyr residents, many of them elderly, flocked to the
spacious court hall. Most just quietly eyed Onoprienko, but some
shouted their fears aloud.
	   ``He was born a monster and deserves a slow death,'' Liudmyla
Fedorova, a 50-year-old school teacher, said as a cluster of women
around her demanded that Onoprienko be tortured for days on end.
	   In the former Soviet Union, Onoprienko's rampage is matched only
by that of Andrei Chikatilo, executed in 1994 for killing and
mutilating 52 women and children in neighboring Russia over a
12-year period.
	   Relatives and boarding school teachers describe Onoprienko as a
quiet, reserved youth.
	   He said he feels himself to be a robot, driven for years by an
unknown dark force.
	   ``In 1995, (I) was forced to kill people again... Then,
literally in the process of all this, I saw that it was not me,''
Onoprienko said Saturday in a prison interview filmed by Ukraine's
Inter TV company.
	   He has argued that he should not be tried until authorities
determine the source of this force.
	   With a thin face, prominent nose, gray eyes and receding reddish
hair, Onoprienko rambles endlessly about the CIA and Interpol,
unknown powers and revelations while showing no shadow of remorse
about the killings.
	   Psychiatrists, however, have ruled him fit to stand trial.

Palestinian protest against Arafat's deputy over prisoners
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Angered by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's failure to win the release of security prisoners
held by Israel, hundreds of relatives of detainees protested Monday
outside the home of Arafat's deputy.
	   ``Where is the justice? You have become collaborators!'' one
women shouted as she held a gold-framed photo of her son in the
rally outside the villa of Arafat's No. 2, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   ``A government that does not appreciate its prisoners does not
deserve respect,'' read a banner in the crowd of 500 people.
	   Palestinian police scuffled with several protesters, and one
woman slumped to the ground.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel, and their
fate could become a serious internal problem for Arafat.
	   It is an emotionally charged issue because nearly every
Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by Israel at one
time. Prisoner releases are seen as a true gauge of whether peace
agreements bring real benefits.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   The Palestinians took this to mean that Israel would release
security prisoners held for participating in the 1987-1993 uprising
against Israeli occupation or those jailed for membership in
Arafat's Fatah faction which was once outlawed by Israel.
	   However, a majority of the 250 Palestinians freed in a first
release last Friday were criminals.
	   The Palestinian Authority filed a protest with the United
States, saying Israel had violated the peace accord.
	   However, Arafat did not hold up the implementation of the
agreement over the issue _ a move that might have stopped last
week's Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he
had followed his commitments to the Palestinians regarding the
prisoners ``to the letter.''
	   He told his Cabinet on Sunday that he had promised Arafat to
release 100 so-called security prisoners who had not carried out
killings and did not belong to the Islamic militant group Hamas,
the Haaretz daily said. Netanyahu claimed that with last Friday's
release, there were hardly any security prisoners left that
qualified for release under Israel's conditions.
	   Palestinian groups monitoring prisoners disputed Netanyahu's
contention, saying about 1,000 of the Palestinian prisoners were
serving time for Fatah membership, weapons possession or
involvement in the Palestinian uprising.
	   ``None are charged with murder,'' said Issa Karakeh, director of
the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   Hassan Asfour, who helped negotiate the Wye agreement, said he
understood the anger of the prisoners' relatives, but that the
Palestinian Authority should not be blamed for Israel's breach of
promises.
	   Hisham Abdel Razek, the senior Palestinian Authority official in
charge of prisoners, said the only restriction the Palestinians
agreed to in the Wye talks was that Israel would not free killers
for the time being.
	   Israel's minister of public security, Avigdor Kahalani, said
there was a ``big gap between the Palestinian and Israeli
understanding'' of the prison deal.
	   On Sunday, Fatah prisoners held in Israel's Megiddo Prison began
a hunger strike and warned that they would come out against the
peace process if they are not freed soon.

Bus carrying American tourists attacked in Iran

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in 11th-12th grafs with condemnation of attack by
Iranian paper

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A bus carrying American tourists had its
windows shattered when a group of assailants shouting anti-American
slogans attacked it with stones and iron rods, the Iran News
reported Monday.
	   The attack is believed to have been triggered by reports in
hardline newspapers accusing the visiting American group of being
U.S. officials and members of the Central Intelligence Agency
posing as tourists.
	   The attack happened Saturday morning as the group arrived in
front of the Esteglal Hotel in northern Tehran where they were
staying, the paper said.
	   The bus was stopped by a group of men who broke all of the
buses' windows before the bus driver sped off to another hotel and
called the police, the paper said.
	   The group of 13 people then received a police escort to their
hotel, said the Iran News. Other accounts said some of the
Americans suffered minor injuries and cuts from flying glass.
	   A radical Muslim group claiming responsibility for the attack
had a slightly different account, saying its members threw stones
at the tourists and injured some as they got off the bus to enter
the hotel, the al-Hayat newspaper reported.
	   The London-based Arabic daily said its office in Tehran received
an anonymous phone call from someone speaking on behalf of the
Fedayeen Islam, or ``Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam,'' claiming
it carried out the attack.
	   ``This is a lesson and a warning to those spies,'' the paper
quoted the caller as saying.
	   A statement from the Fedayeen Islam also claiming responsibility
was made available in Tehran on Monday.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' it said, apparently referring to
President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural exchanges between
Americans and Iranians.
	   An Iranian newspaper Monday condemned the attack saying it went
against Iran's tradition of hospitality.
	   ``Doesn't the attack on the bus carrying the group of tourists
visiting Iran, the land of hospitable people, damage our Islamic
and Iranian reputation. It gives the impression that our country is
not a safe place and no more tourists will dare come to Iran,'' the
Etelaat evening paper said.

Murdoch announces formation of New Corp. European subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. announced Monday that
it will launch a European subsidiary that will investigate and
oversee media investments in continental Europe.
	   Letizia Moratti, former chairman of the Italian broadcaster RAI,
will serve as head of News Corp. Europe, to be based in Milan,
Italy, Murdoch said at a news conference.
	   He also confirmed that the new division is in advanced
negotiations with Telecom Italia SpA and the French broadcasting
group TF1 about launching joint broadcasting ventures.
	   The talks with Telecom Italia concern the formation of a joint
venture to develop the Italian pay-TV market, in which News Corp.
would hold a minority stake, Murdoch said.
	   The negotiations with TFI involve launching a channel targeted
at the 15- to 35-year age group, to be distributed in France
initially by cable and satellite, he said.
	   Murdoch said that following the success of the BSkyB satellite
station in Britain, in which News Corp. holds a major stake, ``we
see opportunities to participate in media developments across
Europe.''
	   ``We are delighted to be working with Letizia Moratti, who has
both the vision and experience to help us achieve our ambitions,''
Murdoch said.
	   He said the new company was ``basically electronic'' and would
not be expanding into the mainstream newspaper business. He did not
rule out, however, moving into magazines or specialized
publications.

Philippines seeks dlrs 7.9 billion from Japan's Miyazawa fund
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Japanese finance officials began
talks Monday with the Philippine government on its request for dlrs
7.9 billion to finance projects aimed at helping the Philippines
recover from the regional currency crisis.
	   The financing is being sought from the dlrs 30 billion Miyazawa
fund, pledged by Japan as part of a broad relief effort to revive
East Asia's ailing economies.
	   Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said he is optimistic the
Philippine request will be granted, and noted that the Japanese
officials are eager to quickly process the requests for financing.
	   The Philippines has presented the Japanese delegation, headed by
Ministry of Finance Deputy Director General Kyoto Ido, with a
``wish list'' of 33 projects, which include agricultural and
low-cost housing projects.
	   The proposal also includes co-financing power, environmental and
banking sector reform projects with the Asian Development Bank and
the World Bank.
	   Some are earmarked for immediate assistance, while others
involve longer-term financing.
	   But a Philippine finance official said concern has been raised
by the Japanese officials that the Philippines' relatively sound
economy may not warrant the level of financing being sought, given
the dire financial straits of other countries in the region.
	   The official said he expects Japan to announce within the next
two weeks exactly how the Philippines will benefit from the
Miyazawa fund. He acknowledged that perhaps not all the 33 projects
will be approved.
	   Espiritu said part of the Japanese funding will be used to
support the government's planned bond issues for next year.
	   The Philippine government plans to raise some dlrs 1.5 billion
on the international capital market in early 1999 in yen-, dollar-
and euro-denominated bonds.
	   The launch is scheduled to start in January with the yen- and
dollar-denominated bonds, each totaling dlrs 500 million. The euro
bond, denominated in the single European currency, is expected to
be launched about a month later.
	   The government wants to source a large portion of its financing
requirements abroad rather than risk pressuring domestic interest
rates by borrowing domestically.
	   Financing from the Miyazawa fund will be routed through Japan's
Export-Import Bank and the country's Overseas Economic Cooperation
Fund. The Philippines hopes the Exim Bank will purchase up to half
of the yen-bond issue, with the balance placed with private
investors but fully guaranteed by Exim.
	   The Philippines is also seeking dlrs 500 million from the
Miyazawa fund to supplement the central bank's so-called export
dollar fund facility, which provides dollar funds to certain
exporters at favorable interest rates.

Russian military officers sentenced for hazing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Four Russian border guards officers have been
sentenced to prison terms from 15 to 23 years for brutal
harrassment of young conscripts, officials said Monday.
	   The officers, who served with a border guard unit in the Far
Eastern region of Chukotka, were convicted of beating and torturing
their soldiers, leading to the death of one conscript, border
guards officials said, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. The
report did not say when they were sentenced.
	   The investigation revealed that the officers were regularly
beating their men for minor offenses, leaving them without warm
clothes in temperatures up to -20 degrees C (-4 degrees F) and
denying them food, the report said.
	   Russia's cash-strapped and demoralized armed forces have been
plagued by the ritual hazing of young conscripts by older soldiers
and officers, contributing to frequent shootings and suicides.
	   According to official figures, 50 soldiers were killed by fellow
servicemen last year, and about 500 committed suicide.

Malaysia ready to evacuate 1 million in case of floods
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The government is prepared to
evacuate up to 1 million people if Malaysia is inundated by floods
caused by the La Nina phenomenon, a news report said Monday.
	   Zaleha Ismail, the national unity and social development
minister, said all facilities had been put in place as the number
of evacuees was expected to be much higher than the 40,000 people
usually affected by floods each year.
	   She was speaking to reporters after being briefed on the
situation in flood-hit areas in the northern state of Penang, 370
kilometers (220 miles) from Kuala Lumpur, the national news agency
Bernama reported.
	   With floodwaters now receding in several states, there were
1,527 evacuees at 12 relief centers in Penang, it added.
	   Heavy rains, landslides and floods are expected in December and
January when La Nina is expected to be at its peak.

Fighting reported in a key Somalia town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Militiamen loyal to Hussein Aidid
killed at least six rival fighters in driving the Rahanwein
Resistance Army from a base near a key Somalia town, a commander
said Monday.
	   Aidid's men on Sunday gained control of a base the RRA recently
established near Baidoa, about 150 kilometers (95 miles) northwest
of Mogadishu, one of Aidid's commanders said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   The commander said six RRA militiamen were killed in the
clashes. He did not comment on casualties on Aidid's side.
	   Initially, Aidid's forces were beaten back and had to seek
reinforcements of pickup trucks mounted with weapons, the commander
said. But later, RRA fighters were dislodged from the base.
	   Baidoa is a strategic town because it has a major runway which
can be used to resupply troops.
	   It was slated as a venue for a reconciliation conference first
set for Feb. 15, but repeatedly postponed for lack of money and
Aidid's refusal to withdraw his forces.
	   Last December, 24 other faction leaders, including Aidid, agreed
in Cairo to form a government of transition and hold a
reconciliation conference.
	   Somalia has had no central government since late dictator
Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 by a coalition of rebels who
later turned against each other, splitting the country into
fiefdoms protected by clan militias.

Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon, air raids follow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon today, killing an
Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   An hour later, Israeli warplanes raided an area between the
villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north of a sector
occupied by Israel in southern Lebanon.
	   The Israeli jets fired at least one air-to-surface missile on
the area, the officials said, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity. There was no immediate word on casualties.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the attack on the Dabshe outpost in the eastern sector of an
Israeli-occupied enclave.
	   A Hezbollah statement said guerrillas targeted an Israeli army
tank at the post, scoring ``direct hits.'' The security officials
said one Israeli soldier was killed and that others may have been
wounded.
	   There was no immediate comment from Israel.
	   The Dabshe outpost is five miles (eight kilometers) north of
Marjayoun, the main town in the enclave Israel has occupied since
1985.
	   Hezbollah is fighting to drive out about 1,500 Israeli troops
and 2,500 allied militiamen stationed in the Israeli-occupied zone.
Israel maintains the occupation is necessary to protect its
northern towns.

More than 1,000 Ukrainian teachers go on strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ More than 1,000 teachers went on strike
Monday demanding payment of back wages, forcing 9,000 children to
miss classes, the Education Ministry said.
	   The strike affected a total of 36 schools in the Crimea,
Kirovohrad and Ternopil regions.
	   Scattered strikes involving thousands of the country's 500,000
teachers began with the start of the school year Sept. 1. But wage
debts only have mounted since then, reaching 441 million hryvna
(dlrs 129 million) as of last week, the ministry said.
	   The former Soviet republic's government is struggling to collect
taxes, pushing up its already huge wage debts.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 62 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The early winter weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in
Romania and Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 32 people
died, most of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold
after drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). The lowest
temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15 Fahrenheit)
early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
	   In Romania, at least 21 people died from the cold and in
weather-related accidents on snow-covered roads since Friday.
Temperatures plunged to 14 early today.
	   About 200 people spent more than 48 hours stranded in their cars
after winds whipped snowdrifts across main highways in southern
Romania. Army vehicles rescued most drivers but six people froze to
death over the weekend after being trapped in their cars.
	   Dozens of trains were canceled and 200 communities were reported
to be without electricity, the Libertatea newspaper reported
Monday. Some 15 major roads were blocked by snowdrifts as high as
1.5 meters (five feet). Police urged drivers not to travel in snowy
areas.
	   In Bucharest, dozens of cars smashed into other vehicles and
skidded in the icy conditions. The Emergency Hospital in Bucharest
said it treated 80 people for fractures and frostbite over the
weekend.
	   In France, the death toll from the cold snap rose Monday to six
people, three of them homeless men.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris were completely
frozen, and in Mouthe, in eastern France, temperatures fell Monday
morning to minus 21 Celsius (minus 6 F).
	   In Bulgaria, three people died in the northwestern region of
Montana, the daily 24 Chassa reported Monday. Some highways were
blocked and some areas were without power, phones and running
water.
	   The Black Sea ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Constanta in
Romania were closed Monday due to storms, state radio reported.

Open star Rose fails to win Tour card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: will be updated with other scores &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Teen-age star of this year's British
Open as an amateur, Justin Rose failed to win his card for next
season's European pro Tour Monday when he closed the qualifying
competition with an 80, which included an eagle at the last.
	   The 18-year-old Englishman, who tied for fourth at the Open at
Royal Birkdale to post the highest finish for an amateur for 35
years, didn't win a penny in prize money after turning pro
immediately afterwards, missing the cut in all eight tournaments he
played.
	   That meant he joined 180 other hopefuls in the six-round
qualifying competition and wound up with rounds of
78-73-70-71-74-80 for a 14-over total of 446.
	   Rose needed something like a 69 in the final round to join the
top 35 and ties who won their cards. But he was out in 40 after
four bogeys in his first nine holes at the windy San Roque course.
	   He needed to cover the remaining nine in 30 to stand any chance
of making it. But he collected three more bogeys in his finishing
nine, triple bogeyed the next-to-last hole after shooting out of
bounds before finishing with a 20-foot eagle putt.
	   ``I just need a break, it's been a long week,'' Rose said after
his latest ordeal.
	   ``I'm upset because I wanted to come here and make my card. But
life goes on.''
	   His failure to qualify leaves Rose hoping for sponsors'
invitations to tournaments. Otherwise it will be life on the lower
grade Challenge Tour.

Croatia won't attend NATO exercise in Slovenia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's military observers will not
watch a NATO exercise in neighboring Slovenia since the date for
which they were invited to come ``is not appropriate,'' the
state-run news agency HINA quoted a Foreign Ministry official as
saying.
	   The official, who declined to be identified, did not elaborate,
but the Croats may have been offended because they were invited to
come on Wednesday, the same day reporters and common Slovenes may
watch a small part of the war games. The rest of the exercise is
closed to outsiders.
	   The exercise, held for the first time in the former Yugoslav
republic of Slovenia, just few kilometers (miles) from Croatian
border, lasts until Dec. 2.
	   Croatia is eager to be admitted to NATO's Partnership for Peace
program, but the Zagreb government repeatedly has been told that
will happen only when it improves its democracy record.
	   NATO as such has not invited Croatia to attend the exercise. But
the Slovene Defense Ministry said five Croatian army officers could
come on Wednesday, only to see Slovene participants.
	   Up to 1,200 troops from Slovenia, which is a member of the
Partnership for Peace program, are participating in the exercise.
	   ``Croatia thanked Slovenia for the invitation, but we emphasized
that the date is not appropriate,'' the Foreign Ministry official
told HINA.

Sol Melia to become world's ninth largest hotel group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish hotel giant Sol Melia announced
Monday it will merge its various units to create a hotel group it
said will be the world's ninth largest.
	   Sol Melia, owned by the Escarrer family, will fully absorb Melia
Inversiones Americanas, which specializes in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the family's private hotel-construction business
Inmotel.
	   Sol Melia, Spain's largest hotel management company, operates
more than 250 hotels and handles some 65,000 rooms in 25 countries.
Founded by Gabriel Escarrer in 1956 with the first Sol Hotel, it
became the center of his family's hotel empire.
	   ``The integration of the three companies into one will provide
greater financial stability that will allow us to maximize
opportunities for future growth and have a leading position in the
world,'' Escarrer, the company's chairman, said Monday in a press
release.
	   The merger operation will be concluded in the first quarter of
1999 and will reduce company costs.

Villagers burn vehicles, buildings in protest in North Sumatra

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Mobs burned vehicles and damaged a
number of buildings in a continuing protest against a troubled pulp
mill in North Sumatra after one of its guards shot and wounded a
villager, news reports said Monday.
	   At least 10 people were detained after several hundred villagers
took to the streets Sunday and Monday in protest against PT. Inti
Indorayon Utama in the district of Porsea, the official Antara news
agency said.
	   Some policemen and a number of employees were injured when they
blocked stone-throwing villagers who tried unsuccessfully to burn
the factory, Antara said.
	   The villagers then burned an employees' dormitory and damaged
shops, restaurants and houses in the town in North Tapanuli, about
1,500 kilometers (937 miles) northwest of Jakarta.
	   They also burned a number of trucks and motorcycles.
	   The newspaper Suara Pembaruan reported that the villagers had
burned 13 trucks in the initial clash Sunday with workers of the
company.
	   It said that as four truckloads of workers were passing a
volleyball court, a guard on one truck fired on a player picking up
a volleyball on the street the trucks were using.
	   Villagers and environmentalists have accused the company of
pollution, and the provincial parliament has recommended that the
government close it down.

Britain holds meeting of Iraqi opposition groups

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain, the host of a meeting of 16
often-competing Iraqi opposition groups, said Monday it wants to
help coordinate activities of the exiled opponents of President
Saddam Hussein.
	   ``It is almost impossible to argue that Iraq without Saddam
Hussein would not be a better country,'' Foreign Office Minister
Derek Fatchett said after the meeting. ``A change of regime ...
would have to better for the ordinary people of Iraq.''
	   British officials label the meeting the first of a series,
reflecting the greater frankness by the United States and Britain
that a prime aim in ending the stalemate over U.N. weapons
inspections is to topple Saddam.
	   The United States announced last week that it had held talks
with Ahmed Chalabi, head of the Iraqi National Congress, a
London-based opposition group. The U.S. Congress also has approved
a dlrs 97 million aid package to offer support to Iraqi dissidents.
	   British officials said their focus is finding common ground
among the opposition groups.
	   ``If and when there is a change of regime in Iraq, it will be
extremely useful to have the opposition groups working together so
Baghdad does not fall into chaos and anarchy,'' Fatchett said
before the meeting.
	   In Damascus, the Iraqi Communist Party and another Syrian-based
opposition group led by a former member of Saddam's Baath Party
accused Britain of interfering.
	   Fadel Ansari, once a senior Baath official who now leads a
splinter pro-Syrian group in Damascus, said foreign intervention
``strengthens the regime and does not weaken it.''
	   London is a main center for Iraqi exile and opposition groups.
	   At various times, the dissidents have succeeded in bringing
together Shiite Muslim groups, former ruling party officials and
Kurdish guerrillas who sought autonomy in northern Iraq.
	   Opposition groups say they are a key source of information about
Saddam and critical to any rebellion.
	   One London-based group, The Iraqi National Accord, said this
week that it has provided British authorities with a detailed list
of Saddam's international spy network.
	   The document, compiled by Saddam's private secretary, named all
the members of Iraqi intelligence service who pose as diplomats and
was released to the West even before it was on Saddam's desk, the
group said in a report in London's Sunday Telegraph.
	   ``Information like this is priceless in the battle to end
Saddam's tyranny,'' Ayad Alawi, who heads the group, told the
newspaper, adding that Western support is vital.
	   ``There is no point in the West urging Iraqis to overthrow
Saddam if it is not prepared to help,'' he said. ``The first step
toward getting rid of Saddam is to persuade the Iraqi people that
they have friends and supporters outside who can help them
succeed.''

New museum to Egypt's royal family shows crystal, knickknacks

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A museum exhibiting memorabilia of the
Egyptian royal family _ everything from jewel encrusted swords to
weird knickknacks _ opened to the public Monday inside one of the
former royal palaces.
	   The Abdeen Palace Museum, occupying a corner of the 29-acre
(11-hectare) complex of gardens and gilt-walled rooms, offers
Egyptians and others a glimpse into the lives of the until recently
much maligned monarchy.
	   ``We are beginning to show their nice sides which were
obliterated before,'' Maj. Gen. Essam Shehata, deputy chief of
President Hosni Mubarak's staff, said as he led reporters on a tour
of the royal grounds Sunday.
	   Egypt became a republic after a 1952 coup by army officers who
ousted the late King Farouk. The royal family's lands and palaces
were seized, Farouk was exiled to Italy, and official history
referred to the monarchy as ``the squanderers of Egypt's wealth.''
	   The museum was built in the 1930s as a private exhibit for the
collections King Fouad I and later his son, Farouk. It remained
open until 1967, and its new life follows repairs to the palace
from damage done in a 1992 earthquake.
	   Visitors can see King Farouk's hundreds of swords, gold daggers
and pistols, both ancient and modern. One item is a steel dagger
which belonged to German Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, who fought
against the British for control of Egypt in World War II.
	   Since Farouk was a fan of strange knickknacks, his collection
also includes a wooden jewelry box fitted with four miniature
cannons that were designed to fire on any intruder who opened the
box the wrong way _ from the front.
	   Also displayed are some of Farouk's collection of pins with
sayings like ``You wanna buy a duck?'' and ``Let's make a date,''
recalling the king's playboy reputation.
	   More formal trappings are shown, too, such as crystal decanters
and silver goblets emblazoned with the royal family's crest.
	   The Abdeen Palace was ordered built by the Khedive Ismail to
house visitors to the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869. But it
took 11 years to build and was not ready in time for the canal's
inauguration.
	   During Sunday's tour, a modern note intruded on the 19th century
surroundings. Songs by pop singer Celine Dion played from hidden
speakers.
	   The entrance fee to the museum is one pound (29 U.S. cents) for
Egyptian students, two pounds (58 cents) for ordinary Egyptians and
10 pounds (dlrs 3) for foreigners.

Congolese rebel commander survives plane crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Congolese rebel commander Jean-Pierre
Ondekane and 126 troops escaped injury when the Boeing 727 they
were aboard caught fire while taking off in eastern Congo, rebel
radio said Monday.
	   The accident occurred Sunday in Goma, the eastern rebel
stronghold, when the plane owned by GOMAIR of Congo hit a hole at
the end of runway, Radio Goma said.
	   The plane's left wheel burst into flames, which spread to the
rear engine and the right wheel. The plane stopped about 200 meters
(yards) into the grass, and pilots and mechanics doused the fire.
	   The plane was carrying 127 passengers, most of them troops, and
3.5 tons of food to Kisangani, the rebel army's headquarters about
400 kilometers (250 miles) northwest of Goma.
	   Radio Goma, monitored in Kigali, said Ondekane, 36, ruled out an
attempt on his life. He flew to Kisangani, his usual base, on
another plane on Monday.
	   It was the first known plane accident since the rebels began
fighting Aug. 2 to overthrow President Laurent Kabila. They have
run practically nonstop flights of Boeing 727s, Russian-built
Ilyushin-76s and Antonov transport planes to ferry troops and
supplies across Africa's third largest nation.
	   Planes are often the only means to overcome huge distances,
thick forests and lack of roads in eastern Congo.
	   Most of the aircraft and crews used by the rebels were captured
at the beginning of the war. Others planes are being leased.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's ex-President Suharto could
be placed under house arrest if he attempts to interfere with a new
corruption inquiry against him, a news report said.
	   The official Antara news agency quoted Attorney General Muhammad
Ghalib as saying it was possible the former autocrat could be
banned from traveling abroad while the investigation proceeds.
	   On the weekend, Suharto's successor and former protege,
President B.J. Habibie, announced he would appoint a commission of
inquiry to investigate Suharto's wealth.
	   ``If Suharto complicates the investigation, saying that it is
too difficult for him to take part, then the commission could
propose whether or not Suharto be placed under house arrest or
banned from leaving the country,'' Antara quoted Ghalib as saying.
	   Ghalib headed an earlier investigation into graft allegations
against Suharto. However, his efforts were denounced as a whitewash
after he failed to identify any wrongdoing by the ex-head of state.
	   Ghalib said the proposed commission would be independent.
	   The membership and terms of reference of the new inquiry have
not been announced.
	   Some senior members of the ruling Golkar Party, which helped
keep Suharto in power for 32 years, have backed calls for him to be
put under house arrest.
	   ``The purpose is ... if (Suharto) is needed he can be easily
reached,'' Akbar Tanjung, Habibie's state secretary and Golkar
Party chairman, was quoted as saying by the newspaper Indonesian
Observer.
	   Student protesters have called for Suharto to be put on trial
for corruption and human rights abuses during his rule.
	   About 30 protesters marched through an exclusive suburb Monday,
but were blocked by hundreds of troops from approaching the house
where Suharto lives as a virtual recluse.
	   The soldiers stopped them at a park adjacent to the U.S.
ambassador's home.
	   The protest was much smaller than other demonstrations in recent
days during which students called for Suharto to be hanged.
	   Suharto, 77, was forced to quit the presidency in May after a
wave of protests and riots, in which 1,200 people were killed.
	   Opponents allege he amassed a fortune and used his power to
enrich his six children and a clique of cronies.
	   Suharto has said he is innocent.
	   On Sunday, former Australian Prime Minister Paul Keating, who
visited Suharto last week, said the former leader was ready to face
any charges laid against him.
	   Meanwhile, one of Suharto's sons was interrogated by the
attorney general's office over corruption allegations Monday.
	   Hutomo ``Tommy'' Mandala Putra was questioned as part of an
investigation against Beddu Amang, a former chief of a state-run
food distribution organization, the newspaper Suara Pembaruan
reported.
	   It quoted Anton Sujata, a government lawyer, as saying that
Tommy earlier had been banned from leaving the country.
	   The newspaper Terbit reported that investigators were examining
a deal under which Beddu's organization, known as Bulog, allegedly
sold state land to one of Tommy's companies at a cheap price.
	   Terbit said the company built a department store on the land. It
said the state allegedly lost dlrs 16 million on the transaction.
	   Tommy made no comment.
	   Two other Suharto sons, Bambang and Sigit, also have been
questioned over a series of recent bank collapses.

Sol Melia to become world's ninth largest hotel group
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish hotel giant Sol Melia announced
Monday it will merge its various units to create a hotel group it
said will be the world's ninth largest.
	   Sol Melia, owned by the Escarrer family, will fully absorb Melia
Inversiones Americanas, which specializes in Latin America and the
Caribbean, and the family's private hotel-construction business
Inmotel.
	   Sol Melia, Spain's largest hotel management company, operates
more than 250 hotels and handles some 65,000 rooms in 25 countries.
Founded by Gabriel Escarrer in 1956 with the first Sol Hotel, it
became the center of his family's hotel empire.
	   ``The integration of the three companies into one will provide
greater financial stability that will allow us to maximize
opportunities for future growth and have a leading position in the
world,'' Escarrer, the company's chairman, said in a press release
Monday.
	   The merger operation will be concluded in the first quarter of
1999 and will reduce company costs.

Kurd rebel blames two enemies _ Turkish nationalists, military _
</HEADLINE>
for attack on pope &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: for AMS. UPDATES, recasts throughout with Vatican comment.

 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul
II in 1981 wasn't acting alone, a Kurd rebel leader claims in a
letter made public Monday that seeks the pope's support for the
Kurdish cause.
	   The Vatican's only immediate response was that the Kurds and
their opponents should solve their disputes peaceably.
	   Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan wrote John Paul Nov. 18 while he
was still in custody in Rome, La Repubblica daily said. A Rome
court freed Ocalan two days later, rejecting a Turkish warrant for
the guerrilla chief who is Turkey's most-wanted fugitive.
	   Ocalan's letter blames two enemies of the Kurds _ Turkish
nationalists and the Turkish military _ for the May 13, 1981,
attack on the pope in St. Peter's Square.
	   Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca shot the pope in the abdomen. He
is now serving a life sentence in Italy.
	   Agca was a member of the Gray Wolves, a far-right nationalist
group that is the staunchest opponent to the Kurdish cause in
Turkey. The motive for his attack on the pope has never been clear;
Agca has gone back and forth on claims that the Bulgarian secret
service plotted the attack at the instigation of the Soviet Union.
	   Agca escaped from a Turkish jail in 1979, two years before the
attack. Ocalan's letter claimed Agca actually was freed by one of
the generals who later took part in Turkey's 1980 military coup.
	   ``This hateful attack on your person should not be considered an
individual act,'' Ocalan wrote, asking the pope's support for the
Kurdish cause. ``Mr. Ali Agca has not told the truth.''
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Monday only that
the church was mindful ``of the situation and the aspirations of
the Kurds, who live as displaced people in many countries.''
	   The Holy had always advocated resolving the Kurdish issue
``through dialogue and discourse'' and has condemned ``any type of
violence to resolve the problems,'' he said, according to the ANSA
news agency.
	   There was no immediate response to the letter from Turkey, which
has always rejected peace talks with Ocalan's rebel Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in
Turkey's southeast that has killed 37,000 people. Ocalan insisted
in his letter to the pope that he has now renounced ``armed
struggle,'' but the fighting continues.
	   Ocalan is seeking asylum in Italy; an Italian court ordered him
to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany time to decide
whether to pursue extradition on its own terrorism charges.
	   Italy's refusal to hand over Ocalan has outraged Turkey, its
NATO partner. Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Turkey would
make a formal extradition request Wednesday or Thursday, despite
Italy's rejection of the Turkish arrest warrant.
	   On Monday, a convoy of yellow taxi cabs careened past the
Italian Embassy in Ankara, honking horns and flying banners
declaring, ``No to Fiat'' _ although most of the cabs were
Turkish-made Fiat 131s.
	   Economy Minister Gunes Taner said in a newspaper interview
published Monday that he disapproves of the popular movement to end
trade with Italy. The government, he stressed, has not approved any
boycotts.

EU farm ministers poised to lift ban on most British beef exports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Decision expected for later Monday &QL; 
 &UR; By RAF CASERT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union farm ministers were
expected Monday to lift a worldwide export ban on the vast majority
of British beef, a milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has
pitted Britain against its EU allies for almost three years.
	   ``The time is right,'' said EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler
ahead of Monday's EU farm ministers meeting, which was set to scrap
the ban on deboned beef despite continued opposition from at least
Germany and Austria.
	   The decision will go a long way in ending the ``mad cow'' crisis
for British farmers, who were badly hit by the March 1996 ban.
Estimated losses because of the ban amount to over 2 billion pounds
(dlrs 3.3 billion). The crisis undermined confidence in beef
throughout the 15 member nations.
	   Monday's expected decision ``will tend to boost the confidence
of the British consumer and presumably other consumers throughout
the EU and our beef trade and our beef producers will get back to
normal,'' said Dr. John Mann, superintendent of Smithfield Market,
Britain's largest meat market.
	   A panel of veterinary experts voted earlier this month to ease
the ban.
	   Exports of British beef were banned in March 1996 after Britain
announced a possible link between ``mad cow'' disease in British
beef and a fatal brain ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease.
	   Monday's expected decision will be immediately followed by a
campaign to put British beef back on the plates of consumers
throughout the 15-nation EU. Beef exports though will need a final
stamp of approval after another EU inspection round, opening the
way for exports early in the new year.
	   ``We will get the decision we want. We have done what we were
asked to do and can justify Britain's position on the basis of
science and the technical implementation,'' said British Farm
Minister Nick Brown.
	   British government cooperation didn't always come that easy.
	   After the March 1996 ban, the Conservative government of Prime
Minister John Major tried to get the ban lifted and threatened not
to cooperate with the EU.
	   Relations with Brussels improved considerably when Tony Blair
became Prime Minister in May 1997. EU Farm Minister approved a
resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland in March.
	   Before the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of beef,
worth dlrs 1 billion, in 1995.
	   Now British exporters face the task of reclaiming lost markets.
	   ``It will take some time, perhaps a couple of years and then
we'll be back to our normal export trade levels,'' said Mann.

Appeals court jails men given suspended sentence for sexual
</HEADLINE>
assault &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Following protests by feminists against
lenient punishment for sexual assaults, an appeals court on Monday
threw out suspended sentences for three men and sent them to jail.
	   The defendants _ identified as Janusz W., 21, Grzegorz K., 18,
and Seweryn D., 20 _ originally received two-year suspended
sentences for abducting and sexually abusing a teenage girl.
	   Under Monday's ruling, one received a 3 1-2-year sentence and
the others received three-year sentences.
	   Barbara Limanowska of the feminist group Oska welcomed the
appellate ruling but said court sentences for rape were ``still too
low.''
	   The case involved the abduction and beating of a teenage girl in
July 1997 in a village near Opole, 310 kilometers (190 miles)
southwest of Warsaw. The three defendants were convicted of
undressing the victim, beating her and wounding her face with a
sharp object.
	   They tried to rape the girl, who managed to escape.
	   In June, a lower court sentenced them to two years in jail,
suspended for five years because of their young ages and clean
records.
	   Womens' rights groups protested, saying the suspended sentences
showed leniency for people charged with rape and sexual abuse. An
open letter by the feminist groups later in June claimed more than
one third of defendants convicted of rape got suspended sentences
in 1996, compared to 25 percent who received suspended sentences in
1989.
	   A new penal code, which took effect in September, lowered the
possible sentence for rape to two to 12 years in prison, compared
to three to 15 years under the old code.
	   ``There is still an opinion that rape is not such a big crime,''
Limanowska said Monday.
	   According to the Womens' Rights Center, two out of five Polish
women are abused sexually sometime in their lives and only 20
percent of sexual crime is reported to police.

Germany, Italy to discuss Kurdish rebel leader
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Italy-Turkey-Kurds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German and Italian leaders this week will
discuss the fate of a Kurdish rebel chief who has sought political
asylum in Italy but is wanted on German terrorism charges, a
government spokesman said Monday.
	   Germany has deferred asking Italy for Abdullah Ocalan's
extradition for trial, apparently because of fears of unrest among
its 2 million Turkish residents, a quarter of whom are Kurds.
	   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
will take up the case at talks scheduled Friday in Bonn, spokesman
Uwe-Karsten Heye said.
	   They will try ``to see whether there are possibilities to
develop something from this situation that is helpful for all
involved,'' he said. He refused to elaborate.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 in Rome. A Rome court freed him
Friday, rejecting a Turkish warrant for the man Turkey considers
its most-wanted criminal. He was ordered to stay in Rome until Dec.
23 to give Germany time to consider an extradition request.
	   Germany's federal prosecutor's office said last weekend it had
drafted a broader arrest warrant for Ocalan, going beyond 1990
charges of a single murder in Germany.
	   The magazine Der Spiegel said the new charges included
``liquidation of a string of dissidents'' in Germany in the 1980s
and several arson attacks in 1993.
	   Heye insisted Monday that the fresh charges left unchanged
Germany's decision to put off an extradition request for now. A
Justice Ministry spokesman described the revised warrant as a legal
technicality.
	   Ocalan leads the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which has
fought a 14-year-old war for autonomy for Kurds in Turkey's
southeast. Some 37,000 people have been killed.

OPEC faces difficult and limited options at Vienna meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ A global oil glut, last year's
relatively warm North American winter, weakened economies in Asia
and 11-year-low prices spell trouble for OPEC as oil ministers
convene this week, analysts said Monday.
	   Oil ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of
Wednesday's year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday.
	   Average OPEC oil prices in the third quarter are dlrs 12.33 a
barrel, compared to dlrs 18.03 this time last year.
	   Production cuts agreed to in June in an effort to boost prices
haven't had the desired effect. The cuts lowered production by 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   ``They're meeting at a difficult time because the cuts they
instituted in a real sense have not worked,'' said Drollas.
	   Instead, prices stayed flat most of the summer and have weakened
again.
	   The main problem will be hard to fix _ for once, the oil-hungry
world just doesn't seem to want as much of its most vital commodity
as it used to, Drollas said.
	   ``The villain of the piece has been demand. Incremental demand
has decreased,'' he said.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ an
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production, leading to a
glut; a warmer-than-average winter in many places, cutting demand
for heating oil; over-production by several OPEC members; and
weakened world demand, especially in Asia.
	   For OPEC economies, the drop in income is threatening to balloon
budget deficits.
	   Saudi Arabia, which produces 8 million barrels a day and is
OPEC's largest producer, depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of
its income.
	   This year, those revenues are expected to fall 27 percent below
target, bringing in dlrs 25.3 billion, the Saudi British Bank
forecast in a report issued Monday.
	   At current prices, Saudi Arabia is looking at a deficit in 1999
of about dlrs 9 billion the bank estimated. Real economic growth
would fall to 1.7 percent for 1998, compared to 7 percent last
year.
	   Next year doesn't look much better. ``The prolonged period of
relatively low oil prices has persuaded most oil forecasters to be
conservative about 1999,'' the bank said.
	   Bolstering prices will need at least an agreement in Vienna to
extend June's cuts to the end of 1999.
	   Currently, they are due to run out mid-1999.
	   Failure to extend could lead to a rout in prices. ``The market
won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned.
	   Another option _ instituting deeper production cuts _ is
unlikely, Iran's deputy oil minister intimated last week.
	   That would be ``too much for OPEC to handle at the moment,''
Mehdi Hosseini said at a London oil conference.
	   Venezuela, a major player, has any way ruled out further cuts to
its present quota of 2.32 million barrels a day.
	   Worse, several countries _ including Venezuela _ aren't sticking
to the cuts.
	   Most analysts believe Venezuela is producing around 100,000 more
barrels a day than the 2.32 million it is officially permitted.
	   And Indonesia, whacked by its imploded currency and other
economic troubles, is complying to the tune of only 50 percent,
analysts believe.
	   Tighter compliance is ``an absolute imperative,'' Drollas said.
``The logic is clear. You can't talk about further cuts if you
can't comply so far.''

	    &UR; Government liquidates debt-ridden mine after two-week strike
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The government started liquidation
procedures Monday at a debt-ridden state mine where impoverished
workers have been striking for two weeks in hopes of winning a pay
raise.
	   The Zlatograd lead and zinc mine, 300 kilometers (188 miles)
southeast of Sofia, has had a long history of loss making and
industrial unrest. In the latest strike, which started Nov. 10,
some 1,000 miners demanded the government raise their leva 160,000
(dlrs 95) monthly salaries by 200 percent.
	   The average monthly wage in Bulgaria is dlrs 107.
	   The government has refused, citing the leva 230 million (dlrs
140,000) monthly loss of the mine, stemming from too many office
personnel and falling lead and zinc prices on world bourses.
	   Liquidation of the mine will mean that this isolated border area
will lose its principal source of revenue.
	   Bulgaria is being forced to make painful economic decisions in
order to offset the consequences of hyperinflation, which the
previous Socialist government triggered early last year by running
up too much debt to bail out inefficient industries.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's Social Democratic Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine used his European Union debut Monday to
seek support for a left-leaning agenda to shift the economic focus
from fighting inflation to creating jobs.
	   ``In the euro zone there is a need for ... coordination to
create the kind of policy mix that promotes growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine told reporters.
	   The need to intensify cooperation after the euro is launched as
the common currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1, was underscored by
Lafontaine and other ministers from socialist-led government who
pledged on the eve of the EU meeting to work closer together to
boost the economy. But differences over policy confronted ministers
Monday.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, another
socialist, clashed with Lafontaine over proposals for EU-wide taxes
to deter companies crossing borders in search of lower taxes.
Lafontaine said ``it is not logical'' to have competing tax rates.
Brown insisted he would veto any move for unified taxes.
	   ``Tax harmonization is no way forward for Europe,'' Brown told
reporters. ``Tax decisions will continue to be taken in London and
not in Brussels.''
	   Ministers from euro-zone nations met Wim Duisenberg, head of the
European Central Bank, which will set interest rates for the
currency bloc.
	   Duisenberg faces calls for lower rates to help boost
job-creation, especially since inflation is falling to its lowest
levels in decades, just 1 percent in the euro-zone. In contrast,
unemployment in the 11 nations is stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.
	   ``Nobody disputes monetary policy must also support economic
growth and employment, if price stability isn't endangered,''
Lafontaine said. ``We all agree that price stability exists (in the
euro zone).''
	   However, Duisenberg told reporters he felt ``no pressure
whatsoever to cut rates.'' Short-term rates in the euro zone are
expected converge at levels similar to Germany's 3.3 percent money
market.
	   Smaller nations were at odds with their bigger partners over who
should represent the euro-zone internationally, with Germany,
France and Italy unwilling to cede their seats at the G-7 group of
world economic powers to a joint euro-bloc representative.
	   ``It's a chance for Europe to speak with one voice (but) there
is a rift between those that have a seat at the G-7 and the
others,'' said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy.
	   There were hints of a compromise as France backed a proposal for
a rotating presidency and vice-presidency of the euro-zone that
would allow one of the smaller nations to have a seat at G-7
finance meetings alongside the EU's existing G-7 members and the
European Central Bank.
	   An even more contentious issue concerns efforts to overhaul the
EU's budget so the Union can afford its plans to bring in up to 12
new members over the next decade, mostly from former-communist
eastern Europe.
	   Britain, Germany and others are pushing for a freeze that would
keep spending at current levels until 2006. Less well-off EU
members led by Spain fear such rigor will mean them losing out as
funds start flowing to the even poorer easterners.
	   ``I don't believe this is a positive or constructive way
forward,'' said Rodrigo Rato, Spain's economics minister.
	   The EU has to resolve the budget issue by June, 1999, to keep
the expansion plan on track. The question is further complicated by
German demands for cuts in its contribution to EU coffers and
French fears reducing the EU's dlrs 47 billion-a-year agricultural
subsidies will enrage the country's powerful farm lobby.

Dutch Queen postpones visit following Yeltsin's hospitalization
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch Queen Beatrix on Monday
postponed a planned state visit to Russia because President Boris
Yeltsin, who is hospitalized with pneumonia, cannot welcome her.
	   Beatrix and her consort, Prince Claus, were due to fly to Russia
on Wednesday for a three-day visit to Moscow and St. Petersburg.
The Russian government asked them to call off the trip following
Yeltsin's latest health scare.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was rushed to a hospital Sunday with pneumonia and
a high temperature. His temperature returned to normal after
treatment with antibiotics, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said Monday. It was not clear how long Yeltsin would stay in the
hospital.
	   Yeltsin had been due to greet the royal couple on their arrival
in Moscow and was to host a state dinner in Beatrix's honor on
Thursday.
	   No new date for the state visit was immediately announced.

	   KARLSRUHE, Germany (AP) _ Germany has charged an alleged Turkish
terrorist with murder in the death of a restaurant owner who
resisted blackmail attempts, as well as counts of attempted murder
and belonging to a terrorist group, federal prosecutors said
Monday.
	   The suspect, identified only as IIhan Y., 32, has been held in
investigative custody since June. No trial date has been set.
	   In a statement, prosecutors identified the suspect as a leading
member of the Revolutionary People's Liberation Front, known as the
Karatas wing of the leftist extremist group Devrimici Sol that
split into rival groups in 1993. The group is banned in Germany as
a terrorist group.
	   The suspect also is charged in the attempted murder of a member
of a rival Turkish extremist group.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Some dlrs 64,000 of false bills have
been stolen from a courthouse in western Romania, a newspaper
reported Monday.
	   The money, in dlrs 100 bills, was confiscated early this year
when police discovered a counterfeit network. It was being kept as
evidence in a locked room in a courthouse in Timisoara, a city 425
kilometers (265 miles) northwest of Bucharest, the daily National
reported.
	   Police said the money was taken weeks ago but the theft was only
discovered Friday.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Vincent Winter, who won a special miniature
Academy Award for his beguiling performance as a six-year-old in
``The Little Kidnappers,'' has died at age 50.
	   Winter died of a heart attack on Nov. 2 in St. Peter's Hospital,
Chertsey, near his home at Weybridge, 20 miles (30 kms) from
London, The Guardian newspaper reported.
	   The child actor charmed audiences in the 1953 film _ released in
Britain as ``The Kidnappers'' _ that told the story of two small
boys, orphaned and sent to live with their grandfather in a bleak
area of Nova Scotia at the beginning of the century.
	   The boys wanted a dog, but were denied one by the grandfather.
However, one day, they found a baby in the woods and decided to
keep it secretly as a ``pet.''
	   The Independent, a London newspaper, said in a tribute Monday
that Winter, too young to read when the film was being made, was
taught his lines by verbal repetition. He had such a good memory
that he would say his own lines aloud and then mouth the other
parts.
	   Winter and the other child actor, John Whiteley, were both given
special Oscars for ``outstanding juvenile performances.''
	   Winter was born Dec. 29, 1947 in Aberdeen, Scotland and was age
five when he was discovered by a children's acting coach. While he
found early fame with his role in ``The Little Kidnappers'' and
spent much of his life working in film, Winter never repeated that
level of fame.

Israeli and Palestinians seek total of dlrs 1.6 billion in aid

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel and the Palestinians are both asking the
United States for financial help to strengthen their claims in the
West Bank _ requests that could exceed dlrs 1.6 billion.
	   Israeli officials have hinted that the pace of a West Bank
pullback, part of the U.S.-brokered peace accord reached last
month, may depend in part on receiving the money that President
Bill Clinton promised to sweeten the agreement.
	   Israel is expected to ask for dlrs 1.2 billion, officials said.
Its finance minister, Yaakov Neeman, left for Washington, D.C., on
Sunday to request aid to fortify Jewish settlements and build roads
that bypass Palestinian towns _ controversial items that U.S.
officials may resist.
	   Palestinians are lobbying for dlrs 400 million to dlrs 500
million to build a road network that will knit their scattered
villages and towns together and pave the way for statehood. But
they oppose the use of U.S. aid to make Jewish settlers more secure
and Israel's confiscation of land to build the roads.
	   For the United States, the requests pose a dilemma of rising
expectations and conflicting political aims.
	   Moshe Fogel, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's government, said the purpose of the aid was to
``minimize potential friction'' after the next pullback _ which
will leave a dozen Israeli settlements surrounded by
Palestinian-controlled lands.
	   ``That would include the construction of additional bypass
roads, but it would also mean installing the type of protective and
security devices that would improve the local settlements' ability
to deal with potential threats,'' Fogel said.
	   On Monday, residents of the Elon Moreh Jewish settlement seized
a West Bank hilltop outside the settlement as part of their
campaign to gain control over more land ahead of the next troop
pullback.
	   The government considers the settler outpost illegal because it
is outside the boundaries of Elon Moreh, said Peter Lerner,
spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West Bank.
	   It was not clear whether Israeli troops would order settlers to
leave.
	   Since the peace agreement was signed, settler groups have seized
nearly a dozen hills to prevent the land from falling into
Palestinian hands.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 62 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in Romania and
Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 32 people died, most
of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold after
drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). The lowest
temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15 Fahrenheit)
early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
	   In Romania, at least 21 people died from the cold and in
weather-related accidents on snow-covered roads since Friday.
Temperatures plunged to minus 10 Celsius (14 degrees F) early
Monday.
	   About 200 people spent more than 48 hours stranded in their cars
after winds whipped snowdrifts across main highways in southern
Romania. Army vehicles rescued most drivers, but six people froze
to death over the weekend after being trapped in their cars.
	   Dozens of trains were canceled and 200 communities were reported
to be without electricity, the Libertatea newspaper reported
Monday. Some 15 major roads were blocked by snowdrifts as high as
1.5 meters (five feet). Police urged drivers not to travel in snowy
areas.
	   In Bucharest, dozens of cars smashed into other vehicles and
skidded in the icy conditions. The Emergency Hospital in Bucharest
said it treated 80 people for fractures and frostbite over the
weekend.
	   In France, the death toll from the cold snap rose Monday to six
people, three of them homeless men.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris were completely
frozen, and in Mouthe, in eastern France, temperatures fell Monday
morning to minus 21 Celsius (minus 6 F). About 100 homeless people
staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the state-run medical
assistance service in Paris to demand better protection in winter.
	   In Bulgaria, three people died in the northwestern region of
Montana, the daily 24 Chassa reported Monday. Some highways were
blocked and some areas were without power, phones and running
water.
	   The Black Sea ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Constanta in
Romania were closed Monday due to storms, state radio reported.

Russia, Ukraine finalize 1999 gas deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine and Russia have agreed on supplies
of Russian natural gas to Ukraine next year, a deal that will cover
most of this country's gas needs, a senior Ukrainian official said
Monday.
	   Russia will supply up to 62 billion cubic meters (2.1 trillion
cubic feet) of gas to Ukraine in 1999, First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoliy Holubchenko said.
	   Of that amount, up to 32 billion cubic meters (1.1 trillion
cubic feet) will go to the state gas and oil giant Naftogaz Ukrainy
as payment for the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine's
territory to Western Europe, he said.
	   The remaining 30 billion cubic meters (1 trillion cubic feet)
are to be purchased by private gas traders, Holubchenko told the
Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine is the world's sixth largest consumer of gas, and relies
heavily on gas imports from Russia, which has been the country's
primary gas supplier since the 1991 Soviet collapse.
	   Holubchenko said that Ukraine will not change its 1999 gas
transit fee for pumping 1,000 cubic meters (35,000 cubic feet) of
Russian gas through Ukraine, leaving it at dlrs 1.09 per 100
kilometers (60 miles) of pipeline.
	   Russia priced the gas it would supply to Naftogaz Ukrainy at
dlrs 50 for 1,000 cubic meters.
	   The imports of Russian gas, coupled with Ukraine's plans to
extract 18 billion cubic meters (630 billion cubic feet) of gas
from domestic deposits in 1999, are expected to fully cover
Ukraine's annual demand of 80 billion cubic meters (2.8 trillion
cubic feet) of gas.
	   The two countries had wrangled for years over Ukraine's dlrs 1
billion gas debt to Russia, but finally managed to reach a debt
repayment deal earlier this month under which the debt is to be
covered by supplies of food and other commodities.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Monday agreed to
lift a worldwide export ban on the vast majority of British beef, a
milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against
its EU allies for almost three years, an EU official said.
	   A majority of the 15 EU Farm Ministers meeting here voted to
scrap the ban on deboned beef despite continued opposition from
Germany, an official who demanded anonymity said.
	   The decision came a long way in ending the ``mad cow'' crisis
for British farmers, who were badly hit by the ban imposed in March
1996. Estimated losses because of the ban amount to over 2 billion
pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion). The crisis undermined confidence in beef
throughout the 15 member nations.
	   ``That's quite a move forward,'' said Ben Gill, President of
Britain's Ntional Farmers Union. ``That's good news.''

	   ``That would include the construction of additional bypass
roads, but it would also mean installing the type of protective and
security devices that would improve the local settlements' ability
to deal with potential threats,'' Fogel said.
	   On Monday, residents of the Elon Moreh Jewish settlement seized
a West Bank hilltop outside the settlement as part of their
campaign to gain control over more land ahead of the next troop
pullback.
	   The government considers the settler outpost illegal because it
is outside the boundaries of Elon Moreh, said Peter Lerner,
spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West Bank.
	   It was not clear whether Israeli troops would order settlers to
leave.
	   Since the peace agreement was signed, settler groups have seized
nearly a dozen hills to prevent the land from falling into
Palestinian hands.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union on Monday agreed to
lift a worldwide export ban on the vast majority of British beef, a
milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against
its EU allies for almost three years, an EU official said.
	   A majority of the 15 EU Farm Ministers meeting here voted to
scrap the ban on deboned beef despite continued opposition from
Germany, an official who demanded anonymity said.
	   The decision came a long way in ending the ``mad cow'' crisis
for British farmers, who were badly hit by the ban imposed in March
1996. Estimated losses because of the ban amount to over 2 billion
pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion). The crisis undermined confidence in beef
throughout the 15 member nations.
	   ``That's quite a move forward,'' said Ben Gill, president of
Britain's National Farmers Union. ``That's good news.''

	   BRUSSELS : member nations.
	   Germany was the lone holdout to maintain the ban, with France,
Spain, Austria and Luxembourg abstained. The other farm ministers
voted for.
	   Monday's decision ``will tend to boost the confidence of the
British consumer and presumably other consumers throughout the EU
and our beef trade and our beef producers will get back to
normal,'' said Dr. John Mann, superintendent of Smithfield Market,
Britain's largest meat market.
	   The move to significantly ease the ban was boosted early this
month when a majority of veterinary experts endorsed the beef
export plan.
	   Now, the issues goes back to the Commission, which will send
inspector to Britain for a final examination of safety standards,
opening the way for exports early in the new year.
	   ``We have a positive advise from the scientists that this
British beef is safe,'' said Fischler. Exports of British beef were
banned in March 1996 after Britain announced a possible link
between ``mad cow'' disease in British beef and a fatal brain
ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Monday's decision will be immediately followed by a campaign to
put British beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the
15-nation EU. Beef exports though will need a final stamp of
approval.
	   ``It will still be some months before the first shipments of
beef actually resume and there is much work to be done to
re-establish markets,'' said Gill.
	   ``We have done what we were asked to do and can justify
Britain's position on the basis of science and the technical
implementation,'' said British Farm Minister Nick Brown.
	   British government cooperation didn't always come that easy.
	   In the wake of the March 1996 ban, the Conservative government
of Prime Minister John Major tried to get the ban lifted and
threatened a confrontational policy of non-cooperation with the EU.
The Conservative farm minister even refused to heed the call of the
European Parliament to discuss the issue.
	   Relations with Brussels improved considerably when Tony Blair
became Prime Minister in May 1997. EU Farm Minister approved a
resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland in March.
	   Ahead of the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of beef,
totaling some dlrs 1 billion, in 1995.
	   Now British exporters face the task of reclaiming lost markets.
	   ``It will take some time, perhaps a couple of years and then
we'll be back to our normal export trade levels,'' said Mann.

Thorny issues at first EU meeting for Germany's Lafontaine
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's Social Democratic Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine used his European Union debut Monday to
seek support for a left-leaning agenda to shift the economic focus
from fighting inflation to creating jobs.
	   ``In the euro zone there is a need for ... coordination to
create the kind of policy mix that promotes growth and
employment,'' Lafontaine told reporters.
	   The need to intensify cooperation after the euro is launched as
the common currency of 11 EU nations on Jan. 1, was underscored by
Lafontaine and other ministers from socialist-led government who
pledged on the eve of the EU meeting to work closer together to
boost the economy. But differences over policy confronted ministers
Monday.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, another
socialist, clashed with Lafontaine over proposals for EU-wide taxes
to deter companies crossing borders in search of lower taxes.
Lafontaine said ``it is not logical'' to have competing tax rates.
Brown insisted he would veto any move for unified taxes.
	   ``Tax harmonization is no way forward for Europe,'' Brown told
reporters. ``Tax decisions will continue to be taken in London and
not in Brussels.''
	   Ministers from euro-zone nations met Wim Duisenberg, head of the
European Central Bank, which will set interest rates for the
currency bloc.
	   Duisenberg faces calls for lower rates to help boost job
creation, especially since inflation is falling to its lowest
levels in decades, just 1 percent in the euro-zone. In contrast,
unemployment in the 11 nations is stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.
	   ``Nobody disputes monetary policy must also support economic
growth and employment, if price stability isn't endangered,''
Lafontaine said. ``We all agree that price stability exists (in the
euro zone).''
	   However, Duisenberg told reporters he felt ``no pressure
whatsoever to cut rates.'' Short-term rates in the euro zone are
expected converge at levels similar to Germany's 3.3 percent money
market.
	   Smaller nations were at odds with their bigger partners over who
should represent the euro-zone internationally, with Germany,
France and Italy unwilling to cede their seats at the G-7 group of
world economic powers to a joint euro-bloc representative.
	   ``It's a chance for Europe to speak with one voice (but) there
is a rift between those that have a seat at the G-7 and the
others,'' said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy.
	   There were hints of a compromise as France backed a proposal for
a rotating presidency and vice presidency of the euro-zone that
would allow one of the smaller nations to have a seat at G-7
finance meetings alongside the EU's existing G-7 members and the
European Central Bank.
	   An even more contentious issue concerns efforts to overhaul the
EU's budget so the Union can afford its plans to bring in up to 12
new members over the next decade, mostly from former-communist
eastern Europe.
	   Britain, Germany and others are pushing for a freeze that would
keep spending at current levels until 2006. Less well-off EU
members led by Spain fear such rigor will mean them losing out as
funds start flowing to the even poorer easterners.
	   The EU has to resolve the budget issue by June, 1999, to keep
the expansion plan on track. The question is further complicated by
German demands for cuts in its contribution to EU coffers and
French fears reducing the EU's dlrs 47 billion-a-year agricultural
subsidies will enrage the country's powerful farm lobby.

Two countries agree to better relations, Balkan stability
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QC; 
 &UR; By PATRICK QUINN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ In a rare foreign trip, Croatian President
Franjo Tudjman on Monday said Balkan countries must do more to
bridge their age-old differences for stability to come to the
region.
	   ``We examined the positions of the two countries and the efforts
being made to solve problems in the region,'' Tudjman said after
meeting Greek Premier Costas Simitis. ``We have an absolute
identity of views on these issues.''
	   His comment, and others, were a sign that times are changing in
parts of the Balkans, with some countries apparently willing to put
aside old animosities and improve relations.
	   One such sign was Tudjman apparently lauding Greece's stance
during the crisis following the breakup of the former Yugoslavia,
when Athens was one of Serbia's few Western allies because of their
common Orthodox Christian heritage and traditional ties of
friendship.
	   Predominantly Roman Catholic Croatia was often vilified here as
the main cause for the breakup of Yugoslavia and ensuing Bosnian
war.
	   Tudjman's three-day official visit here was also one of his rare
trips abroad since visiting the United States in late 1996 for
medical treatment.
	   Tudjman not only thanked Athens for its ``stance during the
Yugoslav crisis and its contribution so that this crisis was solved
quickly and peacefully,'' but added it was an indication that with
``mutual participation other regional problems like Bosnia and
Kosovo can be solved.''
	   Greek President Costis Stephanopoulos called Tudjman the father
of Croatian independence and said he contributed to ``peace in the
region.''
	   Another sign was Simitis' promise to support Croatia's bid for
future membership in the European Union and the NATO alliance, for
which Tudjman expressed ``his deepest appreciation.''
	   Simitis and Tudjman also said they would work together for the
construction of an ``Adriatic highway'' running from Greece,
through Albania, the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, Croatia,
Bosnia, Slovenia, Italy and finally Austria.
	   ``We are satisfied with the agreement on the highway that will
run along the Adriatic coast,'' a happy Tudjman said after meeting
Simitis.
	   Foreign ministers also signed agreements to bolster tourism
between the two countries and to fight organized crime and the drug
trade.
	   But in an interview with the Athens daily Eleftherotypia,
Tudjman said his country still had problems with Yugoslavia and
with the situation in Bosnia.
	   On Yugoslavia, he said relations could only normalize if the two
countries agree on the status of Prevlaka, Croatia's southernmost
peninsula which borders with Montenegro. Croatia only accepts a
discussion on area security, while Yugoslavia wants to discuss who
will ultimately control the area
	   ``Croatia considers this a security problem,'' Tudjman said,
adding that his country wanted a 28-man United Nations observer
team to leave Prevlaka when its mandate expired on Jan 15.
	   On Bosnia, Tudjman said he was opposed to attempts for imposing
``some regime with a strong central authority, a society of
citizens, or Bosnian nation in southeastern Europe.''
	   Such a regime, Tudjman said, ``will threatened the existence of
Croats in Bosnia.''
	   On Sunday, Bosnian Muslims signed a controversial agreement to
regulate and strengthen relations between Croatia and the Bosnian
Muslim-Croat federation, which controls 51 percent of Bosnia.

Away from protests, many Turks fear return of Kurdish rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A young protester touched his lighter to a
paper Italian flag. Then he tossed the blazing scrap toward the
gates of Italy's embassy, where more than 500 people gathered
Monday to demand the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
	   The flames scorched his fingers.
	   Turkey could also be playing with fire for insisting on Ocalan's
return to a country where the government labels him a super
terrorist and his supporters worship him as a freedom fighter.
	   From think tanks to shop stalls, many Turks worry about the
consequences if Ocalan is ever returned. They also question the
wisdom of strongarm Turkish policies that uprooted Ocalan from his
longtime Syrian base in October.
	   ``How do you put him on trial? What do you do with him?'' asked
Ilnur Cevik, chief columnist for the Turkish Daily News. ``You
could have all these crazy bombers all over the place ... trying
him in absentia is one thing. Doing it in the flesh is another.''
	   Some Turks fear a trial and possible death sentence could make
Ocalan a powerful martyr for Kurdish insurgents, who have battled
Turkish forces for 14 years in a conflict that has claimed nearly
37,000 lives.
	   Even imprisonment could increase his mystique and draw more
attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, from the sparsely
populated southeast to urban centers such as Istanbul and Aegean
port of Izmir.
	   Such concerns, however, have been drowned out by tireless
government protests for Ocalan's extradition and anti-PKK rallies
around Turkey, including daily gatherings outside the Italian
Embassy in Ankara. On Sunday, demonstrators burned Italian clothes
and a Fiat and pressed for a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Sebnem Hacaoglu looked over a flier handed out by demonstrators
blaring ultra-nationalist songs toward the embassy.
	   ``I have a son in the army right now,'' she said. ``I hate
Ocalan, but I'm afraid it could get even worse if Ocalan is here.''
	   Ocalan left Syria in October after Turkey threatened air
strikes. He turned up in Russia and then traveled on a false
passport to Rome, where he requested political asylum Nov. 12.
	   An Italian court refused to consider a Turkish arrest warrant
because of Italy's policy against extradition of any person who
could face the death penalty.
	   Turkey may have miscalculated the outcome of putting Ocalan on
the run, some critics say. Turkish leaders may have wrongly assumed
Ocalan would drift to another nation that the West considers an
international outlaw, possibly Libya or Iran.
	   ``The government got themselves into this mess with its campaign
against Syria,'' said Coskun San, an Ankara University professor
who studies government policies. ``Their demands for Ocalan now are
just a show, but it has no choice but to pursue this show.''
	   Turkish leaders, said San, are now stuck with the possibility of
Ocalan and the PKK trying to expand sympathy and political support
in Europe.
	   ``Turkey would like nothing better than if Ocalan went to a
faraway country like Cuba. Turkey will say, `I'm not happy.' But it
would be very happy,'' he said.
	   Seyfi Tashan, a researcher at the private Foreign Policy
Institute in Ankara, believes Turkey has the ``moral and legal
responsibility to make Ocalan answer for his crimes.''
	   But he acknowledges there could be a high price: escalating the
Kurdish rebellion.
	   ``It's definitely something people are thinking about,'' he
said.
	   Others believe Turkey should redirect its focus from extradition
to trying to exploit Ocalan's absence from the region.
	   ``There is no need for vengeance, no need to tear Ocalan into
pieces,'' said Nur Vergin, a sociologist from Marmara University in
Istanbul. ``Turks should be happy instead because the terrorism he
has started entered a stage of decline.''

Russian pioneer heart surgeon Vladimir Demikhov dies at 82
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vladimir Demikhov, a Russian surgeon who conducted
the world's first animal heart and lung transplants, has died at
the age of 82, a news agency reported Monday.
	   Demikhov died on Sunday after a long illness, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported. It didn't specify the illness or say where
Demikhov died.
	   South African surgeon Christiaan N. Barnard, who performed the
first human heart transplant in 1967, relied on Demikhov's research
and experience, ITAR-Tass said.
	   A pioneer in transplants and artificial organs, Demikhov was the
first to transplant a heart in a dog, in 1946. The dog, which kept
both the old heart and the new one, lived for five months after the
surgery.
	   The next year, Demikhov conducted the first lung transplant,
also in a dog, ITAR-Tass said.
	   In 1952, Demikhov conducted the world's first coronary bypass,
in a dog, a procedure that has since become widespread in human
medicine.
	   Demikhov won broad acclaim in the West, but found it hard to
apply his research at home, where Soviet officials dismissed his
work as ``tricks'' not worth serious attention, the agency said. It
wasn't until this year that Demikhov finally received a government
award for his contribution to national science.
	   Demikhov will be buried on Wednesday at Moscow's Novodevichy
Cemetery, burial ground for prominent Russians including playwright
Anton Chekhov, composer Sergei Prokofiev and Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev.

Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon, three civilians wounded
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two militiamen, three civilians, wounded in
shelling exchanges, ADDS details, background

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon Monday, killing
an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Two Israeli-allied militiamen were also wounded in guerrilla
shelling of a second outpost on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israel retaliated with an air strike and the bombardment of
Lebanese villages facing the enclave, wounding three Lebanese
civilians.
	   Israeli warplanes fired at least one air-to-surface missile at
an area between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north
of the enclave, the officials said.
	   Israeli troops and allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army
militia later fired artillery at a string of villages across from
the occupation zone.
	   Three civilians, including a seven-year-old boy, were wounded in
the shelling and were being treated in a nearby hospital, the
officials said.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the afternoon attack on the Dabshe outpost in the eastern sector of
the Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
	   A Hezbollah statement said guerrillas targeted an Israeli army
tank at the post, scoring ``direct hits.'' The security officials
said one Israeli soldier was killed.
	   The Israeli military confirmed that its aircraft struck targets
in southern Lebanon, but did not comment on the guerrilla raids.
	   The Dabshe outpost is some eight kilometers (five miles) north
of Marjayoun, the main town in the enclave Israel has occupied
since 1985.
	   The two militiamen were lightly wounded when guerrilla shells
struck a militia outpost near the Kfar Tibnit crossing point which
links the occupied zone with the rest of southern Lebanon.
	   The exchanges Monday come at a time of heightened tension in
south Lebanon. Three Israeli soldiers were killed and four others
wounded last Monday in a Hezbollah roadside bombing. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to drive some 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen from the enclave. Israel
maintains the occupation is necessary to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla raids.

Bus carrying American tourists attacked in Iran

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two grafs at end with condemnation of attack by
Iranian paper. No Pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Assailants shouting anti-American slogans
used stones and iron rods to attack a bus carrying U.S. tourists,
the Iran News reported Monday.
	   The attack was believed to have been triggered by reports in
hard-line newspapers accusing the visiting Americans of being U.S.
officials and members of the CIA posing as tourists.
	   The attack happened Saturday morning as the group arrived at the
Esteglal Hotel in northern Tehran where they were staying, the
paper said.
	   Men stopped the bus and broke all of its windows before the
driver sped off to another hotel and called the police, the paper
said.
	   Police escorted the 13 tourists to their hotel, the Iran News
said. Other accounts said some of the Americans suffered minor
injuries and cuts from flying glass.
	   A Muslim extremist group claiming responsibility for the attack
had a slightly different account, saying its members threw stones
at the tourists and injured some as they got off the bus to enter
the hotel, the al-Hayat newspaper reported.
	   The London-based Arabic daily said its office in Tehran received
an anonymous phone call from someone speaking on behalf of the
Fedayeen Islam, or ``Volunteers for Martyrdom for Islam,'' claiming
it carried out the attack.
	   ``This is a lesson and a warning to those spies,'' the paper
quoted the caller as saying.
	   The Fedayeen Islam also claimed responsibility Monday in Tehran.
	   ``This was an operation against U.S. spies and a warning to the
officials who invited them,'' its statement said, apparently
referring to President Mohammad Khatami's call for cultural
exchanges between Americans and Iranians.
	   American tourists have trickled back to Iran since Khatami, who
took office last year, urged informal contacts between the two
countries.
	   The Fedayeen Islam was active before the 1979 Islamic
revolution. It had not been heard of in years until earlier this
month, when it threatened to kill any Americans hostages from the
1979 U.S. Embassy takeover if they ever returned to Iran.
	   The students who stormed the embassy had invited the 52 hostages
to return on the anniversary of the seizure this year. Most of
those who held the embassy are now considered moderates who support
Khatami and his urging of an open society.
	   But a new breed of hard-liners clustered around Iran's supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, is opposed to any compromise with
the United States.
	   An Iranian newspaper Monday condemned the attack saying it went
against Iran's tradition of hospitality.
	   ``Doesn't the attack on the bus carrying the group of tourists
visiting Iran, the land of hospitable people, damage our Islamic
and Iranian reputation. It gives the impression that our country is
not a safe place and no more tourists will dare come to Iran,'' the
Etelaat evening paper said.

EU lifts ban on vast majority of British beef exports

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union agreed Monday to
lift a worldwide export ban on the vast majority of British beef,
an official said. The development would be a milestone in the ``mad
cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against its EU allies.
	   A majority of the 15 EU farm ministers meeting in Brussels voted
to scrap the ban on deboned beef despite continued opposition from
Germany, according to an official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   British farmers were badly hit by the ban on deboned beef,
imposed in March 1996 after Britain announced a possible link
between mad cow disease in British beef and a fatal brain ailment
in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   ``That's quite a move forward,'' said Ben Gill, President of
Britain's National Farmers Union. ``That's good news.''
	   Losses resulting from the ban have been estimated at more than
dlrs 3.3 billion. The crisis undermined confidence in beef
throughout the EU's 15 member nations.
	   The move to significantly ease the ban was boosted early this
month at a meeting of veterinary experts. Eight EU countries at the
meeting endorsed the beef export plan. Five opposed it and two
abstained.
	   Monday's decision will be followed immediately by a campaign to
put British beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the
15-nation EU.
	   The Conservative government of Prime Minister John Major tried
to get the ban lifted and threatened a confrontational policy of
non-cooperation with the EU. The Conservative farm minister even
refused to heed the call of the European Parliament to discuss the
issue.
	   Relations with the EU improved considerably when Tony Blair
became British prime minister in May 1997. EU farm ministers
approved a resumption of beef exports from Northern Ireland in
March.
	   In 1995, before the ban, Britain exported about 70,000 tons, or
dlrs 1 billion worth of beef.
	   Now British exporters face the task of reclaiming lost markets.
	   ``It will take some time, perhaps a couple of years and then
we'll be back to our normal export trade levels,'' said Dr. John
Mann, superintendent of Smithfield Market, Britain's largest meat
market.

<TEXT>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) _ Danish police on Monday announced the
country's largest seizure of heroin _ 30 kilograms (66 pounds)
taken from a Dane as he drove off a ferry from Germany.
	   The seizure of the uncut brown heroin, valued at 50 million
kroner (dlrs 8 million), took place last month in Gedser, a
southern port for ferries from Rostock and Luebeck.
	   Police said they had kept quiet about the serizure until now
because of a continuing drug investigation.
	   The car's driver, a 19-year-old Dane, told police he had been on
a tourist trip and that the car was borrowed from a friend. Both
the driver and the friend have been arrested, but their identities
have not been released.

Israeli soldier killed in Lebanon, three civilians wounded

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with two militiamen, three civilians, wounded in
shelling exchanges, ADDS details, background

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars Monday at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, killing
an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Two Israeli-allied militiamen were also wounded in guerrilla
shelling of a second outpost on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israel retaliated with an airstrike and the bombardment of
Lebanese villages facing the enclave, wounding three Lebanese
civilians.
	   Israeli warplanes fired at least one air-to-surface missile at
an area between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north
of the enclave, the officials said.
	   Israeli troops and allied militiamen of the South Lebanon Army
militia later fired artillery at a string of villages across from
the occupation zone.
	   Three civilians, including a seven-year-old boy, were wounded in
the shelling and were being treated in a nearby hospital, the
officials said.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the afternoon attack on the Dabshe outpost in the eastern sector of
the Israeli-occupied enclave in south Lebanon.
	   A Hezbollah statement said guerrillas targeted an Israeli army
tank at the post, scoring ``direct hits.'' The security officials
said one Israeli soldier was killed.
	   The Israeli military confirmed that its aircraft struck targets
in southern Lebanon, but did not comment on the guerrilla raids.
	   The Dabshe outpost is some eight kilometers (five miles) north
of Marjayoun, the main town in the enclave Israel has occupied
since 1985.
	   The two militiamen were lightly wounded when guerrilla shells
struck a militia outpost near the Kfar Tibnit crossing point which
links the occupied zone with the rest of southern Lebanon.
	   The exchanges Monday come at a time of heightened tension in
south Lebanon. Three Israeli soldiers were killed and four others
wounded last Monday in a Hezbollah roadside bombing. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to drive some 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen from the enclave. Israel
maintains the occupation is necessary to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla raids.

Amnesty International condemns Congo violence, world's

indifference &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ In a report issued on the eve of
Congolese President Laurent Kabila's visit to Belgium, Amnesty
International on Monday highlighted atrocities in Congo committed
by both government and opposition forces.
	   ``Since August 2, 1998, fighting in (Congo) has dramatically
endangered the lives of millions of civilians,'' AI said.
	   The international human rights group's report stressed all
parties in the conflict were waging a war against civilians.
	   The AI report cited widespread human rights abuses by the
opposition Congolese Rally for Democracy and its allies.
	   It said armed forces loyal to President Kabila have massacred
civilians suspected of sympathizing with the opposition.
	   The report comes a day before Kabila starts a two-day visit to
Belgium, his first to Congo's former colonial ruler since he took
power after toppling the late President Mobutu Sese Seko in 1997.
	   Last Friday, a Belgian lawyer filed suit against Kabila and two
aides, saying they violated international law by inciting ethnic
hatred against Congo's Tutsi minority.
	   AI did not take sides in that case but said it supported an
inquiry into human rights violations by all factions in Congo.
	   ``Those found responsible for these violations, whether it be
President Kabila or someone else, must go on trial,'' AI spokesman
Godfrey Byaruhanga told a news conference.
	   AI condemned the indifference of the international community
while people were being arrested and killed and hundreds of
thousands live in refugee camps in Congo and neighboring Tanzania.
	   AI also lashed out at neighboring countries that supply arms and
troops to both sides of the Congolese conflict. Angola, Zimbabwe,
Namibia and Chad actively support the government in Kinshasa, while
Rwanda, Uganda, Burundi back opposition ranks, the report said.
	   In a separate report, AI denounced continuing violence in
Burundi, another conflict that has largely faded from the
international community's radar screens.
	   ``Soldiers of the Tutsi-dominated Burundian army have
deliberately killed this year alone hundreds of men, women and
children - virtually all of them Hutu. The various Hutu-dominated
armed opposition groups and other militias active in Burundi have
killed scores of unarmed civilians,'' AI said.
	   During his two-visit to Belgium, Kabila is to meet with European
Union and Belgian officials.

	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has guaranteed
the safety of players of Juventus of Turin, who fear they may be
attacked during Wednesday's match in Turkey because of the
country's political tensions with Italy.
	   The Italians are scheduled to play a Champions League match
against Galatasaray in Istanbul. But some Juventus players have
said they would fear for their lives in Turkey, where thousands of
people have taken to the streets over the past week to protest
Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial as a
terrorist.
	   The governing body of European soccer, UEFA, was scheduled to
announce Monday when and where the game would be played.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday. ``We are also considering to ban
demonstrations in Istanbul until the match.''
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces will be assigned to provide the security during
the match.

OPEC faces difficult and limited options at Vienna meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ A global oil glut, last year's
relatively warm North American winter, weakened economies in Asia
and 11-year-low prices spell trouble for OPEC as oil ministers
convene this week, analysts said Monday.
	   Oil ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of
Wednesday's year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday.
	   Average OPEC oil prices in the third quarter are dlrs 12.33 a
barrel, compared to dlrs 18.03 this time last year.
	   Production cuts agreed to in June in an effort to boost prices
haven't had the desired effect. The cuts lowered production by 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   ``They're meeting at a difficult time because the cuts they
instituted in a real sense have not worked,'' said Drollas.
	   Instead, prices stayed flat most of the summer and have weakened
again.
	   The main problem will be hard to fix _ for once, the oil-hungry
world just doesn't seem to want as much of its most vital commodity
as it used to, Drollas said.
	   ``The villain of the piece has been demand. Incremental demand
has decreased,'' he said.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ an
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production, leading to a
glut; a warmer-than-average winter in many places, cutting demand
for heating oil; over-production by several OPEC members; and
weakened world demand, especially in Asia.
	   For OPEC economies, the drop in income is threatening to balloon
budget deficits.
	   Saudi Arabia, which produces 8 million barrels a day and is
OPEC's largest producer, depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of
its income.
	   This year, those revenues are expected to fall 27 percent below
target, bringing in dlrs 25.3 billion, the Saudi British Bank
forecast in a report issued Monday.
	   At current prices, Saudi Arabia is looking at a deficit in 1999
of about dlrs 9 billion the bank estimated. Real economic growth
would fall to 1.7 percent for 1998, compared to 7 percent last
year.
	   Next year doesn't look much better. ``The prolonged period of
relatively low oil prices has persuaded most oil forecasters to be
conservative about 1999,'' the bank said.
	   Bolstering prices will need at least an agreement in Vienna to
extend June's cuts to the end of 1999.
	   Currently, they are due to run out by mid-1999.
	   Failure to extend could lead to a rout in prices. ``The market
won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned.
	   Another option, instituting deeper production cuts, is unlikely,
Iran's deputy oil minister intimated last week.
	   That would be ``too much for OPEC to handle at the moment,''
Mehdi Hosseini said at a London oil conference.
	   Venezuela, a major player, has any way ruled out further cuts to
its present quota of 2.32 million barrels a day.
	   Worse, several countries, including Venezuela, aren't sticking
to the cuts.
	   Most analysts believe Venezuela is producing around 100,000 more
barrels a day than the 2.32 million it is officially permitted.
	   And Indonesia, whacked by its imploded currency and other
economic troubles, is complying to the tune of only 50 percent,
analysts believe.
	   Tighter compliance is ``an absolute imperative,'' Drollas said.
``The logic is clear. You can't talk about further cuts if you
can't comply so far.''

Saudi Interior Minister in Yemen to restart border talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AHMAD AL-HAJ &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin
Abdul-Aziz arrived in Yemen Monday in a bid to restart stalled
talks on a border dispute between the two neighbors.
	   Nayef was met at the airport by his Yemeni counterpart, Hussein
Mohammed Arab, and will meet with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh later Monday, a Yemeni official said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Fighting has occasionally erupted along the 2,000-kilometer
(1,300-mile) frontier between Yemen and Saudi Arabia.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has long contested
Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts of the
Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially lucrative oil
fields. The two nations have yet to demarcate a mountainous border
in the east.
	   Border talks have been stalled since July. Yemen is frustrated
by the lack of progress and has said it will consider seeking
international arbitration.
	   The two sides will also discuss Yemeni accusations that Saudi
Arabia helps finance its exiled opposition and was behind a series
of explosions in the southern port city of Aden last year, the
official said. Yemen also claims that a number of men implicated in
an assassination attempt against Arab last year are hiding out in
Saudi Arabia.
	   For its part, Saudi Arabia accuses Yemen of allowing arms and
drugs to be smuggled through its borders to Saudi Arabia, the
official said.

	   KIEL, Germany (AP) _ A day after crews put out a month-old blaze
aboard a leaking tanker, workers began pumping 600 tons of oil from
the stranded craft's hull Monday.
	   Fire broke out on the Pallas at the end of October, forcing the
crew to abandon the burning boat off the coast of Denmark. Stormy
seas disrupted attempts to put the blaze out, and crews also were
unable to anchor the freighter as it drifted into German waters.
	   Oil from the tanker has harmed or killed 8,800 birds and has
washed up on beaches of several North Sea islands.

the southwest sections of Puerto Rico to produce scattered showers
and possibly a thunderstorm. Nevertheless, no widespread rainfall
activity is expected as an upper level high pressure system will
limit the development of showers and thunderstorms.
	   A weak cold front located several hundred miles north of our
area will continue to move slowly east-southeast and will produce
an increase in clouds and showers over our area late tonight and
Tuesday morning.

OPEC faces difficult and limited options at Vienna meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS lead to CORRECT that warm weather refers to now sted last
winter; SUBS 11th graf to CLARIFY &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ A global oil glut, mild North American
weather, weakened economies in Asia and 11-year-low prices spell
trouble for OPEC as oil ministers convene this week, analysts said
Monday.
	   Oil ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of
Wednesday's year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday.
	   Average OPEC oil prices in the third quarter are dlrs 12.33 a
barrel, compared to dlrs 18.03 this time last year.
	   Production cuts agreed to in June in an effort to boost prices
haven't had the desired effect. The cuts lowered production by 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   ``They're meeting at a difficult time because the cuts they
instituted in a real sense have not worked,'' said Drollas.
	   Instead, prices stayed flat most of the summer and have weakened
again.
	   The main problem will be hard to fix _ for once, the oil-hungry
world just doesn't seem to want as much of its most vital commodity
as it used to, Drollas said.
	   ``The villain of the piece has been demand. Incremental demand
has decreased,'' he said.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ an
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production, leading to a
glut; warmer-than-average weather in many places this autumn,
cutting demand for heating oil; over-production by several OPEC
members; and weakened world demand, especially in Asia.

Away from protests, many Turks fear return of Kurdish rebel chief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING protectively to all lines &QL; 
 &UR; By BRIAN MURPHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A young protester touched his lighter to a
paper Italian flag. Then he tossed the blazing scrap toward the
gates of Italy's embassy, where more than 500 people gathered
Monday to demand the extradition of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan.
	   The flames scorched his fingers.
	   Turkey could also be playing with fire for insisting on Ocalan's
return to a country where the government labels him a super
terrorist and his supporters worship him as a freedom fighter.
	   From think tanks to shop stalls, many Turks worry about the
consequences if Ocalan is ever returned. They also question the
wisdom of strongarm Turkish policies that uprooted Ocalan from his
longtime Syrian base in October.
	   ``How do you put him on trial? What do you do with him?'' asked
Ilnur Cevik, chief columnist for the Turkish Daily News. ``You
could have all these crazy bombers all over the place ... trying
him in absentia is one thing. Doing it in the flesh is another.''
	   Some Turks fear a trial and possible death sentence could make
Ocalan a powerful martyr for Kurdish insurgents, who have battled
Turkish forces for 14 years in a conflict that has claimed nearly
37,000 lives.
	   Even imprisonment could increase his mystique and draw more
attacks by the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, from the sparsely
populated southeast to urban centers such as Istanbul and Aegean
port of Izmir.
	   Such concerns, however, have been drowned out by tireless
government protests for Ocalan's extradition and anti-PKK rallies
around Turkey, including daily gatherings outside the Italian
Embassy in Ankara. On Sunday, demonstrators burned Italian clothes
and a Fiat and pressed for a boycott of Italian goods.
	   Sebnem Hacaoglu looked over a flier handed out by demonstrators
blaring ultra-nationalist songs toward the embassy.
	   ``I have a son in the army right now,'' she said. ``I hate
Ocalan, but I'm afraid it could get even worse if Ocalan is here.''
	   Ocalan left Syria in October after Turkey threatened air
strikes. He turned up in Russia and then traveled on a false
passport to Rome, where he requested political asylum Nov. 12.
	   An Italian court refused to consider a Turkish arrest warrant
because of Italy's policy against extradition of any person who
could face the death penalty.
	   Turkey may have miscalculated the outcome of putting Ocalan on
the run, some critics say. Turkish leaders may have wrongly assumed
Ocalan would drift to another nation that the West considers an
international outlaw, possibly Libya or Iran.
	   ``The government got themselves into this mess with its campaign
against Syria,'' said Coskun San, an Ankara University professor
who studies government policies. ``Their demands for Ocalan now are
just a show, but it has no choice but to pursue this show.''
	   Turkish leaders, said San, are now stuck with the possibility of
Ocalan and the PKK trying to expand sympathy and political support
in Europe.
	   ``Turkey would like nothing better than if Ocalan went to a
faraway country like Cuba. Turkey will say, `I'm not happy.' But it
would be very happy,'' he said.
	   Seyfi Tashan, a researcher at the private Foreign Policy
Institute in Ankara, believes Turkey has the ``moral and legal
responsibility to make Ocalan answer for his crimes.''
	   But he acknowledges there could be a high price: escalating the
Kurdish rebellion.
	   ``It's definitely something people are thinking about,'' he
said.
	   Others believe Turkey should redirect its focus from extradition
to trying to exploit Ocalan's absence from the region.
	   ``There is no need for vengeance, no need to tear Ocalan into
pieces,'' said Nur Vergin, a sociologist from Marmara University in
Istanbul. ``Turks should be happy instead because the terrorism he
has started entered a stage of decline.''

In Lebanon, tens of thousands await prize of citizenship
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RODEINA KENAAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In Lebanon _ as in most Arab countries _
citizenship is not a matter of where you are born, but a prize to
be sought. And as many as 275,000 people are hoping Lebanon's new
president will give them such a reward after he takes office
Tuesday.
	   Lebanon is not about to expel its foreign residents, but many
people who have lived here for decades _ or even generations _ want
to be citizens of the only homeland they know.
	   For people like Mustafa Jaber, a 45-year-old Jordanian who came
to Lebanon when he was 10, such a decree would simply confirm his
identity.
	   ``I consider myself a Lebanese already,'' said the Muslim
furniture store owner. ``My whole family is in Lebanon. My wife of
15 years is Lebanese ... My four children speak Lebanese Arabic and
even my accent has changed.''
	   The citizenship debate in this nation of 3.2 million is about
religion. A 15-year civil war fought by Christians and Muslims
ended in 1990, but arguments still rage about each sides power and
numbers.
	   President Elias Hrawi planned to decree citizenship for foreign
residents _ mostly Muslims _ before leaving office. But vehement
opposition among his Maronite Catholic community _ and a heart
attack that kept him away from work for a week _ scuttled the plan.
	   Hrawi's last Cabinet meeting passed Thursday with no decree, and
now the would-be citizens are looking to the next president, Emile
Lahoud, who takes over Tuesday. Lahoud, also a Maronite, has not
spoken of the controversial decree.
	   In the Arab world, even being born in a country is not enough to
get citizenship _ which is withheld for a raft of economic and
political reasons.
	   In Kuwait, about 120,000 stateless Arabs are not citizens though
many have lived there for generations. The government claims they
only want Kuwait's generous welfare benefits.
	   In other oil-rich Gulf countries, denying citizenship is a way
to control expatriate workers who far outnumber the native
populations. In Egypt, women married to Palestinian men can't get
citizenship for their children _ since they're supposed to be
citizens of a future Palestine.
	   The Lebanese law, allowing citizenship for any foreigner
residing here for five years, was not applied for decades to tens
of thousands who moved from other Arab countries to Lebanon seeking
freedom and economic opportunity.
	   Then in 1994, the government naturalized somewhere between
130,000 and 480,000 foreigners _ no official figure was disclosed _
leading to the present dispute.
	   Muslim foreigners were the main beneficiaries. Christians,
already a minority estimated at about 45 percent, saw the move as a
threat to the country's delicate sectarian makeup.
	   ``We don't even know the kind of people who were granted
citizenship,'' Pierre Helou, head of the Maronite League political
grouping, said in a television interview.
	   Maronites complained that as many as 50,000 Palestinians were
included despite rules against granting Palestinians citizenship to
preserve their right of return to their homeland.
	   The government denied the accusation. But the new decree that
Hrawi was to sign covers 45,000 to 275,000 people _ again, no
official figures exist _ and is said to be stacked with Christians
to offset the 1994 decree.
	   But now the Maronites, the country's main Christian sect, are
complaining the plan would accept non-Maronite Christians as
Lebanese, including poor Egyptian workers and some Syrians and
Jordanians who have never lived in Lebanon.
	   ``You can't rectify an error with another error,'' a conference
of Maronite bishops led by Cardinal Nasrallah Sfeir declared
earlier this month.
	   But many like Mustafa, the would-be citizen from Jordan,
complain the Christian argument is denying them citizenship in the
place they call home.
	   ``My last visit to Jordan was 18 years ago to attend a wedding
and it was for one day. I don't recall the previous visit,''
Mustafa said.

Italian priest says he helped prostitutes obtain abortions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Vatican refused comment Monday on the
disclosure by a priest in the northern city of Genoa that he had
been referring pregnant prostitutes to a doctor for abortions.
	   The Rev. Andrea Gallo told Italian media on Sunday he had helped
with a Genoa center that provided clean syringes to drug addicts
and condoms to prostitutes, along with hot beverages.
	   Gallo said he would counsel prostitutes against abortions, then
refer them to a doctor friend if they still wanted the procedure.
	   ``Some of them told me that, as punishment, they would take such
violent kicks in the stomach from their pimps that they would lose
blood,'' he said. ``What should we have done, leave them in the
hands of back-alley abortionists, or wait for the pimps to finish
the job?''
	   ``I haven't renounced my principles,'' Gallo insisted. ``I know
that abortion is a sin.''
	   The Vatican refused comment. A spokesman for the diocese of
Genoa, Monsignor Giulio Venturini, said it would be a matter
between Archbishop Dionigi Tettamanzi and the priest.
	   ``If the archbishop has anything to say, he will say it directly
to those involved,'' Venturini said.

U.S. Embassy in Liberia resumes operations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ The United States Embassy in Liberia
has resumed normal operations, signifying an end to a diplomatic
standoff triggered by a gun battle at the embassy's entrance, an
embassy spokesman said Monday.
	   Charge d'Affaires Donald Petterson told The Associated Press
that Washington had accepted an apology issued last week by the
Liberian government.
	   ``The United States government is satisfied with the apology,''
Petterson said, adding the embassy had resumed visa and consular
operations.
	   Embassy services were scaled back following the shooting in
September.
	   Government troops opened fire at Liberia's former warlord
Roosevelt Johnson as he tried to seek shelter at the embassy.
	   At least three Liberians were killed and two Americans were
wounded just outside the embassy gates.
	   Diplomats said the Liberian soldiers were standing on the
compound's property when they opened fire.
	   Johnson managed to find refuge in the embassy and was airlifted
out of the country using the U.S. diplomatic compound's helipad.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients and hundreds of
American diplomats filled the sprawling embassy compound.
	   Although the flow of aid has dropped off with the end of the
Cold War and as a result of Liberia's civil war, the United States
still earmarked about dlrs 48 million for Liberia last year.
	   President Charles Taylor, who was also a warlord during
Liberia's brutal seven-year civil war, was elected into office last
year. The war ended in 1996.

All-French Monaco-Marseille draws crowd; Liverpool goes to Celta
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Monaco's Stade Louis II stadium will be packed
Tuesday for the UEFA Cup's first all-French match in history.
	   But most will be from visiting Marseille, France's most
passionate fans. Monaco rarely attracts more than 5,000 for home
matches.
	   With four teams apiece, France and Spain dominate Tuesday's
eight UEFA Cup third-round, first-leg matches. Spain has its own
domestic dispute with Atletico Madrid going to league rival Real
Sociedad.
	   Three Italian and two Swiss clubs are still alive with the other
berths going to Belgium, Scotland and England.
	   The games: Monaco vs. Olympique Marseille, Roma vs. FC Zurich,
Grasshoppers vs. Bordeaux, Real Sociedad vs. Atletico Madrid, Lyon
vs. Club Brugges, Rangers vs. Parma, Celta vs. Liverpool, Bologna
vs. Real Betis.
	   England's Liverpool, twice UEFA Cup champions and a four-time
Champions Cup winners but mired at mid-table in the domestic
standings, will be playing its first European match under coach
Gerald Houllier now that co-manager Roy Evans has quit.
	   The Reds are fresh from a 4-2 weekend win over English league
leader Aston Villa. Celta, Spain's hottest team _ which eliminated
Villa from the second round _ stumbled over the weekend with a 2-0
loss to lowly Alaves.
	   ``I think it is the best possible matchup because both teams are
coming into this round in good shape. It will be a historic game,''
said Celta coach Victor Fernandez.
	   Asked about the weekend loss, he replied, ``It's already
forgotten.''
	   A 32,000 sellout _ the first in four years _ is expected in
Spain's northwestern port of Vigo with 500 police deployed to deter
any English hooligans. It will be only Celta's seventh European
game in history. One English newspaper calculated Liverpool played
its seventh back in 1965.
	   Celta's strikeforce of Lubo Penev, Alexandre Mostovoi and Valery
Karpin will attack a porous Liverpool defense with Robbie Fowler _
a hat trick against Villa _ and Michael Owen keying the Reds.
	   In the French showdown, Marseille striker Fabrizio Ravanelli and
defender Cyril Domoraud are injured and defender William Gallas in
suspended. In-form Florian Maurice and the burly Titi Camara are
likely to form Marseille's strikeforce.
	   Monaco, in a run of poor form that has seen it slump to fifth
place in the standings, is emerging from an early season injury
crisis with only long-term victim Japhet N'Doram remains
unavailable.
	   ``The problem with playing against Marseille is that we are not
going to play a single home match,'' grumbled Monaco striker David
Trezeguet.
	   In the all-Spanish affair in San Sebastian, Atletico de Madrid
may be without the services of Juninho. The Brazilian star sat out
a 6-1 weekend rout of Valladolid on a red card. His replacement
Fernando Correa scored a goal and coach Arrigo Sacchi is
considering keeping Correa in the lineup.
	   Atletico beat Real Sociedad 4-1 earlier this season in Madrid.
	   AS Roma, hosting Swiss side Zurich, is tied for second in Serie
A with a wide-open style of play revolving around captain Francesco
Totti, the 22-year-old striker who made his first national team
start last week.
	   Italy international midfielder Eusebio Di Francesco and Cameroon
defender Pierre Wome are both suspended, while Brazilian defender
Cafu is out with a muscle strain.
	   AC Parma, fifth in Italy after a 1-0 loss Saturday to Cagliari,
goes to Glasgow Rangers with a slew of injury problems. Strikers
Enrico Chiesa, Colombia's Faustino Asprilla and Argentina's Abel
Balbo are all out, as are midfielders Diego Fuser, Raffaele Longo
and Pierluigi Orlandini and Argentine defender Nestor Sensini.
	   Rangers, on top in Scotland, are also reeling after 5-1 loss
over the weekend to bitter rival Celtic.
	   In Zurich, Bordeaux _ second in the French standings _ is
without suspended midfielder Ali Benarbia, who has been one the
team's key players since moving from Monaco in pre-season.
Grasshoppers are still alive only because Italian club Fiorentina
was suspended from the competition because of a firework thrown in
Italy during the second round, second leg.
	   In Bologna, Italy, visiting Betis could face sub-zero (Celsius)
temperatures with a chance of snow. Bologna will be without
defender Amedeo Mangone (suspended), and midfielders Carlo Nervo,
defender Massimo Paganin and French striker Cristophe Sanchez (all
injured). Four others are not eligible for UEFA Cup action until
the new year: defender Giovanni Bia, midfielders Jonathan Binotto
and Giampiero Maini, and Russian striker Igor Simutenkov.
	   Brazilian star Denilson is doubtful for Betis after a long
flight back from Brazil for a friendly. He played only the last 15
minutes of Saturday's win over Oviedo for coach Javier Clemente,
who has three wins for the team since taking over.I
	   In Lyon, France, Lyon will be without suspended defender David
Linares and Christian Bassila, and Brugges will miss suspended
defender Tjorven de Brul.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ A global oil glut, mild North American
weather, weakened economies in Asia and 11-year-low prices spell
trouble for OPEC as oil ministers convene this week, analysts said
Monday.
	   Oil ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of
Wednesday's year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday.
	   Average OPEC oil prices in the third quarter are dlrs 12.33 a
barrel, compared to dlrs 18.03 this time last year.
	   Production cuts agreed to in June in an effort to boost prices
haven't had the desired effect. The cuts lowered production by 2.6
million barrels per day.
	   ``They're meeting at a difficult time because the cuts they
instituted in a real sense have not worked,'' said Drollas.
	   Instead, prices stayed flat most of the summer and have weakened
again.
	   The main problem will be hard to fix _ for once, the oil-hungry
world just doesn't seem to want as much of its most vital commodity
as it used to, Drollas said.
	   ``The villain of the piece has been demand. Incremental demand
has decreased,'' he said.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ an
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production, leading to a
glut; warmer-than-average weather in many places this autumn,
cutting demand for heating oil; over-production by several OPEC
members; and weakened world demand, especially in Asia.

Palestinian archaeologist uncovers mosaic in Manger Square

	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A large mosaic with geometric
designs from the Byzantine period has been uncovered during the
remodeling of Manger Square, just outside the Church of the
Nativity, a Palestinian archaeologist said Monday.
	   The mosaic might have been part of a public building that
belonged to the church complex, said Hamdan Taha, director of the
Palestinian Department of Antiquities.
	   ``It is a very important discovery, something that will add to
the history of the city and to the millennium celebrations,'' Taha
told The Associated Press.
	   The church, built over the grotto where tradition says Mary gave
birth to Jesus, is one of Christianity's most revered sites.
	   The Byzantine basilica adjoins Manger Square which until
recently was used mainly as a parking lot for tourist buses. The
square was ringed on two sides by souvenir shops and fast food
restaurants and on the third by a police station.
	   Under a major remodeling plan, the square is being turned into a
plaza with trees and water fountains, and the police station is to
being replaced by a tourist center and museum.
	   The mosaic was uncovered last week in a part of the square where
the police station once stood, Taha said.
	   The mosaic consists of geometric designs in red, black and
white, Taha said. So far, about 18 square feet of the mosaic have
been uncovered, but it is believed to be larger. He said the work
was delicate because the moasic rested on sloping bedrock.
	   During a reporter's visit to the site Monday, the mosaic was
covered by a protective layer of wood. Nearby, bulldozers were
digging into the soil as part of the construction work.
	   Taha said the mosaic was being properly protected and that he
was now in touch with those in charge of the remodeling to make
sure the mosaic will be be incorporated into the new building.
	   Taha said he also found two cisterns and two water tunnels. One
cistern held a collection of Byzantine plates and five or six
lamps.

Six N.C. State students arrested in death of student

	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Five North Carolina State
athletes and a former athlete faced criminal charges Monday in
connection with the slaying of a gunman who was killed with his own
gun.
	   Among the three reserve football players charged was David
Stringer, the son of Rutgers women's basketball coach C. Vivian
Stringer. His cousin, Korey Stringer, plays for the Minnesota
Vikings NFL football team.
	   Police say Neil Davis Jr., 21, an N.C. State student from
Fayetteville, was shot about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He died about six
hours later at Wake Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Marilyn
Eddinger said.
	   Raleigh Police Capt. Mike Longmire said Davis was shot with a 9
mm semiautomatic pistol after a struggle with the six students. The
six had been attending an off-campus party a few doors down from
Davis' home.
	   Clyde Blunt faces the most serious charges. The 20-year-old
sophomore wrestler, a collegiate heavyweight champion, was charged
with involuntary manslaughter because investigators say his
aggressive behavior resulted in Davis' death. Blunt also faces
charges of misdemeanor breaking and entering.
	   The three reserve football players _ Harold Jackson, Willie
Wright and Stringer _ were charged with misdemeanor breaking and
entering and misdemeanor assault. Wright, 19, also was charged with
larceny of a firearm. Jackson, 20, and Stringer, 19, also were
charged with accessory to a felony for helping Wright take the
weapon, Longmire said.
	   Michael Mordarski, a 20-year-old wrestler, and Daniel Scott
Campenella, 21, an N.C. State student and former wrestler, were
charged with misdemeanor breaking and entering.
	   Mordaski and Campenella were released on their own recognizance
Sunday night. The three football players secured bonds, and Blunt
was in the Wake County Jail on a dlrs 5,000 bond.

Brazil's communications minister resigns amid scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's communications minister and two
other top officials resigned Monday amid allegations they tried to
manipulate the sale of the state-run telecommunications giant to
benefit their friends.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso accepted the resignation of
Communications Minister Luis Carlos Mendonca de Barros, but said in
a statement he considered Barros' actions in the Telebras sale
``absolutely suitable.''
	   The president of Brazil's National Development Bank, Andre Lara
Resende, and Barros' brother, Jose Roberto Mendonca de Barros,
secretary of the Foreign Trade Council, also resigned.
	   The scandal broke Nov. 9 when several leading magazines
published transcripts of illegally taped telephone conversations by
Barros and Resende. Police are investigating who was behind the
phone taps.
	   In the transcripts, Barros and Resende appeared to be trying to
influence the sale in favor of a consortium that included former
Central Bank head Persio Arida and former privatization director
Elena Landau. The effort was unsuccessful.
	   Telebras was sold in 12 separate blocks for a total of dlrs 19
billion at the July 29 auction, billed as Latin America's largest
privatization.
	   Barros has denied wrongdoing, saying the transcripts were
``incomplete and edited.'' He said he was only trying to ``increase
competition.''
	   Barros' spokesman, Cesar Borges, was not immediately available
for comment today.
	   Barros faced nearly five hours of questioning in Congress on
Thursday, but failed to satisfy some government-allied politicians
with his answers.
	   The scandal threatened the government's efforts to win
congressional approval for a dlrs 24 billion austerity package
aimed at rebuilding investor confidence in Brazil's ailing economy.

Russia, China adopt statements on cooperation, border
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin in his hospital reception room Monday to
adopt a statement on expanding relations between the giant former
Cold War rivals and define the western stretch of their lengthy
border.
	   The document noted that the ``strategic partnership'' declared
by the two countries _ the world's largest and the world's most
populous _ last year ``is not an alliance and is not aimed against
third countries.''
	   The partnership aims to block ``the development of elements of
confrontation'' in their relations and encourage cooperation in all
sectors, the 10-page statement said, according to the Interfax news
agency.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang also released a declaration settling disputes
over parts of the western stretch of the two nations' 4,300
kilometer (2,700-mile) border, Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   Their statement also called for the creation of a multi-polar
world _ Russia's favorite euphemism for counterbalancing what it
sees as growing global U.S. influence. China has voiced similar
concerns about the United States.
	   Following decades of enmity between the Chinese and the former
Soviet Communist parties that began in the 1950s, relations between
Russia and China began to thaw with a visit by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989.
	   Yeltsin was hospitalized in the government's Central Clinical
Hospital on Sunday with pneumonia and a high temperature. But
Yeltsin's temperature was normal Monday, Yakushkin said, and
pictures released by the Kremlin showed Yeltsin and Jiang sharing a
joke as they sat in a reception room, surrounded by aides.
	   The main outcome of the meeting was the ``similarity of
approaches on virtually all international issues and ... the
prospects of building up close, confident relations between Russia
and China, aimed at strategic interaction in the 21st century,''
Yeltsin's foreign affairs aide Sergei Prikhodko said, according to
Interfax.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang called for a peaceful settlement of the
dispute in the Yugoslav province of Kosovo and a resolution of
ongoing fighting in Afghanistan, news reports said.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang agreed to reconvene in China next year for
their seventh summit, Interfax reported. Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov will meet with his Chinese counterpart Zhu Rongji
in Moscow in February, news reports said.
	   Russian media has speculated that Yeltsin's health problems
would rule out any more foreign trips during the remaining 19
months of his term, but the Russian leader insists he has no major
health problems.
	   Jiang also met with Primakov to discuss expanding trade, which
fell 10 percent last year to dlrs 6.1 billion and the two countries
want to raise it to dlrs 20 billion by 2000.
	   ``Very good talks have taken place. We are pleased,'' the
Russian premier said after the meeting, according to Interfax.
	   China is a major customer for Russia's defense industry.
	   Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov said Russia
was considering exporting energy to China and helping it build
three steam power plants, ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Jiang and his wife, Wang Yeping, will visit the Siberian city of
Novosibirsk on Tuesday and Wednesday before departing for Japan.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Britain, after hosting a meeting of 16 Iraqi
opposition groups, said Monday it supports a campaign to have
President Saddam Hussein and his top leaders indicted for crimes
against humanity.
	   ``I think it is clearly obvious that crimes have been committed
by the leadership,'' Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said.
``I think the campaign (for a trial) is a strong one which the
international community would support.''
	   Fatchett said he stressed to the often-competing opposition
groups that events are moving quickly in Iraq and unity was vital.
	   The groups are scheduled to meet with a U.S. State Department
official, assistant secretary of state Martin Indyk, on Tuesday in
London. Fatchett will also be present.
	   Fatchett said he advised the opposition leaders to bring
specific proposals to Tuesday's meeting on how the United States
and Britain could help.
	   Indyk met last week with Ahmed Chalabi, head of Iraqi National
Congress, an umbrella opposition group. The U.S. Congress also has
approved a dlrs 97 million aid package to offer support to Iraqi
dissidents.
	   Earlier, British officials labeled the London meeting the first
of a series, reflecting the greater frankness by the United States
and Britain that a prime aim in ending the stalemate over U.N.
weapons inspections is to topple Saddam.
	   ``It is almost impossible to argue that Iraq without Saddam
Hussein would not be a better country,'' said after the meeting.
``A change of regime ... would have to better for the ordinary
people of Iraq.''
	   Fatchett said his focus was to find common ground among the
opposition groups so that ``if and when there is a change of regime
in Iraq ... Baghdad does not fall into chaos and anarchy.''

WWF urges EU to rethink policy on farm subsidies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The World Wildlife Fund on Monday
warned that the European Union's policy of subsidizing farmers has
a disastrous impact on the environment and does little to help
develop rural areas.
	   ``The EU's rural policy is a regressive policy. It is making
rich farmers richer and poor farmers poorer, as well as destroying
large parts of Europe's environment,'' Tony Long, the director
European policy of the WWF environmental group said.
	   The EU's Common Agriculture Policy, created to help Europe's
farmers, takes up half of all EU spending and amounts to over 40
billion European currency units (dlrs 50 billion).
	   The EU executive Commission has made proposals on reforming the
CAP, which cannot remain in its present form if the EU is to absorb
several eastern European countries and their millions of farmers in
the next decade.
	   But the proposals, which EU farm ministers are set to discuss
during their two-day session starting Monday, are ``too timid,''
WWF spokeswoman Natasha Yellachich said.
	   Under these proposals, 75 percent of the CAP budget would still
go to EU farmers. Only 3 percent would be used for
agro-environmental measures and 10 percent for ``rural
development'' measures, Yellachich said.
	   The WWF is proposing instead that by the year 2006, 75 percent
of the CAP budget be transformed into funds for rural development.
These funds would be used, for example, to help farmers diversify,
or to encourage people to set up their own business, not just in
farming.
	   ``The number of farmers in the EU has dropped from 15 million to
7 million over the past 25 years. It's time the EU broadened its
rural policy to include other groups of people,'' Yellachich said.
	   Under the WWF proposal, a quarter of the CAP should be spent for
environmental measures.
	   The WWF also wants farmers to receive subsidies only if they
comply with basic environmental standards.
	   ``Currently, 13 out of 15 EU countries are subject to legal
proceedings. In all these countries there are cases of nitrate
levels in water exceeding levels permitted under EU rules,''
Yellachich said.
	   Another example of non-compliance is that olive-growers, who
receive some 2.2 billion ecu (dlrs 2.57 billion) out of the CAP
budget, cultivate the land more and more intensively with complete
disregard for the soil. Yellachich said.
	   ``This leads to phenomenal soil erosion,'' she said.

Defense minister withdraws resignation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Slovenia's defense minister
surprisingly withdrew his resignation Monday, but the move was seen
as a protest against the government's failure to appoint a
successor more than a month after he had stepped down.
	   Minister Alojz Krapez's move occurred at a time when NATO is
holding its first exercise in this former Yugoslav republic.
Slovenia is in the Partnership for Peace program and is eager to
join NATO.
	   But the country's Defense Minister has seen repeated troubles.
	   Krapez's predecessor, Tit Turnsek, had to resign in March after
a van equipped to do electronic surveillance for the intelligence
services was caught in neighboring Croatia.
	   Only seven months later, Krapez had to step down after
opposition leaders revealed that he had accepted an apartment
reserved for members of the uniformed armed services. Government
officials are not allowed to live in military quarters.
	   Premier Janez Drnovsek accepted Krapez's resignation Oct. 20,
but Krapez continued to serve as minister because the post remained
vacant.
	   The Slovenian People's Party, the No. 2 force in the government
coalition, is to recommend a new minister. They have no time limit
for suggesting a successor.
	   Parliament was scheduled to confirm Krapez's resignation
Tuesday.
	   ``Since I have still been acting as a minister, and no new name
is in sight, I am withdrawing my resignation,'' Krapez told
reporters.
	   Asked whether his move could hurt Slovenia's reputation with
NATO, Krapez said the fact that no new minister was appointed yet
``is much more damaging.''
	   Drnovsek said the resignation was final. Krapez acknowledged
that he could not legally reverse his resignation, and indicated he
acted to pressure the government to appoint a new minister.

Cold weather claims at least 65 lives in Europe

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 65 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in Romania and
Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 32 people died, most
of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold after
drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). The lowest
temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15 Fahrenheit)
early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
	   In Romania, at least 21 people died from the cold and in
weather-related accidents on snow-covered roads since Friday.
Temperatures plunged to minus 10 Celsius (14 degrees F) early
Monday.
	   About 200 people spent more than 48 hours stranded in their cars
after winds whipped snowdrifts across main highways in southern
Romania. Army vehicles rescued most drivers, but six people froze
to death over the weekend after being trapped in their cars.
	   Dozens of trains were canceled and 200 communities were reported
to be without electricity, the Libertatea newspaper reported
Monday. Some 15 major roads were blocked by snowdrifts as high as
1.5 meters (five feet). Police urged drivers not to travel in snowy
areas.
	   In Bucharest, dozens of cars smashed into other vehicles and
skidded in the icy conditions. The Emergency Hospital in Bucharest
said it treated 80 people for fractures and frostbite over the
weekend.
	   In France, the death toll from the cold snap rose Monday to six
people, three of them homeless men.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris were completely
frozen, and in Mouthe, in eastern France, temperatures fell Monday
morning to minus 21 Celsius (minus 6 F). About 100 homeless people
staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the state-run medical
assistance service in Paris to demand better protection in winter.
	   Italian authorities reported the death Sunday of a 91-year-old
Italian man after being found in his unheated home in Calabria, in
southern Italy. The cold was also being blamed for the deaths of a
husband and wife, who were found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning
_ apparently from a defective heater _ at their home in rural
Lombardy.
	   In Bulgaria, three people died in the northwestern region of
Montana, the daily 24 Chassa reported Monday. Some highways were
blocked and some areas were without power, phones and running
water.
	   The Black Sea ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Constanta in
Romania were closed Monday due to storms, state radio reported.

Charles says many big cities look too similar

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Britain's Prince Charles Monday looked up
to the ancient Acropolis - and not down at the modern apartment
blocks around it - for inspiration.
	   Charles, here on a cultural visit, said cities around the world
look too ugly and too much like each other.
	   ``After the last war many cities, not only in your country but
also in mine, have been redeveloped so that sometimes it is
impossible to know which country you are in,'' he said. ``Such is
the internalization of cities.''
	   But Charles, who studied architecture for a year, studiously
avoided mention of the 2,500-year-old Parthenon marbles, stripped
from the ruins atop the Acropolis in the early 19th century and now
housed in the British Museum.
	   Removed by Lord Elgin _ then Britain's ambassador to the Ottoman
Empire _ successive Greek governments have pressed for their return
for many years, but Britain has turned down all requests.
	   ``I told him that I view his visit to the Acropolis today as the
first symbolic step for the marbles' return,'' Culture Minister
Evangelos Venizelos said after Charles toured the ruins.
	   Venizelos said Charles ``didn't make any specific comment.'' But
Venizelos said that ``I stressed that we understand his
constitutional position, we understand that this all falls under
the jurisdiction of the British government.''
	   During his visit, Charles was given a hammer and chisel used by
craftsmen helping restore many of the marbles atop the Acropolis,
damaged by time and pollution.
	   ``Of course, we know that he is especially interested in
architecture and so it was an honor to show him this most important
ancient monument,'' said Prof. Manolis Korres, the architect who is
leading the restoration work.
	   It was the second time in one day that the marbles came up.
Earlier, Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos expressed his wish that the
marbles be housed in a new Acropolis museum Athens hopes to have
ready by 2004, when it hosts the Summer Olympics.
	   ``The time has come for the return of the monuments of Athenian
civilization to the place that for some time now is being prepared
for this, the new Acropolis museum,'' Avramopoulos said during a
ceremony giving Charles a city medal.
	   But while he skirted the marbles issue, Charles did congratulate
Avramopoulos for the mayor's efforts to make the capital more
livable.
	   Athens has launched ambitious programs to create a walkway
system linking its ancient sites and improve run-down areas.
	   While free of slums, the city has been scarred by rampant
development since the 1960s. Nearly half of Greece's population of
10.2 million now lives in greater Athens.
	   Charles, an avid campaigner against ugly architecture in cities,
arrived in Athens Sunday for a three-day official visit.
	   Early Monday, Charles inaugurated a British Council education
center, met with President Costis Stephanopoulos and attended
events at an annual Britain and Greece festival.
	   He also visited the British School of Archaeology in Athens to
lend his support for their appeal to raise 10.5 million pounds
(dlrs 17.3 million).
	   At the school, he planted an olive tree as a symbolic tribute to
Athena, the mythical goddess who was the capital's patron.
	   ``We need to understand our past if we are to make a success of
our future. No aspect of our shared past is more important than the
legacy of the ancient Greeks,'' Charles said at the event.
	   The prince is patron of the school, which was founded in 1886
and is the oldest British research institution outside Britain.
	   Although Charles has made frequent private visits to Greece, his
last official trip here was back in 1964.
	   Before leaving on Tuesday, Charles will visit ancient sites on
the island of Crete.

Sweden's most-capped player quits U.S soccer league
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Thomas Ravelli, the Swedish goalkeeper
who holds the record for national team goalkeeper appearances, is
leaving Major League Soccer.
	   Ravelli said he has put his Florida house up for sale and is
moving back to his the Swedish west-coast city of Goteborg next
week, the newspaper GT/Expressen reported Monday.
	   Ravelli, who had hoped to sign for Cologne of Germany, or
another MLS team, was not offered a renewed contract by Tampa
Mutiny Bay, which he joined a year ago.
	   ``Honestly I don't know what I will do right now. I would have
liked to play one more year,'' Ravelli said.
	   The U.S. league was established after the United States hosted
the 1994 World Cup finals. Sweden placed third in the finals and
Ravelli kept goal.
	   Ravelli played for 21 years in Sweden's first division _ most
recently with IFK Goteborg _ and appeared a record 143 times with
the national team.

Confidence debate opens with government's future doubtful
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with debate opening. No pickup. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Lawmakers opened debate Monday on a
confidence motion that is expected to sink the government of Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz amid accusations of links with organization
crime.
	   ``No one can expect this prime minister to carry on,'' said Ali
Sevki Erek, a member of the True Path party of former Prime
Minister Tansu Ciller.
	   Yilmaz' critics need 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament to
topple the nearly 17-month-old government, which has been smothered
by allegations of Yilmaz' ties to organized crime and tampering
with the privatization of a state bank. The vote is Wednesday.
	   The collapse of Yilmaz' government is expected to set off
political deal making to cobble together a new coalition. One
scenario has Yilmaz' Motherland Party seeking a pact with its
longtime rival, the True Path Party.
	   The signs of shifting political alliances appeared even before
the confidence debate began. Parliamentary committees opposed
moving ahead with corruption probes into both Yilmaz and Mrs.
Ciller.
	   Motherland Party deputies supported Mrs. Ciller in the 12-2
vote, although Motherland had originally asked for the probe into
accusations that Mrs. Ciller's illegally amassed a fortune from
bank deals.
	   Similarly, Mrs. Ciller's party did an about-face and joined in
the 10-5 vote against advancing a probe into the financial dealings
of Yilmaz.
	   Parliament is likely to follow the decisions by the two
committees. A negative vote would have stripped them of immunity
from prosecution.
	   Mrs. Ciller has survived several similar probes into her
accumulation of wealth. Detractors alleged the bulk of the family's
wealth came from illegal bank dealings conducted by her husband,
who ran a private bank that collapsed.
	   Mrs. Ciller claims she built up their fortune from several
hundred thousand dollars inherited from her family.

Kurd rebel blames two enemies _ Turkish nationalists, military _
</HEADLINE>
for attack on pope &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Turkey taking Italian TV off cable broadcasts,
Fiat comment &QL; 
 &UR; By ELLEN KNICKMEYER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Turkish gunman who tried to kill Pope John Paul
II in 1981 wasn't acting alone, a Kurd rebel leader claims in a
letter made public Monday that seeks the pope's support for the
Kurdish cause.
	   The Vatican's only immediate response was that the Kurds and
their opponents should solve their disputes peaceably.
	   Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan wrote John Paul Nov. 18 while he
was still in custody in Rome, La Repubblica daily said. A Rome
court freed Ocalan two days later, rejecting a Turkish warrant for
the guerrilla chief who is Turkey's most-wanted fugitive.
	   Ocalan's letter blames two enemies of the Kurds _ Turkish
nationalists and the Turkish military _ for the May 13, 1981,
attack on the pope in St. Peter's Square.
	   Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca shot the pope in the abdomen. He
is now serving a life sentence in Italy.
	   Agca was a member of the Gray Wolves, a far-right nationalist
group that is the staunchest opponent to the Kurdish cause in
Turkey. The motive for his attack on the pope has never been clear;
Agca has gone back and forth on claims that the Bulgarian secret
service plotted the attack at the instigation of the Soviet Union.
	   Agca escaped from a Turkish jail in 1979, two years before the
attack. Ocalan's letter claimed Agca actually was freed by one of
the generals who later took part in Turkey's 1980 military coup.
	   ``This hateful attack on your person should not be considered an
individual act,'' Ocalan wrote, asking the pope's support for the
Kurdish cause. ``Mr. Ali Agca has not told the truth.''
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Monday only that
the church was mindful ``of the situation and the aspirations of
the Kurds, who live as displaced people in many countries.''
	   The Holy had always advocated resolving the Kurdish issue
``through dialogue and discourse'' and has condemned ``any type of
violence to resolve the problems,'' he said.
	   There was no immediate response to the letter from Turkey, which
has always rejected peace talks with Ocalan's rebel Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK.
	   The PKK has fought a 14-year-old war for Kurdish autonomy in
Turkey's southeast that has killed 37,000 people. Ocalan insisted
in his letter to the pope that he has now renounced ``armed
struggle,'' but the fighting continues.
	   Ocalan is seeking asylum in Italy; an Italian court ordered him
to stay in Rome until Dec. 23 to give Germany time to decide
whether to pursue extradition on its own terrorism charges.
	   Italy's refusal to hand over Ocalan has outraged Turkey, its
NATO partner. Justice Minister Hasan Denizkurdu said Turkey would
make a formal extradition request Wednesday or Thursday, despite
Italy's rejection of the Turkish arrest warrant.
	   On Monday, a convoy of yellow taxi cabs careened past the
Italian Embassy in Ankara, honking horns and flying banners
declaring, ``No to Fiat'' _ although most of the cabs were
Turkish-made Fiat 131s.
	   Fiat's joint venture in Turkey, Tofas, on Monday spoke out
against a boycott, saying it would put people out of work in Fiat
plants in Turkey.
	   Economy Minister Gunes Taner said in a newspaper interview
published Monday that he disapproves of the popular movement to end
trade with Italy. The government, he stressed, has not approved any
boycotts.
	   But Transport Minister Arif Ahmet Denizolgun announced Monday
that the government was dropping Italian stations from Turkey's
cable systems.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Baseball's most storied team may be changing
owners soon.
	   Owner George Steinbrenner is talking with Cablevision Systems
Corp. about selling a major share of the New York Yankees. He would
retain control of the World Series champions in any deal, a source
familiar with the negotiations said Sunday night, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
	   A sale would involve only Steinbrenner's limited partner shares.
He would retain his shares as managing general partner, and thus
keep control of team operations. He owns 59 percent of the Yankees.
	   NBC Sports reported a deal was agreed to last week and said it
called for Steinbrenner to turn over full ownership of the team to
Cablevision for dlrs 600 million. The Daily News today said the
deal called for Cablevision to buy 70 percent of the team for dlrs
525 million.

Reactor restarted at Ukraine's Yuzhnaya nuclear plant after delay
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A reactor was restarted at Ukraine's
Yuzhnaya nuclear power plant after staying idle for more than a
month because the plant had no money to import new safety
equipment, officials said Monday.
	   Reactor No. 2 went on line late Sunday following installation of
a new safety system component, the Nuclear Regulation
Administration said. The reactor was shut down in June for routine
repairs and upgrades and was supposed to be restarted in early
October.
	   But a Czech company refused to supply all the new parts for the
reactors' control and safety systems, demanding that the plant pay
for the equipment in advance and cover earlier debts, worth dlrs 4
million.
	   The restart of the reactor was good news for Ukraine's troubled
energy system, especially with the onset of winter, when demand for
electricity mounts.
	   Ukrainian energy plants are owed more than dlrs 1 billion by
consumers and have been working below capacity since October
because they cannot afford to stay open.
	   The Cabinet was working on a list of enterprises that would be
deprived of electricity as soon as demand for energy becomes
dangerously high _ the latest of several desperate attempts by the
government to solve the country's energy problems.
	   Energy Minister Oleksiy Sheberstov warned that his ministry
would be forced to cut off electricity in entire regions if even
one nuclear reactor is stopped in the coming days, the Ukrainian
News agency said.
	   Towns and villages throughout Ukraine already go without
electricity for several hours every day, while thousands of debtor
enterprises have been disconnected until they pay their electricity
bills.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Snow and rain storms swept Greece Monday,
flooding homes, ripping up trees and seriously disrupting transport
and services.
	   Three sailors were killed and one was missing in the northern
port of Salonica after braving rough seas in a tug boat to
extinguish a fire aboard an oil tanker.
	   The fire aboard the tanker, anchored nearly two kilometers (one
mile) offshore, spread to the tug as it tried to extinguish the
blaze. Both fires were put out and rescue boats were looking for
the body of the fourth sailor.
	   Flooding was reported in parts of Athens, Salonica and more than
a dozen regional cities and towns, where power and telephone
outages also occured.
	   Strong winds forced the cancellation of many domestic flights
and ferry services. In Salonica, gale force winds uprooted trees
and billboards and sent them crashing into cars. No was was hurt.
	   Road traffic was affected by heavy snowfall in parts of central
and northern Greece, where dozens of villages were cut off by snow.
	   Although Athens escaped much of Monday's bad weather, a number
of suburbs were extensively flooded.
	   It was the second time in the past week that rainfall has caused
serious problems in the capital. Opposition parties have accused
the government of failing to deal with the crisis properly.
	   Weather conditions are expected to improve Tuesday.

Feuding Catholic bishops seek Vatican's arbitration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Two feuding Austrian bishops who accuse
each other of lying took their unprecedented conflict to the
Vatican on Monday for possible arbitration.
	   The dispute between the archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, and Bishop Kurt Krenn of St. Poelten reflects a deeper
rift in the Catholic hierarchy the bishops consistently deny.
	   At issue is Krenn's claim he was unfamiliar with the contents of
a five-year report presented by Austrian bishops at the Vatican on
Saturday. His statement, and the resulting feud, have made
headlines in Austria and drawn sharp criticism from church leaders
and Catholic lay people.
	   Among other things, the document admitted clumsy handling of a
scandal involving retired Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who was
accused of sexually abusing young boys and men but never directly
admitted his guilt. Groer, who had to relinquish all his church
functions, recently returned from months of Vatican-imposed exile
and is reported to be terminally ill.
	   A visibly angry Schoenborn disputed Krenn's claim last week,
telling Austrian state television from Rome on Friday,
``Objectively, what he (Krenn) said was simply not correct.''
	   Krenn has remained defiant, however, saying ``liars should keep
their mouths shut.''
	   Rejecting calls for a public show of repentance, he was quoted
Monday by the Vienna daily Der Standard as saying, ``Am I now
supposed to go around in underpants for half a year?''
	   Krenn also was quoted as saying that disciplinary proceedings
could only be initiated by the Vatican, ``because we are all
subject to the pope.''
	   The feuding bishops made an apparent attempt to settle their
conflict Monday, issuing a joint statement saying they had agreed
to take their ``discussion'' to ``the competent Roman congregation
for bishops _ a Vatican department _ and to seek its judgment, if
any.''
	   The Groer affair last year ignited a long-simmering conflict
between Austrian church leaders favoring reforms and others,
particularly Krenn, taking a conservative stance in line with
current Vatican policy.

Turkey. The motive for his attack on the pope has never been clear;
Agca has gone back and forth on claims that the Bulgarian secret
service plotted the attack at the instigation of the Soviet Union.
	   Agca escaped from a Turkish jail in 1979, two years before the
attack. Ocalan's letter claimed Agca actually was freed by one of
the generals who later took part in Turkey's 1980 military coup.
	   ``This hateful attack on your person should not be considered an
individual act,'' Ocalan wrote, asking the pope's support for the
Kurdish cause. ``Mr. Ali Agca has not told the truth.''
	   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Monday only that
the church was mindful ``of the situation and the aspirations of
the Kurds, who live as displaced people in many countries.''
	   The Holy See had always advocated resolving the Kurdish issue
``through dialogue and discourse'' and has condemned ``any type of
violence to resolve the problems,'' he said.

Chiapas peace talks end with little progress

	   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) _ Ski-masked Indian
rebels headed home Monday from the first talks with congressional
negotiators in nearly two years, apparently no closer to their goal
of Indian autonomy and rights than before.
	   But the meeting may have helped the Zapatista National
Liberation Army reclaim a little of the public attention that has
been elusive _ except for brief spurts _ since their January 1994
uprising.
	   The three days of talks in San Cristobal, a Chiapas city 460
miles (730 kms) southeast of Mexico City, were designed to
reestablish contact and discuss the possibility of more formal
peace talks. But both sides ended the meetings in the same place
they began.
	   The 29 Zapatista representatives said in a statement that they
would only agree to further talks if the government agreed to
demands they made two years earlier when the talks broke off. The
government did not comment.
	   The demands include the implementation of accords that the
government reneged on _ prompting the breakdown of talks _ the
freedom of Zapatista prisoners, demilitarization of southern Mexico
and that any talks include discussions of democracy.
	   The Congressional negotiators did not comment on those demands,
with spokesman Benigno Aladro saying only that the talks ``took
place in an atmosphere of frank dialogue and without limitations,
and their result brings hope for the restarting of the peace
process with the government.''
	   He said the negotiators tried to give the Zapatistas two sealed
envelopes from the government, but that they refused to receive
them because they don't recognize the lawmakers as mediators until
formal talks restart.
	   The rebels apparently agreed to the talks because they need a
political stage after government troops boxed them into a small
area of southern Chiapas state, harassed their supporters and cut
down on the steady stream of visits they once received.
	   Zapatista rebel leader Subcomandante Marcos did not show up at
the talks, but sent a statement Sunday urging a grassroots struggle
against the government's economic policy.
	   ``It is a question of survival for the country,'' he wrote.
	   The Zapatistas announced a plan to send 5,000 representatives to
visit every township in Mexico in coming months, as part of a
national debate on the Indian rights bill.
	   It would be a major public relations push for the rebels, which
have faded from national attention since staging a brief armed
uprising in January, 1994 demanding greater democracy and Indian
rights.
	   The government has steadily reduced the rebel's area of
influence in the last year by increasing army patrols in Chiapas,
dismantling maverick town councils set up by Zapatista supporters
there, and limiting the number of foreign observers and supporters
allowed to visit rebel strongholds.

EU lifts ban on vast majority of British beef exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union voted Monday to lift
a worldwide export ban on the vast majority of British beef, a
milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against
its EU allies for the best part of three years.
	   ``The beef ban is lifted,'' said British Farm Minister Nick
Brown. ``The beef is safe to eat.''
	   Ten of the 15 EU farm ministers meeting here voted to scrap the
ban on deboned beef, with Germany the lone holdout. France, Spain,
Austria and Luxembourg abstained.
	   The decision should clear the way to ending the crisis for
British farmers, who were badly hit by a ban on all beef exports
imposed by he EU in March 1996. Estimated losses from the ban
amount to over 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion) and the crisis
undermined confidence in beef throughout Europe.
	   ``The question now is how to get back on the world markets,''
said Brown, predicting an uphill struggle to re-establish the
reputation of British beef.
	   Monday's decision ``will tend to boost the confidence of the
British consumer and presumably other consumers throughout the EU
and our beef trade and our beef producers will get back to
normal,'' Dr. John Mann, superintendent of Britain's largest meat
market, Smithfields, said in London
	   The move to ease the ban was boosted early this month when eight
out of 15 veterinary experts endorsed the plan to resume exports.
	   Now, the issue goes back to the EU's executive Commission, which
will send inspectors to Britain for a final examination of safety
standards, opening the way for exports early in the new year. No
more ministerial votes on the issue are needed.
	   Exports were banned after Britain announced a possible link
between ``mad cow'' disease in British cattle and a fatal brain
ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Monday's decision will be immediately followed by a campaign to
put British beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the
15-nation EU.
	   ``It will still be some months before the first shipments of
beef actually resume and there is much work to be done to
re-establish markets,'' said Ben Gill, president of Britain's
National Farmers Union.
	   Brown downplayed the continued opposition of Germany. ``Germany
was not opposed to lifting the beef ban. It was opposed to lifting
it now,'' said Brown.
	   The Labor government lauded the cooperation from its EU
partners. ``I have no quarrel how other people approached the
issue,'' Brown said. ``I got a fair hearing from each of the other
14.''
	   In the wake of the 1996 ban, the previous Conservative
government of Prime Minister John Major instigated a policy of
non-cooperation with its partners which effectively paralyzed the
EU for months.
	   Relations improved after Tony Blair became Prime Minister in May
1997. EU farm ministers approved a resumption of beef exports from
Northern Ireland in March.
	   Ahead of the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of beef,
totaling some dlrs 1 billion, in 1995. Mann said he hoped exports
would be back to such levels within a couple of years.

<TEXT>
	   OXFORD, England (AP) _ In a ceremony steeped in tradition, the
presidents of Harvard and Yale received honorary degrees from
Oxford University Monday in recognitioin of their contributions to
education.
	   Harvard President Neil L. Rudenstine and Yale President Richard
C. Levin were awarded doctorates of Civil Law at a ceremony at the
university's Convocation House on ``Oxford Monday.''
	   The day celebrates the links that unite the ancient university
with the leading U.S. universities.
	   Both Rudenstine and Levin were students at Oxford on Rhodes
Scholarships. Rudenstine studied English Literature at Oxford's New
College from 1957-59 and Levin studied economics at Merton College
from 1968-71.
	   Wearing red gowns, they were led into the hall by a procession
of Oxford professors wearing robes and mortar boards.
	   Lord Roy Jenkins, Chancellor of the university, presented the
honorary degrees.

Low turnout in Senate elections
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Low voter turnout of slightly more
than 20 percent marked this weekend's Senate elections, in which
the ruling Social Democrats suffered a major blow.
	   Party chairman Milos Zeman acknowledged defeat after his party
scored just three victories in runoff elections for 27 seats in the
81-seat upper chamber of Czech legislature.
	   Zeman called voters ``cowards'' for ignoring the ballot and
blamed his candidates for not campaigning enough.
	   President Vaclav Havel was happy after his favored four-party
coalition led by the Christian Democrats won 13 seats.
	   ``The enlightened minority came to the polls,'' Havel said,
commenting on the low turnout.
	   Former Premier Vaclav Klaus, now opposition leader, called the
vote a draw after his Civic Democratic Party won nine seats. The
unreformed Communist party won the two remaining mandates.

Deputy air force commander suspended over Nov. 11 jet crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Defense minister Janusz Onyszkiewicz on
Monday suspended the deputy air force commander over a Nov. 11
military jet crash that killed two experienced pilots.
	   Gen. Mieczyslaw Walentynowicz's suspension was based on evidence
from a special commission investigating the air crash and military
prosecutors, said defense ministry spokesman Lt. Col. Eugeniusz
Mleczak.
	   The Iskra military training jet crashed in bad weather near
Otwock, some 30 kilometers (18 miles) southeast of Warsaw as it was
checking weather conditions for an air show over the city to mark
Poland's Independence Day.
	   Many military pilots charged their superiors with ordering the
Iskra and other planes to fly that day, when the cloud ceiling over
Warsaw was only 200 meters (656 feet), about level with the city's
tallest buildings.
	   Onyszkiewicz told private Radio Zet Monday he believes the Iskra
jet should not have been allowed to take off.
	   Military prosecutors must now decide whether to raise charges
against the general.

Russia promises to respect EU conditions tied to food aid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BRU109 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Russia's vice premier for relations
with the European Union Vladimir Bulgak stressed Monday his country
will respect conditions tied to a 400 million European currency
unit (dlrs 460 million) food aid package recently offered by the EU
to Russia.
	   ``We will ensure that this (EU) aid is properly distributed ...
The products will be sold at market prices and the revenue ... will
be used to help the poorer sectors of the population,'' Bulgak
said.
	   ``Certainly, the aid will not be reexported. That is not
something we intend to do.'' Bulgak told members of the European
Parliament.
	   Russia has been struggling with a severe economic crisis coupled
with the worst grain harvest in 40 years.
	   Bulgak told European Parliament members that, although Russia is
''not suffering from any catastrophic famine, the crisis has
seriously affected some regions.''
	   Bulgak, who met with the EU's Commissioner for foreign affairs
Hans Van den Broek before heading for the European Parliament, said
he was ``very encouraged'' by his talks with EU officials.
	   ``As we reach the end of the first year of our partnership
agreement, it is clear we both (Russia and the EU) wish for the
same thing,'' Bulgak told journalists after his meeting with Van
den Broek.
	   ``We are hoping to reap bigger, better fruit as we go along,''
Bulgak added.
	   The partnership agreement signed last December was intended to
serve as a platform on which the EU would work with Russia,
primarily on trade issues.

OPEC faces difficult and limited options at Vienna meeting

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with report OPEC needs to reform grafs 4-6; minor
editing to tighten &QL; 
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ A global oil glut, mild North American
weather, weakened economies in Asia and 11-year-low prices spell
trouble for OPEC as oil ministers convene this week, analysts said
Monday.
	   Oil ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of
Wednesday's year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, an Iranian newspaper warned
Monday that OPEC's credibility is at stake. The daily Hamshahri,
published by the Tehran city government, said the organization must
draw up new methods and policies, not just tinker with production
ceilings.
	   ``OPEC is confronted with a big test,'' which if it fails ``will
place a seal of approval on views that call for the termination of
OPEC's epoch'' and prolong low prices, the newspaper said.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June, with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday.
	   Average OPEC oil prices in the third quarter are dlrs 12.33 a
barrel, compared to dlrs 18.03 this time last year.
	   A 2.6 million barrel-a-day production cut agreed in June is not
working _ prices have stayed down.
	   ``They're meeting at a difficult time because the cuts they
instituted in a real sense have not worked,'' said Drollas.
	   The main problem could be hard to fix _ for once, the oil-hungry
world just doesn't seem to want as much of its most vital commodity
as it used to, Drollas said.
	   ``The villain of the piece has been demand. Incremental demand
has decreased,'' he said.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ OPEC's
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production;
warmer-than-average weather in many places, cutting demand for
heating oil; and weakened world demand, especially in Asia.
	   For OPEC economies, the drop in income is threatening to balloon
budget deficits, leading to predictions of tighter spending next
year.
	   Saudi Arabia, which produces 8 million barrels a day and is
OPEC's largest producer, depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of
its income.
	   This year, those revenues are expected to fall 27 percent below
target, bringing in dlrs 25.3 billion, the Saudi British Bank
forecast in a report issued Monday.
	   At current prices, Saudi Arabia is looking at a deficit in 1999
of about dlrs 9 billion the bank estimated. Real economic growth
would fall to 1.7 percent for 1998, compared to 7 percent last
year.
	   Next year doesn't look much better. ``The prolonged period of
relatively low oil prices has persuaded most oil forecasters to be
conservative about 1999,'' the bank said.
	   Bolstering prices will need at least an agreement in Vienna to
extend June's cuts to the end of 1999. Currently, they are due to
run out mid-1999.
	   Failure to extend could lead to a rout in prices. ``The market
won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned.
	   Another option _ instituting deeper production cuts _ is
unlikely, Iran's deputy oil minister intimated last week.
	   That would be ``too much for OPEC to handle at the moment,''
Mehdi Hosseini said at a London oil conference.
	   Venezuela, a major player, has anyway ruled out further cuts to
its present quota of 2.32 million barrels a day.
	   Sticking to cuts also is a problem, with Venezuela and
Indonesia, among a few, producing more than they should.
	   Tighter compliance is ``an absolute imperative,'' Drollas said.
``The logic is clear. You can't talk about further cuts if you
can't comply so far.''

City pulls out of free heroin handout program
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) _ This western Dutch city's
municipality has pulled out of an experiment in which free heroin
is given to long-term addicts, saying it cannot afford to take
part.
	   The program would cost The Hague 700,000 guilders (dlrs 372,340)
despite subsidies from the government and that would mean less
funds for other drug treatment programs, city spokeswoman Corinne
Leopold said Monday.
	   Up to 200 addicts in this city 60 kilometers (38 miles)
southwest of Amsterdam were qualified for the experiment that was
scheduled to begin next July.
	   The handout program, which aims to improve addicts' health and
reduce drug-related crime, has already started in other major Dutch
cities like Amsterdam and Rotterdam.
	   The Dutch experiments follow similar free heroin programs in
Switzerland.

Open star Rose fails to win Tour card
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with other scores, more quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SOTOGRANDE, Spain (AP) _ Teen-age star of this year's British
Open as an amateur, Justin Rose failed to win his card for next
season's European pro Tour Monday when he closed the qualifying
competition with an 80, which included an eagle at the last.
	   His six round total was 21 strokes behind the joint leaders,
Scotland's Ross Drummond and Henrik Nystrom, and Rose finished tied
for 73rd instead of in the top 38 who got their cards.
	   The 18-year-old Englishman, who tied for fourth at the Open at
Royal Birkdale to post the highest finish for an amateur for 35
years, didn't win a penny in prize money after turning pro
immediately afterwards, missing the cut in all eight tournaments he
played.
	   That meant he joined 180 other hopefuls in the six-round
qualifying competition and wound up with rounds of
78-73-70-71-74-80 for a 14-over total of 446.
	   Drummond's final round 72 gave him the edge over Nystrom with
the two players level on 425 because of had the lower final round
score. Nystom carded a 76.
	   Rose, hampered by a groin strain, needed something like a 69 or
70 in the final round to join the top 35 and ties. But he was out
in 40 after four bogeys in his first nine holes at the windy San
Roque course.
	   He needed to cover the remaining nine in 30 to stand any chance
of making it. But he collected three more bogeys in his finishing
nine, triple bogeyed the next-to-last hole after shooting out of
bounds before finishing with a 20-foot eagle putt.
	   ``I just need a break, it's been a long week,'' Rose said after
his latest ordeal. ``I'm upset because I wanted to come here and
make my card. But life goes on.''
	   Rose has accepted invitations to play in the upcoming Australian
and New Zealand Opens.
	   ``After those I'll have a break _ and I definitely need it,''
Rose said.
	   ``I've wanted one for a long time now, but I had to keep working
for this. It's been a long week and a difficult one. I was under
pressure to make the cut and did that, but I really struggled
today.''
	   His failure to qualify leaves Rose hoping for sponsors'
invitations to tournaments. Otherwise it will be life on the lower
grade Challenge Tour.

the 1980s, squeezed in with one stroke to spare after a final round
1-under 71.

U.N. envoy returns to Baghdad amid clash on arms documents

 &UR; By LEON BARKHO

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The special envoy of U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan returned to Baghdad on Monday as Iraq unleashed a new
volley of criticism at the chief U.N. weapons inspector's demands
for arms-related documents.
	   The papers sought by Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, are spurring a new confrontation between the
government of Saddam Hussein and Butler's UNSCOM which oversees
destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
	   Iraqi officials have derided Butler's request as a move to
justify a U.S. military strike on Iraq, saying the government
already had turned over all documents relevant to the arms
inspectors' work.
	   Annan's envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, flew in from the Gulf state
of Bahrain. He refused to comment about the latest controversy on
arrival, saying only that he expected to meet with Iraqi officials.
	   Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi said Monday that
the latest crisis between Baghdad and Iraq had been ``concocted''
by Butler.
	   He added that Iraq sent a letter to the U.N. Security Council
Monday explaining its position.
	   Al-Qaisi said Butler's request came as Iraq was hoping that a
U.N. review of progress toward weapons destruction would lead to an
easing of economic sanctions.
	   He said the United Nations had requested documents about issues
that Iraq and UNSCOM had settled in the past.
	   ``At the present time, with the legitimate expectation for a
comprehensive review to take place, Butler comes ... as if no work
at all has been settled,'' al-Qaisi said.

Swissair denies it pressured for approval of in-flight system
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair on Monday denied it
pressured Swiss aviation authorities to approve the installation of
an in-flight entertainment system disconnected following the crash
in September of Flight 111.
	   ``No Swissair plane ever flew with an uncertified system,''
Philippe Bruggisser, chief executive of the airline's parent
SAirGroup, told a news conference.
	   Swissair last month acted voluntarily to disconnect the
video-on-demand system for first and business class passengers
after investigators detected signs of heat damage on wiring and
other debris.
	   The system was linked to a power supply routed through the
cockpit.
	   The crew reported smoke in the cockpit 16 minutes before the
plane bound from New York to Geneva crashed in the sea off Nova
Scotia, killing all 229 people on board.
	   The cause of the crash has yet to be determined.
	   The installation of the entertainment system in the airline's
MD-11 and Boeing 747 jets was approved on Jan. 24, 1997, by the
U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, Bruggisser said.
	   That certification was adopted by Switzerland's Federal Office
of Aviation, he said. The system was installed on the crashed MD-11
in August and September last year.
	   Bruggisser dismissed as ``false information'' media reports that
the airline pressured the Swiss office into certifying the system's
use.
	   Swissair is the only customer for the system, manufactured by
Phoenix-based Interactive Flight Technologies Inc.
	   Switzerland's transport ministry said Monday it is opening an
inquiry to clarify the procedures followed in certifying the
product.
	   Canadian investigators haven't linked the system to any damage.
	   Canada's Transportation Safety Board last week said heat-damaged
material found so far ``is located in the forward upper area just
forward and aft of the cockpit bulkhead.''
	   It reported finding a few small pieces of melted aluminum, some
electrical wires with melted copper, arcing damage, and charred or
missing wire insulation.
	   There are no signs of fire as yet in any other section of the
aircraft, the investigators added.

British Foreign Minister visits Slovenia

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Cook remarks &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ British Foreign Minister Robin Cook
on Monday expressed support for Slovenia's bid to join the European
Union and NATO on his first visit to the former Yugoslav republic
and would-be EU member.
	   Cook met his counterpart Boris Frlec, President Milan Kucan and
Premier Janez Drnovsek. He also participated in the official
opening of the British Council in the capital of Ljubljana.
	   Slovenia, a tiny Alpine country of two million, declared
independence from the old Yugoslav federation in 1991. The most
prosperous and developed of all former Yugoslav republics, Slovenia
soon was admitted to the NATO Partnership for Peace program and is
listed as one of potential candidates for the EU's eastward
enlargement.
	   Although the country has already started talks on EU membership,
it recently was criticized for being too slow in making its
legislation conform to West European standards.
	   Cook said that Slovenia is still a frontrunner for EU
membership, emphasizing that the ``problems highlightened in a
recent EU report ... were aimed to help Slovenia find solutions to
these problems.''
	   Cook offered British assistance in dealing with the legislative
reforms through the exchange of public administration personnel.
	   He also said he felt ``sorry'' for Slovenia for being excluded
last year from the first round of NATO enlargment, adding that if
there were any further enlargements of NATO, ``Slovenia should be
among the invited countries.''

Injured Agassi avoids the group of Sampras
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras, battling to retain his No.
1 ranking for a record sixth year in a row, got a group without
fellow American Andre Agassi at Monday's draw for the ATP World
Championship.
	   Agassi, who suffered a back injury in practice Monday, missed
the draw and will not start playing until Wednesday in the
round-robin portion of the dlrs 3.5 million event.
	   Marcelo Rios, who is ranked No. 2 and who can unseat Sampras
from the top ranking in the season-ending tournament, headed the
White Group, while Sampras got into the Red Group.
	   Sampras will face Karol Kucera, Carlos Moya and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, whom he beat in last year's final when he won the
fourth title in the elite tournament of the top eight players of
the year.
	   Rios will battle Agassi, Alex Corretja and Tim Henman.
	   The tournament begins Tuesday.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ A global oil glut, mild North American
weather, weakened economies in Asia and 11-year-low prices spell
trouble for OPEC as oil ministers convene this week, analysts said
Monday.
	   Oil ministers from the cartel were gathering Monday ahead of
Wednesday's year-end meeting to discuss how to lift prices.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, an Iranian newspaper warned
Monday that OPEC's credibility is at stake. The daily Hamshahri,
published by the Tehran city government, said the organization must
draw up new methods and policies, not just tinker with production
ceilings.
	   ``OPEC is confronted with a big test,'' which if it fails ``will
place a seal of approval on views that call for the termination of
OPEC's epoch'' and prolong low prices, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 65 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in Romania and
Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 32 people died, most
of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold after
drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit). The lowest
temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15 Fahrenheit)
early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.
	   In Romania, at least 21 people died from the cold and in
weather-related accidents on snow-covered roads since Friday.
Temperatures plunged to minus 10 Celsius (14 degrees F) early
Monday.
	   About 200 people spent more than 48 hours stranded in their cars
after winds whipped snowdrifts across main highways in southern
Romania. Army vehicles rescued most drivers, but six people froze
to death over the weekend after being trapped in their cars.
	   Dozens of trains were canceled and 200 communities were reported
to be without electricity, the Libertatea newspaper reported
Monday. Some 15 major roads were blocked by snowdrifts as high as
1.5 meters (five feet). Police urged drivers not to travel in snowy
areas.
	   In Bucharest, dozens of cars smashed into other vehicles and
skidded in the icy conditions. The Emergency Hospital in Bucharest
said it treated 80 people for fractures and frostbite over the
weekend.
	   In France, the death toll from the cold snap rose Monday to six
people, three of them homeless men.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris were completely
frozen, and in Mouthe, in eastern France, temperatures fell Monday
morning to minus 21 Celsius (minus 6 F). About 100 homeless people
staged a sit-in at the headquarters of the state-run medical
assistance service in Paris to demand better protection in winter.
	   Italian authorities reported the Sunday death of a 91-year-old
Italian man after being found in his unheated home in Calabria, in
southern Italy. The cold was also being blamed for the deaths of a
husband and wife, killed by carbon monoxide poisoning _ apparently
from a defective heater _ at their home in rural Lombardy.
	   In Bulgaria, three people died in the northwestern region of
Montana, the daily 24 Chassa reported Monday. Some highways were
blocked and some areas were without power, phones and running
water.
	   The Black Sea ports of Burgas in Bulgaria and Constanta in
Romania were closed Monday due to storms, state radio reported.

	   BOMBAY, India (AP) _ Pakistan's planned cricket tour in India is
causing a rift between two Hindu nationalist partners in India's
ruling coalition.
	   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee said over the weekend that
the team from India's hostile neighbor would be welcome and well
protected during the tour scheduled for January. He was responding
to threats by the head of the ultra-nationalist Shiv Sena party in
Bombay, Bal Thackeray, to block the Pakistani cricketers from
Indian soil.
	   On Monday, Thackeray reiterated that his party would not allow
the Pakistani cricketers to play in Maharashtra state, his party's
stronghold.
	   ``It is for the Bharatiya Janata Party to see whether it would
like to continue alliance with the Shiv Sena. The ball is in the
BJP's court, and if it wants to break the alliance, break,''
Thackeray said in an interview with a television network.
	   Cricket is a passion in both countries, and the sporting rivalry
between India and Pakistan is heightened by the political enmity
that led the two countries to war three times in the last 50 years.
	   The Shiv Sena is one of the smaller partners with Vajpayee's
Bharatiya Janata Party in the federal coalition. But the alliance
between the BJP and Shiv Sena is more important in the state
politics of Maharashtra, of which Bombay is the capital.
	   On Monday, newspapers quoted Gopinath Munde, the state minister
in charge of internal security, as distancing himself from
Thackeray.
	   ``Sports, music and arts should be free from political ill
will,'' said Munde, the senior Bharatiya Janata Party minister in
the state government.
	   Thackeray said Pakistani cricket should be boycotted by
``staunch Hindus'' as long as Pakistan supports the Muslim
separatist insurrection in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state
in predominantly Hindu India. Pakistan denies actively helping the
militants.
	   Shiv Sena is a powerful regional party in Maharashtra state. Its
activists disrupted a test match between India and Pakistan more
than a decade ago by digging up the pitch. The Pakistan cricket
team hasn't played an international match in Bombay, the capital of
Maharashtra state, since then.

Madrid officials go underground to ease traffic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bucking criticism that they are dabbling in
science fiction, Spanish officials Monday unveiled a dlrs 2.2
billion plan to ease Madrid's traffic woes with a network of
underground highways.
	   The blueprint calls for building a circular road under the city
center, from which 12 spokes would radiate _ six leading into
Madrid and six out.
	   The arteries, covering some 100 kilometers (65 miles) would lie
about 50 meters (165 feet) underground, below the city's subway
system. The plan, which also calls for building 30,000 subterranean
parking spaces, would allow drivers to criss-cross the city without
surfacing.
	   Construction is to begin sometime over the next 18 months, and
take eight to 10 years to complete, the city government said.
	   Outlines of the project were presented by the center-right mayor
of Madrid, Jose Maria Alvarez del Manzano, and Spanish Development
Minister Rafael Arias-Salgado.
	   They said no taxpayer money would go into the project because it
will be funded by the construction companies that build the roads.
These firms, which have yet to be chosen, will then recoup their
investment by charging tolls and by operating the new underground
parking lots.
	   The opposition Socialist Party dismissed the project as a
dehumanizing fantasy that is financially and technically unviable
and will never get off the ground.
	   ``They are trying to sell us projects that don't make sense,''
spokesman Juan Barranco said. ``If this network of underground
roads were built it would be a real blunder.''
	   But Enrique Villoria, the city's public works chief, said
officials are confident the project is sound and that a number of
companies want to submit bids.
	   ``When the city government jumps into a swimming pool, it does
so because it knows the pool is full of water,'' Villoria said.
	   Greater Madrid's estimated five million residents are painfully
used to monster traffic jams. Over morning coffee, motorists who
commute from the suburbs regularly trade war stories over the day's
traffic.
	   Local elections are scheduled for next year but Mayor Alvarez
del Manzano insisted the project is not an electoral ploy but
rather a sincere attempt to ease traffic, noise and pollution.

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Sharon insisting on Palestinian police
commander's extradition, 7th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday released three Palestinian
policemen who had been held for 15 months without trial on
suspicion they planned to attack a Jewish settlement.
	   The three were detained on July 14, 1997, near the Jewish West
Bank settlement of Bracha after Israeli troops opened fire on their
car. One of the policemen was injured in the hand.
	   Israeli media reported at the time that the three were armed
with automatic weapons and hand grenades.
	   The incident caused a major crisis in relations between Israel
and the Palestinians.
	   The Israeli government said the three had been sent by the
commander of the Palestinian police, Brig. Gen. Ghazi Jabali, to
attack Bracha.
	   Israel revoked Jabali's VIP pass to cross Israeli territory
without security checks and demanded his extradition. The
Palestinians denied the charge and refused to extradite him.
	   Last month, during negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians at Wye Plantation near Washington, Israel dropped its
demand for Jabali's extradition as a condition for further
withdrawals from the West Bank. But during a visit to Jordan
Monday, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon told Israel Radio that Israel
continues to insist on Jabali's extradition.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon Monday, killing
an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Two Israeli-allied militiamen were also wounded in guerrilla
shelling of a second outpost on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israel retaliated with airstrikes and the bombardment of
Lebanese villages facing the enclave, wounding three Lebanese
civilians.
	   Israeli warplanes fired at least one air-to-surface missile at
an area between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north
of the enclave, the officials said.
	   Jets returned three hours later to fire two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla positions in Jebaa, a Hezbollah stronghold
across from the border enclave.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel on Monday released three Palestinian
policemen who had been held more than a year without trial on
suspicion they planned to attack a Jewish settlement.
	   The three were detained on July 14, 1997, near the Jewish West
Bank settlement of Bracha after Israeli troops opened fire on their
car. One of the policemen was shot in the hand.
	   Israeli media reported at the time that the three carried
automatic weapons and grenades.
	   The incident caused another crisis in relations between Israel

	   The Israeli government said the three had been sent by the

	   Israel revoked Jabali's VIP pass to cross Israeli territory
without security checks and demanded his extradition. The
Palestinians denied the charge and refused to extradite him.
	   lt was not until the negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians at Wye Plantation near Washington last month that
Israel dropped its demand for Jabali's extradition.
	   The three policemen were released Monday, one day after an
Israeli military appeals court ruled that there was no evidence to
justify their continued detention without trial, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's spokesman, Aviv Bushinsky, said.
	   Bushinsky said their release was not part of the Wye agreement
in which Israel promised to release 750 Palestinian prisoners.
	   ``There was no deal,'' Bushinsky said. ``The three are not
included in those being released under the Wye agreement.''

Britain says Iraqi position on documents amounts to less than
</HEADLINE>
compliance &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATION (AP) _ Iraq's resistance to turning over documents
about its arms programs shows it is not complying fully with its
own promise to resume cooperation with inspectors, Britain's U.N.
ambassador said Monday.
	   As a result, a promised Security Council review of Baghdad's
seven-year effort to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction
remains ``in the future,'' Jeremy Greenstock said.
	   Baghdad has pinned its hopes on a lifting of the eight-year U.N.
oil embargo to the review, which the council agreed to as a way to
persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more
completely on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a
preliminary outline for the review that didn't specifically refer
to a lifting of the embargo as a possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14, pledging
unconditional cooperation with UNSCOM and narrowly averting what
U.S. officials have said were imminent airstrikes.
	   Greenstock spoke to reporters as council members met for the
first time since Iraq balked Friday at a U.N. request for documents
related to its missiles and chemical and biological weapons
programs.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that those weapons, as well as
nuclear arms, are destroyed before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf war.
	   Iraqi officials have said that many of the papers were
destroyed, never existed, or have already been turned over. Top
officials in Baghdad said over the weekend that the request by the
chief inspector, Richard Butler, was merely aimed at justifying a
U.S. military strike.
	   They have also placed conditions on viewing one particular air
force document detailing expended munitions that may have been
filled with chemical and biological agents in the 1980-88 war
between Iraq and Iran.
	   ``What this boils down to is less than full compliance, which is
what they promised eight days ago,'' Greenstock said. ``So I think
there will be concern about that.''
	   The United States and Britain have said military force remains
an option for forcing Baghdad to cooperate with inspectors.
	   ``We have in place in the Gulf enough capability to carry out
any military options the president might decide would be
required,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday at a
Pentagon briefing.
	   The council was expected to discuss the document issue Monday,
council president Peter Burleigh of the United States said. Also on
the agenda was the U.N. oil-for-food program, which lets Iraq sell
limited amounts of oil to buy food and medicine.
	   Also Monday, Iraq complained in a letter that the United States
was violating its obligations as the host country of the United
Nations by preventing an Iraqi official from attending the U.N.
General Assembly.
	   The letter from Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the United
States told the Iraqi mission here that an entry visa would be
issued at the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan, for the head of the
legal department in Iraq's foreign affairs ministry. The official,
Muhammad Abdullah Al-Doory, was forced to wait in Amman for seven
days and answer personal questions, yet he still failed to obtain a
visa, Hamdoon wrote.

Police in Swaziland hunt for bombers; reward offered
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) _ Police on Monday hunted for suspects
in last week's bombing of a government office building, with the
prime minister demanding they ``face the nation and God with an
explanation'' for the attack.
	   A security guard died and six people were wounded in the
explosion on Friday that tore out a section of the two-story
building and shattered glass in storefronts on one of the capital's
busiest streets.
	   Prime Minister Sibusiso Barnabas Dlamini issued a statement
Sunday offering a 50,000 rand (dlrs 9,000) reward for information
leading to the arrest or prosecution of the bombers.
	   Police, who erected checkpoints outside Mbabane, have begun ``an
intensive hunt for those who committed this barbaric act,'' Dlamini
said.
	   Dlamini did not comment on a claim by a caller to the Times of
Swaziland newspaper that the Tigers, a previously unheard of group,
had planted the bomb to protest Swaziland's system of government.
	   Political parties are banned in Swaziland, a kingdom of 1
million people sandwiched between South Africa and Mozambique.
	   The second bombing in Swaziland in less than a month came hours
after King Mswati III swore in a new Cabinet in another part of the
capital.
	   Last month, an explosion damaged a bridge and injured one
person, two hours after the king crossed the span. No suspects have
been arrested in either attack.
	   Mario Masuku, president of the opposition People's United
Democratic Movement, denounced the attacks and said his group was
not involved.
	   ``Such activities don't happen in civilized free situations ...
we believe conflict should be resolved by peaceful means,'' Masuku
said.
	   Masuku's group has criticized the monarchy for its ban on
political parties and had urged voters to boycott parliamentary
elections which were held in October. His group is not technically
a political party and would not have been able to field candidates
during the elections, all of whom must be approved by the king.
	   In his statement, Dlamini challenged the bombers to step forward
and ``be counted and face the nation and God with an explanation.''

EU lifts ban on vast majority of British beef exports
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union voted Monday to lift
a worldwide export ban on the vast majority of British beef, a
milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against
its EU allies for some three years.
	   ``The beef ban is lifted,'' said British Farm Minister Nick
Brown. ``The beef is safe to eat.''
	   Ten of the 15 EU farm ministers meeting here voted to scrap the
ban on deboned beef, with Germany the lone holdout. France, Spain,
Austria and Luxembourg abstained.
	   The decision should clear the way to ending the crisis for
British farmers, who were badly hit by a ban on all beef exports
imposed by he EU in March 1996. Estimated losses from the ban
amount to over 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.3 billion) and the crisis
undermined confidence in beef throughout Europe.
	   ``The question now is how to get back on the world markets,''
said Brown, predicting an uphill struggle to re-establish the
reputation of British beef.
	   Monday's decision ``will tend to boost the confidence of the
British consumer and presumably other consumers throughout the EU
and our beef trade and our beef producers will get back to
normal,'' Dr. John Mann, superintendent of Britain's largest meat
market, Smithfields, said in London.
	   The move to ease the ban was boosted early this month when eight
out of 15 veterinary experts endorsed the plan to resume exports.
	   Now, the issue goes back to the EU's executive Commission, which
will send inspectors to Britain for a final examination of safety
standards, opening the way for exports early in the new year. No
more ministerial votes on the issue are needed.
	   Exports were banned after Britain announced a possible link
between ``mad cow'' disease in British cattle and a fatal brain
ailment in humans called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.
	   Monday's decision will be immediately followed by a campaign to
put British beef back on the plates of consumers throughout the
15-nation EU.
	   ``It will still be some months before the first shipments of
beef actually resume and there is much work to be done to
re-establish markets,'' said Ben Gill, president of Britain's
National Farmers Union.
	   In the wake of the 1996 ban, the previous Conservative
government of Prime Minister John Major instigated a policy of
non-cooperation with its partners which effectively paralyzed the
EU for months.
	   Relations improved after Tony Blair became prime minister in May
1997. EU farm ministers approved a resumption of beef exports from
Northern Ireland in March.
	   Ahead of the ban, Britain exported some 270,000 tons of beef,
totaling some dlrs 1 billion, in 1995. Mann said he hoped exports
would be back to such levels within a couple of years.

Bahrain arrests six suspected militants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Security forces have arrested six men
suspected of receiving training in southern Lebanon to carry out
attacks in Bahrain, the official Gulf News Agency reported Monday.
	   The arrests come amid a stiff government crackdown against
political unrest led by Shiite Muslims that has plagued this Gulf
island for nearly four years.
	   The agency said that five of the arrested men were Bahrainis,
while the sixth was a Lebanese man identified as Suhail Mahdi
Shehatah.
	   The agency said Shehatah led the group, which it said had
received training in south Lebanon to carry out terrorist and
subversive activities in Bahrain.
	   It added that security forces had seized weapons and explosives
that the men were trying to smuggle into Bahrain.
	   The men confessed to carrying out arson attacks and bombings in
Bahrain, the agency added.
	   It did not say when the men were arrested or what kind of
weapons or explosives they were trying to smuggle into the country.
	   Since December 1994, Shiite Muslims have led a violent campaign
for democratic and social reforms that include restoration of the
National Assembly, which was dissolved in 1975.
	   Hundreds of activists have been detained in connection with the
violence, which has included bombings and arson attacks. More than
40 people have been reported killed in the unrest.
	   A slight majority of Bahrain's 400,000 citizens are Shiites, but
the ruling Al Khalifa family belongs to the mainstream Sunni sect
of Islam.

New U.N. telecoms chief stresses cost-based communications
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos GEV105,106 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Wealthy and developing countries must come to
agreement on a fair method for determining how much they pay each
other for international phone calls, the future chief of the U.N.
telecommunications agency said Monday.
	   The dispute over the ``accounting rate system'' is one of the
one of the major topics which needs to be resolved, said Yoshio
Utsumi, designated new director general of the International
Telecommunications Union.
	   Industrialized countries complain that they have to pay
developing countries too much for receiving international calls.
	   Costs must be linked to the actual cost of the call, Utsumi, who
takes over Feb. 1, told a news conference.
	   The originating company charges the caller making the
long-distance call and then has to pay a portion of the fee to the
receiving country for making the connection to its customer.
	   Until now, the charges were weighted to help the developing
world improve its telecommunications facilities, Utsumi said.
	   ``The direction in which we all have to go is to cost-based
charges, but we need some time to adjust to that,'' said Utsumi.
	   The 56-year-old, who is deputy minister of the Japanese Ministry
of Posts and Telecommunications, also stressed the importance of
involving private companies in the ITU as more and more countries
privatize their systems and open them up to competition.
	   The importance of combating the Millennium Bug could not be
emphasized too much, added Utsumi.
	   Computer programmers are scrambling to avert disaster on New
Year's Day 2000 when computer systems may fail because they only
recognize the last to digits of a year and assume it is 1900.

Feuding Catholic bishops seek Vatican's arbitration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROLAND PRINZ &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Two feuding Roman Catholic bishops in
Austria who accuse each other of lying took their unprecedented
conflict to the Vatican on Monday for possible arbitration.
	   The dispute between the archbishop of Vienna, Cardinal Christoph
Schoenborn, and Bishop Kurt Krenn of St. Poelten reflects a deeper
rift in the Catholic hierarchy the bishops consistently deny.
	   At issue is Krenn's claim he was unfamiliar with the contents of
a five-year report presented Saturday by Austrian bishops at the
Vatican. His statement, and the resulting feud, have made headlines
in Austria and drawn sharp criticism from church leaders and
Catholic lay people.
	   Among other things, the document admitted to clumsy handling of
a scandal involving retired Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who was
accused of sexually abusing young boys and men but never directly
admitted his guilt. Groer, who had to relinquish all his church
functions, recently returned from months of Vatican-imposed exile
and is reported to be terminally ill.
	   A visibly angry Schoenborn disputed Krenn's claim last week,
telling Austrian state television from Rome on Friday,
``Objectively, what he (Krenn) said was simply not correct.''
	   Krenn has remained defiant, however, saying ``liars should keep
their mouths shut.''
	   Rejecting calls for a public show of repentance, he was quoted
Monday by the Vienna daily Der Standard as saying, ``Am I now
supposed to go around in underpants for half a year?''
	   Krenn also was quoted as saying that disciplinary proceedings
could only be initiated by the Vatican, ``because we are all
subject to the pope.''
	   The feuding bishops made an apparent attempt to settle their
conflict Monday, issuing a joint statement saying they had agreed
to take their ``discussion'' to ``the competent Roman congregation
for bishops _ a Vatican department _ and to seek its judgment, if
any.''
	   The Groer affair last year ignited a long-simmering conflict
between Austrian church leaders favoring reforms and others,
particularly Krenn, taking a conservative stance in line with
current Vatican policy.

Kitten alerts family to fire
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Disturbed by a fire in the night, a
kitten raced around frantically, waking up a family and saving it
from the raging flames.
	   But 3-month-old Topi was unable to escape the flames himself,
the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``Without Topi, we would've been engulfed by the flames,'' said
Heikki Tahvanainen, who narrowly escaped with his wife and
18-month-old son.
	   Tahvanainen woke to a loud sound at 2 a.m. on Sunday, and found
Topi leaping about in the room next door. Then he saw a strange
glow under the kitchen door.
	   ``I realized the house was on fire, and woke up the others. We
just had time to put on our pants,'' Tahvainen said.
	   Topi likely hid in some corner and perished in the flames,
Tahvanainen told Ilta-Sanomat. The family had no chance of saving
it, he added.
	   The fire destroyed the wooden house in Pyhaselka, 430 kilometers
(265 miles) northwest of Helsinki.

Court orders 10-year jail term for farmer who killed disabled
</HEADLINE>
daughter &QL;

 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Reversing a lenient lower-court sentence, an
appeals court Monday ruled that a Saskatchewan farmer must serve at
least 10 years in prison for killing his severely disabled daughter
in what he contended was an act of mercy.
	   The legal defeat for Robert Latimer was the latest twist in a
wrenching five-year case that has split public opinion across
Canada.
	   Latimer was convicted last year of second-degree murder for the
1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who suffered from
severe cerebral palsy.
	   The judge in the murder trial provoked a national furor by
refusing to impose the mandatory long prison term _ life with no
chance of parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking a rarely used
exemption, he sentenced Latimer to serve one year in a provincial
jail and a second year confined to his farm.
	   On Monday, Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld the
prosecutors' appeal and ruled that the trial judge erred by
refusing to impose the mandatory sentence.
	   Latimer, who has three other children, admitted to killing Tracy
by placing her in his pickup truck at the family farm and pumping
carbon monoxide into the cab. Tracy had suffered from a severe form
of cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk, talk or feed
herself.
	   The girl had endured operations on her back, hips and legs, and
her parents believed she faced the prospect of a lifetime of
painful surgery.
	   After convicting Latimer last year, jurors told the trial judge,
Ted Noble, they felt the mandatory sentence was too harsh and
recommended Latimer be paroled after one year.
	   Noble agreed with the jurors, saying the mandatory sentence
would in this case be cruel and unusual punishment.
	   ``The evidence establishes Mr. Latimer was motivated solely by
his love and compassion for Tracy and the need _ at least in his
mind _ that she should not suffer any more pain,'' Noble ruled.
	   Activists for the disabled were infuriated by Noble's ruling,
saying it sent a signal that the disabled have less of a right to
life than other people.
	   Latimer was first convicted in the case in 1994, but the Supreme
Court threw out that conviction because some jurors had been
improperly questioned by police.
	   Latimer received thousands of letters of support from people
across the country who saw him as a loving father who relieved his
daughter from a life of misery.
	   He had been free on his own recognizance pending the outcome of
the appeals of last year's trial.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin will run Russia from a hospital room
for several days at least, aides said Monday, after the president
fell ill with pneumonia _ the third time he's been sidelined by
sickness in recent weeks.
	   This latest ailment revived worries about Yeltsin's ability to
run a country mired in economic troubles. But his condition wasn't
critical enough to stop him from meeting with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in the Central Clinical Hospital on Monday.
	   Film on Russian TV networks showed the two leaders sharing a
joke in a reception room and Yeltsin, dressed in a sweater, did not
look particularly ill.
	   The 67-year-old president was rushed to the hospital Sunday with
pneumonia and a temperature of 38.9 degrees C (102 F), the Kremlin
said Monday. He was being treated with antibiotics.
	   Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved
either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday
night.
	   The president has rarely been seen in public recently, fueling
speculation that he is seriously ill. He fell sick in October
during a state visit to central Asia with what was described as a
respiratory ailment. He was taken ill again in late October with
what doctors described as high blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Since then the Kremlin appears to have been taking little chance
with the president's health, ensuring that he has frequent medical
checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian Constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would likely cancel meetings with foreign
visitors this month, but will continue to meet Russian officials at
the hospital.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital, but
added that treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   Also Monday, a top Kremlin aide was quoted by the Interfax news
agency as saying that presidential power could be turned over to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff.
	   Savyolova said her remarks were unrelated to the president's
latest illness.
	   Primakov said Monday the government was working as normal and he
was not assuming any extra powers.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall. Dutch Queen Beatrix on Monday postponed a
visit to Russia planned for this week because of Yeltsin's
condition.
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and there
has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   ``We wish Mr. Yeltsin recovery,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said in unusually mild remarks at a news conference
Monday. ``But his illness is incurable _ he's an irresponsible
person who is unable to govern the country, and everyone knows
that.''

U.N. envoy back in Baghdad amid clash on arms documents

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A U.N. envoy returned Monday to Baghdad as
Iraq unleashed a new volley of criticism at the chief U.N. weapons
inspector and his demand for more arms-related documents.
	   The papers sought by Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N.
Special Commission, are spurring a new confrontation between the
government of Saddam Hussein and UNSCOM, which is overseeing the
destruction of Iraq's most dangerous weapons.
	   On Sunday, two leading Iraq officials derided Butler's request
as a move to justify a U.S. military strike on Iraq, saying the
government already had turned over all relevant documents.
	   U.N. envoy Prakash Shah came to Baghdad from Bahrain on Monday.
He refused to comment about the controversy, saying only that he
expected to meet with Iraqi officials.
	   Iraqi Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi said the latest
crisis between Baghdad and the United Nations had been
``concocted'' by Butler, adding that Iraq sent a letter to the U.N.
Security Council on Monday explaining its position.
	   Al-Qaisi said Butler's request came as Baghdad was hoping that a
U.N. review of progress toward weapons destruction would lead to an
easing of economic sanctions imposed by the world body after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   He said the United Nations had requested documents about issues
that Iraq and UNSCOM had already settled.
	   ``At the present time, with the legitimate expectation for a
comprehensive review to take place, Butler comes ... as if no work
at all has been settled,'' al-Qaisi said.
	   State-run Iraqi newspapers insisted Monday that Butler asked for
more paperwork because he has a grudge against Iraq.
	   ``Butler has personal motives to create a new crisis,'' the
daily Al-Thawra newspaper of the ruling Baath Party said in a
front-page editorial. ``He has explained Iraq's decision to let the
inspectors resume their activities ... as a personal victory, which
he believes will enable him to take revenge on Iraq.''
	   Iraq had asked for Butler's dismissal from UNSCOM as one of its
demands for allowing weapons inspectors to return to work. But it
reversed its ban on the inspectors' work Nov. 14 when faced with
airstrikes by U.S. and British forces.
	   The arms inspectors returned last week and have been making
daily visits to potential weapons sites with the cooperation of the
Iraqi government.
	   The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons
of mass destruction before the Security Council will lift the
sanctions. Iraq insists it has already gotten rid of all proscribed
weaponry.
	   Butler's weekend demand for new documents again raises the
possibility of American military strikes against Iraq because U.S.
President Bill Clinton has demanded full cooperation with the
weapons inspectors.
	   In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday
the military option remains open if Iraq fails to comply fully with
the inspectors' demands.
	   ``We have in place in the gulf enough capability to carry out
any military options the president might decide would be
required,'' Cohen told reporters.
	   David Leavy, a spokesman for the U.S. National Security Council,
said the refusal to hand over documents was an ``insufficient''
response to Butler's request but said no final conclusion had been
drawn. Leavy, who is traveling with Clinton, made his remarks in
South Korea.
	   Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, said Sunday that
Butler's demands were either intended to provoke an attack or to
put off a promised Security Council review of Iraq's cooperation in
arms destruction. The government hopes the review will lead to
easing the sanctions.
	   Aziz said some of the documents requested no longer exist, and
Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf said Iraq already has
given inspectors all relevant documents _ more than 2 million
pages.
	   He said Butler was leading ``a savage campaign ... of
disinformation'' to make it seem as if Iraq was not cooperating.
	   Asked if he thought the dispute over documents could provoke
more threats, al-Sahhaf said that U.N. resolutions don't ``say that
if you do not hand over a document that three cruise missiles will
hit your country.''
	   ``This is ridiculous,'' he said. ``So whatever party is
threatening that, he will bear the responsibility for that.''
	   Iraqi officials have said they are prepared to let the
inspectors see relevant portions of one requested document: a log
of chemical weapons used during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. But
they said some of the document concerned Iraq's national security
and could not be shown to inspectors.
	   In London, Britain organized a meeting today of 16 Iraqi
opposition groups. Afterward, British Foreign Office Minister Derek
Fatchett said Britain supports a campaign to have Saddam and his
top leaders indicted for crimes against humanity.
	   The opposition groups were scheduled to meet Tuesday with U.S.
Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk.

FIFA, Cameroon soccer officials meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Sports officials of Cameroon and FIFA
president Joseph Blatter met Monday to try resolving problems that
led to the dissolution last month of the Cameroon soccer
federation.
	   The world governing body of soccer, in a brief statement Monday,
described talks in Zurich as ``frank and sincere.'' In addition to
Blatter, Cameroon was represented by Joseph Owona, minister for
Youth and Sport, and Maurice Tadjore, Director of Sports.
	   FIFA said issues ``regarding football in Cameroon'' brought up
in the meeting would be referred to its Dec. 3-4 executive
committee meeting.
	   FIFA dissolved the Cameroon federation earlier this month for a
series financial problems and appointed an interim executive to run
the organization for nine months.
	   FIFA said Monday Cameroon would remain under the interim
executive until further notice.

Iraq ambassador. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATION (AP) _ Iraq's resistance to turning over documents
about its arms programs shows it is not complying fully with its
own promise to resume cooperation with inspectors, Britain's U.N.
ambassador said Monday.
	   As a result, a promised Security Council review of Baghdad's
seven-year effort to disarm itself of weapons of mass destruction
remains ``in the future,'' Jeremy Greenstock said.
	   Baghdad has pinned its hopes on a lifting of the eight-year U.N.
oil embargo to the review, which the council agreed to as a way to
persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with the U.N. Special
Commission, which is responsible for disarming Iraq.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more
completely on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a
preliminary outline for the review that didn't specifically refer
to a lifting of the embargo as a possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14, pledging
unconditional cooperation with UNSCOM and narrowly averting what
U.S. officials have said were imminent airstrikes.
	   Greenstock spoke to reporters as council members met for the
first time since Iraq balked Friday at a U.N. request for documents
related to its missiles and chemical and biological weapons
programs.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that those weapons, as well as
nuclear arms, are destroyed before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf war.
	   The council president was meeting with Iraq's ambassador later
Monday, U.N. officials said.

EU ministers: growth drive won't mean sloppy finances

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's Social Democratic Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine used his European Union debut Monday to
seek support for a left-leaning agenda to shift the economic focus
from fighting inflation to creating jobs.
	   Lafontaine and his fellow socialists, who now run the
governments of all but four of the 15 EU nations, dismissed fears
their quest for economic expansion would mean a return to sloppy
finances.
	   ``We don't want to fall into a situation, as we had several
years ago, with lax budget policies and restrictive monetary
policies,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told
reporters.
	   Ahead of Monday's EU finance minister's meeting, the socialists
ministers stressed their commitment to the EU's ``stability pact''
which threatens fines against nations that run up big deficits
after they adopt the euro as a shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   ``The stability pact ... is vital given the importance of
budgetary discipline ... most European countries must be tougher on
their current budget deficits,'' the socialists said in a
joint-policy document entitled ``The New European Way.''
	   Ministers from the 11 nations in the first group to adopt the
euro met with Wim Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank,
which will set interest rates for the currency bloc.
	   Some urged him to keep rates low to help boost job-creation
since since inflation is at its lowest levels in decades, just 1
percent in the euro-zone. In contrast, unemployment in the 11
nations is stubbornly high at 10.9 percent.
	   ``Nobody disputes monetary policy must also support economic
growth and employment, if price stability isn't endangered,''
Lafontaine said. ``We all agree that price stability exists.''
	   However, Lafontaine insisted he was not seeking to undermine the
bank's independence from government interference. Duisenberg told
reporters he felt ``no pressure whatsoever to cut rates.''
	   Despite the plans for intensified cooperation, ministers were
confronted with serious policy differences.
	   Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, another
socialist, warned he'd veto French and German proposals for EU-wide
taxes aimed at discouraging companies from crossing borders in
search of lower taxes. ``Tax harmonization is no way forward for
Europe,'' Brown said.
	   In a dispute over who represents the euro-zone internationally,
Germany, France and Italy irritated smaller nations by refusing to
cede their seats at the G-7 group of world economic powers to a
joint euro-bloc representative.
	   ``It's a chance for Europe to speak with one voice (but) there
is a rift between those that have a seat at the G-7 and the
others,'' said EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy.
	   There were hints of a compromise as France backed a proposal for
a rotating system that would allow a minister from one of the
smaller nations to sit at G-7 finance meetings alongside the EU's
existing G-7 members and the European Central Bank.
	   Differences also persisted over efforts to overhaul the EU's
budget so the Union can afford to bring in up to 12 new members
over the next decade, mostly from former-communist eastern Europe.
	   Britain, Germany and others are pushing for a freeze that would
keep spending at current levels until 2006. Less well-off EU
members led by Spain fear such rigor will mean them losing out as
funds start flowing to the even poorer easterners.
	   ``I don't believe this is a positive or constructive way
forward,'' said Rodrigo Rato, Spain's economics minister.

German government wants to push for Europe-wide aircraft fuel tax
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and his
environment minister told a meeting of tourist experts Monday in
Bonn that they intend to push for a Europe-wide aircraft fuel tax.
	   Schroeder told the gathering that while Germany would not
implement such a tax on its own, the exemption of tax for some
users of kerosene was ``ecologically unacceptable,'' and distorted
competition between transport systems.
	   Kerosene for trucks and other vehicles in Germany is taxed.
	   Environment Minister Juergen Trittin said that not taxing fuel
for the flying industry ``the most energy intensive form of
travel,'' was an indirect state subsidy that amounted to about 6
billion marks (dlrs 3.5 billion)'' a year.
	   Aircraft fuel has remained exempt from tax in Germany, despite
various attempts over the years to impose one.

Moscow mayor to visit Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, a leading potential
contender in Russia's 2000 presidential election, will visit
Germany and meet with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder next month, in
an apparent bid to raise Luzhkov's foreign profile.
	   The mayor will tour Berlin, Munich, Bonn and Dusseldorf on Dec.
8-11, the Interfax news agency reported Monday, citing the mayor's
office.
	   Luzhkov, who is tremendously popular and powerful in Moscow but
is little known outside the country, has clearly been trying to
raise his foreign affairs profile ahead of the 2000 election.
	   It also remains unclear how much support he can summon in
Russia's impoverished provinces, which often resent Moscow's
relative prosperity.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albania's fiery opposition leader on
Monday urged supporters to ``fill the streets of Tirana'' to
protest the government's apparent victory in persuading voters to
back a Western-style constitution.
	   The call of Sali Berisha, a key figure both in September rioting
in the capital and prolonged unrest last year, raised fears of
renewed violence.
	   By dusk Monday, about 2,000 people chanting anti-government
slogans peacefully filled downtown Skanderbeg Square _ the scene of
rioting and gunfire after the September assassination of Azem
Hajdari, a prominent member of Berisha's Democratic Party.
	   Earlier Monday, his voice at a near scream, a fist-waving
Berisha accused the government of voting fraud and intimidation in
Sunday's referendum meant to give Europe's poorest nation its first
post-communist Constitution.
	   His voice at a near scream, Berisha accused the government of
voting fraud and intimidation in Sunday's referendum meant to give
Europe's poorest nation its first post-communist Constitution.
	   ``I call on everybody in Tirana to take to the streets in self
defense,'' Berisha said.
	   The Constitution is meant to give citizens the right to legally
change their religion and to identify themselves as members of an
ethnic minority. Opposition leaders call these clauses
``anti-Albanian'' and predict many people will turn away from
Islam, the dominant religion, to avoid discrimination while working
in richer, non-Muslim neighbors such as Greece.
	   The constitution also defines property rights and lets the
government expropriate land deemed of national interest. Critics
say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   On his way out of a hotel, Berisha ran into members of the
European Parliament who observed the vote. ``The government
violated the process, and the people will go out on the streets and
show them that is very serious,'' Berisha shouted at them.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which oversaw the balloting, said the referendum was
relatively incident-free and voter turnout was higher than expected
consider a steady rain and a boycott call by Berisha.
	   Albania's Central Voting Committee said Monday more than 50
percent of voters participated. The committee said it may take a
few days to receive turnout results and ballot boxes from remote
regions, delaying referendum results.
	   Berisha disputed the committee's figures, saying no more than 38
percent of the population voted and accused the government of
rigging the elections.
	   Months of political violence last year led to early elections
that spelled defeat for Berisha and forced his resignation as
president. Violence fomented by Berisha supporters paralyzed the
country again earlier this year.

More than 100 police officers arrested in Mexico City raid

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Dozens of judicial police, many wearing ski
masks and armed with automatic rifles, raided a Mexico City police
station Monday and arrested about 100 police officers.
	   A police official, Ramon David Almada, said the arrested
officers were being charged with ``serious crimes,'' including
possible homicide, but declined to elaborate.
	   The arrested officers were members of the auxiliary police
force, which performs most day-to-day police functions such as
patrolling.
	   The raid was carried out by more than 100 members of Mexico
City's judicial police, who investigate most crimes and serve most
arrest warrants in the city.
	   Mexican television and radio provided live broadcasts of the
raid.

Canadian Cabinet minister resigns under fire for role in protest
</HEADLINE>
inquiry &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Andy Scott, the Cabinet minister who oversaw
federal police and prison agencies, resigned Monday because of an
embarrassing controversy that arose because of remarks overheard by
a political rival aboard an airplane.
	   Opposition parties had been clamoring for Scott's resignation as
solicitor general for almost two months, saying he was overheard
making prejudicial comments about an ongoing inquiry into police
handling of a 1997 political protest.
	   Scott initially denied making any controversial comments about
the inquiry into protests at last year's summit in Vancouver of
leaders from the Asia-Pacific region. But he was contradicted in
sworn statements both by his own seatmate and by an opposition
Parliament member who eavesdropped on the conversation from across
the aisle.
	   Scott's resignation was accepted by Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, who replaced him with former Labor Minister Lawrence
MacAulay and named Parliament member Claudette Bradshaw of New
Brunswick as labor minister.
	   Protesters at last year's summit have complained that police
used excessive force to break up their demonstrations against
Indonesian President Suharto.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Rail workers, fearing major job losses that might
come with deregulation, brought train traffic to a standstill in
parts of Europe Monday to voice their concerns.
	   Commuters were stranded in France, Belgium and Greece, where the
strike caused havoc during the morning rush hour. There were major
traffic jams, and subways were packed.
	   In Spain and Luxembourg, though, effects were minimal. In
Portugal, rail workers were staging a one-hour stoppage just before
evening rush hour.
	   The European Union's executive commission plans to increase
deregulation in the freight sector from 5 percent to 25 percent in
a bid to boost competition and efficiency.
	   European Union Transport Commissioner Neil Kinnock warned Monday
of the dangers of resisting reform.
	   ``The future is plain and very bleak,'' Kinnock said in a
statement. ``Without change there will be no rail transport in much
of the Union by 2012.''
	   Unions are sensitive to streamlining, aware that some 500,000
jobs already have been lost in the past 15 years.
	   Kinnock said that the percentage of overall freight transport on
trains had dropped from 32 percent in 1970 to 14 percent in 1996.
	   ``Without change the job loss will be devastating,'' Kinnock
said.
	   France's national train company, the SNCF, said about one in
three trains was running nationwide Monday. Suburban trains were
also disrupted, with just one in four operating on some lines.
	   ``I'm fed up with this. There seem to be strikes every week,''
said 31-year-old lawyer Stephanie Castela, her face pressed against
a window of the Paris Metro during morning rush hour.
	   ``There are some things you have to be able to guarantee, and
getting to work is one of them.''
	   In France, only Eurostar trains to London were running normally.
Buses replaced the high-speed Thalys trains from Paris to Brussels,
Amsterdam and Cologne. Only two out of 20 trains were scheduled to
run between London and Brussels.
	   In Belgium, train traffic also was crippled, transforming the
morning rush hour into a slow crawl. Traffic jams of up to 40
kilometers (25 miles) were reported outside Brussels.
	   In Greece, there were no trains at all, and workers rallied at
the Transport Ministry in Athens.
	   Although Germany was not directly affected, many long-distance
passengers were faced with delays. Unions in other countries also
handed out leaflets to protest deregulation.

Britain holds meeting of Iraqi opposition groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with Iraqi opposition declaring unity,
seeking public commitment from West &QL; 
 &UR; By AUDREY WOODS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Iraqi opposition groups won British support Monday
for their campaign to indict Saddam Hussein and his top leaders for
crimes against humanity.
	   ``I think it is clearly obvious that crimes have been committed
by the leadership,'' Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett said
after a meeting with representatives of 15 opposition groups. ``I
think the campaign is a strong one which the international
community would support.''
	   The groups planned to meet here Tuesday with U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Martin Indyk, who also had talks last week with
Ahmed Chalabi, head of Iraqi National Congress, an opposition
umbrella group.
	   The U.S. Congress has approved a dlrs 97 million aid package to
support Iraqi dissidents.
	   British officials said earlier that Fatchett's meeting with the
Iraqis was one of a series reflecting the greater frankness by the
United States and Britain that a prime aim after ending the
stalemate over U.N. weapons inspections is to topple Saddam.
	   ``It is almost inconceivable to imagine that Iraq without Saddam
Hussein would not be a better country,'' Fatchett said after the
meeting.
	   Fatchett said he had stressed to the often-competing opposition
groups that events are moving quickly in Iraq, making unity vital.
	   Spokesmen for the Iraqi National Congress later said the member
organizations were of one mind about their goals and needed a clear
public commitment from Britain and the United States.
	   ``The Iraqi opposition are very united in their objectives; the
removal of Saddam Hussein and the establishment of a democratic
alternative in Iraq,'' said Nabil Musawi.
	   ``We asked the British government and are asking the U.S
government tomorrow, to make a clear public, political statement in
support of the Iraqi opposition,'' Musawi said. ``We don't want
them to drop their commitment when things get too hot for them.''
	   Musawi said his group believed the Western allies who fought
Saddam in the 1991 Gulf War left the job ``half-done'' and so have
a moral obligation to support the Iraqi opposition in its efforts
to get rid of the dictator.
	   Fatchett emphasized that Britain's support would not be
military, but instead to help the opposition group coordinate its
campaign, which Musawi said his group understood.
	   What the Iraqi National Congress seeks ``is not foreign
forces,'' Musawi said. ``This is the duty of the Iraqi people.''
	   What the opposition groups want now is support for their
campaign to set up a war crimes tribunal, reactivation of the
opposition radio station to transmit their message to the Iraqi
people, and a clear commitment to the opposition and what it stands
for, he said.
	   Musawi's group reiterated its proposal to establish an
opposition government on Iraqi territory in a `no-fly zone'' to be
enforced by the United States and its allies.
	   Hamid al-Bayati, London representative of the Supreme Assembly
of the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, said the opposition leaders
urged Britain to make further efforts to protect human rights in
Iraq.
	   In Damascus, the Iraqi Communist Party and another Syrian-based
opposition group led by a former member of Saddam's Baath Party,
accused Britain of interfering.
	   Fadel Ansari, once a senior Baath official who now leads a
splinter pro-Syrian group in Damascus, said foreign intervention
``strengthens the regime and does not weaken it.''

India to open insurance business to private sector
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The federal Cabinet on Monday decided to
open up the insurance business to private sector and allow up to 40
percent foreign equity.
	   The decision is expected to boost foreign investors' confidence
in India's fledgling economy. The government would introduce
legislation during a Parliament's session later this month, Finance
Minister Yashwant Sinha told reporters in New Delhi.
	   ``Foreign equity participation in insurance sector would be up
to 26 percent, while additional holding or investment by foreign
institutional investors, nonresident Indians and Overseas
Corporation Bodies would be up to 14 percent,'' Sinha said.
	   The government has been under pressure from investors to allow
foreign equity in insurance business.
	   On Monday, the Cabinet also decided to amend the Indian Patents
Act to provide for exclusive marketing rights.
	   Indian industrialists say business was passing through a very
difficult time in the country and that investors have suffered
heavy losses due to a sharp decline in market capitalization.
	   Many large basic industries, such as iron and steel, cement,
paper, chemicals textiles and capital goods have been experiencing
an unprecedented slowdown in demand.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars Monday at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, killing
an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Two Israeli-allied militiamen were also wounded in guerrilla
shelling of a second outpost on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israel retaliated with airstrikes and the bombardment of
Lebanese villages facing the enclave, wounding three Lebanese
civilians.
	   Israeli warplanes fired at least one air-to-surface missile at
an area between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north
of the enclave, the officials said.
	   Jets returned three hours later to fire two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla positions in Jebaa, a Hezbollah stronghold
across from the border enclave.

strategy &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer apparently
wants to push for a more defensive strategy in NATO, because he
feels 1991 plans for the use of nuclear weapons are outdated, a
ministry spokesman said Monday.
	   Spokesman Martin Erdmann said Monday that Fischer wants
Germany's NATO partners to consider further nuclear disarmament and
drop plans for a first strike option.
	   Fischer wants to get a discussion started and had already
discussed the theme with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine and
NATO General Secretary Javier Solana, Erdmann said.
	   Erdmann said that the foreign minister had no intention of
Germany going its own way on the idea of updating NATO strategy,
but wanted other member states to start thinking of the
possibilities.

Tyson settles dispute
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NANCY ZUCKERBROD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and two
men he is accused of assaulting agreed Monday to settle a dispute
following an August traffic accident.
	   The deal was reached to prevent Abmielec Saucedo and Richard
Hardick from filing a lawsuit against Tyson, said Saucedo's
attorney, Glenn Culpepper.
	   ``Everything's not finalized until all the t's are crossed and
the i's are dotted,'' said Culpepper, explaining he expected the
final settlement soon. Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
	   The men accused Tyson of punching and kicking them following a
minor traffic accident on Aug. 31 involving Tyson's wife, Monica,
in the Washington suburb of Gaithersburg, Maryland.
	   Tyson still faces criminal misdemeanor assault charges over the
matter and is scheduled to stand trial in Rockville, Maryland, on
Dec. 1.
	   Tyson attorney Paul Kemp said he does not expect the settlement
to affect the case.
	   Culpepper said his client has cooperated with prosecutors and is
expected to testify. Tyson is making plans to be in Maryland for
the trial, Kemp said.
	   Last month, Tyson and his attorneys met with State Attorney
Robert Dean and asked him to postpone the trial for a year and
suggested he drop the charges if Tyson stayed out of trouble.
Initially, Dean said he would consider the request but then ruled
against it, citing Tyson's criminal record.
	   Tyson is on probation for a 1992 rape conviction in Indiana.
Kemp acknowledged that a conviction in Maryland could send him back
to prison.
	   The Nevada Athletic Commission returned Tyson's boxing license
last month. It was revoked after he bit Evander Holyfield's ears
during a June 1997 title bout.

New U.N. telecoms chief stresses cost-based communications
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos GEV105-106 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Wealthy and developing countries must come to
agreement on a fair method for determining how much they pay each
other for international phone calls, the future chief of the U.N.
telecommunications agency said Monday.
	   The dispute over the ``accounting rate system'' is one of the
one of the major topics which needs to be resolved, said Yoshio
Utsumi, designated new director general of the International
Telecommunications Union.
	   Industrialized countries complain that they have to pay
developing countries too much for receiving international calls.
	   Costs must be linked to the actual cost of the call, Utsumi, who
takes over Feb. 1, told a news conference.
	   The originating company charges the caller making the
long-distance call and then has to pay a portion of the fee to the
receiving country for making the connection to its customer.
	   Until now, the charges were weighted to help the developing
world improve its telecommunications facilities, Utsumi said.
	   ``The direction in which we all have to go is to cost-based
charges, but we need some time to adjust to that,'' said Utsumi.
	   The 56-year-old, who is deputy minister of Japan's Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications, also stressed the importance of
involving private companies in the ITU as more and more countries
privatize their systems and open them up to competition.

Injured Agassi avoids the group of Sampras
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras, battling to retain his No.
1 ranking for a record sixth year in a row, got a group without
fellow American Andre Agassi at Monday's draw for the ATP World
Championship. The bad news for Agassi was a sudden back injury.
	   Agassi missed the draw to get treatment for back spasms he
suffered in practice Monday and will not start playing until
Wednesday in the round-robin portion of the dlrs 3.5 million event.
	   ``I went to hit a shot and managed to get a little stuck on the
court and fell down,'' Agassi said. ``I still remain hopeful but if
I don't take care of it right now it's going to get worse, so I
need to treat it.''
	   Marcelo Rios, who is ranked No. 2 and who can unseat Sampras
from the top ranking in the season-ending tournament, headed the
White Group, while Sampras got into the Red Group.
	   Sampras will face Karol Kucera, Carlos Moya and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov. Sampras will kick off the tournament Tuesday against
Kafelnikov, the Russian whom he beat in last year's final when he
won the fourth title in the elite tournament of the top eight
players of the year.
	   Rios will battle Agassi, Alex Corretja and Tim Henman.
	   ``Anytime I'm away from Pete, I don't mind,'' said Agassi, who
won the event in 1990. ``I'll certainly do everything I can to play
here.''
	   Moya, the French Open champion, beat Sampras in last year's
round-robin portion.
	   ``Each match is very important this year,'' Sampras said.
	   Sampras is trying to become the first player to finish as No. 1
for six years in a row. He now shares the record of five with Jimmy
Connors, who held the No. 1 spot from 1974 to 1978.
	   Only 33 points separate Sampras from Rios on the computer
rankings. To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras basically has to keep
pace with Rios. Rios needs to win at least two round-robin matches
to have a shot at No. 1. Two players from each group advance to the
semifinals.
	   ``I am not putting too much pressure on myself,'' Sampras said.
``The pressure is on both of us, but I've done it five years and he
still has to do it.''
	   ``It's a record that's really hard to achieve. It's rare that
you have something in your hands that may stay for eternity. It
would be an achievement that I feel may never be touched,'' Sampras
said.
	   ``But the Grand Slam record is something I put above
everything,'' said Sampras, who has 11 Grand Slam title, one short
of the record of Roy Emerson.
	   Although he won Wimbledon for the fifth time this year, Sampras
has had a relatively modest season by his standards, winning only
three more titles.
	   Rios, who at 22 is five years younger than Sampras, on the other
hand leads the tour with seven titles. The Chilean has already held
the No. 1 spot twice briefly this year. This is his first
appearance at he World Championship.
	   On other matches Tuesday, Moya plays Kucera and Rios battles
Henman.

Despite some shortcomings, Palestinians' airport set to open
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The control tower is still without
controls, the check-in counter has no computers, and the runway
can't function after dark for lack of flood lights.
	   Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International Airport
is set to open Tuesday morning, aided by a little bit of
improvisation and a lot of patriotic pride.
	   ``It's a glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are
open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching as
workers painted white lines on the tarmac in the southern Gaza
Strip, close to the Egyptian border, on Monday.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will be on hand to welcome the
first plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian government officials at
about 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt). At half-hour intervals, six more are to
arrive from faraway places such as Morocco and Spain. The European
Union, which donated dlrs 38 million for equipment and training, is
sending its Mideast envoy in a special plane.
	   The airport opening had been held up for two years because of
disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's
role in monitoring passengers and cargo.
	   In the end, Israel will have a say over who and what is coming
into the Gaza Strip, but the Israeli monitors will operate
discretely, behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at the Rafah and
Allenby Bridge crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye
River peace agreement. But reporters trying to learn more about
operations, such as whether the airport would be affected by
Israeli security closures on Palestinian areas, heard a lot of
``I'd have to check that'' answers from the Israeli officials.
	   The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez
Zeidan, was not available for comment all day Monday.
	   For many Palestinians, the airport is a powerful landmark on the
road to independence. For those living in the small, overcrowded
Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one side and by
barbed wire on the other three, it may also help ease the
ever-present feeling of being trapped.
	   ``It's a symbol of freedom,'' said Khaled Salmeh, 21, who
studies economics at Gaza City University.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go throughm,'' he said, adding that he would
fly from Gaza International to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to
Mecca, Islam's holiest site, next month.
	   For the time being, it will still be a bit of an adventure to
fly out of Gaza International or land there.
	   Palestinian officials say the equipment for the control tower,
the computers for the check-in counters and the flood lights are
still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
	   Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman for Israel's Civil Aviation Authority,
acknowledged that there have been delays in some of the equipment
reaching Dahanieh, but said he did not know the reasons.
	   Portable control equipment installed in a van will guide
Tuesday's flights to a safe landing. The passengers will be checked
in at the Rafah border crossing, a 10-minute busride away. And
until the flood lights arrive, there will be no night flights.
	   Designed in an Oriental style with elaborate tiles imported from
Morocco, the airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a
3.3-kilometer-long (2-mile) runway.
	   With just few hours left before the opening, the airport still
looked like a construction site Monday. Electrical cords dangled
from the ceiling of the terminal. Workers unpacked crates of office
furniture and laid plush red carpeting in the VIP lounge.
	   Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian, Spanish and German flags
fluttered from the control tower. A 4-foot-tall poster of Arafat
was attached with masking tape to the walls of the tower.
	   For the time being, Israelis will not permitted to use the
airport, Israeli government officials said, citing security
concerns. However, many believe Gaza International will eventually
become a tough competitor to Ben Gurion International Airport near
Tel Aviv.
	   Shmuel Rechtman, chairman of the regional council of the Negev
Plateau, an order in Israel bordering on Gaza, said he believed
that within a year, Israeli farmers would be exporting most of
their flowers and produce to Europe from Gaza International.
	   ``Economic realities are much stronger than any law,'' he said.

Netanyahu pays visit to Jewish settlers isolated under pullback

	   HERMESH, West Bank (AP) _ Appealing to worried Jewish settlers
Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised this isolated
West Bank community a larger budget, a swimming pool and computers
for their children.
	   Netanyahu has come under fire from the powerful settler lobby
and hard-liners in his government for signing a peace deal which
handed over 2 percent of the area to Palestinian control last week.
	   As settlers dug their heels deeper into West Bank land,
Netanyahu paid his first to settlements since signing the accord
and reiterated a threat to annex huge chunks of land if the
Palestinians carry out any unilateral acts, such as declaring
statehood.
	   ``We will act to ensure that settlements remain, grow and
blossom,'' Netanyahu told residents of Hermesh, a tiny settlement
built on a peak which commands a sweeping view of the
Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus to the north-west.
	   New access roads for Hermesh's 50 families will be built on
Arab-owned land to be expropriated in the coming months, said
defense ministry officials who accompanied Netanyahu on the
settlement tour. Israel announced two weeks ago that it would
confiscate thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian land for
bypass roads for settlers.
	   Earlier, Netanyahu said that he would not capitulate to
Palestinian demands to release so-called security prisoners,
Palestinians jailed for militant or political acts against Israel.
	   In Gaza, hundreds of relatives of Palestinian detainees
protested against Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for not pushing
the prisoner issue. Last Friday, in addition to a troop withdrawal,
Israel also set free 250 prisoners but most were common criminals.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel, and their
fate could become a serious internal problem for Arafat.
	   It is an emotionally charged issue because nearly every
Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by Israel at one
time. Prisoner releases are seen as a true gauge of whether peace
agreements bring real benefits.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said 20-25 prisoners
suffering from ill health would be included in the next release and
he would review the jail lists for any more political prisoners who
could be included.
	   Monday, Israel released three Palestinian policemen who had been
held for 15 months without trial on suspicion they planned to
attack a Jewish settlement.
	   In Hermesh, settlers held signs reading ``We won't live in a
Ghetto,'' and ``We want a normal life for our children.'' Many said
since Friday's pullback they are more afraid to use roads where
Palestinian policemen can now patrol.
	   ``I am not sure I will stay if it will be very dangerous. I am
afraid for the lives of my children,'' said Rita Rakovshik, a
mother of three, who like many in Hermesh, moved to Israel from the
former Soviet Union after the collapse of communism.
	   Despite Netanyahu's promises to Hermesh for another dlrs 600,000
for ``various needs,'' including a new swimming pool, settlers said
the premier could not reverse the damage done by the peace accord.
	   ``The financial promises that the prime minister gave cannot
remove the heavy shadow that the premier cast on the survival and
development of the settlements by signing the Wye Accord,'' a
statement from the settlers leaders said.
	   The settlers, who oppose ceding any war-captured land, were avid
backers of Netanyahu and their votes helped him narrowly win
election in 1996. But their support has been dwindling slowly since
Netanyahu began signing land-for-peace deals.
	   Hoping to avoid further conflict with the settlers, Netanyahu
indicating his government, unlike the previous dovish Labor, would
not remove Israelis who had taken over West Bank hilltops
illegally.
	   ``We found that talking to them produces better results than
using force.'' He said that strategy helped end peacefully a
take-over yesterday by settlers of a long abandoned railway
station. Settlers demanded the right to build a museum and seminary
there and Netanyahu said the government was considering their
request.
	   Meanwhile, settlers from Elon Moreh, not far from Hermesh, drove
a bus to a hill east of the community. The bus was used as a mobile
home, with a generator providing electricity, said Peter Lerner,
spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West Bank.

Leader McRae crashes as Sainz closes on world title triumph
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Race leader Colin McRae dropped out
of the Network Q rally of Britain with mechanical trouble Monday
while Carlos Sainz remained on course for his third world title by
staying in a top four position.
	   McRae, a former world champion in his last race for Subaru
before he transfers to Ford, was leading the field on stage 20 of
the 28-stage rally, when his engine blew on the way a Builth Wells
in Wales.
	   ``The engine's knackered, it's finished,'' said the Scot who was
bidding to win the race the fourth time. ``It's the end of a bad
season.''
	   Although he was out of contention for the world title, McRae had
lead virtually from the start of the race round England and Wales
which finishes at Cheltenham on Tuesday.
	   By then, Sainz hopes to be crowned world champion.
	   The Spaniard came into the last race of the season two points
behind championship leader Tommi Makinen. But the Finn slid out of
the race on Sunday when he skidded on a patch of oil and the impact
with a concrete pillar smashed a rear wheel.
	   Sainz, who now only has to finish in the top four to clinch his
third title but first for six years, was third after 19 stages
before McRae's retirement.
	   With only Mitsubishi's Richard Burns ahead of him, the Spaniard,
driving a Toyota, was in a comfortable position with two of the
day's stages to go.

Moderate Iranian editor found guilty of insulting military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court in Tehran has found the editor of an
opposition monthly newspaper guilty of insulting or publishing lies
about the army and the country's clerical court, Iranian radio and
television reported Monday.
	   The court said a jury unanimously voted that Ezzatollah Sahabi,
editor of Iran-e Farda, or ``Iran Tomorrow,'' deserved leniency,
official government television reported. It did not make clear what
if any sentence was issued.
	   The jury found Sahabi guilty of ``insulting the armed forces and
of publishing lies against the Special Clerical Court in order to
create concern among the public,'' the TV report said.
	   Radio and television reports did not make clear exactly what
material in Iran-e Farda was behind the charges, but they were
believed related in part to cartoons. The clerical court
investigates cases against Muslim clergymen.
	   Sahabi, a government minister early in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, announced his candidacy for president last year, saying
he would re-establish relations with the United States if he won.
The Guardian Council which vets candidates rejected his candidacy.
	   Iran-e Farda was one of the moderate newspapers established
after President Mohammad Khatami took office in August 1997 and
lifted restrictions on the press.
	   It switched from daily to monthly publication in July because of
financial problems resulting from its refusal to take advertising
for fear of compromising its independent stance. The paper survives
in part on donations.

Macedonian president names new premier
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ Macedonia's president named Monday a
new premier from the ranks of a center-right coalition, which won
last month's parliamentary elections.
	   The move came as the country prepared to accept deployment of a
1,800-strong NATO rapid reaction force on its territory to assist
international peace monitors in neighboring Serbia's strife-torn
Kosovo province.
	   President Kiro Gligorov gave the mandate to form a new
government to 32-year old Ljubco Georgijevski from the VMRO-DPMNE
and Democratic Alternative coalition, which toppled the ruling
ex-Communists in last month's elections.
	   Georgijevski's appointment likely will be approved by the
Macedonian parliament where his coalition holds 62 out of the 120
seats.
	   He will be the youngest Macedonian premier to date. Macedonia
proclaimed independence in 1991 and was the only republic which
seceded from the old Yugoslav, six-republic federation without
bloodshed.
	   A literature major from Skopje University with a book of poems
to his credit, he entered Macedonia's first parliament as a
legislator for the center-right VMRO-DPMNE party which advocated
independence and nationalist values.
	   Over the years he has softened his radical nationalism,
campaigning instead for economic reforms in one of Europe's poorest
countries. In October elections, he promised his voters ``positive
energy,'' better life and more jobs.
	   Macedonia's average monthly wage equals 230 dlrs. Unemployment
is at 30 per cent.
	   Georgijevski was expected to name his Cabinet within a week and
give some seats to ethnic Albanians, which account for a quarter of
Macedonia's 2.2 million population.
	   One of the future government's first decisions will be to
approve deployment of what is also called NATO's extraction force
in Macedonia, set up to assist some 2,000 unarmed monitors in
Kosovo in case they come under threat.
	   Although Georgijevski's coalition initially opposed deployment
of the NATO force in Macedonia, it changed this stance, saying it
supported a constructive attitude to the Kosovo crisis and would
welcome closer ties with NATO.
	   Macedonia joined NATO's Partnership for Peace program in 1995
and has aspirations for full membership in the Alliance.

Former police officers filmed beating motorists go to trial in
</HEADLINE>
Brazil &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ Two former police officers filmed
beating motorists at a roadblock pleaded not guilty Monday to
charges of attempted murder and abuse of authority.
	   Joao Batista de Queiros and Paulo Rogerio Garcia Barreta were
among eight police officers involved in the beatings and shootings
in a Sao Paulo slum that shocked Brazil after their actions were
aired on national television in March 1997.
	   In their testimony, both defendants claimed that while they were
present at the roadblock they had only been checking motorist's
documents and did not take part in the beatings.
	   The footage showed police stopping cars, extorting money from
the motorists, beating them and in one case shooting at them.
	   In October, a Sao Paulo court convicted former police officer
Otavio Lourenco Gambra in the killing of 27-year-old mechanic Mario
Jose Josinho.
	   Prosecutor Jose Carlos Blat said that Queiros and Barreta had
not been charged with murder because they did not appear in the
videotape on the night of the killing.

Italian priest says he helped prostitutes obtain abortions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: updates with diocese censuring priest

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A priest in Genoa who said publicly that
he'd referred prostitutes to an abortion doctor was censured Monday
by his diocese.
	   The Vatican refused to comment Monday, but the bishop of Genoa,
Monsignor Dionigi Tettmanzi, issued a statement condemning the
priest's actions as ``unacceptable.'' The statement, carried by the
ANSA news agency, said abortion is a sin and it is mmoral to assist
it.
	   The Rev. Andrea Gallo told Italian media on Sunday he had helped
with a Genoa center that provided clean syringes to drug addicts
and condoms to prostitutes, along with hot beverages.
	   Gallo said he would counsel prostitutes against abortions, then
refer them to a doctor friend if they still wanted the procedure.
	   ``Some of them told me that, as punishment, they would take such
violent kicks in the stomach from their pimps that they would lose
blood,'' he said. ``What should we have done, leave them in the
hands of back-alley abortionists, or wait for the pimps to finish
the job?''
	   ``I haven't renounced my principles,'' Gallo insisted. ``I know
that abortion is a sin.''

Aide to slain lawmaker regains consciousness, talks to police

<TEXT>
	   ST.PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ While a badly wounded aide to a
slain lawmaker talked to police after regaining consciousness
Monday, politicians and media floated their own theories about the
killing.
	   Galina Starovoitova, 52, an outspoken leader of the liberal
Russia's Democratic Choice party, was shot to death by unidentified
assailants on the stairs of her apartment building in St.
Petersburg on Friday night.
	   The killing of such a prominent politician has caused an uproar
in Russia and prompted calls from all sides for a crackdown on the
country's growing lawlessness. Scores of business leaders and
others have been gunned down in recent years in contract killings
that are almost never solved.
	   Starovoitova's aide, 27-year-old Ruslan Linkov, regained
consciousness Monday, and police acted on his information to round
up several suspects, officials said. There were no further details.
But a detective later said that investigators learned nothing
``serious'' from Linkov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Linkov was critically wounded in the head during the attack.
Special police armed with assault rifles were standing guard at the
door of his hospital room.
	   Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin said that Starovoitova had
received threats, Interfax reported on Monday. He didn't elaborate.
	   Meanwhile, liberal leaders charged _ without any concrete
evidence _ that Starovoitova's Communist foes in the Duma, the
lower house of parliament, were the most likely culprits.
	   Stepashin even had to call a news conference to say there was no
evidence that the Communist speaker of the Duma, Gennady Seleznyov,
was involved in the killing.
	   A St. Petersburg newspaper that Starovoitova edited recently
accused Seleznyov of setting up an illegal fund to finance a
presidential bid and other shady activities.
	   Seleznyov has denied the accusations and threatened to sue. But
on Monday, major national newspapers were discussing the fund's
activities.
	   Seleznyov responded in kind, suggesting that ``extremists from
democratic organizations'' might have staged the killing in order
to win local elections set for Dec. 6, the Interfax news agency
reported.
	   The popular daily Moskovsky Komsomolets also suggested Monday
that the killing _ coming on the wake of anti-Semitic statements
from a Communist lawmaker, secession threats by a Russian region,
and reports of criminal ties of Russia's main intelligence agency _
was staged by hard-liners to demonstrate the government's weakness.
	   ``Well, are you now scared of a Communist revenge and a victory
of dark forces?'' Moskovsky Komsomolets said in a front-page
analysis.
	   Several democratic politicians apparently were, and called for
uniting to prevent Communists from returning to power. Communists,
meanwhile, lambasted the government for its inability to contain
soaring crime.
	   Starovoitova's slaying had all the traits of a contract murder,
an increasingly common crime in Russia. But the reaction to her
death was of a kind hardly seen before _ partly because she was a
woman, partly because she had no known shady business ties, partly
because she elicited impassioned support.
	   Starovoitova tried to run for president in 1996 but her
registration was turned down for technical reasons. She had said
she would run again in 2000.
	   She served as President Boris Yeltsin's aide in 1991-92 _ the
only woman in his immediate circle. Yeltsin called Starovoitova a
``comrade'' and said he would personally monitor the investigation
into her killing.

Guamanians eager for closer association with U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout; recasts &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAGATNA, Guam (AP) _ By starting with the words, ``My fellow
Americans,'' President Bill Clinton was a cinch to hit if off with
the thousands of Guamanians who waited for hours under a searing
sun to see him.
	   Clinton spent only five hours on Guam Monday, stopping en route
to Washington from Seoul, South Korea, but it was long enough for
him to see the natural beauty of this U.S. territory _ and to hear
of its people's longing for a closer association with the United
States.
	   ``Let us be your legacy,'' cried Michael San Nicholas, one of
two local students who helped introduce Clinton at campaign-style
rally in a grassy park overlooking the emerald seas. He and others
made a pitch for a greater right to self-determination for the
island people.
	   The people of Guam are American citizens, but they cannot vote
in federal elections. It's hard to miss reminders of their pride.
``Where America's day begins'' is a favorite promotional line for
an island that is the westernmost U.S. territory, 8,902 miles
(14,243 kilometers) from Washington, D.C.
	   Robert Underwood, Guam's delegate to the House of
Representatives _ whose vote counts in committees but not on the
House floor _ told Clinton that his wife had jokingly threatened to
move off Guam before the 1996 election so she could vote for
Clinton. The problem, he said, was that she then would have been
ineligible to vote for her own husband.
	   ``No American citizen should have to choose between voting for
their president and voting for their representative in Congress,''
Underwood said to a roar of applause.
	   Gov. Carl Gutierrez echoed that sentiment.
	   ``We are nobody's constituency,'' he complained. ``Somebody
needs to stand up and do what is right by we Americans in Guam. ...
You are that person,'' he said, turning to Clinton.
	   The president came armed with a package of proposals meant to
help Guam's economy and to satisfy their demand for the return of
more land held by the U.S. military. But he made no promises on
Guam's political status, saying it was up to them to decide what
they wanted.
	   Clinton said Guam deserved a ``more effective self-government,''
and he spoke of the island's ``special membership in the American
family.''
	   ``Though we live on opposite sides of the Earth, ... we are all
Americans,'' Clinton said.
	   The president's plane made a refueling stop at Hickam Air Force
Base in Hawaii before returning to Washington. He met at Hickam
with Adm. Joseph Preuher, commander of U.S. Pacific Command.
	   Guam, with a population of 145,000, was ceded to the United
States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. It is a possession
of, but not part of, the United States. In 1987, Guam asked
Washington to establish an interim political relationship called a
commonwealth. The proposal made no progress, so the Guam
Legislature set up a Dec. 12, 1999, referendum to vote on one of
three options: independence, free association or statehood.
	   After speaking, Clinton walked along a ropeline holding back a
wildly enthusiastic crowd that at times seemed to nearly pull the
president into its midst. He posed for pictures, shook hands,
cuddled a baby or two, accepted a few kisses from adoring women,
and apparently enjoyed it so much he did it again, doubling back
for a second dose of the adulation.
	   Clinton also paid tribute to the American servicemen killed in
the liberation of Guam from the Japanese in 1944.
	   At a World War II memorial called the War in the Pacific
National Historical Park overlooking Asan Bay and the Philippine
Sea, Clinton helped lay a wreath in memory of 1,300 American
servicemen killed in recapturing Guam. A U.S. Park Service guide
pointed to a beach below the hilltop memorial where the 3rd Marine
Division spearheaded the U.S. landing on July 21, 1944. He also was
told that about 700 islanders, known as the Chamorro, died during
Japan's occupation, which began two days after the Pearl Harbor
attack in Hawaii.

South Africa's GDP and trade balance drop
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa got a one-two
punch of bad economic news Monday, with reports that the nation's
gross domestic product and the trade balance had both nose-dived.
	   The GDP's 2.3 percent third-quarter drop over the same period
last year was the sharpest since 1994, Statistics South Africa
reported. State-run TV news said there was no clear cause for the
drop but that it indicated the country was headed for recession.
	   South Africa's trade balance, meanwhile, recorded a 511.5
million rands (dlrs 91 million) deficit in October, according to
the South African Revenue Service.

Man accused of killing Canadian girl goes on trial in Bermuda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A Bermuda man went on trial Monday
accused of killing a Canadian teen-ager in a rare case of violence
against a foreigner on this tiny island.
	   Justis Smith, a native of Bermuda, is charged with the
premeditated murder of 17-year-old Rebecca Middleton of Belleville,
Ontario. If convicted, Smith could be sentenced to death by
hanging.
	   Middleton was killed July 3, 1996, while vacationing in Bermuda
with a high school friend. Another man, Kirk Mundy, has already
pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact in the death
and is serving a five-year jail sentence.
	   There was some speculation last week the trial would be
postponed to avoid seating a jury through the Christmas holidays.
It went ahead as scheduled, however.
	   ``It's definitely a go,'' said Terence Maxwell, a detective with
the Bermuda police force. ``We're ready to fight.''
	   Middleton had flown to Bermuda with another a friend, Jasmin
Meens, whose father lived on one of the Bermuda islands.
	   The girls tried to find a taxi after a rained-out concert when
they were offered rides by some men on motorcycles. Hitchhiking is
not considered a dangerous practice in Bermuda, which prides itself
on a low crime rate with an average of three murders a year for the
last decade.
	   But the two girls were separated and hours later Rebecca's body
was found at the side of a quiet road.
	   Smith and Mundy, ages 17 and 21 at the time, were arrested and
charged with the teen's murder.
	   At his trial in October 1996, Mundy, a native of Jamaica,
testified he and Middleton had consensual sex in a park just before
she was killed.
	   ``He heard her scream repeatedly `No!' and said it looked like
Smith was punching her in the face,'' said Crown prosecutor Khamisa
Tokunbo.
	   Smith's parents have hired a lawyer from Britain to defend their
son.
	   Solicitor General of Bermuda, William Pearce, and his
co-counsel, Sandra Bacchus are prosecuting the case.
	   The trial, expected to last six weeks, will call about 66
witnesses, including Dr. Henry Lee, one of the world's foremost
blood experts who testified in the O.J. Simpson trial.

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ European soccer's governing body postponed
the Champions League match between Italy's Juventus and Turkey's
Galatasaray because of escalating tensions between the two
countries, news reports said Monday.
	   UEFA pushed the game, scheduled for Wednesday in Istanbul, back
to Dec. 2.
	   Thousands of people have taken to the streets in Turkey over the
past week to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader
for trial as a terrorist.
	   Juve's players threatened to refuse to play if the game was held
as planned, while Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz has said
safety will be assured.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday. ``We are also considering banning
demonstrations in Istanbul until the match.''
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces will be assigned to provide the security during
the match.

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave that hit Poland a week
ago has killed 36 people, police said Monday.
	   Earlier police said 32 people throughout the country had died of
cold exposure thus far, but by evening more deaths were reported.
	   A man was found in Debin, near Czestochowa, some 217 kilometers
(134 miles) south of Warsaw and two men were found dead near Lodz,
133 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of Warsaw. A report on the
fourth death was incomplete, police said.
	   Most of the victims were middle-aged men who had been drinking
alcohol and passed out in the cold, according to Grazyna Puchalska
of the national police headquarters. Two women and a number of
homeless people were also among the victims, Puchalska said.
	   Temperatures in central and eastern Poland over the weekend were
as low as minus 20 degrees Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
	   The lowest temperature reported was minus 26 Celsius (minus 15
Fahrenheit) early Sunday in Ostroleka in northeast Poland.
	   The cold wave hit on Nov. 16, making it one of the coldest
Novembers in Poland in recent years. Weather forecasters predict
higher temperatures in the next few days.

Complacency and tactical errors blamed for amazing West Indies loss
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Complacency, tactical errors and the
age of the West Indian side's fast bowlers, all were blamed Monday
as bewildered cricket fans in the Caribbean tried to explain the
humiliating two-wicket defeat to South Africa's Orange Free State.
	   It was one of the most amazing turnarounds in cricket. Having
bowled the home team out for 67 for a first innings lead of 249,
the West Indies managed to lose the game. They stumbled to 188 all
out in the second innings and the regional team scored 438 for
eight to win by two wickets.
	   ``This defeat must be a psychological blow against the team,''
said Leon Horatio, veteran sports editor of The Chronicle newspaper
in Guyana. ``There is no doubt that the boys were complacent ...''
	   In Barbados, there was a more relaxed reaction. People noted
that the West Indies have lost many county games but then gone on
to win test series. Some people thought the loss might be a good
thing and could jerk the players out of their complacency.
	   ``We shouldn't worry too much, but it is a highly unlikely
victory,'' said Maurice Foster, a Jamaican member of the West
Indies Cricket Board.
	   In their final warmup game before the first of a five-test
series starts Thursday, the West Indies began strongly but then
fell to a hammering led by Orange Free State captain Hansie Cronje,
who launched an extraordinary attack on the West Indies spin
bowlers and wound up unbeaten on 157.
	   ``It means that something is wrong with our second string
attack, meaning our support bowlers are not penetrative enough,''
said Horatio.
	   ``Frankly, I am surprised that captain Brian Lara only bowled
Curtly Ambrose for less than 12 overs in the second innings,'' said
former West Indies test off spinner Clyde Butts. ``While he was
concentrating on giving spinner Dinanath Ramnarine a long bowl
before the test, that might well have been a mistake.''
	   Ramnarine had not played in South Africa before, and Lara was
probably giving him practice.
	   Butts, now manager-coach of the Guyana senior team, said the
team management will have to go back to the practice nets and work
on the support bowlers.
	   Others say there's a need to rethink the team's strategy on fast
bowlers. It's unusual to find senior bowlers over 30 years old and
the West Indies are sporting former captain Courtney Walsh, who is
36, and Curtly Ambrose, 35.
	   Their ages were debated when the cricket board first announced
its selection for South Africa.
	   And both men are not well. There is doubt whether Walsh will
play in the first Test, which is in Johannesburg, because of an
ankle injury, and Ambrose is recovering from a bout of influenza.
	   ``Walsh and Ambrose are not fully fit and our support bowlers
are not that experienced. But if we are to do well against South
Africa we have to play two-innings cricket,'' said Foster.
	   Easton McMorris, a former West Indies batsman and former member
of the West Indies Cricket Board's selection panel, said the loss
``is devastating. It means we're not playing good cricket ... we're
only playing one-inning cricket.''

Iraq says resistance over documents in no way means noncooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Iraqi comments, letter, Hamdoon
comment saying no documents to deliver. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said Monday its resistance to turning
over documents on its arms program to the United Nations should in
no way be construed as noncooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``We don't have any more documents that are related to
disarmament at this point,'' Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar Hamdoon
told reporters Monday.
	   He spoke after delivering a letter from the Iraqi deputy prime
minister to the president of the Security Council, Peter Burleigh
of the United States, which has threatened military action if
Baghdad doesn't keep its promise to cooperate fully with
inspectors.
	   The letter details why Iraq shouldn't be forced to deliver the
documents demanded by the chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard
Butler.
	   ``Given the gulf between the respective positions and the
different approaches adopted, we concluded that the requests of the
executive chairman are impossible to satisfy,'' Tariq Aziz said in
the letter, responding to Butler's request for documents on Iraq's
biological weapons program.
	   Aziz accused Butler of raising the issue of the documents to
undermine a promised council review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions. The council has said it won't conduct the review
unless Butler reports he has received full cooperation from
Baghdad.
	   The council agreed to the review as a way to persuade Iraq to
resume cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission, which is
responsible for disarming Iraq. Baghdad believes the review is its
best hope for an end of the eight-year U.N. oil embargo.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more fully
on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary outline
for the review that didn't refer specifically to a lifting of the
embargo as a possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14, pledging
unconditional cooperation with UNSCOM and narrowly averting what
U.S. officials have said were imminent airstrikes.
	   Aziz said he found it puzzling how Butler could conclude that
Iraq wasn't cooperating with inspectors when he was seeking
documents that had already been turned over, or for which Iraq had
already provided answers.
	   ``Iraq's understanding of the present situation in the manner I
describe here ... cannot by any stretch of the imagination, be
described as a lack of cooperation,'' Aziz wrote.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq's chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons and the missiles to deliver them are
destroyed before the council will lift sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf war.
	   Iraqi officials have placed conditions on viewing one particular
air force document detailing expended munitions that may have been
filled with chemical and biological agents in the 1980-88 war
between Iran and Iraq.
	   ``What this boils down to is less than full compliance, which is
what they promised eight days ago,'' British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said Monday. ``So I think there will be concern about
that.''
	   He said Iraq's position left the comprehensive review ``in the
future.''
	   ``We have in place in the Gulf enough capability to carry out
any military options the president might decide would be
required,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday at a
Pentagon briefing.
	   The council was expected to discuss the document issue Monday,
Burleigh said. Also on the agenda was the U.N. oil-for-food
program, which lets Iraq sell limited amounts of oil to buy food
and medicine.
	   Also Monday, Iraq complained in a letter that the United States
was violating its obligations as the host country of the United
Nations by preventing an Iraqi official from attending the U.N.
General Assembly.
	   The letter from Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the United
States told the Iraqi mission here that an entry visa would be
issued at the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan, for the head of the
legal department in Iraq's foreign affairs ministry. The official,
Muhammad Abdullah Al-Doory, was forced to wait in Amman for seven
days and answer personal questions, yet he still failed to obtain a
visa, Hamdoon wrote.

Saddam's deputy reportedly escapes assassination attempt

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with first attempt on high-ranking official since
1996, reports of fighting in southern Iraq.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's deputy
narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in a southern Iraqi city,
Baghdad television reported Monday.
	   Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council, was attending a religious ceremony Sunday in
Kerbala, a Shiite Muslim holy city, it said.
	   Several bodyguards and bystanders were wounded, it said.
	   The assailants threw two grenades at Ibrahim as he got out of
his car, but he was not wounded, it said.
	   The attack came a day before Iraqi opposition groups met in
London to find ways to unite their ranks. It was the first reported
attempt on a senior Iraqi official since December 1996, when gunmen
tried to kill Saddam's eldest son, Odai.
	   Investigations were under way to apprehend ``the perpetrators of
this heinous crime,'' the television said.
	   Despite the attack, Ibrahim continued his activities and
attended a religious festival held to commemorate the birthday of
Hussein, the Prophet Mohammed's grandson and Shiite Muslims' most
revered saint, it said.
	   He delivered a speech on behalf of Saddam, it said.
	   Ibrahim is a powerful figure within Iraq's ruling elite and
serves as a deputy commander of the Iraqi armed forces.
	   Opposition groups have said that fighting has renewed in recent
months in southern Iraq. Shiite Muslim rebels have staged
hit-and-run attacks since the Iraqi army crushed their uprising in
the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.

 &UR; UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with UEFA confirmation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game to Dec. 2. It will be
played at the same venue.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past week
to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial
as a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against possible
provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   The Italian side's captain, Angelo Di Livio, said players hoped
UEFA would move the game to a neutral site.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon Monday, killing
an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Two Israeli-allied militiamen were also wounded in guerrilla
shelling of a second outpost on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israel retaliated with airstrikes and the bombardment of
Lebanese villages facing the enclave, wounding three Lebanese
civilians.
	   Israeli warplanes fired at least one air-to-surface missile at
an area between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north
of the enclave, the officials said.
	   Jets returned three hours later to fire two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla positions in Jebaa, a stronghold of Hezbollah
guerrillas across from the border enclave.
	   The Israeli military confirmed that its aircraft struck targets
in two separate raids on southern Lebanon, but did not comment on
the guerrilla raids.

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ A priest in Genoa who said publicly that
he'd referred prostitutes to an abortion doctor was censured Monday
by his diocese.
	   The Vatican refused to comment Monday, but the bishop of Genoa,
Monsignor Dionigi Tettmanzi, issued a statement condemning the
priest's actions as ``unacceptable.'' The statement, carried by the
ANSA news agency, said abortion is a sin and it is immoral to
assist it.

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) - Western officials Monday praised an
Albanian referendum on a draft constitution but slammed opposition
politicians for ``disinformation'' and ``unfounded allegations''
during the campaign.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
monitored Sunday's referendum meant to give this impoverished
nation its first post-communist Constitution, said the process was
``peaceful throughout the nation.''
	   But the OSCE blamed the opposition Democratic Party, which
boycotted the referendum, for creating ``an atmosphere of extreme
polarization.''
	   The Democrats staged an anti-government demonstration in Tirana
but mustered only 2,000 people
	   The OSCE statement released Monday also said the opposition's
boycott clearly identified those who did vote as government
supporters and risked the integrity of the vote.
	   ``The Democratic Party ...decided not to partake in the process
and this jeopardized the vote's secrecy,'' it said.
``Disinformation by (Democratic Party) representatives and
unfounded allegations against the constitutional process are to be
regretted.
	   ``Despite the above-mentioned shortcomings, this vote showed
progress over last year's elections.''
	   Final results will be available in a few days but most voters
were apparently government supporters and the draft was likely to
pass.
	   Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 51 per cent of
the population participated in the referendum despite a steady rain
and the opposition boycott.
	   Democratic Party and bocycott leader Sali Berisha claimed police
launched a nationwide campaign of intimidating voters and stealing
ballot boxes. He also said the voting commission lied about turnout
and said no more than 38 per cent of the 1.9 million eligible
voters cast their ballots.
	   OSCE officials said they saw none of the alleged irregularities
but said many voter lists were inaccurate.
	   The constitution, drafted with Western legal advice, would give
citizens the right to legally change their religion and to identify
themselves as members of an ethnic minority. It would also define
property rights and allow the government to expropriate land deemed
of national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while working in richer,
non-Muslim neighbors such as Greece.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   Shortly before the OSCE statement, Berisha gathered about 2,000
supporters in downtown Tirana who screamed for the downfall of the
government and the ouster of the OSCE chief in Albania, Daan
Everts.
	   Under a heavy police surveillance, the protesters chanted
``Majko is finished,'' referring to Prime Minister Pandeli Majko.
They also yelled: ``Everts leave Albania.''
	   Dozens of vans loaded with police patrolled downtown Tirana,
fearing violence after a calm Sunday referendum that could give
Albania its first post-communist constitution.
	   Berisha worked supporters into a fervor with angered speeches,
accusing the government of rigging the referendum.
	   ``If this government wants to manipulate votes it will have to
step over our bodies,'' shouted the populist leader on the city's
central Skanderbeg Square.
	   Months of political violence last year led to early elections
that spelled defeat for Berisha and forced his resignation as
president. Violence fomented by Berisha supporters paralyzed the
country again earlier this year.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Dozens of Mexico City police officers, some
wearing ski masks, raided a police station Monday and led more than
100 officers away in handcuffs. Authorities said only that the
officers were being charged with ``serious crimes.''
	   The officers arrested were members of Mexico City's auxiliary
police force, which performs most day-to-day police functions such
as patrolling.
	   The officers were being charged with ``serious crimes that might
include homicide,'' said Ramon David Almada, regional director of
the public security secretariat that oversees the auxiliary force.
	   ``These are real criminals, and it is not possible for them to
hide within our ranks,'' Almada told reporters.
	   Almada didn't elaborate, saying it would be up to Mexico City
Attorney General Samuel del Villar to make public the charges. Del
Villar refused to discuss the arrests.
	   The dramatic raid was carried out by Mexico City judicial
police, which investigate most crimes and serve most arrest
warrants in the city.
	   More than 100 officers, many of them wearing ski masks, raided
the station in northern Mexico City, arriving on motorcycles and in
buses. Most carried automatic rifles.
	   Mexican television and radio broadcast news of the raid live,
but were at a loss to explain it. Some also said police conducting
the raid roughed up journalists.
	   Corruption within police ranks has prompted President Ernesto
Zedillo to propose the creation of a national police force with
higher standards than local police agencies.
	   But opposition lawmakers have suggested that the new national
police would be just as likely to become corrupt, and could be used
for political purposes.

Azerbaijani newspaper on hunger strike hit with libel ruling
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ An Azerbaijani court has ordered a
newspaper to pay dlrs 50,000 to the head of the presidential
administration in one of several libel cases prompting opposition
journalists to go on hunger strike.
	   At least 19 editors and journalists from several independent
newspapers in this former Soviet republic continued their hunger
strike Monday to protest the lawsuits and recent police beatings of
journalists. Some of those on hunger strike stopped eating Nov. 12.
	   The opposition newspaper Yeni Musavat was ordered last Friday to
pay the equivalent of dlrs 50,000 to Ramiz Mekhtiyev, the head of
President Geidar Aliev's administration, officials said Monday.
Mekhtiyev had sued the paper for libel over articles he said
damaged his reputation.
	   In another court ruling last week, Yeni Musavat was ordered to
pay dlrs 5,000 to Nizami Godzhayev, chief investigator with the
Azerbaijani Interior Ministry, for articles connecting him to the
slaying of one of his deputies.
	   Aliev's brother Dzhalal has sued another opposition newspaper,
Azadlyg, for reporting that he and other relatives of the president
bought expensive real estate in Britain.
	   Damages sought by officials in the lawsuits exceed dlrs 500,000
_ a staggering amount in a country where average salaries rarely
exceed the equivalent of dlrs 43 a month.
	   Aliev has been criticized by international human rights groups
for cracking down on the press, though he eased censorship this
summer ahead of presidential elections.
	   Four journalists with Yeni Musavat were injured earlier this
month when police dispersed a rally by newspaper employees.

treatment &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LUCKNOW, India (AP) _ Vrinda, the ailing lion who almost was put
to sleep in a north Indian zoo, is regaining strength after
treatment by a doctor of alternative medicine, a veterinarian said
Monday.
	   Authorities at the Prince of Wales Zoo in Lucknow had put off
the mercy killing of the 11-year-old lion following pleas by
conservationists and an offer by a doctor practising homeopathy who
said he could perhaps cure it of a debilitating spinal injury. Now,
it looks like the death sentence will be lifted.
	   ``Vrinda seems to be responding to the treatment,'' said zoo
veterinarian Utkarsh Shukla. The lion, once known as Sonu until
authorities seized him from a traveling zoo and renamed him, had
been confined for years in a cage so small he could not stand
upright.
	   ``His sores are healing,'' said Shukla. The lion, who is eating
more heartily, now greets visitors with a full-throated roar as he
limps about the cage.
	   Credit was given to D.N. Upadhyay, a practitioner of the
alternative medical system of homeopathy, who gave Vrinda drugs and
ointments.
	   Vrinda had been so weak from painful injuries to his backbone
and hind legs that authorities announced plans to commit
euthanasia.
	   The zoo received more than 100 appeals for his life and offers
of help. Mystics and Hindu priests visited the zoo, chanting
mantras, sprinkling holy water from the Ganges River and burning
incense sticks outside the lion's cage. Muslim and Sikh priests
also offered prayers at the zoo.
	   ``The lion's prolonged confinement in a very small cage, coupled
with malnutrition and lack of medical attention led to deformation
of his spine,'' Shukla said. ``His backbone is unable to carry his
weight and he is unable to walk.''
	   ``In view of the public appeals and the fact that Vrinda is
responding to treatment, I don't think there is reason for Vrinda
to be put to sleep,'' said R.L. Singh, chief wildlife warden of
Uttar Pradesh state, of which Lucknow is the capital.
	   The lion was seized from one of the 38 traveling zoos in the
northern Uttar Pradesh province that lost licenses earlier this
year. Some of the zoo owners could face charges under wildlife
protection laws.

Slovakia and Czech Republic plan to resolve dispute over assets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ The prime ministers of Slovakia and
the Czech Republic, two countries which once made up
Czechoslovakia, agreed Monday to settle a long-standing dispute
over assets within the next year.
	   Czech Prime Minister Milos Zeman, the first prime minister to
visit Slovakia since a new government took power last month, said
he and his Slovak counterpart, Mikulas Dzurinda, agreed to solve
the remaining problems.
	   ``Over the past four years the negotiations on the property's
division did not advance,'' Dzurinda told reporters at a news
conference.
	   The division of assets now will be decided by a commission, and
each country will appoint six representatives. The panel will meet
for the first time in December.
	   ``The commission must listen to the experts. A politician who
does not listen to what his experts say is a bad politician,''
Zeman said.
	   The two countries, which were united from 1918 to 1992, are at
loggerheads over how to divide a number of assets, including the
property of the Czechoslovak Trade Bank, art works and gold.
	   The prime ministers also issued statements that their countries
are interested in joining the European Union, and will support each
other's candidacies.
	   ``We want a united accession of both countries,'' Zeman said.
	   While the Czech Republic is considered a front-runner to join
the EU, Slovakia has been passed over. The EU has cited the
country's lack of democratic reforms under the previous regime.

UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Galatasaray reaction in 16th thru 18th grafs, clarifies
match was scheduled for Wednesday. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game, scheduled for
Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be played at the same venue.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past week
to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial
as a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against possible
provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   The Italian side's captain, Angelo Di Livio, said players hoped
UEFA would move the game to a neutral site.
	   Galatasaray's deputy president, Mehmet Cansun, said the
postponement was ``not a healthy decision.''
	   ``It was a decision given in favor of Juventus,'' with several
injured players, Cansun said on private Star television. ``We are
surprised by the decision.''
	   ``There will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey
within a week,'' he added.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Germany's Social Democratic Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine used his European Union debut Monday to
seek support for a left-leaning agenda to shift the economic focus
from fighting inflation to creating jobs.
	   Lafontaine and his fellow socialists, who now run the
governments of all but four of the 15 EU nations, dismissed fears
their quest for economic expansion would mean a return to sloppy
finances.
	   ``We don't want to fall into a situation, as we had several
years ago, with lax budget policies and restrictive monetary
policies,'' French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told
reporters.
	   Ahead of Monday's EU finance minister's meeting, the socialists
ministers stressed their commitment to the EU's ``stability pact''
which threatens fines against nations that run up big deficits
after they adopt the euro as a shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   ``The stability pact ... is vital given the importance of
budgetary discipline ... most European countries must be tougher on
their current budget deficits,'' the socialists said in a
joint-policy document entitled ``The New European Way.''

Former Italian president Cossiga visits Spain's Basque region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BILBAO, Spain (AP) _ Former Italian President Francesco Cossiga
arrived here Monday for a four-day visit which he said was aimed at
getting a firsthand view of the peace process in Spain's Basque
region, news reports said.
	   Skirting questions as to the possibility of him mediating in
resolving the Basque problem, Cossiga told reporters he was ``here
as a friend'' and had been invited to the northern Spanish region
by the governing Basque Nationalist Party.
	   His visit comes as Spain and the three-province Basque region
enjoys its third month of peace following the Sept. 18 cease-fire
by the armed separatist group ETA.
	   On Monday, Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Cossiga
``could come and go'' in Spain as often as he likes but stressed
that no intermediaries were needed to resolve the Basque conflict,
the private Europa Press news agency said.
	   The Italian centrist leader praised center-right Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar's decision to begin making contacts to sound out
ETA's long-term intentions before full negotiations take place.
	   Cossiga added that peace in the Basque region would help
consolidate the European Union.
	   During the visit, Cossiga is to hold talks with Basque
Nationalist Party leaders and visit the several political and
cultural sites. He did not rule out a meeting with representatives
of Herri Batasuna, the political wing of ETA.
	   ETA, whose name is a Basque-language acronym for Basque Homeland
and Freedom, has killed nearly 800 people in a 30-year campaign for
independence.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ An Arctic cold wave and accompanying
blizzards have killed at least 65 people throughout Europe, police
and media reported Monday.
	   The weather played a role in at least 24 deaths in Romania and
Bulgaria over the past three days. In Poland, 36 people died, most
of them homeless or others who passed out in the cold after
drinking alcohol, police said.
	   Earlier police said 32 people throughout Poland had died of cold
exposure thus far, but by evening more deaths were reported.
	   A man was found in Debin, near Czestochowa, some 217 kilometers
(134 miles) south of Warsaw and two men were found dead near Lodz,
133 kilometers (82 miles) southwest of Warsaw. A report on the
fourth death was incomplete, police said.

Italy, Lazio striker out of action until January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Injured Italy striker Christian Vieri said Monday he
plans to be back at practice with Lazio of Rome in 10 days but
probably won't see game action until January.
	   The 25-year-old has been sidelined since Sept. 23, when he hurt
ligaments in his left knee during a Lazio match. He opted not to
undergo surgery.
	   ``I suffer a lot sitting in the stands,'' Vieri said. ``I can't
wait to return to Lazio and the national team.''
	   He has missed Italy's three Euro 2000 qualifying games and eight
Serie A games for Lazio, which he joined in August on a dlrs 30
million transfer from Spain's Atletico Madrid.
	   Vieri tallied five goals in as many games for Italy at the World
Cup.

Iraq says resistance over documents in no way means noncooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS lede to RAISE US threats; UPDATES with new Hamdoon
quote; RAISES background. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Confronted with lingering threats of a
U.S. military attack, Iraq said Monday that its resistance to
turning over documents on its arms program should in no way be
construed as noncooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   ``We don't have any more documents that we believe are related
to disarmament at this point,'' Iraq's U.N. ambassador Nizar
Hamdoon said.
	   He spoke to reporters after delivering a letter from the Iraqi
deputy prime minister to the president of the Security Council,
Peter Burleigh of the United States, which has threatened military
action if Baghdad doesn't keep its promise to cooperate fully with
inspectors.
	   The letter details why Iraq shouldn't have to deliver the
documents and open its files to inspectors of the U.N. Special
Commission.
	   Hamdoon said the letter was indicative of Baghdad's frustration
``with the effort to change the whole work of UNSCOM from
disarmament into documentation,'' because asking Iraq to open its
archives to U.N. inspectors went beyond Baghdad's obligations under
U.N. resolutions.
	   ``Given the gulf between the respective positions and the
different approaches adopted, we concluded that the requests of the
executive chairman are impossible to satisfy,'' Tariq Aziz said in
the letter, responding to chief inspector Richard Butler's request
for documents on Iraq's biological weapons program.
	   Aziz accused Butler of raising the issue of the documents to
undermine a promised council review of Iraq's compliance with U.N.
resolutions. The council has said it won't conduct the review
unless Butler reports he has received full cooperation from
Baghdad.
	   Baghdad sees a review as its best hope for a lifting of the
eight-year U.N. oil embargo. The council agreed to a review as a
way to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, which is
responsible for disarming Iraq.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more fully
on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary outline
for the review that didn't refer specifically to a lifting of the
embargo as a possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14, pledging
unconditional cooperation with UNSCOM and narrowly averting what
U.S. officials have said were imminent airstrikes.
	   U.N. weapons experts must certify that Iraq's chemical,
biological and nuclear weapons, and the missiles to deliver them,
are destroyed before the council will lift sanctions imposed after
Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, sparking the Gulf war.
	   Iraq has said it has destroyed all its banned weapons.
	   Aziz said he found it puzzling how Butler could conclude that
Iraq wasn't cooperating with inspectors when he was seeking
documents that had already been turned over, or for which Iraq had
already provided answers.
	   ``Iraq's understanding of the present situation in the manner I
describe here ... cannot by any stretch of the imagination, be
described as a lack of cooperation,'' Aziz wrote.
	   Iraqi officials have placed conditions on the viewing of one
particular air force document detailing expended munitions that may
have been filled with chemical and biological agents in the 1980-88
war between Iraq and Iran.
	   ``What this boils down to is less than full compliance, which is
what they promised eight days ago,'' British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said Monday. ``So I think there will be concern about
that.''
	   He said Iraq's position left the comprehensive review ``in the
future.''
	   ``We have in place in the Gulf enough capability to carry out
any military options the president might decide would be
required,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday at a
Pentagon briefing.
	   The council was expected to discuss the document issue Monday,
Burleigh said. Also on the agenda was the U.N. oil-for-food
program, which lets Iraq sell limited amounts of oil to buy food
and medicine for its people.
	   Also Monday, Iraq complained in a letter that the United States
was violating its obligations as the host country of the United
Nations by preventing an Iraqi official from attending the U.N.
General Assembly.
	   The letter from Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon said the United
States told the Iraqi mission here that an entry visa would be
issued at the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Jordan, for the head of the
legal department in Iraq's foreign affairs ministry. The official,
Muhammad Abdullah Al-Doory, was forced to wait in Amman for seven
days and answer personal questions, yet he still failed to obtain a
visa, Hamdoon wrote.

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Commuters squeezed into packed train
carriages during the evening rush hour Monday after Portuguese rail
workers stopped work for one hour as part of a protest in Europe
against proposed deregulation.
	   The Federation of Railworkers' Unions said no trains were
running between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. (1600 gmt and 1700 gmt), when
almost 100 percent of drivers and ticket staff joined the strike
call.
	   The national rail company confirmed the total train stoppage
during that period.
	   Administrative and maintenance staff continued their stoppage
for a further hour, Federation spokesman Jose Manuel de Oliveira
said.
	   The Federation, representing some 13,500 employees, called the
strike because it fears job losses from European Union plans to
deregulate train services as a way of spurring competition and
efficiency.
	   The federation held four one-day strikes during June and July to
demand pay rises.
	   The government is breaking up state rail company CP into two
separate companies covering rail infrastructure and train services
in a bid to reduce its debts, estimated at more than 200 billion
escudos (dlrs 1.1 billion), and to prepare the company for
privatization.

Palestinian archaeologist uncovers mosaic in Manger Square

<TEXT>
	   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) _ A large mosaic with geometric
designs from the Byzantine period has been uncovered during the
remodeling of Manger Square, just outside the Church of the
Nativity, a Palestinian archaeologist said Monday.
	   The mosaic might have been part of a public building that
belonged to the church complex, said Hamdan Taha, director of the
Palestinian Department of Antiquities.
	   ``It is a very important discovery, something that will add to
the history of the city and to the millennium celebrations,'' Taha
told The Associated Press.
	   The church, built over the grotto where tradition says Mary gave
birth to Jesus, is one of Christianity's most revered sites.
	   The Byzantine basilica adjoins Manger Square which until
recently was used mainly as a parking lot for tourist buses. The
square was ringed on two sides by souvenir shops and fast food
restaurants and on the third by a police station.
	   Under a major remodeling plan, the square is being turned into a
plaza with trees and water fountains, and the police station is to
being replaced by a tourist center and museum.
	   The mosaic was uncovered last week in a part of the square where
the police station once stood, Taha said.
	   The mosaic consists of geometric designs in red, black and
white, Taha said. So far, about 18 square feet (less than two
meters) of the mosaic have been uncovered, but it is believed to be
larger. He said the work was delicate because the moasic rested on
sloping bedrock.
	   During a reporter's visit to the site Monday, the mosaic was
covered by a protective layer of wood. Nearby, bulldozers were
digging into the soil as part of the construction work.
	   Taha said the mosaic was being properly protected and that he
was now in touch with those in charge of the remodeling to make
sure the mosaic will be incorporated into the new building.
	   Taha said he also found two cisterns and two water tunnels. One
cistern held a collection of Byzantine plates and five or six
lamps.

Israeli suspect in death of Palestinian claims self-defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli man accused of bludgeoning to
death an elderly Palestinian farmer in the West Bank last month
claimed he was acting in self-defense, his lawyer said Monday.
	   The suspect, Gur Hamel, 35, turned himself into police a few
days after the body of Mohammed Zalout, 65, was found on October 26
near the Jewish settlement of Itamar.
	   At a pre-trial hearing Monday in Tel Aviv District Court, state
prosecutors read the murder indictment against Hamel.
	   ``There's no question that he carried out the act,'' said Yair
Berger, Hamel's lawyer. ``The question is, what were the
circumstances?''
	   Berger said his client maintains he acted out of self-defense.
Berger said that Hamel, who has been hospitalized for mental
illness, may have felt threatened by the elderly man and responded
by striking him.
	   Hamel did not speak in court. His trial is scheduled for
mid-December and Berger said he had not yet decided how his client
would plead.

	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars Monday at an Israeli outpost in southern Lebanon, killing
an Israeli soldier, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Two Israeli-allied militiamen were also wounded in guerrilla
shelling of a second outpost on the edge of an Israeli-occupied
enclave in south Lebanon, the officials said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   Israel retaliated with airstrikes and the bombardment of
Lebanese villages facing the enclave, wounding three Lebanese
civilians.
	   Israeli warplanes fired at least one air-to-surface missile at
an area between the villages of Habboush and Arab Salim, just north
of the enclave, the officials said.
	   Jets returned three hours later and fired two more missiles at
suspected guerrilla positions in Jebaa, a stronghold of Hezbollah
guerrillas across from the border enclave.
	   The Israeli military confirmed that its aircraft struck targets
in two separate raids on southern Lebanon, but did not comment on
the guerrilla raids.

Samsung buys government stake in Kazak copper plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Samsung has acquired the Kazak government's 90
percent stake in a major copper and zinc plant in Kazakstan for
dlrs 6.3 million, a news report said Monday.
	   Samsung Deutschland, a subsidiary of South Korea's
second-largest conglomerate, the Samsung Group, purchased the
shares of the Kazakstan Copper and Chemicals Plant in the east of
the Central Asian nation, the Interfax news agency reported. It did
not say when the deal was completed.
	   Kazakstan's government earlier this year opened up its
privatization efforts to the Kazakstan Stock Exchange, selling
government shares on the open market.
	   The Samsung deal was the largest transaction yet on the
exchange, Urazaly Yerzhanov, director of the former Soviet
republic's privatization fund, was quoted as saying Monday.
	   Kazakstan has large deposits of many metals and minerals,
including copper and zinc.

 &UR; UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with UEFA confirmation. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game, scheduled for
Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be played at the same venue.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past week
to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial
as a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against possible
provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   The Italian side's captain, Angelo Di Livio, said players hoped
UEFA would move the game to a neutral site.
	   Galatasaray's deputy president, Mehmet Cansun, said the
postponement was ``not a healthy decision.''
	   ``It was a decision given in favor of Juventus,'' with several
injured players, Cansun said on private Star television.
	   ``There will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey
within a week,'' he added.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The death toll from a cold snap across France rose
to eight Monday, after police found five more people presumed to
have died from the weather. One was found on the steps of a hotel
in southern France.
	   Fountains in front of the Eiffel Tower were completely frozen.
Homeless shelters in the capital were overflowing, and emergency
phone numbers were clogged. City officials opened a metro station
to shelter the homeless overnight.
	   After a very cold weekend during which three deaths were
reported, the temperature in Paris on Monday morning was minus 5
Celsius (23 F) _ slightly higher than on Sunday.
	   In Mouthe, eastern France, temperatures were at minus 21 Celsius
(minus 6 F) on Monday morning.
	   In most parts of France, temperatures did not rise much above
freezing _ rare for November.
	   Five homeless men were found dead Monday, all presumed to have
died of the cold. One was found in front of a hotel in the southern
city of Marseille.
	   About 100 homeless people staged a sit-in at the headquarters of
the SAMU state-run medical assistance service in Paris to demand
better protection in winter.
	   They demanded that the state spend more money protecting them,
and that more people be hired to man a special telephone line for
the homeless needing urgent attention.
	   Although the emergency number, 115, was working in the rest of
the country, in Paris it appeared clogged. In a random effort of 10
calls, eight of them produced a recording telling the caller to try
again later.
	   The cold weather hitting much of Europe was expected to remain
in France until the end of the week.

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ The Cabinet minister who oversaw Canada's federal
police and prison agencies resigned Monday, embarrassed by a
controversy ignited when a political rival overheard him discussing
a sensitive police inquiry.
	   Opposition parties had been clamoring for Andy Scott's
resignation as solicitor-general for almost two months, saying he
was overheard aboard an airplane making prejudicial comments about
an ongoing inquiry into police handling of a 1997 political
protest.
	   Scott initially denied making any questionable comments about
the inquiry into protests at last year's Asia-Pacific summit in
Vancouver. But he was contradicted in sworn statements by his own
traveling companion and an opposition Parliament member who
eavesdropped on the conversation from across the aisle.
	   Scott's resignation was accepted by Prime Minister Jean
Chretien, who replaced him with Labor Minister Lawrence MacAulay.
Parliament member Claudette Bradshaw of New Brunswick was named
labor minister.
	   The inquiry is looking into whether the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police used excessive force in November 1997 while suppressing
students protesting against then-President Suharto of Indonesia at
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
	   Protesters have suggested that orders to crack down on them came
from Chretien's office with the aim of sparing embarrassment to
Suharto.
	   Dick Proctor, a Parliament member for the left-wing New
Democratic Party, took notes about Scott's conversation with a
friend during an Oct. 1 flight. According to Proctor, Scott said
``four or five Mounties overreacted'' during the APEC protest and
that ``Hughie may be the guy who takes the fall'' for
pepper-spraying protesters.
	   Scott at first denied any memory of the conversation and any
knowledge of a police officer called Hughie.
	   But last week, Scott's friend, lawyer Fred Toole, filed an
affidavit confirming Scott was speaking about RCMP Staff-Sgt. Hugh
Stewart and did indeed suggest Stewart might take a ``hit'' or a
``fall'' for his actions.
	   At a press conference Monday, Scott apologized to the government
but again denied having prejudged the inquiry's outcome. He blamed
himself for a ``lapse of memory'' and a failure to explain himself
clearly when first questioned about Proctor's allegations.
	   Parliament's top-ranking opposition leader, Preston Manning of
the right-wing Reform Party, said the ongoing inquiry by a police
complaints panel had been discredited and should be replaced by a
more sweeping judicial inquiry.
	   The controversy has been an embarrassment for Chretien, who has
taken pride in the lack of scandals within his Cabinet.

European sugar beet growers announce production cutback
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) -- European sugar beet growers announced Monday they
will cut back plantings next year in an effort to boost the
depressed sugar market and urged other producers to follow.
	   ``Given the world market surplus, the size of world stocks and
the weakness of prices, beet growers in the European Union have
decided to reduce their beet area again in 1999,'' the
International Confederation of European Beet Growers said in a
statement.
	   The move was intended to cut the EU target for exports of
refined white sugar to around 4 million metric tons in the
1999-2000 season from about 5 million tons in 1998-99. Output over
the past 10 years has averaged about 5 million tons a year,
according to the confederation.
	   The group called upon other leading world sugar exporters to
join it in helping to re-balance the oversupplied sugar market
``until surplus world stocks have been absorbed.''
	   The EU is the world's biggest sugar producer and the second
largest exporter after Brazil. It also imports the equivalent of
1.75 million tons of white sugar annually from developing countries
under a special trade convention.
	   The London-based International Sugar Organization forecasts that
EU raw sugar production will reach 18.1 million tons but that
consumption will only be 15.1 million tons.
	   At the end of October, the agency put global raw sugar
production this season at a record 127.76 million tons and
consumption _ which has been hit by weak demand in Asia and Russia
_ at 126.77 million tons.
	   Traders said the prospect of another world surplus for the
second season running in 1998-99 had been behind the slump this
year in the price, which in September hit its lowest level in more
than 10 years.

Milan's police chief arrested for slaying of smuggler

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _One of Italy's most prominent law enforcement
officers, the police chief of Milan, was arrested in Rome Monday
and charged with murder in the shooting of a smuggler during a
police chase in 1995.
	   Francesco Forleo was police chief of Brindisi, a southern port
city, at the time. The shooting took place during a crackdown on
illegal immigration.
	   Forleo was in a police helicopter chasing the boat of people
smuggler Vito Ferrarese. Forleo shot Ferrarese during the chase; a
rifle was later found in Ferrarese's boat.
	   Forleo, who was once a top police union official and later
served two terms in parliament, was cleared of any wrongdoing in a
subsequent investigation.
	   A tough cop with a taste for street operations, he climbed
steadily up the ranks, becoming Florence police chief in 1996 and,
in October, the police chief of Milan, Italy's fashion and finance
capital.
	   Meanwhile, the Ferrarese investigation was quietly reopened in
Brindisi. Prosecutors there now allege that Forleo deliberately
killed Ferrarese to cover up police complicity with the smugglers.
They say Ferrarese was unarmed and the rifle was planted in the
boat.
	   Forleo was summoned to the Interior Ministry in Rome, where he
tendered his resignation Monday morning. He was arrested later in
the day.
	   The arrest stunned the law enforcement community. Giorgio
Innocenzi, an official of the national police union, called it
``incredible, astonishing, absurd.''
	   ``Maybe appointments of police chiefs have to be made more
scrupulously,'' he said, according to the ANSA news agency.
	   ANSA said the prosecutors have testimony from two witnesses
aboard the helicopter.
	   Last month, five police officers who served in Brindisi under
Forleo were arrested in connection with the Ferrarese slaying.

Netanyahu pays visit to Jewish settlers isolated under pullback

<TEXT>
	   HERMESH, West Bank (AP) _ Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat came under fire Monday from
certain segments of their populations disappointed with the latest
results of a Mideast peace accord.
	   In his first visit to Jewish settlements since signing the
land-for-peace deal last month in Washington, Netanyahu was met
with signs that read ``We won't live in a Ghetto,'' and ``We want a
normal life for our children.''
	   Trying to appease worried Jewish settlers left isolated after an
Israeli troop withdrawal from 2 percent of the northern West Bank
Friday, Netanyahu promised the settlement of Hermesh a larger
budget, a swimming pool and computers for their children.
	   Support for the premier from the powerful settler lobby and
hard-liners in Netanyahu's government has slipped since agreeing to
hand over more West Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   As settlers dug their heels deeper into West Bank land,
Netanyahu vowed to strengthen the settlements and reiterated a
threat to annex huge chunks of land if the Palestinians carry out
any unilateral acts, such as declaring statehood.
	   ``We will act to ensure that settlements remain, grow and
blossom,'' Netanyahu told residents of Hermesh, a tiny settlement
built on a peak which commands a sweeping view of the
Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus to the north-west.
	   New access roads for Hermesh's 50 families will be built on
Arab-owned land to be expropriated in the coming months, said
defense ministry officials who accompanied Netanyahu on the
settlement tour. Israel announced two weeks ago that it would
confiscate thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian land for
bypass roads for settlers.
	   Earlier, Netanyahu said that he would not capitulate to
Palestinian demands to release so-called security prisoners,
Palestinians jailed for militant or political acts against Israel.
	   In Gaza, hundreds of relatives of Palestinian detainees
protested against Arafat for not pushing the prisoner issue. In
addition to Friday's troop withdrawal, Israel also set free 250
prisoners but most were common criminals.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel, and their
fate could become a serious internal problem for Arafat.
	   It is an emotionally charged issue because nearly every
Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by Israel at one
time. Prisoner releases are seen as a true gauge of whether peace
agreements bring real benefits.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said 20-25 prisoners
suffering from ill health would be included in the next release and
he would review the jail lists for any more political prisoners who
could be included.
	   Monday, Israel released three Palestinian policemen who had been
held for 15 months without trial on suspicion they planned to
attack a Jewish settlement.
	   In Hermesh, many settlers said they are more afraid to use roads
where Palestinian policemen can now patrol.
	   ``I am not sure I will stay if it will be very dangerous. I am
afraid for the lives of my children,'' said Rita Rakovshik, a
mother of three, who like many in Hermesh, moved to Israel from the
former Soviet Union after the collapse of communism.
	   Despite Netanyahu's promises to Hermesh for another dlrs 600,000
for ``various needs,'' including a new swimming pool, settlers said
the premier did not win them back.
	   ``The financial promises that the prime minister gave cannot
remove the heavy shadow that the premier cast on the survival and
development of the settlements by signing the Wye Accord,'' a
statement from the settlers leaders said.
	   The settlers, who oppose ceding any war-captured land, were avid
backers of Netanyahu and their votes helped him narrowly win
election in 1996. But their support has been dwindling slowly since
Netanyahu began signing land-for-peace deals.
	   Hoping to avoid further conflict with the settlers, Netanyahu
indicated his government, unlike the previous dovish Labor, would
not remove Israelis who had taken over West Bank hilltops
illegally.
	   ``We found that talking to them produces better results than
using force.'' He said that strategy helped end peacefully a
take-over yesterday by settlers of a long abandoned railway
station. Settlers demanded the right to build a museum and seminary
there and Netanyahu said the government was considering their
request.
	   Meanwhile, settlers from Elon Moreh, not far from Hermesh, drove
a bus to a hill east of the community. The bus was used as a mobile
home, with a generator providing electricity, said Peter Lerner,
spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West Bank.

UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further reaction, match clashing with other
games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game, scheduled for
Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be played at the same venue.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past week
to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial
as a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against possible
provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   The Italian side's captain, Angelo Di Livio, said players hoped
UEFA would move the game to a neutral site.
	   In Ankara, Galatasaray technical manager Fatih Terim said UEFA
``has brought a lot of trouble on itself.'' The decision would
increase tension between the two countries, he said.
	   ``It was a decision given in favor of Juventus,'' with several
injured players, the club's deputy president, Mehmet Cansun, said
on private Star television.
	   ``There will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey
within a week,'' he added.
	   The postponement means an Italian Cup quarterfinal between
Juventus and Bologna, slated for Dec. 2, will also have to be
rescheduled.
	   Terim said Galatasaray has a Turkish Cup game on the same date.
Both teams have Champions League games the following week.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

U.S. mediator meets Serbian president over draft plan for Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A U.S. mediator for Kosovo met the
Serbian president Monday for the first time since Serbia rejected a
U.S.-sponsored draft for the strife-torn province last week, media
here reported.
	   American mediator Christopher Hill, who has been involved in
intense shuttle diplomacy trying to find a solution to the
conflict, was likely to seek an explanation regarding Serbia's
rejection of the U.S. draft.
	   Serbian President Milan Milutinovic last week dismissed the
American-backed plan as giving too much power to the
independence-minded ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 per cent of
Kosovo's 2 million people.
	   Instead, Serbian authorities published last Saturday their own
four-page plan under which Kosovo would remain firmly within
Serbia. Milutinovic also scheduled new talks with ethnic Albanian
leaders for Wednesday in the provincial capital Pristina.
	   His invitation was refused by the Kosovo Albanian negotiating
team, which did not turn up for previous talks and which accepts
only the U.S.-sponosred initiative.
	   Philip Reeker, Hill's spokesman, told The Associated Press that
the American side was hesitant to view Milutinovic's statements
regarding the U.S. draft as a definite rejection, since ``there is
no definite agreement on the table for either side to reject.''
	   ``This is a process ... to mold an agreement,'' Reeker said.
	   ``Some alterations, some suggestions are positive and important
... this is what it's about ... people have to make compromises,''
Reeker said.
	   A statement from the president's office, broadcast on Serbian
state-run television after the talks Monday, said both Milutinovic
and Hill ``assessed that broad self-rule, based on equality of all
ethnic commmunities, was the basis for finding a political solution
to overcome the conflict'' in Kosovo.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ In Lebanon _ as in most Arab countries _
citizenship is not a matter of where you are born, but a prize to
be sought. And as many as 275,000 people are hoping Lebanon's new
president will give them such a reward after he takes office
Tuesday.
	   Lebanon is not about to expel its foreign residents, but many
people who have lived here for decades _ or even generations _ want
to be citizens of the only homeland they know.
	   For people like Mustafa Jaber, a 45-year-old Jordanian who came
to Lebanon when he was 10, such a decree would simply confirm his
identity.
	   ``I consider myself a Lebanese already,'' said the Muslim
furniture store owner. ``My whole family is in Lebanon. My wife of
15 years is Lebanese ... My four children speak Lebanese Arabic and
even my accent has changed.''
	   The citizenship debate in this nation of 3.2 million is about
religion. A 15-year civil war fought by Christians and Muslims
ended in 1990, but arguments still rage about each sides power and
numbers.
	   President Elias Hrawi planned to decree citizenship for foreign
residents before leaving office. But vehement opposition among his
Maronite Catholic community _ and a heart attack that kept him away
from work for a week _ scuttled the plan.

 &UR; Eds: AMs, UPDATES with more quotes from Iraqi deputy foreign
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-Assassination Attempt
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the chief U.N. weapons
inspector Monday of fabricating a new crisis over its weapons
programs by demanding documents that were destroyed, irrelevant or
already in the possession of the United Nations. In southern Iraq,
a powerful official reportedly escaped an assassination attempt.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi said Richard Butler's
request for the weapons-related documents takes Iraq back to
``square one'' in its effort to end crippling sanctions imposed by
the U.N. Security Council after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``Why is it that now Mr. Butler is requesting all over again the
same requests that were made in the past?'' al-Qaisi asked.
	   ``All we have we gave, all we don't have, we stated we don't
have,'' he told a news conference.
	   His comments were the latest in a dispute that has raised again
the specter of an attack on Iraq.
	   In letters last week, Butler asked for 12 kinds of documents as
well as information on Iraq's biological weapons program, the field
in which U.N. inspectors say they have the most questions. Iraq has
balked at the request, calling it an attempt to reignite a crisis.
	   ``What do we see? No light at the end of the tunnel. What we see
is the light of a locomotive coming head on at Iraq,'' he said.
	   Iraq reversed its two-week ban on the work of U.N. inspectors on
Nov. 14 when faced with what appeared to be imminent air strikes by
U.S. and British forces stationed in the Gulf.
	   The inspectors returned last week. With the cooperation of the
Iraqi government, they have since made daily visits to sites
suspected of helping build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, long-range missiles and the
programs to build them before the Security Council can lift the
sanctions, which have caused widespread malnutrition, hunger and
poverty in the once-prosperous Arab country.
	   The U.N. inspections themselves constitute the most ambitious
disarmament program since the Allied victory in World War II.
	   Al-Qaisi insisted that since inspections began in 1991, Iraq has
provided all the documents inspectors need. Others that Butler
requested were destroyed, he said. Some, like personal diaries, are
irrelevant, and one on chemical weapons can be viewed in the
presence of Prakash Shah, a special U.N. envoy in Baghdad.
	   ``Mr. Butler is requesting access to all the archives of the
Iraqi state. He seems to think that it is he who decides what is a
relevant archive and what is an irrelevant archive,'' he said.
	   The inspectors repeatedly have accused Iraq of trying to mislead
weapons teams. They checked nine sites Monday, including a surprise
visit to a cigarette and tobacco company in Baghdad that is not
under long-term surveillance, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Earlier Monday, Shah returned to Baghdad, saying only that he
would hold talks with Iraqi officials. At the Pentagon, U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen said Monday that the United States
could still attack Iraq if it did not fully cooperate with the
inspectors.
	   Iraqi opposition groups, meanwhile, gathered in London at the
invitation of the British government. The meeting came as Iraqi
television reported that assailants lobbed two hand grenades at
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's deputy as he got out of his car to
attend a religious festival in southern Iraq.
	   Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council, escaped the Sunday attack without injury, it said.
Several bodyguards and bystanders were, however, wounded, it added.
	   Riven by ethnic, religious and political differences, the
dissidents have long posed little threat to the government. But the
United States has turned to them in recent months with promises of
political and financial support in hopes of overthrowing Saddam.
	   In the latest round of tension with the United Nations, Iraq has
focused its ire on Butler himself, and Iraq's official media on
Monday called the dispute personal, not political.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling party, said Butler viewed
Iraq's decision to resume inspections ``as a personal victory,
which he believes will enable him to take revenge.''
	   ``Butler sees Iraq not only as a personal opponent but as an
enemy that needs to be harmed and crushed,'' it said.
	   Another newspaper, Babil, warned that the United States may
attack Iraq within the coming three weeks.
	   In the streets, at least, the renewed prospect of a military
strike seemed to generate little anxiety.
	   ``The Iraqi people are becoming accustomed to such things, and
they don't have any fear of it,'' said Salem Fadil, a 35-year-old
vendor selling soap in Baghdad's bustling Shorja market.
	   Another shopkeeper, Salman Ali, called the crisis ``ordinary.''
	   ``God willing, nothing will happen. We pray to God it doesn't,
but we know that America doesn't respect world opinion,'' he said.

Moderate Iranian editor found guilty of insulting military
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A court in Tehran has found the editor of an
opposition monthly newspaper guilty of insulting or publishing lies
about the army and the country's clerical court, Iranian radio and
television reported Monday.
	   The court said a jury unanimously voted that Ezzatollah Sahabi,
editor of Iran-e Farda, or ``Iran Tomorrow,'' deserved leniency,
official government television reported. It did not make clear what
if any sentence was issued.
	   The jury found Sahabi guilty of ``insulting the armed forces and
of publishing lies against the Special Clerical Court in order to
create concern among the public,'' the TV report said.
	   Radio and television reports did not make clear exactly what
material in Iran-e Farda was behind the charges, but they were
believed related in part to cartoons. The clerical court
investigates cases against Muslim clergymen.
	   Sahabi, a government minister early in the 1979 Islamic
Revolution, announced his candidacy for president last year, saying
he would reestablish relations with the United States if he won.
The Guardian Council which vets candidates rejected his candidacy.
	   Iran-e Farda was one of the moderate newspapers established
after President Mohammad Khatami took office in August 1997 and
lifted restrictions on the press.
	   It switched from daily to monthly publication in July because of
financial problems resulting from its refusal to take advertising
for fear of compromising its independent stance. The paper survives
in part on donations.

Despite some shortcomings, Palestinian airport set to open

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The control tower is still without
controls, the check-in counter has no computers and the runway
can't function after dark for lack of flood lights.
	   Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International Airport
is set to open Tuesday, aided by a little improvisation and a lot
of patriotic pride.
	   ``It's a glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are
open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching while
workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in the southern
Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat planned to be on hand Tuesday
morning when a plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian officials becomes
the first arrival. At half-hour intervals, six more planes are to
come in from places such as Morocco and Spain.
	   The European Union, which donated dlrs 38 million for equipment
and training, is sending its Mideast envoy on a special plane.
	   The airport opening had been held up for two years because of
disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's
role in monitoring passengers and cargo.
	   In the end, Israel will have a say over who and what is coming
into the Gaza, but the Israeli monitors will operate discretely,
behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at the Rafah and Allenby
Bridge crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye
River land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
Questions still remain, however, about how the airport will
operate, and how Israeli security closures on Palestinian areas
might affect it.
	   For the time being, it will still be a bit of an adventure to
fly out of Gaza International or to land there.
	   Palestinian officials say the equipment for the control tower,
the computers for the check-in counters and the flood lights are
still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
	   Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman for Israel's Civil Aviation Authority,
acknowledged delays in some of the equipment reaching Dahanieh but
said he did not know the reasons.
	   Portable control equipment installed in a van will guide
Tuesday's flights to a safe landing. The passengers will be checked
in at the Rafah border crossing, a 10-minute bus ride away. And
until the flood lights arrive, there will be no night flights.
	   But for many Palestinians, the airport is a big step on the road
to independence. For those living in the small, overcrowded Gaza,
which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one side and by barbed wire
on the other three, it may help ease the ever-present feeling of
being trapped.
	   ``It's a symbol of freedom,'' said Khaled Salmeh, 21, who
studies economics at Gaza City University.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' he said, adding that he plans
fly from Gaza International next month to Saudi Arabia for a
pilgrimage to Mecca, Islam's holiest site.
	   Designed in an Oriental style with elaborate tiles imported from
Morocco, the airport has one passenger terminal, a dignitaries'
lounge and a three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway.
	   Only hours before its opening, the airport still looked like a
construction site. Electrical cords dangled from the ceiling of the
terminal. Workers unpacked crates of office furniture and laid
plush red carpeting in the VIP lounge.
	   Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian, Spanish and German flags
fluttered from the control tower. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall poster of
Arafat was attached with masking tape to the walls of the tower.
	   For the time being, Israelis will not be permitted to use the
airport, Israeli government officials said, citing security
concerns. However, many believe Gaza International will eventually
become a rival to Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv.
	   Shmuel Rechtman, chairman of the regional council of the Negev
Plateau, an area in Israel that borders Gaza, said he believed that
within a year, Israeli farmers would use the new airport to export
most of their flowers and produce to Europe.
	   ``Economic realities are much stronger than any law,'' he said.

Israeli suspect in death of Palestinian claims self-defense
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli man accused of bludgeoning to
death an elderly Palestinian farmer in the West Bank last month
claimed he was acting in self-defense, his lawyer said Monday.
	   The suspect, Gur Hamel, 35, turned himself into police a few
days after the body of Mohammed Zalout, 65, was found on October 26
near the Jewish settlement of Itamar.
	   At a pre-trial hearing Monday in Tel Aviv District Court, state
prosecutors read the murder indictment against Hamel.
	   ``There's no question that he carried out the act,'' said Yair
Berger, Hamel's lawyer. ``The question is, what were the
circumstances?''
	   Berger said his client maintains he acted out of self-defense.
Berger said that Hamel, who has been hospitalized for mental
illness, may have felt threatened by the elderly man and responded
by striking him.
	   Hamel did not speak in court. His trial is scheduled for
mid-December and Berger said he had not yet decided how his client
would plead.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Russia's
President Boris Yeltsin in his hospital reception room Monday to
adopt a statement on expanding relations between the giant former
Cold War rivals and define the western stretch of their lengthy
border.
	   The document noted that a ``strategic partnership'' declared by
the two countries _ the world's largest and the world's most
populous _ last year ``is not an alliance and is not aimed against
third countries.''
	   The partnership aims to block ``the development of elements of
confrontation'' in Russian-Chinese relations and encourage
cooperation in all sectors, the 10-page statement Monday said,
according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Yeltsin and Jiang also released a declaration settling disputes
over parts of the western stretch of the two nations' 4,300
kilometer (2,700-mile) border, Yeltsin spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   Their statement called for the creation of a multi-polar world _
Russia's favorite euphemism for counterbalancing what it sees as
growing global U.S. influence. China has voiced similar concerns
about the United States.
	   Following decades of enmity between the Chinese and the former
Soviet Communist parties that began in the 1950s, relations between
Russia and China began to thaw with a visit by Soviet leader
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1989.
	   Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao, in Moscow for
the visit, called the meeting ``successful and fruitful'' and
hailed the border agreement, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.

certain gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnet equipment
for safety but that it wouldn't hold-up the airport from opening.
	   The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez
Zeidan, was not available for comment all day Monday.
	   For many Palestinians, the airport is a powerful landmark on the
road to independence. For those living in the small, overcrowded

UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further reaction, match clashing with other
games. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game, scheduled for
Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be played at the same venue.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands of people have taken to the streets over the past week
to protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish rebel leader to
Turkey for trial as a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
Istanbul's Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against
possible provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   The Italian side's captain, Angelo Di Livio, said players hoped
UEFA would move the game to a neutral site.
	   In Ankara, Galatasaray technical manager Fatih Terim said UEFA
``has brought a lot of trouble on itself.'' The decision would
increase tension between the two countries, he said.
	   ``It was a decision given in favor of Juventus,'' with several
injured players, the club's deputy president, Mehmet Cansun, said
on private Star television.
	   ``There will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey
within a week,'' he added.
	   The postponement means an Italian Cup quarterfinal between
Juventus and Bologna, slated for Dec. 2, will also have to be
rescheduled.
	   Terim said Galatasaray has a Turkish Cup game on the same date.
Both teams have Champions League games the following week.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

Netanyahu pays visit to Jewish settlers isolated under pullback

<TEXT>
	   HERMESH, West Bank (AP) _ Both Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat came under fire Monday from
constituents disappointed with the latest results of a Mideast
peace accord.
	   Trying to appease worried Jewish settlers isolated after
Friday's troop withdrawal from 2 percent of the northern West Bank,
Netanyahu promised the settlement of Hermesh a larger budget, a
swimming pool and computers for their children.
	   In his first visit to Jewish settlements since signing the
land-for-peace deal last month in Washington, Netanyahu was met
with signs that read ``We won't live in a Ghetto,'' and ``We want a
normal life for our children.''
	   Support for the premier from the powerful settler lobby and
hard-liners in Netanyahu's government has slipped since he agreed
to hand over more West Bank land to Palestinian control.
	   As settlers dug their heels deeper into West Bank land,
Netanyahu vowed to strengthen the settlements and reiterated a
threat to annex huge chunks of land if the Palestinians carry out
any unilateral acts, such as declaring statehood.
	   ``We will act to ensure that settlements remain, grow and
blossom,'' Netanyahu told residents of Hermesh, a tiny settlement
built on a peak that commands a sweeping view of the
Palestinian-controlled city of Nablus to the northwest.
	   Earlier, Netanyahu said that he would not capitulate to
Palestinian demands to release so-called security prisoners,
Palestinians jailed for militant or political acts against Israel.
	   In Gaza, hundreds of relatives of Palestinian detainees
protested against Arafat for not pushing the prisoner issue. In
addition to Friday's troop withdrawal, Israel also set free 250
prisoners but most were common criminals.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel, and their
fate could become a serious internal problem for Arafat.
	   It is an emotionally charged issue because nearly every
Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by Israel at one
time. Prisoner releases are seen as a true gauge of whether peace
agreements bring real benefits.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani said 20-25 prisoners
suffering from ill health would be included in the next release and
he would review the jail lists for any more political prisoners who
could be included.
	   Monday, Israel released three Palestinian policemen who had been
held for 15 months without trial on suspicion they planned to
attack a Jewish settlement.
	   In Hermesh, new access roads the settlement's 50 families will
be built on Arab-owned land to be expropriated in the coming
months, said defense ministry officials who accompanied Netanyahu
on the settlement tour. Israel announced two weeks ago that it
would confiscate thousands of acres (hectares) of Palestinian land
for bypass roads for settlers.
	   In Hermesh, many settlers said they are more afraid to use roads
where Palestinian policemen can now patrol.
	   ``I am not sure I will stay if it will be very dangerous. I am
afraid for the lives of my children,'' said Rita Rakovshik, a
mother of three, who like many in Hermesh, moved to Israel from the
former Soviet Union after the collapse of communism.
	   Despite Netanyahu's promises to Hermesh for another dlrs 600,000
for ``various needs,'' including a new swimming pool, settlers said
the premier did not win them back.
	   ``The financial promises that the prime minister gave cannot
remove the heavy shadow that the premier cast on the survival and
development of the settlements by signing the Wye Accord,'' a
statement from the settlers leaders said.
	   The settlers, who oppose ceding any war-captured land, were avid
backers of Netanyahu and their votes helped him narrowly win
election in 1996. But their support has been dwindling slowly since
Netanyahu began signing land-for-peace deals.
	   Hoping to avoid further conflict with the settlers, Netanyahu
indicated his government, unlike the previous dovish Labor, would
not remove Israelis who had taken over West Bank hilltops
illegally.
	   ``We found that talking to them produces better results than
using force.'' He said that strategy helped end peacefully a
take-over yesterday by settlers of a long abandoned railway
station. Settlers demanded the right to build a museum and seminary
there and Netanyahu said the government was considering their
request.
	   Meanwhile, settlers from Elon Moreh, not far from Hermesh, drove
a bus to a hill east of the community. The bus was used as a mobile
home, with a generator providing electricity, said Peter Lerner,
spokesman for the Israeli military government in the West Bank.

Transport minister resigns over railway restructuring

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Transport Minister Eugeniusz Morawski
resigned Monday saying trade unions had too much influence on the
planned restucturing of the strapped state railways, the Television
news Wiadomosci said.
	   Morawski said in a statement to the station he could not accept
a situation when his powers as a Cabinet member are limited and
when trade unions take over control over the way the railway is
run. He did not elaborate.
	   Morawski is a member of the Solidarity Electoral Alliance, a
senior partner in the Solidarity-led coalition government of Prime
Minister Jerzy Buzek. He has been criticized for incompetence and
had been expected to leave under planned government changes early
next year.
	   Poland's heavily indebted railway monopoly, Polskie Koleje
Panstwowe, an inefficient structure inherited from communist times,
has been cutting train connections and increasing ticket prices to
prevent further losses.
	   Unions of train engineers have been staging strikes since the
early 1990s to demand higher pay and better work conditions.
	   There was no immediate word of Buzek's reaction to the
resignation.

Report: Zimbabwean planes bomb Congolese rebel boats, killing 600
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Zimbabwean military planes bombed and
sank six boats carrying Congolese rebel soldiers and equipment on
Lake Tanganyka over the weekend, killing at least 600 rebels,
Congolese state radio reported Monday.
	   The rebels had been on their way to the rebel-held town of
Kalemie on the western edge of the lake, which borders Congo,
Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia, the Voice of the People radio station
said citing unnamed aviation officials. No further details were
provided.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed and there was no
immediate comment from rebel officials. Voice of the People serves
as the mouthpiece of Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
government which, along with Zimbabwean, Angolan, Namibian and
Chadian allies, is fighting rebels in eastern Congo.
	   The rebels are supported by Ugandan and Rwandan forces.
	   A series of peace initiatives aimed at bringing the two sides
together in talks have failed. Kabila has refused to talk with his
opponents, who have accused him of corruption and ethnic favoritism
vowed to topple him.
	   The government has promised an aggressive offensive, including a
bombing campaign, against rebel strongholds in the east. But the
warring sides are separated by long distances and poor
transportation routes. Angola and Zimbabwe have provided some
fighters and bombers to Kabila, whose allied forces appear
strongest around the capital of Kinshasa in the west and in his
home region of Katanga in the southeast.
	   In an unrelated incident, Congolese rebel commander Jean-Pierre
Ondekane and 126 troops escaped injury when the Boeing 727 they
were aboard caught fire while taking off in the rebel-held town of
Goma bordering Rwanda, rebel radio said Monday.

Turkish company produces blood-drenched TV spot blasting Italy,
</HEADLINE>
Kurds &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Blood streams down the screen, over a
backdrop of dead babies, over a Kurdish rebel leader inspecting his
troops and then over a plate of spaghetti.
	   The TV spot produced by a Turkish cellular phone company is
aimed at swaying public opinion abroad to Turkey's point of view:
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan is a killer and Italy is wrong
not to extradite him to Turkey.
	   ``Don't let blood get into your spaghetti,'' says the
voice-over.
	   Telsim says it hopes to get the spot _ produced both in English
and Italian _ on TV stations across Europe, but it has no takers so
far, the television channel Star said Monday.
	   Ocalan was arrested Nov. 12 when he arrived on a flight to Rome.
Turkey wants him extradited to face terrorism charges that carry
the death penalty. Italian law, however, forbids extraditing
someone to a country where they face execution.
	   Turkey was outraged by an Italian court decision last week that
freed Ocalan and is fighting hard to discourage Italy from granting
him political asylum. Several Turkish businesses are boycotting
Italian products and Italian TV stations were taken off cable TV in
Turkey on Monday.
	   The 14-year war between Ocalan's Kurdistan Workers Party or PKK
and the Turkish army for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern Turkey
has claimed an estimated 37,000 lives.

Brazil's communications minister resigns amid scandal

one other official resigned sted two. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's communications minister and
another official resigned Monday after being caught up in
allegations of influence-peddling in the sale of the state-run
telecommunications giant.
	   But analysts said the shakeup might be a blessing in disguise
for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is trying to push a
fiscal stabilization plan through Congress. Legislators had
threatened to hold up debate because of the scandal.
	   Cardoso accepted Monday's resignations of Communications
Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, the
president of Brazil's National Development Bank. But he said
Barros' actions were ``absolutely suitable.''
	   The scandal broke earlier this month after several leading
magazines published transcripts of illegally taped phone
conversations between Barros and Resende about the sale of
telecommunications giant Telebras.
	   In the transcripts, the two men appeared to be trying to
influence the sale in favor of a consortium that included
ex-Central Bank chief Persio Arida and former privatization
director Elena Landau, which ultimately did not win the auction.
Police are investigating who was behind the phone taps.
	   Telebras was sold in 12 separate blocks for a total of dlrs 19
billion at the July 29 auction.
	   Barros' brother, Jose Roberto, who heads the Foreign Trade
Council, and Jose Pio Borges, vice-president of the Development
Bank, stepped down as well although they did not appear to be
involved in the scandal.
	   Many feared a congressional investigation into the charges
against Barros and Resende would hold up approval of a dlrs 24
billion austerity package aimed at rebuilding investor confidence
in Brazil's ailing economy.
	   ``It might be a hard blow for Cardoso personally,'' said
political analyst Ricardo Pedreira. ``But it avoids serious risks
for the fiscal plan, which is now well on its way to approval in
Congress.''
	   Investors also appeared to approve of the resignations. The Sao
Paulo Stock Exchange's Bovespa Index was registering solid gains
Monday.
	   Opposition politicians, however, insisted the resignations
should not preclude a congressional inquiry.
	   Barros has denied wrongdoing, saying the transcripts were
``incomplete and edited.'' He said he was only trying to ``increase
competition.''
	   Barros' spokesman, Cesar Borges, was not immediately available
for comment Monday. Barros answered legislators questions for
nearly five hours on Thursday.

OPEC faces difficult and limited options at Vienna meeting
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; Eds: EDITS thruout. Tightens. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ As OPEC oil ministers gather for their
year-end meeting, they face an assortment of vexing problems: a
global glut of crude, mild North American weather, weakened
economies in Asia and prices that have fallen to 11-year-lows.
	   Ministers from the oil cartel's member nations were gathering
Monday and preparing for the meeting that begins Wednesday and
that's expected to focus on ways to bring prices higher.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, an Iranian newspaper warned
Monday that OPEC's credibility is at stake. The daily Hamshahri
said the organization must draw up new methods and policies, not
just tinker with production ceilings.
	   ``OPEC is confronted with a big test,'' which if it fails ``will
place a seal of approval on views that call for the termination of
OPEC's epoch'' and keep prices low, the newspaper said.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June, with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday. OPEC oil prices averaged dlrs 12.33 a barrel in the third
quarter, compared to dlrs 18.03 a year ago.
	   A big problem facing the ministers is the fact that a 2.6
million barrel-a-day production cut the cartel agreed to in June
has failed to lift prices.
	   But OPEC's biggest predicament lies beyond the cartel's control
_ the usually oil-hungry world just doesn't seem to need or want as
much oil as it used to.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ OPEC's
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production;
warmer-than-average weather in many places; and weakened world
demand, especially in Asia, where sagging economies .
	   The drop in demand means less income for the OPEC countries, and
in turn, bigger budget deficits and predictions of tighter spending
next year.
	   Saudi Arabia, which produces 8 million barrels a day and is
OPEC's largest producer, depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of
its income. This year, those revenues are expected to fall 27
percent below the country's target, bringing in dlrs 25.3 billion,
the Saudi British Bank forecast in a report issued Monday.
	   The country's real economic growth is expected to fall to 1.7
percent for 1998, compared to 7 percent last year.
	   Next year doesn't look much better. ``The prolonged period of
relatively low oil prices has persuaded most oil forecasters to be
conservative about 1999,'' the bank said.
	   If OPEC is to succeed in bringing prices higher, it must at
least extend June's production cuts until the end of 1999. They
currently are due to expire in the middle of next year.
	   Without that extension, prices would likely fall further. ``The
market won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned.
	   Another option _ instituting deeper production cuts _ is
unlikely, Iran's deputy oil minister intimated last week. That
would be ``too much for OPEC to handle at the moment,'' Mehdi
Hosseini said at a London oil conference.
	   Meanwhile, the cartel is still struggling with members who don't
abide by their quotas. Venezuela and Indonesia are among those
producing more than they should.

Russian government says Kalmykia owes huge debts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister on Monday ordered the
small republic of Kalmykia to return an unauthorized government
transfer of nearly dlrs 14 million, just days after its president
threatened to secede over Russia's economic troubles.
	   Kalmyk President Kirsan Ilyumzhinov said last week that the
federal government had failed to deliver subsidies to his republic
and that he would push for secession. The Kremlin was outraged, and
he later softened his stance.
	   On Monday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov sent a letter to
the parliament and government listing financial violations by
Kalmykia, an agricultural republic on the Caspian Sea, the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Among them was a 236 million ruble (dlrs 13.8 million) transfer
payment from the federal government to Kalmykia in August that was
proposed but rejected by the Finance Ministry. The payment was
never approved by the central bank but was transferred to Kalmykia
anyway, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Zadornov ordered that the money be returned.
	   On Saturday, Ilyumzhinov sent a letter to President Boris
Yeltsin saying his call for greater autonomy was misunderstood but
still suggesting regions should be granted more economic rights to
cope with the country's financial crisis.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin will run Russia from a hospital room
for several days at least, aides said Monday, after the president
fell ill with pneumonia _ the third time he's been sidelined by
sickness in recent weeks.
	   This latest ailment revived worries about Yeltsin's ability to
run a country mired in economic troubles. But his condition wasn't
critical enough to stop him from meeting with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in the Central Clinical Hospital on Monday.
	   Russian television showed the two leaders sharing a joke in a
reception room and Yeltsin, dressed in a sweater, did not look
particularly ill.
	   The 67-year-old president was rushed to the hospital Sunday with
pneumonia and a temperature of 38.9 degrees C (102 F), the Kremlin
said Monday. He was being treated with antibiotics.
	   Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved
either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, presidential
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said on Russia's NTV television Monday
night.
	   The president has rarely been seen in public recently, fueling
speculation that he is seriously ill. He fell sick in October
during a state visit to central Asia with what was described as a
respiratory ailment. He was taken ill again in late October with
what doctors described as high blood pressure and exhaustion.
	   Since then the Kremlin appears to have been taking little chance
with the president's health, ensuring that he has frequent medical
checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian Constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   Yakushkin said Yeltsin would likely cancel meetings with foreign
visitors this month, but will continue to meet Russian officials at
the hospital.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital, but
added that treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   ``It happened rather suddenly,'' Yakushkin said, adding that
Yeltsin was distressed ``emotionally and psychologically'' by the
Friday slaying of prominent liberal lawmaker Galina Starovoitova, a
former Yeltsin aide.
	   Also Monday, a top Kremlin aide was quoted by the Interfax news
agency as saying that presidential power could be turned over to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman to Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff.
	   Savyolova said her remarks were unrelated to the president's
latest illness.
	   Primakov said Monday the government was working as normal and he
was not assuming any extra powers.
	   In Washington, the U.S. government wished Yeltsin a speedy
recovery.
	   Yeltsin's health problems have forced him to cancel several
foreign visits this fall. Dutch Queen Beatrix on Monday postponed a
visit to Russia planned for this week because of Yeltsin's
condition.
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and there
has been growing speculation about early elections.
	   ``We wish Mr. Yeltsin recovery,'' Communist leader Gennady
Zyuganov said in unusually mild remarks at a news conference
Monday. ``But his illness is incurable _ he's an irresponsible
person who is unable to govern the country, and everyone knows
that.''

Saudi Interior Minister in Yemen to restart border talks

<TEXT>
	   ADEN, Yemen (AP) _ Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin
Abdul-Aziz arrived in Yemen Monday to restart stalled talks on a
border dispute between the two neighbors.
	   Following a brief meeting with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh, Nayef told reporters that Saudi Arabia did not favor
international arbitration to solve the dispute.
	   His Yemeni counterpart, Hussein Mohammed Arab, said that
resorting to an international court ``was not shameful,'' but
quickly added that Yemen did not mind reaching an agreement with
its powerful neighbor in a ``brotherly way.''
	   Nayef is scheduled to meet again with Saleh on Tuesday.
	   Yemen, on the tip of the Arabian Peninsula, has expressed
frustration with the border talks which have been stalled since
July and has said it would consider seeking international
arbitration.
	   Fighting has occasionally erupted along the 2,000-kilometer
(1,300-mile) frontier between Saudi Arabia and Yemen which has long
contested Saudi Arabia's claim to three Red Sea islands and parts
of the Empty Quarter, a vast desert region with potentially
lucrative oil fields. The two nations have yet to demarcate a
mountainous border in the east.
	   The two sides are also expected to discuss Yemeni accusations
that Saudi Arabia helps finance its exiled opposition and was
behind a series of explosions in the southern port city of Aden
last year. Yemen also claims that a number of men implicated in an
assassination attempt against Arab last year are hiding out in
Saudi Arabia.
	   For its part, Saudi Arabia accuses Yemen of allowing arms and
drugs to be smuggled through its borders to Saudi Arabia.

Iraq says resistance over documents in no way means noncooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS more Iraqi comment, RAISES Butler accusations; TRIMS. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said Monday it was committed to
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors but again balked at giving
them documents, arguing that opening up its archives could
jeopardize its national security.
	   Baghdad accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector of using the
issue of the documents _ which it claims either don't exist, have
been turned over or have no bearing on inspectors' work _ to
prolong arms searches and the timing of a promised review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The new dispute comes just a week after Iraq pledged to fully
and unconditionally cooperate with inspectors when confronted with
what U.S. officials have said were imminent U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen renewed the threat Monday,
saying the United States has ``in place in the Gulf enough
capability to carry out any military options the president might
decide would be required.''
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, delivered an 18-page,
single-spaced letter from his deputy prime minister explaining
Iraq's position in technical detail about why the document requests
from the U.N. Special Commission chief were unfounded.
	   ``We don't have any more documents that we believe are related
to disarmament at this point,'' Hamdoon told reporters.
	   The letter from Tariq Aziz, he said, is indicative of Baghdad's
frustration ``with the effort to change the whole work of UNSCOM
from disarmament into documentation,'' referring to the commission
responsible for disarming Iraq.
	   Forcing Baghdad to open up its archives, he said, ``is something
that may jeopardize the national security of Iraq.''
	   Iraq has used the sovereignty argument before in trying to keep
inspectors at bay, and its sympathizers on the Security Council _
particularly Russia and China _ have generally supported the
position.
	   Council members won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until U.N. weapons experts have certified that
Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and the missiles
to deliver them, are destroyed.
	   Iraq has said it has destroyed all its banned weapons.
	   In the letter, Tariz Aziz accused UNSCOM chief Richard Butler of
using the issue of the documents to undermine a so-called
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's efforts to disarm itself. The
council has said it won't conduct the review until Butler reports
that he has received full cooperation from Baghdad.
	   Baghdad sees a review as its best hope for a lifting of the
eight-year U.N. oil embargo. The council agreed to a review as a
way to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   Aziz said he found it puzzling that Butler could conclude that
Iraq wasn't cooperating with inspectors when he was seeking
documents that had already been turned over, or for which Iraq had
already provided answers.
	   ``Iraq's understanding of the present situation in the manner I
describe here ... cannot by any stretch of the imagination, be
described as a lack of cooperation,'' Aziz wrote.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more fully
on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary outline
for the review that didn't refer to a lifting of the embargo as a
possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14.
	   Aziz took particular aim at Butler's request for information on
its biological weapons program, which inspectors have long said was
far from sufficient, saying ``no meeting of mind is possible.
	   ``Given the gulf between the respective positions and the
different approaches adopted, we concluded that the requests of the
executive chairman are impossible to satisfy,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He also repeated conditions Iraq placed on the viewing of one
particular air force document detailing expended munitions that may
have been filled with chemical and biological agents in the 1980-88
war between Iraq and Iran.
	   ``What this boils down to is less than full compliance, which is
what they promised eight days ago,'' British Ambassador Jeremy
Greenstock said Monday. He said Iraq's position left the
comprehensive review ''in the future.''

	   PARIS (AP) _ Rail workers, fearing major job losses that might
come with deregulation, brought train traffic to a standstill in
parts of Europe Monday to voice their concerns.
	   Commuters were stranded in France, Belgium and Greece, where the
strike caused havoc during the morning rush hour. There were major
traffic jams, and subways were packed.
	   In Spain and Luxembourg, though, effects were minimal. In
Portugal, rail workers staged a total one-hour stoppage just before
evening rush hour. No trains ran between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m., and
administrative and maintenance staff continued their stoppage for a
further hour.

Court orders 10-year jail term for farmer who killed disabled

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court Monday ordered a Saskatchewan
farmer to serve at least 10 years in prison for killing his
severely disabled daughter, overturning a lenient sentence issued
by a judge who said the father acted out of love.
	   The ruling against Robert Latimer was the latest twist in an
five-year case that has fueled divisive public debate over the
ethics of mercy killing.
	   Latimer was convicted last year of second-degree murder for the
1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who suffered from
severe cerebral palsy.
	   The judge in the murder trial provoked a national furor by
refusing to impose the mandatory life sentence with no chance of
parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking a rarely used exemption, he
sentenced Latimer to serve one year in a provincial jail and a
second year confined to his farm.
	   On Monday, Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld a prosecution
appeal and ruled that the trial judge erred by refusing to impose
the mandatory sentence.
	   Latimer told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. he was disappointed
by the ruling but preferred a long jail term to the alternative of
watching Tracy suffer indefinitely.
	   It was not immediately clear if Latimer would be allowed to
remain free while his lawyer considers a possible appeal to the
Supreme Court of Canada.
	   Latimer, who has three other children, admitted to killing Tracy
by placing her in his pickup truck at the family farm and pumping
carbon monoxide into the cab. Tracy had suffered from a severe form
of cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk, talk or feed
herself.
	   The girl had endured operations on her back, hips and legs, and
her parents believed she faced the prospect of a lifetime of
painful surgery.
	   After convicting Latimer last year, jurors told the trial judge,
Ted Noble, they felt the mandatory sentence was too harsh and
recommended Latimer be paroled after one year.
	   Noble agreed with the jurors, saying the mandatory sentence
would in this case be cruel and unusual punishment.
	   ``The evidence establishes Mr. Latimer was motivated solely by
his love and compassion for Tracy and the need _ at least in his
mind _ that she should not suffer any more pain,'' Noble ruled.
	   Activists for the disabled were infuriated by Noble's ruling,
saying it sent a signal that the disabled have less of a right to
life than other people.
	   Latimer was first convicted in the case in 1994, but the Supreme
Court threw out that conviction because some jurors had been
improperly questioned by police.

Zimbabwean president arrives in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived
in Egypt Monday after meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
It was not clear if his plane flew directly from Libya in violation
of a U.N. air embargo on the North African state.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban
which was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for
trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast killed 270 people.
	   Mugabe arrived in Libya Saturday, apparently by plane in
violation of the air embargo.
	   Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad
and Sudan, have ignored the sanctions since the vote.

<TEXT>
	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Zimbabwean military planes bombed and
sank six boats carrying Congolese rebel soldiers and equipment on
Lake Tanganyka over the weekend, killing at least 600 rebels,
Congolese state radio reported Monday.
	   The rebels had been on their way to the rebel-held town of
Kalemie on the western edge of the lake, which borders Congo,
Burundi, Tanzania and Zambia, the Voice of the People radio station
said citing unnamed aviation officials. No further details were
provided.
	   The report could not be independently confirmed and there was no
immediate comment from rebel officials. Voice of the People serves
as the mouthpiece of Congolese President Laurent Kabila's
government which, along with Zimbabwean, Angolan, Namibian and
Chadian allies, is fighting rebels in eastern Congo.
	   The rebels are supported by Ugandan and Rwandan forces. Casualty
reports from both sides of the war rarely agree and are difficult
to independently verify as the conflict often takes place in
remote, hard to reach locales.

	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Five North Carolina State
athletes and a former athlete faced criminal charges Monday in
connection with the slaying of a gunman who was killed with his own
gun.
	   Among the three reserve football players charged was David
Stringer, the son of Rutgers women's basketball coach C. Vivian
Stringer. His cousin, Korey Stringer, plays for the Minnesota
Vikings NFL football team.
	   Police say Neil Davis Jr., 21, an N.C. State student from
Fayetteville, was shot about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He died about six
hours later at Wake Medical Center, hospital spokeswoman Marilyn
Eddinger said.
	   Raleigh Police Capt. Mike Longmire said Davis was shot with a 9
mm semiautomatic pistol after a struggle with the six students. The
six had been attending an off-campus party a few doors down from
Davis' home.
	   Clyde Blunt faces the most serious charges. The 20-year-old
sophomore wrestler, a collegiate heavyweight champion, was charged
with involuntary manslaughter because investigators say his
aggressive behavior resulted in Davis' death. Blunt also faces
charges of misdemeanor breaking and entering.
	   The three reserve football players _ Harold Jackson, Willie
Wright and Stringer _ were charged with misdemeanor breaking and
entering and misdemeanor assault. Wright, 19, also was charged with
larceny of a firearm. Jackson, 20, and Stringer, 19, also were
charged with accessory to a felony for helping Wright take the
weapon, Longmire said.
	   Michael Mordarski, a 20-year-old wrestler, and Daniel Scott
Campenella, 21, an N.C. State student and former wrestler, were
charged with misdemeanor breaking and entering.
	   Mordarski and Campenella were released on their own recognizance
Sunday night. The three football players secured bonds, and Blunt
was in the Wake County Jail on a dlrs 5,000 bond.

UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Italian reaction. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game, scheduled for
Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be played at the same venue in
Istanbul.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands have taken to the streets over the past week to
protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial as
a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against possible
provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   Former Italian sports minister Walter Veltroni said he
considered the postponement ``a wise decision and one that took
into account the risks tied to the game.''
	   ``UEFA recognized that there would not be normal conditions if
the game was played Wednesday in Istanbul,'' Juventus vice
president Roberto Bettega said in Turin.
	   In Ankara, Galatasaray technical manager Fatih Terim said UEFA
``has brought a lot of trouble on itself.'' The decision would
increase tension between the two countries, he said.
	   ``It was a decision given in favor of Juventus,'' with several
injured players, the club's deputy president, Mehmet Cansun, said
on private Star television.
	   ``There will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey
within a week,'' he added.
	   Bettega said Juventus hadn't exerted pressure on UEFA to have
the game postponed or moved.
	   The postponement means an Italian Cup quarterfinal between
Juventus and Bologna, slated for Dec. 2, will also have to be
rescheduled.
	   Terim said Galatasaray has a Turkish Cup game on the same date.
Both teams have Champions League games the following week.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

A look at Iraqi opposition groups
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   A look at major Iraqi groups opposed to President Saddam
Hussein:
	   ___
	   IRAQI NATIONAL CONGRESS: An umbrella opposition organization
formed by Kurdish, Shiite and leftist groups after the 1991 Gulf
War. It is led by Ahmed Chalabi, an economist. Many key groups and
activists have abandoned the organization to protest Chalabi's
leadership. In 1996, Saddam's troops, allied with another Kurdish
group, stormed INC bases in northern Iraq, killing 200 members.
Some 2,000 dissidents were evacuated by the United States.
	   ___
	   THE SUPREME ASSEMBLY OF THE ISLAMIC REVOLUTION IN IRAQ: Tehran,
Iran-based organization made up of several Shiite Muslim groups.
Led by Hojatoleslam Mohammed Bakr al-Hakim, a middle-ranking Iraqi
cleric, since its founding in 1982. The Supreme Assembly has
5,000-9,000 fighters based in Iran. It is the only non-Kurdish
opposition group to have fighters in the area.
	   ___
	   The KURDISTAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY and the PATRIOTIC UNION OF
KURDISTAN: Both have well-organized and potentially effective
military forces deployed in an autonomous Kurdish area of northern
Iraq. The groups are hostile to Saddam, but often seem more focused
on fighting each other. The United States has considered the
Kurdish territory a potential area for launching operations against
Saddam. But the KDP, led by Massoud Barzani, has reportedly said it
won't join efforts to topple Saddam. The Patriotic Union is led by
Jalal Talabani.
	   ___
	   THE IRAQI COMMUNIST PARTY: Founded in 1934, it is led by
activist Aziz Mohammed. The party is well-organized and believed to
have support within Iraq. Saddam's secret police have
systematically suppressed the party and forced its members into
exile.
	   ___
	   IRAQI NATIONAL ACCORD: Set up in 1993 with CIA backing, it is
led by Iyad Alawi, a former member of Saddam's Baath Party. The
London-based group is widely believed to have been infiltrated by
Saddam's secret police.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Assailants shouting anti-American slogans
used stones and iron rods to attack a bus carrying U.S. tourists,
the Iran News reported Monday.
	   The attack was believed to have been triggered by reports in
hard-line newspapers accusing the visiting Americans of being U.S.
officials and members of the CIA posing as tourists.
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin
rejected any claim that U.S. officials or CIA agents were in the
group.
	   ``We do call upon the government of Iran to adhere to the rule
of law and protect visitors to their country,'' Rubin said.

UEFA postpones Galatasaray-Juventus match
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NYON, Switzerland (AP) _ UEFA on Monday postponed for a week a
Champions League match between Turkey's Galatasaray and Italy's
Juventus because of escalating tensions between the two countries.
	   The European governing body moved the game, scheduled for
Wednesday, to Dec. 2. It will be played at the same venue in
Istanbul.
	   UEFA's executive committee ``asks both the Italian and Turkish
governments to undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the
game can be played as indicated under normal conditions,'' a
statement said.
	   The decision is final and can't be appealed, it added.
	   Thousands have taken to the streets over the past week to
protest Italy's refusal to extradite a Kurdish leader for trial as
a terrorist.
	   Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz had guaranteed the safety of
Juventus players, who feared they may be attacked during the match
in Turkey.
	   ``Every kind of guarantee has been given,'' Yilmaz told private
ATV television late Sunday.
	   Interior Minister Kutlu Aktas said up to 20,000 police and
paramilitary forces would be assigned to provide the security
during the match.
	   Police Chief Hasan Ozdemir on Monday warned a ``heavy hand''
would prevent violence and said the police will not allow banners
bearing political statements into the stadium. Fireworks are also
banned.
	   Cheerleaders will be prevented from shouting provocative
slogans, Ozdemir added.
	   Yilmaz said each fan would be searched by police before entering
the Ali Sami Yen stadium. But still he warned against possible
provocations.
	   Turkey wants to try Abdullah Ocalan for leading the Kurdistan
Workers Party, or PKK, which has been waging a guerrilla war for
autonomy in Turkey's southeast. The conflict has claimed some
37,000 lives.
	   Italy has refused to extradite Ocalan, saying its law does not
allow extradition if the suspect could face execution.
	   Juventus announced Friday that no fans would travel with the
club to Istanbul.
	   Former Italian sports minister Walter Veltroni said he
considered the postponement ``a wise decision and one that took
into account the risks tied to the game.''
	   ``UEFA recognized that there would not be normal conditions if
the game was played Wednesday in Istanbul,'' Juventus vice
president Roberto Bettega said in Turin.
	   In Ankara, Galatasaray technical manager Fatih Terim said UEFA
``has brought a lot of trouble on itself.'' The decision would
increase tension between the two countries, he said.
	   ``It was a decision given in favor of Juventus,'' with several
injured players, the club's deputy president, Mehmet Cansun, said
on private Star television.
	   ``There will not be any changes in the situation in Turkey
within a week,'' he added.
	   Bettega said Juventus hadn't exerted pressure on UEFA to have
the game postponed or moved.
	   The postponement means an Italian Cup quarterfinal between
Juventus and Bologna, slated for Dec. 2, will also have to be
rescheduled.
	   Terim said Galatasaray has a Turkish Cup game on the same date.
Both teams have Champions League games the following week.
	   Juventus, a European Champions Cup finalist three years running,
needs a victory against Galatasaray to keep alive its chances of
qualifying for the quarterfinals. The Turkish underdog tops group B
with seven points.
	   UEFA said it ``recognizes that none of the two clubs is to be
held responsible for the reasons that led to this decision.''

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the chief U.N. weapons
inspector Monday of fabricating a new crisis over its weapons
programs by demanding documents that were destroyed, irrelevant or
already in the possession of the United Nations.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi said Richard Butler's
request for the weapons-related documents takes Iraq back to
``square one'' in its effort to end crippling sanctions imposed by
the U.N. Security Council after it invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``Why is it that now Mr. Butler is requesting all over again the
same requests that were made in the past?'' al-Qaisi asked. ``All
we have we gave, all we don't have, we stated we don't have.''
	   His comments were the latest in a dispute that has raised again
the specter of an attack on Iraq.
	   Also Monday, Iraqi opposition groups gathered in London to find
ways to unite their ranks. The meeting came a day after assailants
reportedly lobbed two hand grenades at Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's deputy as he got out of his car to attend a religious
festival in southern Iraq.
	   Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council, escaped the attack without injury, according to
the report. Several bodyguards and bystanders were, however,
wounded, it added.
	   Riven by ethnic, religious and political differences, the
dissidents have long posed little threat to the government. But the
United States has turned to them in recent months with promises of
political and financial support in hopes of overthrowing Saddam.
	   Iraq reversed its two-week ban on the work of U.N. weapons
inspectors on Nov. 14 when faced with what appeared to be imminent
air strikes by U.S. and British forces stationed in the Gulf.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen renewed the threat Monday,
saying the United States has ``in place in the gulf enough
capability to carry out any military options the president might
decide would be required.''
	   The inspectors returned last week. With the cooperation of the
Iraqi government, they have since made daily visits to sites
suspected of helping build weapons of mass destruction.
	   In letters last week, Butler asked for 12 kinds of documents as
well as information on Iraq's biological weapons program, the field
in which U.N. inspectors say they have the most questions. Iraq has
balked at the request, calling it an attempt to reignite a crisis.
	   ``What do we see? No light at the end of the tunnel. What we see
is the light of a locomotive coming head on at Iraq,'' al-Qaisi
said at a news conference.
	   Inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, long-range missiles and the
programs to build them before the Security Council can lift the
sanctions, which have caused widespread malnutrition, hunger and
poverty in the once-prosperous Arab country.
	   The U.N. inspections themselves constitute the most ambitious
disarmament program since the Allied victory in World War II.
	   Al-Qaisi insisted that since inspections began in 1991, Iraq has
provided all the documents inspectors need. Others that Butler
requested were destroyed, he said. Some, like personal diaries, are
irrelevant, and one on chemical weapons can be viewed in the
presence of Prakash Shah, a special U.N. envoy in Baghdad.
	   ``Mr. Butler is requesting access to all the archives of the
Iraqi state. He seems to think that it is he who decides what is a
relevant archive and what is an irrelevant archive,'' he said.
	   At U.N. headquarters in New York on Monday, Iraq's U.N.
ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, delivered an 18-page, single-spaced
letter from Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz explaining Iraq's
position in technical detail about why the document requests from
the U.N. Special Commission chief were unfounded.
	   The inspectors repeatedly have accused Iraq of trying to mislead
weapons teams. They checked nine sites Monday, including a surprise
visit to a cigarette and tobacco company in Baghdad that is not
under long-term surveillance, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Earlier Monday, Shah returned to Baghdad, saying only that he
would hold talks with Iraqi officials.
	   In the latest round of tension with the United Nations, Iraq has
focused its ire on Butler himself, and Iraq's official media on
Monday called the dispute personal, not political.
	   Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling party, said Butler viewed
Iraq's decision to resume inspections ``as a personal victory,
which he believes will enable him to take revenge.''
	   Another newspaper, Babil, warned that the United States may
attack Iraq within the coming three weeks.
	   In the streets, at least, the renewed prospect of a military
strike seemed to generate little anxiety.
	   ``The Iraqi people are becoming accustomed to such things, and
they don't have any fear of it,'' said Salem Fadil, a 35-year-old
vendor selling soap in Baghdad's bustling Shorja market.

Carlos ends hunger strike at request of radical Palestinian
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The man known as Carlos the Jackal has ended a
hunger strike after 20 days at the request of a radical Palestinian
leader, his lawyer said Monday.
	   The Venezuelan-born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez had gone on a hunger
strike Nov. 3 to protest his treatment in prison. He began drinking
water again nine days later.
	   On Monday, his lawyers released a letter to Ramirez from George
Habash, head of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
	   In the letter, excerpted in a statement by Ramirez's lawyers,
Habash requests that Carlos ``stay alive and in good health to be
able to continue together the fight for the noble cause.''
	   Ramirez ``responded that he accepted the request of Dr. Habash,
which he considered an order, as a result of the respect that he
accords him,'' said a statement by Ramirez's attorney, Isabelle
Coutant Peyre.
	   The decision to end the hunger strike was also a result of a
request by Ramirez's parents in Venezuela, the lawyer said.
	   Ramirez, 49, is serving a life term at La Sante prison.
	   He has been in solitary confinement since French agents snared
him in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 15, 1994, then hauled him to Paris
in a sack.
	   He was convicted last December of the murders of two French
investigators and a Lebanese national, and is under investigation
for four terrorist attacks in France.
	   Despite his hunger strike, Ramirez remained prolific, writing to
lawyers, the press and even to Iran's supreme religious leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Zimbabwean president arrives in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe arrived
Monday in Egypt after meeting with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.
It was not clear if his plane flew directly from Libya in violation
of a U.N. air embargo on the North African state.
	   African countries voted in June to ignore the U.N. flight ban
that was imposed in 1992 to try and force Libya to hand over for
trial two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland. The blast killed 270 people.
	   Mugabe arrived in Libya Saturday, apparently by plane in
violation of the air embargo.
	   Several African leaders, including the heads of the Congo, Chad
and Sudan, have ignored the sanctions since the vote.

Augusta makes sweeping qualification changes to Masters
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DOUG FERGUSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Golf Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ORLANDO, Florida (AP) _ Greg Norman won't have to worry about a
special invitation to next year's Masters.
	   Golf's most exclusive major championship on Monday announced
sweeping changes to its invitation list, a move that likely will
increase the number of players in the field but also make sure they
are among the best in the world.
	   Effective immediately, the Masters will take the top 50 players
from the World Golf Rankings who have not otherwise qualified. And
starting with the 2000 Masters, winning a PGA Tour event will no
longer be worth a ticket to Augusta National Golf Club.
	   ``Our existing qualification system has served us well,'' said
Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson. ``We think, however, our new
methodology better reflects the changes in golf, and will ensure
that the best players worldwide are invited to the Masters each
year.''
	   The changes are the first to the invitation list since 1990,
when members of the U.S. Ryder Cup team no longer qualified
automatically for the Masters.
	   Augusta National will invite the top 50 in the world rankings at
the end of the year, as well as the top 50 in the rankings after
the Andersen Consulting Match Play Championship _ or four weeks
before the Masters.
	   That takes care of Norman, who is ranked No. 15 but would not
have otherwise qualified.
	   His five-year exemption from winning the 1993 British Open
expired this year, and he failed to qualify through other means
because of shoulder surgery that forced him to miss three majors
and the last six months of the PGA season.
	   Others that will get in under the new guidelines include British
Open runner-up Brian Watts, ranked No. 24, and most likely Brad
Faxon at No. 42.
	   Starting with the 2000 Masters, winners of PGA Tour events will
no longer be exempt, a qualification that was first implemented in
1972. Had those changes been in place for next year's tournament,
players like Olin Browne, Joe Durant and J.P. Hayes would not have
have qualified.
	   Among the other changes to the invitation list:
	   _ The top 40 on the PGA Tour money list from the previous year,
up from 30. Also the top three on the current money list published
four weeks before the Masters.
	   _ The top 16, including ties, from the previous Masters (down
from 24).
	   _ The top 8, including ties, from the U.S. Open (down from 16)
	   _ The top 4, including ties, from the British Open. Previously,
only the winner was exempt.
	   _ The top 4, including ties, from the PGA Championship (down
from 8).
	   The Masters champion will continue to receive a lifetime
exemption, and the winner of the other three majors will still get
a five-year exemption.
	   Also this year, the winner of The Players Championship will get
a three-year exemption instead of one. The Players traditionally
has the strongest field and richest purse in golf. Of its 25
winners, only four have not won a major championship.
	   Despite the changes, the Masters tournament committee will, at
its discretion, invite international players who have not otherwise
qualified.

Iowa's Hayden Fry retiring after 20 seasons
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHUCK SCHOFFNER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   IOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) _ Hayden Fry, who turned a woeful football
program into a three-time Rose Bowl participant, is leaving Iowa
after 20 seasons.
	   Fry was the winningest coach in Iowa history, but his teams had
trouble staying with the Big Ten powers in the 1990s after winning
three conference championships from 1981 to 1990. This year's team
finished 3-8, the worst in his stay at Iowa.
	   ``It's kind of hard to do,'' the 69-year-old coach said today.
``All the people that gave me am opportunity to spend 20 years as a
member of the Hawkeye family, I could never repay them.''
	   Fry, who inherited a program that had gone 17 years without a
winning season when he came to Iowa City in 1979, took the Hawkeyes
to 14 bowl games and built a 143-89-6 record to become one of the
most popular figures in the state.
	   He said he had considered quitting two years ago but stayed out
of concern for his assistants and the effect his departure would
have had on recruiting. A bowl game at the end of the 1997 season
also prevented him from quitting for similar reasons.
	   ``I'd have rather gone out with a real good season,'' said Fry,
his voice faltering at times as he wiped tears with a handkerchief.
	   ``I really felt like we could have a good year,'' he said.
``I've always been an optimist, but I never dreamed that we would
experience all the problems we had ... . But I'm very proud of this
team this year, even in defeat.''
	   After going 5-6 and 4-7 in his first two seasons, Fry in 1981
took the Hawkeyes to their first appearance in the Rose Bowl since
the 1958 season. They lost to Washington 28-0.
	   Iowa also made Rose Bowl trips under Fry after the 1985 and 1990
seasons, both losses. Iowa was ranked No. 1 nationally for six
weeks in 1985, the only time during his tenure that his team was
top-ranked.
	   Fry, who played quarterback at Baylor, began his coaching career
as an assistant at his alma mater in 1960. Two years later, he
became head coach at SMU, where his teams made three bowl trips in
11 years.
	   He then spent six years as head coach at North Texas State,
compiling a 40-23-3 record before taking the Iowa job in December
1978. The Hawkeyes had gone winless in 1973 and were just 2-9 the
season before Fry became coach.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Western officials on Monday praised an
Albanian referendum on a draft constitution that would allow
Albanians to legally change their religion.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
monitored Sunday's vote on the country's first post-communist
constitution, said voting was ``peaceful throughout the nation.''
	   Drafted with Western legal advice, the constitution also would
give citizens the right to identify themselves as members of an
ethnic minority. It also would define property rights and allow the
government to expropriate land deemed of national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while working in richer,
non-Muslim countries.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   But the OSCE slammed the opposition Democratic Party _ which
boycotted the election _ for ``disinformation'' and ``unfounded
allegations,'' blaming it for creating ``an atmosphere of extreme
polarization.''
	   Final results will be available in a few days, but most voters
were apparently government supporters and the draft was likely to
pass.
	   Albania's Central Voting Commission said about 51 percent of the
population participated in the referendum, despite a steady rain
and the opposition boycott.
	   Democratic Party leader Sali Berisha, who resigned as president
last year, claimed police launched a nationwide campaign of
intimidating voters and stealing ballot boxes. He also said
officials lied about turnout and claimed no more than 38 percent of
the 1.9 million eligible voters cast ballots.
	   OSCE officials said they saw none of the alleged irregularities,
but said many voter lists were inaccurate.
	   Shortly before the OSCE statement, Berisha gathered about 2,000
supporters in downtown Tirana who screamed for the downfall of the
government and the ouster of the OSCE chief in Albania.
	   Berisha worked supporters into a fervor with angry speeches,
accusing the government of rigging the referendum.
	   ``If this government wants to manipulate votes it will have to
step over our bodies,'' he shouted on the city's central Skanderbeg
Square.

Carlos ends hunger strike at request of radical Palestinian

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The man known as Carlos the Jackal has ended a
prison hunger strike after 20 days at the request of a radical
Palestinian leader, his lawyer said Monday.
	   The Venezuelan-born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez had gone on a hunger
strike Nov. 3 to protest his treatment in prison. He began drinking
water again nine days later.
	   On Monday, his lawyers released a letter to Ramirez from George
Habash, head of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine.
	   In the letter, translated by the lawyers, Habash says: ``I shake
your hands, full of hope that you will remain a solid international
militant.
	   ``This necessitates that you stay alive and in good health, to
be able to continue together the fight for the noble cause that is
ours.''
	   Ramirez ``responded that he accepted the request of Dr. Habash,
which he considered an order, as a result of the respect that he
accords him,'' said the statement by Ramirez's attorney, Isabelle
Coutant Peyre.
	   The decision to end the hunger strike was also a result of a
request by Ramirez's parents in Venezuela, the lawyer said.
	   Ramirez, 49, is serving a life term at La Sante prison.
	   He has been in solitary confinement since French agents caught
him in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 15, 1994, then hauled him to Paris
in a sack.
	   He was convicted last December of the murders of two French
investigators and a Lebanese national, and is under investigation
for four terrorist attacks in France.
	   Despite his hunger strike, Ramirez remained prolific, writing to
lawyers, the press and even to Iran's supreme religious leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

Despite some shortcomings, Palestinian airport set to open

	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The control tower is still without
controls, the check-in counter has no computers and the runway
can't function after dark for lack of flood lights.
	   Despite such temporary shortcomings, Gaza International Airport
is set to open Tuesday, aided by a little improvisation and a lot
of patriotic pride.
	   ``It's a glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are
open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching while
workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in the southern
Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat planned to be on hand Tuesday
morning when a plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian officials becomes
the first arrival. At half-hour intervals, six more planes are to
come in from places such as Morocco and Spain.
	   The European Union, which donated dlrs 38 million for equipment
and training, is sending its Mideast envoy on a special plane.
	   The airport opening had been held up for two years because of
disputes between Israel and the Palestinian Authority over Israel's
role in monitoring passengers and cargo.
	   In the end, Israel will have a say over who and what is coming
into the Gaza, but the Israeli monitors will operate discretely,
behind one-way mirrors, as they do now at the Rafah and Allenby
Bridge crossings into autonomous Palestinian areas.
	   The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye
River land-for-security deal between Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Tomer Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in
Gaza, said periodic security closures, which bar Palestinians from
entering Israel, would not effect the operation of the airport. He
said Israel was inspecting certain gear such as X-ray machines and
electro-magnet equipment for safety but that it wouldn't hold-up
the airport from opening.
	   The head of the Palestinian Civil Aviation Authority, Fayez
Zeidan, was not available Monday for comment.
	   For the time being, it will still be a bit of an adventure to
fly out of Gaza International or to land there.
	   Palestinian officials say the equipment for the control tower,
the computers for the check-in counters and the flood lights are
still at the Israeli port of Ashdod.
	   Nir Yarkoni, a spokesman for Israel's Civil Aviation Authority,
acknowledged delays in some of the equipment reaching Dahanieh but
said he did not know the reasons. Degani, from the Israeli military
government, said some equipment was being held up by customs.

Trilateral anti-incitement committee set to meet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israeli, American and Palestinian members of a
new committee to track incitement will hold their first meeting
Tuesday as part of the recent Mideast peace agreement.
	   Yoash Sidon, chairman of the Israeli delegation said Monday that
the committee was intended to monitor a Palestinian crackdown on
anti-Israel incitement and would meet at least every two weeks once
the agenda was fixed.
	   ``We're trying to reduce 50 years of anti-Israel incitement on
the Palestinian streets,'' Sidon said.
	   Incitement and anti-Semitic rhetoric in Palestinian-run media
and in speeches by officials has angered both the current and
former Israeli governments. A committee to weed-out incitement was
a key demand by the Israelis in the new peace accord.
	   In a speech to parliament last week Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu cited several recent examples he found offensive
including a religious program on Palestine TV calling Jews the work
of Satan.
	   The committee is made up of four members from each side,
including elected officials, legal and educational experts, and
media specialists, Sidon said.
	   The American delegation was to include former California
congressman Mel Levine, who has worked to raise money for housing
in Palestinian areas, said a U.S. official who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
	   The official said that the Americans would largely act as
observers of the dialogue to take place between Palestinians and
Israelis.

Leader McRae crashes as Sainz closes on world title triumph
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with placings after day two &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHELTENHAM, England (AP) _ Race leader Colin McRae dropped out
of the Network Q rally of Britain with mechanical trouble Monday
while Carlos Sainz remained on course for his third world title by
staying in a top four position despite a blunder just before the
end of the second day.
	   McRae, a former world champion in his last race for Subaru
before he transfers to Ford, was leading the field on stage 20 of
the 28-stage rally, when his engine blew on the way a Builth Wells
in Wales and he handed the lead to fellow Briton Richard Burns in a
Mitsubishi.
	   ``The engine's knackered, it's finished,'' said the Scot who was
bidding to win the race the fourth time. ``It's the end of a bad
season.''
	   Although he was out of contention for the world title, McRae had
led virtually from the start of the race round England and Wales
which finishes at Cheltenham on Tuesday.
	   By then, Sainz hopes to be crowned world champion.
	   The Spaniard came into the last race of the season two points
behind championship leader Tommi Makinen. But the Finn slid out of
the race on Sunday when he skidded on a patch of oil and the impact
with a concrete pillar smashed a rear wheel.
	   Sainz, who now only has to finish in the top four to clinch his
third title but first for six years, was third after 19 stages
before McRae's retirement.
	   He slipped back to fourth at the end of the second day's racing
and has to keep or improve on that on day three.
	   But he almost ran out of the race on the 20th stage.
	   Instead of taking a high-speed left turn at a junction, the
Spaniard carried straight on and was lucky that an exit road
allowed him to turn back and continue.
	   If the exit road had not been there, Makinen would now be
champion for the third successive year, while Sainz lost 50 seconds
anyway.
	   Going into the final day's racing around south Wales and
south-west England, Burns leads McRae's brother, Alister, by 1
minute 15.7 seconds with Finland's Juha Kankkunen third and Sainz
fourth, 2 minutes 01.7 behind the leader.
	   ``The pressure is very strong,'' Sainz said. ``I cannot afford
to relax or make a mistake.
	   ``We lost time on the last two stages but everything is alright.
The battle will go all the way to the finish tomorrow. We can take
nothing for granted.''

Struggle for No. 1 looms in women's tennis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Martina Hingis had the last word this year. And
her triumph in the Chase Championships could be a precursor of the
scramble for No. 1 in 1999.
	   Hingis, who began 1998 by capturing the Australian Open, wrapped
up the season by knocking off top-ranked Lindsay Davenport in the
year-ending dlrs 2 million Chase Championships at Madison Square
Garden. She doesn't plan to stop there.
	   ``It feels great,'' Hingis said of the 7-5, 6-4, 4-6, 6-2 win
over Davenport. ``To play in the Garden was a big success for me. I
will try to get back the No. 1 ranking next year.''
	   After winning the U.S. Open in September, in which she beat
Hingis in the final, Davenport overtook Hingis in the rankings in
October. She became the first American-born woman to be ranked No.
1 since Chris Evert in 1985.
	   ``She deserves that right now,'' Hingis said. Then she warned,
``I have been up there, so I want to get it back.''
	   The strength of women's tennis was underlined at this year's
Grand Slam tournaments, where only Hingis made a repeat trip to the
finals.
	   The 17-year-old beat Conchita Martinez in the title match at the
Australian Open. Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario stopped Monica Seles at
the French Open and Jana Novotna beat Nathalie Tauziat at Wimbledon
before the Davenport-Hingis finale at the U.S. Open.
	   ``Overall it was the most interesting year in women's tennis for
a decade,'' said Novotna, the defending Championships winner who
was bounced in the first round by Steffi Graf.
	   ``We had changes in rankings, we had four different Grand Slam
champions. If you compare that to a couple of years ago when we had
such a dominating era with Steffi or Monica, I think this year was
the most interesting and the best year for the women's game.''
	   Bart McGuire, chief executive officer of the Corel WTA Tour,
agreed.
	   ``Now we have got half a dozen top players who can beat each
other and who can legitimately hope to be No. 1,'' McGuire said
Sunday. ``Our top 20 are stronger than any time in history. More
and more these players can play an all-court game, no longer just
the big groundstrokes.''
	   Graf has rebounded from injuries and operations, her dominating
game intact. Since returning from wrist surgery in September, the
29-year-old German won 12 consecutive matches, capturing
tournaments in Leipzig, Germany, and Philadelphia, before falling
to Davenport in the Championships.
	   In beating the world's top three players during a four-match
span, Graf stamped herself as a strong contender to regain the No.
1 ranking she held for a record 374 weeks.
	   ``It has been a few years since I felt that I would be able to
keep up with everybody,'' Graf said. ``I've been having a great
time. It's great to be back.''
	   Seles, a young veteran at 24, can again concentrate on tennis
since the death of her father this year. Even in her loss to Graf,
Seles showed the game that made her No. 1 for 178 weeks before
being stabbed by a spectator in Germany.
	   Throw into the mix teen-agers such as Venus and Serena Williams,
Patty Schnyder, Anna Kournikova and Mirjana Lucic.
	   Tauziat, who was 30 when she reached her first Grand Slam
tournament final, noted the change.
	   ``Now you have like 10 or 15 players who can be No. 1,'' she
said. ``So it is completely different from five, 10 years ago.''

Ball's penalty gives Everton win over Newcastle
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Michael Ball fired home a first half
penalty to give Everton a 1-0 victory over Ruud Gullit's Newcastle
Monday and move Walter Smith's team further away from relegation
trouble.
	   With Newcastle without injured England striker Alan Shearer and
Everton missing Duncan Ferguson, both teams were missing their main
strikers and it was significant that the only goal came from a
penalty which gave the Toffees their first home win in the league
since April.
	   The game was 18 minutes old when Carl Serrant upended Don
Hutchinson and Ball made no mistake from the penalty spot.
	   The result moves Everton up one place to 16th, just two places
below Newcastle.

Iraq says resistance over documents in no way means noncooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Iraq saying it wants to cooperate to finish U.N.
work, RAISES British comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Iraq said Monday it was committed to
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors but again balked at giving
them documents, arguing that opening up its archives could
jeopardize its national security.
	   Baghdad accused the chief U.N. weapons inspector of using the
issue of the documents _ which it claims either don't exist, have
been turned over or have no bearing on inspectors' work _ to
prolong arms searches and the timing of a promised review of Iraq's
compliance with U.N. resolutions.
	   The new dispute comes just a week after Iraq pledged to fully
and unconditionally cooperate with inspectors when confronted with
what U.S. officials have said were imminent U.S. and British
airstrikes.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen renewed the threat Monday,
saying the United States has ``in place in the Gulf enough
capability to carry out any military options the president might
decide would be required.''
	   Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock also expressed
displeasure with the Iraqi stance.
	   ``What this boils down to is less than full compliance, which is
what they promised eight days ago,'' Greenstock said.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, delivered an 18-page,
single-spaced letter from his deputy prime minister to the council
explaining Iraq's position in technical detail about why the
document requests from the U.N. Special Commission chief were
unfounded.
	   ``We don't have any more documents that we believe are related
to disarmament at this point,'' Hamdoon told reporters.
	   The letter from Tariq Aziz, he said, is indicative of Baghdad's
frustration ``with the effort to change the whole work of UNSCOM
from disarmament into documentation,'' referring to the commission
responsible for disarming Iraq.
	   Forcing Baghdad to open up its archives, he said, ``is something
that may jeopardize the national security of Iraq.''
	   Iraq has used the sovereignty argument before in trying to keep
inspectors at bay, and its sympathizers on the Security Council _
particularly Russia and China _ have generally supported the
position.
	   Council members won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until U.N. weapons experts have certified that
Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and the missiles
to deliver them, are destroyed.
	   Iraq has said it has destroyed all its banned weapons.
	   In the letter, Tariz Aziz accused UNSCOM chief Richard Butler of
using the issue of the documents to undermine a so-called
``comprehensive review'' of Iraq's efforts to disarm itself. The
council has said it won't conduct the review until Butler reports
that he has received full cooperation from Baghdad.
	   Baghdad sees a review as its best hope for a lifting of the
eight-year U.N. oil embargo. The council agreed to the overview as
a way to persuade Iraq to resume cooperation with UNSCOM.
	   ``Iraq wants to cooperate because it wants to finish this whole
job of the work of UNSCOM and to move on forward to the
comprehensive review,'' and hopefully the lifting of the embargo,
Hamdoon said.
	   Aziz said he found it puzzling that Butler could conclude that
Iraq wasn't cooperating with inspectors when he was seeking
documents that had already been turned over, or for which Iraq had
already provided answers.
	   ``Iraq's understanding of the present situation in the manner I
describe here ... cannot by any stretch of the imagination, be
described as a lack of cooperation,'' Aziz wrote.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more fully
on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary outline
for the review that didn't refer to a lifting of the embargo as a
possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14.
	   Aziz took particular aim at Butler's request for information on
its biological weapons program, which inspectors have long said was
far from sufficient, saying ``no meeting of mind is possible.
	   ``Given the gulf between the respective positions and the
different approaches adopted, we concluded that the requests of the
executive chairman are impossible to satisfy,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He also repeated conditions Iraq placed on the viewing of one
particular air force document detailing expended munitions that may
have been filled with chemical and biological agents in the 1980-88
war between Iraq and Iran.

Championships in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile taking shape
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ While Argentina's Boca Juniors
appear all but certain to be this season's champion, battles for
the top spot in Brazil and Chile are heating up as the seasons wind
down.
	   A 3-2 Boca Juniors victory over Rosario Central on Saturday
night leaves them just one point from the championship. Boca was
also helped by a weekend loss by second-place Gimnasia.
	   ``Boca can begin shouting champion,'' read Monday's headlines in
Clarin, a Buenos Aires daily newspaper. Another, La Nacion, said
``It's a party and Boca will be the champions.''
	   Martin Palermo on Saturday scored two goals, one coming in the
game's final minutes, and again showed that as the league's top
scorer goes, so goes Boca.
	   He has scored in almost every one of Boca's 12 victories this
year. They are undefeated so far this season.
	   The success of Maradona's former club team has reached a
frenzied level. Although Saturday's game was played in Rosario,
thousands of fans packed into Boca's home stadium to watch the game
televised on big screens. Thousands of others made the three-hour
drive to see the game live.
	   A Boca victory or tie next week against Independiente would give
them their first championship in seven years.
	   Meanwhile, post-season play is already underway in Brazil where
eight teams are vying to be this year's champion.
	   In quarterfinal action, Palmeiras beat Cruzeiro 2-1 after
falling to them in the first game at home 2-1. The two teams meet
again on Wednesday and Palmeiras advances on a tie. Cruzeiro needs
a victory to move into the semifinals.
	   Gremio defeated Corinthinas 2-0 on Sunday, forcing the regular
season champion to win at home next to advance. In other play,
Santos beat Sport 2-1 while Coritiba and Portguesa tied. A
Portuguesa tie on Wednesday would be enough to help them reach the
semi-finals.
	   The season-long battle between Chile's two leading teams
continued over the weekend.
	   After drawing with a weaker Coquimbo team, Colo's lead in the
standings over Universidad de Chile was trimmed to one point.
Universidad also helped themselves by scoring two goals in the last
three minutes to beat Palestino 3-1.
	   Still, Colo Colo's head coach Gustavo Benitez said the draw in
Coquimbo doesn't worry him, saying ``the single point we earned may
give us the title.'' He blamed the team's lackluster performance on
the ``poor condition'' of the field in Coquimbo.
	   But Universidad's midfielder Esteban Valencia disagreed saying,
Colo Colo should indeed be worried.
	   ``While they still have the first chance, they will now feel
much stronger pressure knowing that a single defeat in the
remaining matches may cost them the championship,'' he said.

Miami of Ohio back after 20-year absence in AP college poll

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Duke, Connecticut, Stanford and Kentucky
remained the top four teams in The Associated Press U.S. college
basketball poll Monday, and two teams made their first Top 25
appearances in quite a while.
	   St. John's, which beat then-No. 23 Massachusetts last week, was
ranked 23rd, its first time in the poll since a one-week stay in
December 1994.
	   Miami of Ohio, which beat then-No. 18 Tennessee last week, came
in at No. 24, the first time the RedHawks have been ranked since
the final poll of the 1977-78 season.
	   Duke (3-0) retained its commanding lead at the top, receiving 41
first-place votes and 1,736 from the nationwide media panel.
Connecticut (2-0) had 17 No. 1 votes and 1,693 points, 36 more than
Stanford (3-0), which was No. 1 on 12 ballots. Kentucky (2-0)
received the only other first-place vote and 1,524 points.
	   Maryland and Temple each moved up one spot to fifth and sixth
and they were followed in the top 10 by Michigan State, Kansas,
North Carolina and UCLA.
	   Michigan State, which fell two places to seventh after losing
60-59 at Temple on Friday night, was the only team in the top 17
with a loss.
	   Arizona was No. 11 and followed by Oklahoma State, Xavier,
Purdue, Cincinnati, Washington, Indiana, Utah, Syracuse and New
Mexico.
	   The last five teams in the Top 25 were Arkansas, Clemson, St.
John's, Miami of Ohio and Tennessee.
	   The poll could be in for a big scramble this week with three
holiday tournaments having four ranked teams each. The Maui
Invitational has Indiana, Utah, Syracuse and Clemson. The Preseason
NIT semifinals have Stanford, North Carolina, Purdue and St.
John's. The Puerto Rico Shootout has Kentucky, Maryland, UCLA and
Xavier.
	   Massachusetts and Rhode Island, which was 25th, fell from the
rankings, cutting the Atlantic 10's number of ranked teams in half,
leaving Temple and Xavier. Rhode Island (2-2) dropped out after a
70-53 loss to Cincinnati.
	   St. John's (2-0), in its first season under coach Mike Jarvis,
moved into the Top 25 with Preseason NIT wins over North
Carolina-Asheville and Massachusetts.
	   Miami (3-0) beat Notre Dame, Tennessee and Dayton. The victory
over Tennessee (2-2) knocked the Volunteers, who were No. 9 in the
preseason poll, from 18th to 25th.

Second Alomar joining Indians

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Make it two All-Star Alomars on the Cleveland
Indians.
	   Roberto Alomar joined his brother Sandy on the AL Central
champions, agreeing Monday to a four-year contract worth dlrs 30
million to dlrs 32 million.
	   While the deal wasn't immediately announced, several sources
familiar with the negotiations, all speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said it had been completed. The Indians planned a
Tuesday news conference at Jacobs Field to announce the contract
with the nine-time All-Star.
	   Alomar's addition finally gives the Indians stability at second
base, where they have used 15 players since trading Carlos Baerga
in 1996. Roberto, who was in Cleveland on Monday for a physical,
was the Most Valuable Player of this year's All-Star game while
Sandy, a six-time All-Star, was the MVP of the '97 game at Jacobs
Field.
	   Roberto, 30, has been in the sights of Indians general manager
John Hart for several years. With his addition, Cleveland has a
lineup with a current or former All-Star at every position and one
only rivaled by the World Series champion New York Yankees.
	   Second base has been Cleveland's most glaring weakness since
Baerga was dealt to the New York Mets. The Indians used six
different players at second during the '98 season alone and went
into the postseason with Joey Cora there after acquiring him in a
late-season trade with Seattle.
	   Cora hit just .059 in the playoffs and he became a free agent
after Cleveland declined to exercise his 1999 option.
	   Roberto's addition gives the Indians the strongest and flashiest
middle infield in baseball. A six-time Gold Glove winner, Alomar
will be paired up the middle with shortstop Omar Vizquel, who won
his sixth straight Gold Glove this season and has the highest
fielding percentage of any shortstop ever.
	   Alomar, who has played with San Diego, Toronto and Baltimore,
spent three sometimes tumultuous seasons with the Orioles. He came
under fire in 1996 when he spit at umpire John Hirschbeck during an
argument, and last year he and some other Orioles were critical of
manager Ray Miller and Baltimore's front office.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ National Basketball Association commissioner
David Stern and union director Billy Hunter held a brief scheduling
meeting Monday, and the two sides won't meet again until Saturday.
	   On day 146 of the NBA lockout, Stern, deputy commissioner Russ
Granik, Hunter and union president Patrick Ewing agreed to hold a
full negotiating session Saturday in New York _ eight days after
their most recent meeting.
	   That session last Friday led to the biggest progress in the
nearly five-month- long lockout as owners moved off their demand
for a 50-50 split of revenues and players dropped their insistence
upon 60 percent.
	   The owners are believed to be asking for about 52 or 53 percent,
the players 57 or 58 percent.
	   But the two sides did not talk over the weekend, and the delay
for the Thanksgiving holiday almost assures that the season will
not start until after Christmas Day, when NBC is scheduled to
televise its first two games of the season.

Palestinian protest against Arafat's deputy over prisoners
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ Angered by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat's failure to win the release of security prisoners
held by Israel, hundreds of relatives of detainees protested Monday
outside the home of Arafat's deputy.
	   ``Where is the justice? You have become collaborators!'' one
woman shouted as she held a gold-framed photo of her son in the
rally outside the villa of Arafat's No. 2, Mahmoud Abbas.
	   ``A government that does not appreciate its prisoners does not
deserve respect,'' read a banner in the crowd of 500 people.
	   Palestinian police scuffled with several protesters, and one
woman slumped to the ground.
	   About 2,500 Palestinians are still held by Israel, and their
fate could become a serious internal problem for Arafat.
	   It is an emotionally charged issue because nearly every
Palestinian family has had a father or son jailed by Israel at one
time. Prisoner releases are seen as a true gauge of whether peace
agreements bring real benefits.
	   Under the Wye River peace agreement signed last month in
Washington, Israel agreed to release 750 Palestinian prisoners in
three stages by the end of January.
	   The Palestinians took this to mean that Israel would release
security prisoners held for participating in the 1987-1993 uprising
against Israeli occupation or those jailed for membership in
Arafat's Fatah faction which was once outlawed by Israel.
	   However, a majority of the 250 Palestinians freed in a first
release last Friday were criminals.
	   The Palestinian Authority filed a protest with the United
States, saying Israel had violated the peace accord.
	   However, Arafat did not hold up the implementation of the
agreement over the issue _ a move that might have stopped last
week's Israeli troop pullback in the West Bank.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that he
had followed his commitments to the Palestinians regarding the
prisoners ``to the letter.''
	   He told his Cabinet on Sunday that he had promised Arafat to
release 100 so-called security prisoners who had not carried out
killings and did not belong to the Islamic militant group Hamas,
the Haaretz daily said. Netanyahu claimed that with last Friday's
release, there were hardly any security prisoners left that
qualified for release under Israel's conditions.
	   Palestinian groups monitoring prisoners disputed Netanyahu's
contention, saying about 1,000 of the Palestinian prisoners were
serving time for Fatah membership, weapons possession or
involvement in the Palestinian uprising.
	   ``None are charged with murder,'' said Issa Karakeh, director of
the Palestinian Prisoners' Association.
	   Hassan Asfour, who helped negotiate the Wye agreement, said he
understood the anger of the prisoners' relatives, but that the
Palestinian Authority should not be blamed for Israel's breach of
promises.

OPEC faces difficult and limited options at Vienna meeting

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ As OPEC oil ministers gathered for their
year-end meeting, they face an assortment of vexing problems: a
global glut of crude, mild North American weather, weakened
economies in Asia and prices that have fallen to 11-year-lows.
	   Ministers from the cartel's member nations arriving Monday for
the meeting that begins Wednesday were reticent about what steps
they might take to bring prices higher.
	   ``At this meeting we are just reviewing the situation, (to) see
what one can do,'' said the president of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri. He is
also the oil minister of the United Arab Emirates.
	   ``They don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo
at the moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center
for Global Energy Studies in London.
	   Reflecting the sense of crisis, an Iranian newspaper warned
Monday that OPEC's credibility is at stake. The daily Hamshahri
said the organization must draw up new methods and policies, not
just tinker with production ceilings.
	   ``OPEC is confronted with a big test,'' which if it fails ``will
place a seal of approval on views that call for the termination of
OPEC's epoch'' and keep prices low, the newspaper said.
	   Oil prices are flirting with a 12-year low reached in June, with
January Brent futures trading at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on
Monday. OPEC oil prices averaged dlrs 12.33 a barrel in the third
quarter, compared to dlrs 18.03 a year ago.
	   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, the contract for
light sweet crude to be delivered in January fell 44 cents to dlrs
12.45 a barrel. Refined products were also down, with December
heating oil falling .79 cent to 34.29 cents a gallon, and December
unleaded regular gasoline dropping 1.42 cents to 36.78 cents a
gallon.
	   Natural gas to be delivered in December fell 6.6 cents per 1,000
cubic feet, closing at dlrs 2.097.
	   A big problem facing the ministers is the fact that a 2.6
million barrel-a-day production cut the cartel agreed to in June
has failed to lift prices.
	   But OPEC's biggest predicament lies beyond the cartel's control
_ the usually oil-hungry world just doesn't seem to need or want as
much oil as it used to.
	   The weak market is the result of a mixture of factors _ OPEC's
unfortunate decision last winter to boost production;
warmer-than-average weather in many places; and weakened world
demand, especially in Asia, where sagging economies .
	   The drop in demand means less income for the OPEC countries, and
in turn, bigger budget deficits and predictions of tighter spending
next year.
	   Saudi Arabia, which produces 8 million barrels a day and is
OPEC's largest producer, depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of
its income. This year, those revenues are expected to fall 27
percent below the country's target, bringing in dlrs 25.3 billion,
the Saudi British Bank forecast in a report issued Monday.
	   The country's real economic growth is expected to fall to 1.7
percent for 1998, compared to 7 percent last year.
	   Next year doesn't look much better. ``The prolonged period of
relatively low oil prices has persuaded most oil forecasters to be
conservative about 1999,'' the bank said.
	   If OPEC is to succeed in bringing prices higher, it must at
least extend June's production cuts until the end of 1999. They
currently are due to expire in the middle of next year.
	   Without that extension, prices would likely fall further. ``The
market won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned.
	   Another option _ instituting deeper production cuts _ is
unlikely, Iran's deputy oil minister intimated last week. That
would be ``too much for OPEC to handle at the moment,'' Mehdi
Hosseini said at a London oil conference.
	   Meanwhile, the cartel is still struggling with members who don't
abide by their quotas. Venezuela and Indonesia are among those
producing more than they should.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Dozens of police with ski masks and automatic
rifles descended on a police academy Monday, leading more than 100
officers away in handcuffs. Forty-four of the officers were charged
with crimes including robbery, rape and murder.
	   Mexico City's attorney general, Samuel del Villar, said the
arrests were an unprecedented step in the battle against corruption
in the nation's police forces and pledged to continue such
crackdowns.
	   ``This is part of a housecleaning,'' said Mexico City police
chief Alejandro Gertz. ``We will continue to clean our ranks.''
	   According to local radio and television, the police were
summoned to a training course at the academy Monday morning and
instructed to wear police-issued blue sweatsuits. In the raid,
anyone wearing a blue sweatsuit was arrested.
	   More than 100 _ and as many as 272 _ officers were detained,
according to various reports, but del Villar said only 44 were held
after their names were checked against lists of arrest warrants.
	   Of those 44, 20 belong to Mexico City's auxiliary police force,
which performs most day-to-day police functions such as patrolling.
Fifteen were members of the city's banking police, and nine were
private security guards, del Villar said.
	   He said the charges included rape, murder, robbery, abuse of
authority and aggravated assault, but he declined to give other
details.
	   Noting that the arrest warrants had been issued as far back as
1991, del Villar credited Mexico City Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
who took office a year ago, with the first serious attempt to clean
up Mexico's corruption-plagued police forces.
	   Del Villar also credited the federal Interior Secretariat, which
is in charge of national security and the licensing of private
security guards, with providing information that led to the
arrests.
	   Corruption within police ranks has prompted President Ernesto
Zedillo to propose the creation of a national police force with
higher standards than local police agencies. But opposition
lawmakers have suggested that the new national police would be just
as likely to become corrupt, and could be used for political
purposes.

Saddam's deputy reportedly escapes assassination attempt

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's deputy
narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in a southern Iraqi city,
Baghdad television reported Monday.
	   Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council, was attending a religious ceremony Sunday in
Kerbala, a Shiite Muslim holy city, when assailants threw two
grenades at him as he got out of his car, it said.
	   Several bodyguards and bystanders were wounded, the television
reported. It said Ibrahim was not injured.
	   The attack came a day before Iraqi opposition groups met in
London to find ways to unite their ranks. It was the first reported
attempt on a senior Iraqi official since December 1996, when gunmen
shot Saddam's eldest son, Odai, about 10 times while he waited in
his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.
	   Odai, Saddam's heir apparent, survived the attack but now walks
with the aid of a cane.
	   Kerbala is in the southern Shiite Muslim heartland, which has
long been a source of opposition to Saddam.
	   Opposition groups have said that fighting has renewed in recent
months in southern Iraq. Opposition groups based in London said
that earlier this month Ibrahim commanded some Iraqi units sent to
fight Shiite rebels in the southern marshes.
	   Shiite Muslim rebels have staged hit-and-run attacks since the
Iraqi army crushed their uprising in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   The U.S. Congress supports the Iraqi opposition and recently
approved a dlrs 97 million aid package to support dissidents
fighting for the overthrow of the Iraqi leader.
	   The dissidents are deeply split and have rarely posed a strong
threat to Saddam, who rules with the help of a web of competing
security organizations that monitor the country and each other.
	   Despite Saturday's attack, Ibrahim continued his activities and
attended a religious festival held to commemorate the birthday of
Hussein, the Prophet Mohammed's grandson and Shiite Muslims' most
revered saint, the television said.
	   He delivered a speech on behalf of Saddam, it said.
	   Investigations were under way to apprehend ``the perpetrators of
this heinous crime,'' the television added.
	   Ibrahim is a powerful figure within Iraq's ruling elite and
serves as a deputy commander of the Iraqi armed forces.
	   He is one of Saddam's must trusted lieutenants and is officially
the No. 2 man in the Iraqi ruling hierarchy.
	   Like most of the elite, however, he holds little personal power
and his authority depends on his association with Saddam.
	   Ibrahim has survived Saddam's frequent purges, possibly because
he is considered to have little personal ambition.
	   Like Saddam, Ibrahim is from central Iraq, home to many of the
regime's Sunni Muslim loyalists.
	   Top Iraqi officials are well protected by loyal troops and
usually only venture out to meet handpicked crowds.
	   Saddam is known to take special security precautions and rotates
the places where he sleeps to foil possible attackers. In rare
public appearances, scores of elite Special Security Service troops
cluster around him.
	   Since the Gulf War, Saddam's younger son, Qusai, has commanded
this special palace guard of a few hundred men responsible for the
Iraqi leader's personal protection.
	   Most of the guardsmen are from Saddam's hometown of Tikrit.
	   Odai, Saddam's other son, commands the Fedayeen Saddam, a
paramilitary force of 40,000.

	   PAGO PAGO, American Samoa (AP) _ Samoa Prime Minister Tofilau
Eti, suffering from cancer, stepped down Monday and was replaced by
his deputy, according to radio broadcasts monitored on this
neighboring island.
	   Parliament quickly confirmed Deputy Prime Minister Tuilaepa
Sailele Malielegaoi as the new prime minister. Tuilaepa also was
minister of finance and tourism.
	   Tofilau, who held power for 16 years, said he will remain a
member of Parliament representing his home district.
	   Tofilau announced his resignation in Apia, the capital of Samoa,
formerly known as Western Samoa, located about 75 miles (120 kms)
from American Samoa.
	   Tofilau appeared in public for the first time in three weeks on
Monday after returning from cancer treatment in New Zealand. He
resigned while addressing a session of Parliament broadcast live by
government-owned Radio 2AP. He spoke for about five minutes but was
too weak to continue.
	   Tofilau has also had major heart surgery and been hospitalized
in New Zealand several times in recent years. He is the uncle of
American Samoa Gov. Tauese Sunia.
	   Samoa, which gained independence from New Zealand in 1962, is
east of the international dateline and 2,300 miles (3,700 kms)
southwest of Hawaii. The United Nations regards it as one of the
world's least developed countries.

Brain scan could help diagnose attention deficit disorder
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL RECER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Researchers say a new test using a special
brain scan can identify children who have attention deficit
disorder, the behavior syndrome that causes millions of kids to be
placed on powerful drugs.
	   Just as importantly, the finding of a biological ``signature''
in the brains of those with ADD could help determine when a child
does not have the disorder, according to the Stanford University
researchers.
	   Their announcement, to be published Tuesday in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences, comes just days after a
government panel concluded that doctors have no consistent,
physical way to identify ADD or diagnose who has it.
	   The brain scan technique needs further testing, however, and
could prove expensive. Insurance companies generally do not pay for
the special type of brain scan, called a ``functional MRI,'' that
is required. A regular MRI can cost more than dlrs 1,500, and a
functional MRI, available at just a few hospitals, can cost even
more.
	   Nevertheless, ``we've taken a first step that looks very
promising,'' said Dr. John Gabrieli of Stanford's Department of
Psychology, the study's co-author.
	   Attention deficit disorder, or ADD, also known as attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder, usually is diagnosed in school-age
children. The diagnosis is usually based on observed behavior, and
some experts believe it is highly subjective, essentially just an
educated judgment.
	   Symptoms of ADD include the restless inability to sit still to
read, study or even watch television. Often a child cannot play in
group games, and a common symptom is the inability to control
impulses. Some mild forms of symptoms are common in many children,
leading to concerns it is diagnosed too often.
	   ``Many people are concerned because the diagnosis remains very
subjective,'' Gabrieli said. ``It is possible to misdiagnose a
child and miss another condition, or to over-diagnose a child who
is merely rambunctious.''
	   A biological signature of ADD, in contrast, would allow for ``a
valid and consistent diagnosis,'' he said.
	   Mind-affecting drugs such as Ritalin are the most common
treatment, but some doctors and parents worry about their long-term
effects, which have never been studied.
	   The Stanford study used a special type of magnetic resonance
imaging device, the functional MRI, to individually scan the brains
of 16 boys between the ages of 8 and 13 while they were playing a
simple mental game. The MRI detects which part of the brain
responds to specific actions or to drugs.
	   Ten of the boys had been diagnosed with ADD, and six were
considered normal. These six were used as a comparison control.
	   In the game, the boys watched letters of the alphabet flash
individually on a screen. The boys were to push a button for every
letter except X. When X flashed, they were to resist the impulse to
press the button.
	   ``They were seeing a lot of letters except for X,'' said
Gabrieli. ``They got so used to going that it was hard to stop.''
	   When the researchers compared brain scans, there was a clear
difference in brain activity between the ADD patients and the other
boys.
	   The boys were next tested after they had been given doses of
Ritalin. Curiously, the drug improved the performance of both
groups to the same extent.
	   But when the brain scans were compared again, the researchers
found that boys with ADD had more activity in the basal ganglia, a
brain structure, than they had before taking Ritalin. In contrast,
the boys without ADD had less activity in that part of the brain.
	   The test thus gives ``a brain signature'' that specifically and
biologically identifies those with ADD, Gabrieli said.
	   However, it is still preliminary and must be proven by testing
both boys and girls and by being duplicated independently in other
labs, said Dr. Chandan J. Vaidya, the main researcher.

Saddam's deputy reportedly escapes assassination attempt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with background on Ibrahim, Iraqi security
measures &QL; 
 &UR; With Britain-Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's deputy
narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in a southern Iraqi city,
Baghdad television reported Monday.
	   Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council, was attending a religious ceremony Sunday in
Kerbala, a Shiite Muslim holy city, when assailants threw two
grenades at him as he got out of his car, according to the
television report.
	   Several bodyguards and bystanders were wounded, the television
reported. It said Ibrahim was not injured.
	   The attack came a day before Iraqi opposition groups met in
London to find ways to unite their ranks. It was the first reported
attempt on a senior Iraqi official since December 1996, when gunmen
shot Saddam's eldest son, Odai, about 10 times while he waited in
his car in an upscale Baghdad neighborhood.
	   Odai, Saddam's heir apparent, survived the attack but now walks
with the aid of a cane.
	   Kerbala is in the southern Shiite Muslim heartland, which has
long been a source of opposition to Saddam.
	   Opposition groups have said that fighting has renewed in recent
months in southern Iraq. Opposition groups based in London said
that earlier this month Ibrahim commanded some Iraqi units sent to
fight Shiite rebels in the southern marshes.
	   Shiite Muslim rebels have staged hit-and-run attacks since the
Iraqi army crushed their uprising in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf
War.
	   The U.S. Congress supports the Iraqi opposition and recently
approved a dlrs 97 million aid package to support dissidents
fighting for the overthrow of the Iraqi leader.
	   The dissidents are deeply split and have rarely posed a strong
threat to Saddam, who rules with the help of a web of competing
security organizations that monitor the country and each other.
	   Ibrahim is a powerful figure within Iraq's ruling elite and
serves as a deputy commander of the Iraqi armed forces. He is one
of Saddam's must trusted lieutenants and is officially the No. 2
man in the Iraqi ruling hierarchy.
	   Like most of the elite, however, he holds little personal power
and his authority depends on his association with Saddam.
	   Despite Saturday's attack, Ibrahim continued his activities and
attended a religious festival held to commemorate the birthday of
Hussein, the Prophet Mohammed's grandson and Shiite Muslims' most
revered saint, the television said.
	   He delivered a speech on behalf of Saddam, it said.
	   Investigations were under way to apprehend ``the perpetrators of
this heinous crime,'' the television added.
	   Ibrahim has survived Saddam's frequent purges, possibly because
he is considered to have little personal ambition. Like Saddam,
Ibrahim is from central Iraq, home to many of the regime's Sunni
Muslim loyalists.
	   Top Iraqi officials are well protected by loyal troops and
usually only venture out to meet handpicked crowds.
	   Saddam is known to take special security precautions and rotates
the places where he sleeps to foil possible attackers. In rare
public appearances, scores of elite Special Security Service troops
cluster around him.

	   	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Western officials on Monday praised an
Albanian referendum on a draft constitution that would allow
Albanians to legally change their religion.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which
monitored Sunday's vote on the country's first post-communist
constitution, said voting was ``peaceful throughout the nation.''
	   Final results will be available in a few days, but most voters
were apparently government supporters and the draft was likely to
pass.
	   Drafted with Western legal advice, the constitution would also
give citizens the right to identify themselves as members of an
ethnic minority. It would also define property rights and allow the
government to expropriate land deemed of national interest.
	   Opposition leaders call these clauses ``anti-Albanian'' and
predict many people will turn away from Islam, the dominant
religion, to avoid discrimination while working in richer,
non-Muslim countries.
	   They also say the expropriation clause smacks of communism.
	   But the OSCE slammed the opposition Democratic Party _ which
boycotted the election _ for ``disinformation'' and ``unfounded
allegations,'' blaming it for creating ``an atmosphere of extreme
polarization.''

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at outposts in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon Monday,
wounding three Israeli soldiers and two allied militiamen.
	   The attacks provoked Israeli air and artillery retaliation.
	   Three Lebanese civilians, including a seven-year-old boy, were
wounded in retaliatory shelling, which targeted a string of
villages facing the occupied zone, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   There were no immediate reports of casualties from the air
raids.
	   In Israel, the army said three of its soldiers were wounded, two
seriously, in five separate attacks on Israeli and militia
positions along the eastern sector of the zone.
	   Lebanese security officials had earlier said that one Israeli
soldier was killed in the attacks, apparently mistaking one of the
seriously injured troops for dead.
	   The Israeli army also said that two allied militiamen were
lightly wounded in the attacks.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the afternoon attacks in an area a few kilometers (miles) north of
Marjayoun, the main town in the enclave Israel has occupied since
1985.
	   The exchanges Monday come at a time of heightened tension in
south Lebanon. Three Israeli soldiers were killed and four others
wounded last Monday in a Hezbollah roadside bombing. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to drive some 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen from the enclave. Israel
maintains the occupation is necessary to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla raids.

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court Monday ordered a Saskatchewan
farmer to serve at least 10 years in prison for killing his
severely disabled daughter, overturning a lenient sentence issued
by a judge who said the father acted out of love.
	   The ruling against Robert Latimer was the latest twist in an
five-year case that has fueled divisive public debate over the
ethics of mercy killing.
	   Latimer was convicted last year of second-degree murder for the
1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who suffered from
severe cerebral palsy.
	   The judge in the murder trial provoked a national furor by
refusing to impose the mandatory life sentence with no chance of
parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking a rarely used exemption, he
sentenced Latimer to serve one year in a provincial jail and a
second year confined to his farm.
	   On Monday, Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld a prosecution
appeal and ruled that the trial judge erred by refusing to impose
the mandatory sentence.
	   Latimer, who has been free on bail, said he was disappointed by
the ruling but preferred a long jail term to the alternative of
watching Tracy suffer indefinitely. He turned himself in to police
while his lawyer applied for continuation of bail while they sought
permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Some teams with high hopes having problems
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVE GOLDBERG &QC; 
 &UR; AP Football Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Before the season, Kansas City was one of the
favorites to go to the Super Bowl, and at least one national
publication picked Tampa Bay. There was also a feeling the Giants
and Redskins would battle for the NFC East title.
	   Detroit, a playoff team last year, was thought to be a playoff
team again.
	   Three months later, those five teams are a combined 18-37 and
all but mathematically out of the race. They are prime examples of
how quickly clubs rise and fall in a league where a major injury or
two can cripple a team thinned by the salary cap.
	   ``We have found ways to lose time and time again,'' said coach
Marty Schottenheimer, whose Chiefs blew a 17-point lead in losing
to San Diego on Sunday and committed two pass interference
penalties in the final minute to set up the Chargers' winning
touchdown.
	   That came six days after the debacle against Denver in which the
Chiefs committed five personal fouls in the Broncos' final drive,
leading Schottenheimer to suspend Derrick Thomas and cut Wayne
Simmons.
	   The Chiefs are 4-7 after going 13-3 last season. This was the
sixth straight loss for Kansas City, which never had anything
longer than a three-game losing streak during Schottenheimer's 10
seasons as the coach.
	   What went wrong?
	   A bunch of key players got hurt, including quarterback Elvis
Grbac, defensive lineman Chester McGlockton and guard Dave Szott.
	   The injuries led to losses and the losses led to bickering.
Marcus Allen's retirement left a leadership vacuum Schottenheimer
hasn't been able to fill.
	   ``Ten years is too much,'' Jim Mora acknowledged after he left
the Saints in his 11th season. Schottenheimer might have
overextended his welcome in Kansas City although he'd probably be
perfect for one of the more than half-dozen jobs expected to open
after the season.
	   The other disappointments:
	   _Tampa Bay (from 10-6 to 4-7): Injuries and illness weakened the
defense, the strongest part of the team. That put pressure on the
offense, which hasn't kept pace. Quarterback Trent Dilfer has been
a letdown.
	   _Giants (from 10-5-1 to 4-7): The Giants had three impact
players on defense. They lost Jason Sehorn for the season in
training camp and Michael Strahan and Jessie Armstead have played
hurt. The offense has regressed, with quarterback Danny Kanell,
running back Tiki Barber and a young line the major setbacks.
	   _Washington (from 8-7-1 to 2-9): The Redskins thought they
solved their defensive problems by committing dlrs 57 million for
Dana Stubblefield and Dan Wilkinson. They've done little and other
defensive standouts (linebacker Ken Harvey and cornerback Cris
Dishman) have faltered. Worse, Gus Frerotte failed to deliver at
quarterback.
	   _Detroit (from 9-7 to 4-7): Maybe the Lions will make their
occasional late-season run and burst by Arizona and New Orleans for
the last wild card. But probably not. Bobby Ross committed to
rookie Charlie Batch at quarterback. Batch has been OK, but going
with a rookie usually means a team has bagged the season.
	   Then there are two power teams that may have to settle for wild
cards _ San Francisco (8-3) and Green Bay (7-4). ``I still think
nobody's better than we are,'' Mike Holmgren said of his Packers
following the 28-14 loss in Minnesota.
	   Perhaps.
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; THE EAGLE HAS (CRASH-)LANDED: &LR;  Philadelphia wasn't expected to
be much starting the season.
	   The Eagles have been less than that.
	   After being shut out by the Giants on Sunday, they've scored
just 92 points in 11 games, and their high for the season is 21, in
a 24-21 loss to Kansas City.
	   At this pace, the Eagles will set a record for fewest points in
a 16-game season, breaking the 140 by the 1992 Seahawks. They're at
Green Bay next week and have rematches against two teams that shut
them out, the Cowboys and Giants.
	   ``Our fans deserve better,'' said owner Jeff Lurie, who is
certain to fire coach Ray Rhodes after the season. ``In this
league, no offense, no Ws. It's as simple as that.''
	   One problem for Lurie: In Philadelphia, the fans blame him more
than they blame Rhodes, who took untalented teams to the playoffs
his first two seasons.

championship &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Reigning champions Yulia Obertas and
Dmitry Palamarchuk of Ukraine led the short program of the pairs
Monday at the start of the world junior figure skating
championships.
	   The duo overshadowed their rivals in a competition where couples
try to express, through a pattern of unified moves and steps
including lifts, a feeling of harmony and teamwork. The short
program makes up 30 percent percent of final score.
	   Americans Laura Handy, 18, and Paul Binnebose, 21 came in
second, followed by Jacinthe Lariviere and Lenny Faustino of
Canada.
	   In men's qualifying, which makes up for 20 percent of the final
score, hot favorite Ilia Klimkin, showed why he's tipped to reach
great heights in the sport.
	   The 18 year-old Russian recovered from a foiled attempt at a
triple axel with an impressive quadruple toe-loop and a host of
marvellous manuevres to take first place with seeming ease in Group
B. Xiaoou Hu of China was the only other skater to produce a
quadruple jump.
	   Thirty competitors, from a field of 42, made it into the short
program to be held Tuesday. The best 24 will then advance to the
free program and a shot at the title on Thursday.
	   Matt Savoie, 18, was the highest placing American qualifier,
finishing first in Group A. Ryan Bradley, 15, also qualified in the
same group taking seveth place. Parker Pennington, 14, was the
third American to qualify, grabbing 8th position in Group B.
	   The pairs title will be decided Wednesday after the free skating
program. The men's short program and the dance compulsory is
scheduled for Tuesday.

Six of world's top 10 skippers to compete in Frenchman's Reef Race
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands (AP) _ Eight skippers
including six of the world's top racing sailors will compete for
the dlrs 25,000 purse in the Marriott Frenchman's Reef
International Match Race next month, organizers announced Monday.
	   All eight are affiliated with America's Cup teams that plan to
challenge for sailing's most prestigious trophy starting next year
in Auckland, New Zealand.
	   They provide an exciting lineup for the race in Charlotte Amalie
harbor, which is only in its second year.
	   ``This is certainly the most outstanding field of world-class,
professional skippers ever to compete in the Caribbean,'' said
regatta director Arlene Martel of the organizers, the St. Thomas
Yacht Club and Team Caribbean.
	   Heading the list of competitors chosen to compete in the Dec.
9-13 yacht race is the world's No. 1 sailor and current World
Champion Peter Gilmour. The Australian, who is designated skipper
for the Japanese America's Cup Challenge is the only skipper to
have won the World Championship two years in a row.
	   The No. 2 ranked sailor is Chris Law of Great Britain, who
returns as defending champion of the Frenchman's Reef race and
represents England's Royal Dorset Yacht Club challenge for the
America's Cup.
	   No. 3 in the ranking is Virgin Islands native Peter Holmbert, a
finalist in last year's event who also is skipper of Team
Caribbean, the U.S. Virgin Island's America's Cup Challenge.
	   Fourth-ranked is the youthful Gavin Brady, 24, of New Zealand,
who raised his profile by winning the 1998 Ullman Cup in Norway.
	   At No. 5, Frenchman Bertrand Pace has climbed back into the top
10 after months of inactivity recovering from a broken arm.
	   Also from France is Luc Pillot, ranked No. 10 in the world.
	   The other two competitors chosen are Paul Cayard, winner of the
1997-1998 Whitbread Round the World Race and newcomer James
Spithill, 19, a member of the Australia Challenge for the America's
Cup who worked his way up to 66th in the world rankings after
beginning his sailing career on windsurfers and dinghies.

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Lebanese guerrillas fired rockets and
mortars at outposts in Israeli-occupied southern Lebanon Monday,
wounding three Israeli soldiers and two allied militiamen.
	   The attacks provoked Israeli air and artillery retaliation.
	   Three Lebanese civilians, including a seven-year-old boy, were
wounded in retaliatory shelling, which targeted a string of
villages facing the occupied zone, Lebanese security officials
said.
	   No casualties from the air raids were immediately reported.
	   In Israel, the army said three of its soldiers were wounded, two
seriously, in five separate attacks on Israeli and militia
positions along the eastern sector of the zone.
	   Lebanese security officials had earlier said that one Israeli
soldier was killed in the attacks, apparently mistaking one of the
seriously injured troops for dead.
	   The Israeli army also said that two allied militiamen were
lightly wounded in the attacks.
	   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas claimed responsibility for
the afternoon attacks in an area a few kilometers (miles) north of
Marjayoun, the main town in the enclave Israel has occupied since
1985.
	   The exchanges Monday come at a time of heightened tension in
south Lebanon. Three Israeli soldiers were killed and four others
wounded last Monday in a Hezbollah roadside bombing. The casualties
were the highest Israeli losses in more than a year.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, is fighting to drive some 1,500
Israeli troops and 2,500 allied militiamen from the enclave. Israel
maintains the occupation is necessary to protect its northern towns
from cross-border guerrilla raids.

Braves sign Brian Jordan
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Atlanta Braves, changing the face of their
team after another postseason flop, agreed Monday to a dlrs 40
million, five-year contract with outfielder Brian Jordan, The
Associated Press learned.
	   The signing was confirmed by two sources familiar with the
negotiations, speaking on the condition they not be identified. The
Braves scheduled a news conference for Monday night.
	   The Braves signed Jordan, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals
this year and became a free agent, less than two weeks after making
a big deal that sent pitcher Denny Neagle, right fielder Michael
Tucker and a minor-leaguer to Cincinnati for All-Star second
baseman Bret Boone and pitcher Mike Remlinger.
	   By trading Tucker, the Braves created a gaping void in the
outfield and immediately set their sights on Jordan, who lives in
suburban Stone Mountain and played football from 1989-91 with the
National Football League's Atlanta Falcons.
	   Jordan hit .316 with 25 homers for the Cardinals this year, both
career highs. He also had 91 RBIs and 17 stolen bases.
	   The 31-year-old Jordan gives Atlanta another potent bat in a
lineup that already produced a franchise-record 215 homers. The
Braves now have six players _ Andres Galarraga (44), Javy Lopez
(34), Chipper Jones (34), Andruw Jones (31), Boone (24) and Jordan
_ who eclipsed 20 homers in 1998.
	   All six of those players also had at least 90 RBIs, giving the
Braves a fearsome group of hitters to go along with a pitching
staff that still ranks among the best in the baseball despite
trading Neagle, a 16-game winner.
	   Despite an unprecedented seven straight postseason appearances
since 1991, the Braves have captured only one World Series. They
were beaten the last two seasons in the NL championship series,
losing to San Diego in six games this year.

Strong earthquake hits northeastern Japan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of
5.4 struck northeastern Japan early Tuesday, the Meteorological
Agency said, but caused no injuries or major damage.
	   The earthquake, located about 80 kilometers (50 miles) below the
ocean floor at a point 340 kilometers (210 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, struck at 4:56 a.m. (1956 GMT Monday), the agency said.
	   There was no danger of tsunami, or seismic waves caused by
undersea earthquakes or volcanic activity, it said.
	   The quake was most strongly felt in Shibatacho in Miyagi
Prefecture (state), about 300 kilometers (186 miles) northeast of
Tokyo, the agency said. Shaking was recorded in 15 northeastern
prefectures.
	   A magnitude 5 earthquake can damage homes if it occurs in a
residential area, while magnitude 6 can inflict widespread damages
in a populated area.
	   Japan is one of the world's most earthquake-prone countries as
its sits atop four tectonic plates, slabs of land that move across
the earth's surface.

Algeria calls for OPEC summit to halt slide in oil prices
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-OPEC

<TEXT>
	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Algeria is calling for a
summit of the leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to discuss the global slide in oil prices, the official
Emirates News Agency reported Monday.
	   Algerian Oil Minister Youcef Yousfi was quoted as saying that
the fall in oil prices ``can be solved through coordination between
oil exporting countries to rescue prices in the first place and
holding a summit of the presidents of these countries to tackle the
crisis at a political level.''
	   Yousfi made his remarks following a meeting with United Arab
Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan.
	   Algerian President Liamine Zeroual has dispatched other
ministers to the OPEC states of Iraq, Libya, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Indonesia.
	   OPEC representatives meet in Vienna, Austria on Wednesday.
	   Oil is Algeria's main export.
	   The drop in oil prices since the beginning of the year has cost
the North African state dlrs 2 billion in earnings, about the
equivalent of what the country spends on food imports.
	   Zayed expressed support for efforts to boost oil earnings, the
agency said.
	   ``We hope that the brothers would meet because this is their
duty,'' Zayed said in a rare public statement about oil policy.
	   Neither official mentioned any dates or venues for the proposed
summit.

Council prepares to renew oil-for-food program for another 6
</HEADLINE>
months &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The Security Council circulated a draft
resolution Monday to renew the U.N. ``oil-for-food'' program for
another six months and allow Iraq to buy another dlrs 300 million
in spare parts to repair its oil facilities.
	   The council was expected to adopt the resolution sometime before
the expiration on Wednesday of the current phase of the program,
which lets Iraq sell limited amounts of oil to pay for food and
medicine for Iraqis suffering under U.N. sanctions.
	   The new draft allows Iraq to sell another dlrs 5.2 billion in
oil over 180 days.
	   Iraq has been barred from freely exporting oil since its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the Gulf War. The council will
only lift the sanctions after U.N. arms experts report that Baghdad
has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council agreed to start the oil-for-food program in 1996 to
allow imports of basic necessities for Iraq's 22 million people.
	   Iraq had hoped that the current leg of the program would be the
last, and it had tried to persuade the council to merely extend the
current phase of the program for two months rather than renew it
for six.
	   Iraqi officials have long complained that the unique U.N.
program has merely served to keep sanctions in place.
	   Iraq hasn't signed any new contracts with foreign firms for
deliveries of crude beyond Wednesday, Oil Ministry officials said
in Baghdad on Monday. They said exports could be disrupted for a
few days.
	   Council members nearly doubled the amount Iraq could sell to
dlrs 5.2 billion in February, but low oil prices and the weak
condition of Iraq's industry allowed it to sell only about dlrs 3
billion in the current phase.
	   To help Iraq pump more oil, the council agreed in June to let
Iraq buy dlrs 300 million in spare parts for its industry. The
first materials from those purchases _ dlrs 1.75 million worth of
material used to treat crude oil and remove impurities _ are
expected to arrive in Iraq this week, U.N. officials said Monday.
	   The resolution calls for another dlrs 300 million as well.

Thailand to temporarily allow more tax privileges to foreign firms
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand will ease its investment
regulations temporarily to allow foreign majority-owned companies
more tax privileges, a government official said Monday.
	   Manufacturing companies being transferred to foreign
majority-owned status and startup firms will be granted broader tax
exemptions if they apply before the end of 1999, said Staporn
Kavitanon, secretary-general of the Board of Investment.
	   The board grants promotional privileges to various industries,
including corporate-tax exemptions for a maximum of eight years,
tax exemptions for imported machinery, and duty cuts on imported
raw material.
	   Staporn said foreign-majority-owned companies previously
eligible to apply for these benefits had to be producing goods for
export or located in remote rural areas of the country.
	   But the board decided that it will extend benefits to any new
foreign majority-owned companies that are located in more urban
areas and produce goods for domestic sale, he said.
	   The current economic downturn has forced many cash-strapped Thai
companies to raise capital from their foreign partners, putting
many of them under foreign-majority ownership, Staporn said.
	   Because many of these companies are located in more urban areas
and produce goods for domestic sale, the change in majority
ownership technically makes them ineligible for investment
benefits, he said.

Sharks drop Nicholls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN JOSE, California (AP) _ Bernie Nicholls, reduced to playing
on San Jose's fourth line in his 18th National Hockey League
season, has been dropped by the Sharks and offered a job in the
team's front office.
	   General manager Dean Lombardi floated the idea that Nicholls
should leave after Saturday's game against the New York Rangers. On
Sunday, the two met again and agreed.
	   ``Right now we're letting Bernie deal with the issues
surrounding the idea of retirement and also trying to develop a
position for him and present that to him,'' Sharks spokesman Chris
Kelleher said. ``Hopefully, he'll accept and stay with the team.
But as of now, his last game was Saturday.''
	   ``They've announced I'm done playing here,'' Nicholls told the
San Francisco Chronicle. ``I don't know what I should do. It
doesn't make any sense. I never expected it to be this way _ you
want to go out on your terms.''
	   Nicholls, 37, said he wants to help the team in any way he can.
	   ``All we're trying to do is find out what they have in store for
me,'' Nicholls said.
	   A three-time All-Star, Nicholls has had an outstanding career
with Los Angeles, the New York Rangers, Edmonton, New Jersey,
Chicago and San Jose. But his performance recently has been less
than spectacular.
	   Nicholls, who re-signed with the Sharks as a free agent during
the off-season, had 22 assists for San Jose last season and two
assists in 10 games this year, occasionally playing on the team's
fourth line.
	   He ranks 26th in NHL history in points with 1,209 in 1,127
games, and 32nd in goals, with 475, and assists, with 734. Nicholls
is one of eight NHL players to score 70 goals in a season, with 70
and 150 points for the Los Angeles Kings in 1988-1989.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq accused the chief U.N. weapons
inspector Monday of fabricating a new crisis over its weapons
programs. Meanwhile, Iraqi television reported that a powerful
official had escaped an assassination attempt. Deputy Foreign
Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi said Richard Butler's request for
weapons-related documents takes Iraq back to ``square one'' in its
effort to end crippling sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security
Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. Butler asked last week
for documents on Iraq's arms program and information on its
biological weapons program _ the field U.N. inspectors say they
have the most questions about. Iraq has balked at the request,
calling it an attempt to reignite a crisis. Also Monday, Iraqi TV
said assailants had lobbed two grenades at Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's deputy, Izzat Ibrahim, as he got out of his car to attend
a religious festival Sunday in southern Iraq. Ibrahim was not
injured. (IRAQ, IRAQ-ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited Boris
Yeltsin in the hospital Monday, and the two leaders adopted a
declaration expanding Sino-Russian relations and settling a dispute
on their western border. The document noted that the ``strategic
partnership'' the former Cold War rivals declared last year ``is
not an alliance and is not aimed against third countries.''
Instead, the partnership aims to block ``elements of
confrontation'' in the countries' relations and encourage
cooperation in all sectors, the 10-page statement said, according
to the Interfax news agency. Yeltsin and Jiang also released a
declaration settling disputes over parts of the western stretch of
the two nations' 2,700-mile (4,345 kilometer) border. Sidelined by
illness, Yeltsin will likely cancel other meetings with foreign
visitors this month but meet with Russian officials at the
hospital, a spokesman said. (RUSSIA-CHINA, RUSSIA-YELTSIN)
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ After years of negotiations,
fund-raising and hope, the Palestinian people will be one step
closer to a sense of nationhood Tuesday when Gaza International
Airport opens its doors and welcomes its first arrivals. ``It's a
glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are open to the
world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching while workers
painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in the southern Gaza
Strip, close to the Egyptian border. Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat will greet the first plane from Cairo carrying Egyptian
government officials at about 8:30 a.m. (0630 gmt). At half-hour
intervals, six more festive flights are to arrive from places
including Morocco and Spain. The European Union, which donated dlrs
38 million for equipment and training, is sending its Mideast envoy
in a special plane. (PALESTINIAN-AIRPORT)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's top two political parties
have sealed a deal that will place Prime Minister-elect Hun Sen in
firm control of a coalition government. Bitter enemies just a few
months ago, Hun Sen and coalition partner Prince Norodom Ranariddh
joked and laughed Monday as they signed agreements of cooperation
and toasted the new government with champagne. The two sides were
involved in an armed confrontation last year when Hun Sen ousted
Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a violent coup. After meeting
for more than an hour, Hun Sen and Ranariddh signed a joint
political platform and a division of Cabinet posts that will give
Hun Sen's party tight control of fiscal and administrative
functions. (CAMBODIA-NEW GOVERNMENT)
	   ZHYTOMYR, Ukraine (AP) _ A man accused perpetrating the worst
killing spree in modern Ukrainian history went on trial Monday for
murder. Anatoliy Onoprienko, a forester and sailor who said he was
driven to kill by an unknown dark force, has confessed to slaying
52 people, his attorney said. Onoprienko described the slaughter in
a videotaped 1997 police interview obtained by The Associated
Press. Dressed in running shoes, an oversized jacket and a knitted
hat, Onoprienko sat calmly inside an iron cage as court proceedings
began in Zhytomyr, 90 miles (145 kilometers) west of the capital,
Kiev. The charges against Onoprienko point to a remarkable rampage
that first drew public attention in December 1995 with the slaying
of an entire family in a secluded village home. (UKRAINE-MASS

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The Dow industrials shot to record heights
Monday, soaring 214 points as merger talks among major financial
and technology companies extended a spectacular rebound from a
summer swoon. The Dow Jones industrial average, surged 2.3 percent,
a rise of 214.74 that gained momentum in the closing minutes, to
finish at 9,374.27. The Dow has never been higher. The previous
record close was 9,337.97 on July 17. (US-STOCKS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Union voted Monday to lift
a worldwide export ban on the vast majority of British beef, a
milestone in the ``mad cow'' crisis that has pitted Britain against
its EU allies for nearly three years. ``The beef ban is lifted,''
said British Farm Minister Nick Brown. ``The beef is safe to eat.''
Ten of the 15 EU farm ministers meeting here voted to scrap the ban
on deboned beef, with Germany the lone holdout. France, Spain,
Austria and Luxembourg abstained. The decision should clear the way
to ending the crisis for British farmers, who were badly hit by a
ban on all beef exports imposed by he EU in March 1996. Estimated
losses from the ban amount to over 2 billion pounds (dlrs 3.3
billion) and the crisis undermined confidence in beef throughout
Europe. (US-MAD COW)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Deutsche Bank AG and Bankers Trust Corp.
confirmed Monday morning that they are in the ``advanced stages''
of merger talks. Germany's largest bank would pay nearly dlrs 9
billion, or dlrs 93 a share, for Bankers Trust, the eighth-largest
bank in the United States. The deal would be the largest takeover
of a U.S. financial institution by a foreign bank. The boards of
both banks have already agreed to support the deal, and will hold
separate meetings next Sunday to approve it, officials said. A
joint statement released Monday morning said that, ``while the
parties have satisfactorily completed'' their respective
investigations of the merger, the banks still had to work out final
legal, structural and tax matters. (US-BANKERS TRUST)
	   VIENNA, Austria, (AP) _ As OPEC oil ministers gather for their
year-end meeting, they face an assortment of vexing problems: a
global glut of crude, mild North American weather, weakened
economies in Asia and prices that have fallen to 11-year-lows.
Ministers from the oil cartel's member nations were gathering
Monday and preparing for the meeting that begins Wednesday and
that's expected to focus on ways to bring prices higher. ``They
don't know really what to do. OPEC is in a bit of a limbo at the
moment,'' said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for
Global Energy Studies in London. Reflecting the sense of crisis, an
Iranian newspaper warned Monday that OPEC's credibility is at
stake. The daily Hamshahri said the organization must draw up new
methods and policies, not just tinker with production ceilings.
(OPEC)
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's communications minister and
another official resigned Monday after being caught up in
allegations of influence-peddling in the sale of the state-run
telecommunications giant. But analysts said the shakeup might be a
blessing in disguise for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who
is trying to push a fiscal stabilization plan through Congress.
Legislators had threatened to hold up debate because of the
scandal. Cardoso accepted Monday's resignations of Communications
Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, the
president of Brazil's National Development Bank. But he said
Barros' actions were ``absolutely suitable.'' (BRAZIL-MINISTER
RESIGNS)
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ European Union finance ministers
confirmed Monday that the euro can replace the French franc as the
anchor for the common currency used by 15 nations in central and
west Africa. ``The question has been definitively resolved,'' said
EU Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. ``The arrival of
the euro will change nothing for the Africans.'' The decision,
which confirms a provisional ruling taken in July, should calm
fears among the African nations that replacement of the French
franc by the EU's single currency on Jan. 1, would undermine their
monetary stability. Under the agreement, the French Treasury will
defend a fixed parity between the euro and the African nations' CFA
franc in the same way as it now backs the rate of 100 CFA francs to
the French franc. (EU-EURO-AFRICA)

Woods and Topi the life-saving kitten. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Britain's Prince Charles Monday looked up
to the ancient Acropolis _ and not down at the modern apartment
blocks around it _ for inspiration.
	   Charles, here on a cultural visit, said cities around the world
look too ugly and too much like each other.
	   ``Sometimes it is impossible to know which country you are in,''
he said. ``Such is the internalization of cities.''
	   But Charles, who studied architecture for a year, studiously
avoided mention of the 2,500-year-old Parthenon marbles, stripped
from the ruins atop the Acropolis in the early 19th century and now
housed in the British Museum in London.
	   Removed by Lord Elgin, then Britain's ambassador to the Ottoman
Empire, successive Greek governments have pressed for their return
for many years. Britain has turned down all requests.
	   Charles, an avid campaigner against ugly architecture in cities,
arrived in Athens Sunday for a three-day official visit.
	    &UR; ___
	   EAST HAMPTON, New York (AP) _ Film director Alan Pakula was
remembered during a private burial as a man who celebrated life on
and off the screen.
	   ``I never met anybody in my life who was not a better man or a
better woman for having known Alan Pakula,'' Don Hewitt, producer
of CBS's ``60 Minutes,'' told Pakula's family and a few dozen
invited friends in a eulogy Sunday.
	   Pakula, 70, whose films included ``Sophie's Choice,'' ``To Kill
a Mockingbird'' and ``All The President's Men,'' was killed
Thursday after a steel pipe apparently fell off a truck and crashed
through the windshield of his station wagon, striking him in the
head.
	   He was interred in Greenriver cemetery, where painters Jackson
Pollock and Elaine de Kooning and former Time Warner chairman Steve
Ross are buried.
	   ``He gave a lot of people happiness and a lot of strength,'' ABC
News anchorman Peter Jennings said. ``You could go to Alan and tell
him almost any secret and it was always safe.''
	    &UR; ___
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Members of the rock group
Kiss gave a tongue-lashing to the crowd after someone shined a
laser pointer in drummer Peter Criss' eyes.
	   Criss finished singing the ballad ``Beth'' at the Continental
Airlines Arena on Sunday and then nearly stormed off the stage,
furious that someone was blinding him with one of the hand-held
electronic devices.
	   He rushed to the side of the stage, grabbed a microphone and
screamed a profanity at the responsible party.
	   Lead singer Paul Stanley challenged whoever was shining the beam
at band members to fight him on stage.
	   ``In every crowd, there's one or two people who don't belong
here,'' he said. ``Now I know you want to bring it to school
tomorrow when you go to sixth grade, but leave it at home when you
go to the show.''
	    &UR; ___
	   IBUSUKI, Japan (AP) _ Tiger Woods arrived Monday for a Japanese
tournament that is fast selling out because of his popularity.
	   ``People are buying the tickets, saying, `I don't know golf, but
I know Tiger Woods,' '' said Tokikazu Niiro, an official of the
Ibusuki Golf Club, site of the dlrs 1.25 million Casio World Open
that starts Thursday.
	   This is Woods' first tournament on the Japan PGA Tour, although
he played in Japan last year in an exhibition event.
	   All 7,000 four-day tickets for the tournament are sold out. An
additional 8,000 tickets for each day are being sold.
	   A field of 90 will compete for a first prize of dlrs 225,000 on
the 7,105-yard (6495-meter), par-72 Ibusuki Golf Club Kaimon
course.
	    &UR; ___
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) _ Disturbed by a fire in the night, a
kitten raced around frantically, waking up a family and saving it
from the raging flames.
	   But 3-month-old Topi was unable to escape the flames himself,
the Ilta-Sanomat newspaper reported Monday.
	   ``Without Topi, we would've been engulfed by the flames,'' said
Heikki Tahvanainen, who narrowly escaped with his wife and
18-month-old son.
	   Tahvanainen woke to a loud sound at 2 a.m. on Sunday, and found
Topi leaping about in the room next door. Then he saw a strange
glow under the kitchen door.
	   ``I realized the house was on fire, and woke up the others. We
just had time to put on our pants,'' Tahvainen said.
	   Topi likely hid in some corner and perished in the flames,
Tahvanainen told Ilta-Sanomat.
	   The fire destroyed the wooden house in Pyhaselka, 430 kilometers
(265 miles) northwest of Helsinki.

Once stable banks have roller-coaster year but stay upbeat

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ In the turmoil of world financial markets, the big
Swiss banks _ traditionally a bastion of stability _ are having a
particularly roller-coaster year.
	   To begin with, Credit Suisse Group and the newly merged giant,
UBS AG, had to agree to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust
survivors and victims' families to avert sanctions and a
multibillion-dollar lawsuit in the United States over alleged World
War II wrongdoings.
	   Then came the shock of huge third-quarter losses linked to
financial woes in Russia, Asia and Latin America. Heads rolled at
UBS after a disastrous high-risk gamble with a U.S. hedge fund.
	   All told, 1998 will go down as a rough year. But most analysts
are predicting a smoother ride in 1999, complete with higher
profits.
	   ``I don't have a bad feeling,'' said Hans Kaufmann, an analyst
at Bank Julius Baer in Zurich. ``I'm looking forward to the next
two to three years.''
	   Kaufmann said despite all the problems, he still expected the
banks to post profits of more than 3 billion Swiss francs (dlrs 2.3
billion) this year. Other analysts predicted the figure would be
nearer 2 billion francs (dlrs 1.5 billion).
	   In particular, Kaufmann said the two big Swiss players should be
able to seize opportunities offered by the European monetary union
better than more nationally oriented banks in other countries.
	   ``We won't need 11 banks in Euro-land with medium-sized
financing. We'll need one big bank,'' said Kaufman.
	   ``What the Swiss banks have done in the past two to three years
should position them extremely well in the new Europe.''
	   Reports that Credit Suisse would be involved in a big merger,
most likely with a German bank, sent its shares soaring in summer.
Nothing happened, but analysts believe the company is still on the
prowl.
	   Credit Suisse was forced to set aside provisions of some 1
billion francs (dlrs 740,000) because of the economic collapse in
Russia. Analysts predict it will lose well over 500 million francs
(dlrs 373 million) of its remaining 2 billion francs (dlrs 1.5
billion) in outstanding loans.
	   Bank chiefs say Credit Suisse First Boston _ the investment arm
and one of the main lenders to Russian companies _ is likely to
scale back its exposure but won't pull out altogether as Russia is
too big and important.
	   The financial crises have hit UBS hopes of nearing the 5 billion
francs (dlrs 3.7 billion) net profit mark this year on the way to
achieving its goal of 10 billion-11 billion francs (dlrs 7.5
billion-dlrs 8.2 billion) by the year 2002.
	   On a high after the merger between Union Bank of Switzerland and
Swiss Bank Corp., UBS enjoyed a bumper first six months. Profits
rose 22 percent to 3.5 billion francs (dlrs 2.6 billion) including
544 million francs (dlrs 405 million) set aside for the Holocaust
settlement.
	   But then UBS dropped a bombshell, saying it expected
third-quarter losses of about 1 billion francs (dlrs 740 million)
because of the crises in Russia and Asia. Most damaging of all was
the disastrous involvement in the U.S. hedge fund Long-Term Capital
Management LP, which nearly collapsed. That cost UBS 950 million
francs (dlrs 703 million).
	   News of the losses sent UBS shares into free fall until board
chairman Mathis Cabiallavetta quit Oct. 2 to take responsibility.
	   Although UBS is staying silent about future strategy, there are
likely to be more upheavals as it consolidates the merger.
	   With ex-UBS official Cabiallavetta out of the way, chief
executive officer Marcel Ospel _ from Swiss Bank Corp. _ is
expected to strengthen his grip on power.
	   UBS still holds the exclusive Aaa credit rating from Moody's
Investors Service, although has been warned it might be downgraded.
Some experts fear that it may incur big losses if financial turmoil
engulfs Brazil.
	   ``Like many other banks, we are in a difficult position because
of the turbulence on world markets,'' conceded UBS spokesman
Christoph Meier.
	   ``But the Swiss banks have a very, very solid basis and we have
absolute faith in the future,'' he added.

Border conflict brightens future of 100-year-old railway

	   DIRE DAWA, Ethiopia (AP) _ Years of war and neglect have ravaged
the 100-year-old French-built railway that slices through the vast
arid planes of eastern Ethiopia, linking Addis Ababa to Djibouti on
the Gulf of Aden.
	   A dilapidated 30-year-old locomotive pulls rusting carriages so
slowly that persistent vendors can hop on board, only to be forced
off by soldiers riding shotgun.
	   ``It has not been renovated for a long time. It's crowded and
uncomfortable,'' said businessman Abdi Adawi. ``It has to be
improved.''
	   Although it no longer takes the weeks it did in the 1920s to
cover the 781 kilometers (485 miles) between Addis Ababa and
Djibouti, the two-day trip is still grueling.
	   To block out the groaning diesel engine and cushion the constant
shaking, many passengers squeezed into dirty carriages chew khat, a
mildly narcotic leaf that is a cash crop in Ethiopia.
	   But freight, not passengers, is breathing new life into the
ailing railway. Djibouti has become the only port for landlocked
Ethiopia since a simmering border conflict with Eritrea erupted six
months ago, shutting off access to its Red Sea ports of Massawa and
Assab.
	   Since May, incoming freight shipments have increased from 14,000
tons to 21,000 tons a month. The amount of fuel _ diesel and
gasoline _ shipped to Ethiopia has risen from 2,000 tons to 7,000
tons a month.
	   But the surge in business has also underscored the railway's
shortcomings.
	   ``There is only one track, and much of it is well below
international standards,'' said the railway's general manager Ali
Abdullah Gadid. ``We can cope with the extra business at the
moment, but we desperately need to replace around 500 kilometers
(310 miles) of rails.''
	   Bridges destroyed during the war in the late 1970s between
Ethiopia and Somalia over the southeastern Ogaden region have still
not been repaired, and sections of the track are more than 60 years
old.
	   The French development agency has promised 53 million francs
(dlrs 9.3 million) toward an upgrade of the railway while the
European Union has earmarked 35 million ECUs (dlrs 40.6 million)
for the rehabilitation of the track and its bridges. But the funds
come with stringent conditions.
	   The railway has been told to layoff about 1,300 employees, close
to 50 percent of its work force. But it can't afford to fire them
since it doesn't have the funds to cover either their severance pay
or their pensions.
	   The EU also wants the railway to prepare for privatization. But
neither Djibouti nor Ethiopia, each of which holds a 50-percent
stake in the company, seems ready to relinquish control.
	   Privatization could lead to the elimination of passenger
services, which are largely responsible for the railway's annual
losses of around dlrs 750,000.
	   Freight currently accounts for over 80 percent of the railway's
income, and its share is expected to increase.
	   ``I can see the future on the freight side,'' said commercial
director Ahmed Douale Absieh.
	   Dire Dawa, now Ethiopia's second-largest city, was built at the
spot where workers pushing up from Djibouti finished laying the
first 300 kilometers (185 miles) of track in 1905.
	   The remaining stretch to Addis Ababa was not completed until
1917.
	   Wide, tree-lined streets radiate out from the railroad station
in the town that has grown wealthy on the khat trade with Djibouti
but has forsaken railway delivery in favor of small, single-engine
airplanes.
	   Railway officials talk about building a second track, but the
estimated cost of dlrs 120 million probably makes the project a
pipe dream.
	   Nevertheless, general manager Ali Abdullah Gadid remains
confident.
	   ``I am sure that the railway will be here for the next hundred
years. With Djibouti reactivated as Ethiopia's main port, I think
the railway, at last, has a bright future.''

	   LAS VEGAS (AP) _ Today's well-equipped consumers can find
themselves weighed down by all sorts of technological gadgetry,
including pagers, mobile phones, pocket organizers, digital cameras
and laptop computers.
	   Now that dizzying array of portable gear is getting pared. After
whetting people's appetite for single-function, go-anywhere
devices, manufacturers are moving in the opposite direction,
pulling together a stunning range of features into the digital
equivalents of Swiss Army knives.
	   For example, Motorola Corp. is selling an all-in-one mobile
phone that's also a sophisticated pager and a speakerphone and
includes a multilanguage operation that displays prompts in one of
four languages. Sony Electronics Inc. has a laptop computer that's
a digital camera. Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy is sporting a camera too,
a swiveling lens that captures digital images on the screen.
	   These devices may not be as simple as their predecessors. But
they promise to cut computing costs and reduce the number of
gadgets people lug around.
	   ``Some business users are carrying around a pager, cell phone, a
laptop, and in some cases, a printer and an alarm clock,'' said
Alison Crawford, a spokeswoman with Nokia, a Finland-based maker of
mobile phones that handle a range of functions. ``It becomes quite
heavy ... especially for a woman, trying to carry a purse.''
	   The trend, in abundant evidence at the recent Comdex computer
show, is enabled by improvements in technology as well as joint
alliances between manufacturers and providers of a range of
services.
	   In early November, software maker Microsoft Corp. and Qualcomm
Inc., which makes mobile phones, partnered with nine
telecommunications companies and digital phone service vendors in a
deal that will let users of digital phones, pagers and other gear
connect to the Internet, exchange e-mail and maintain calendars,
contact lists and other basic information services.
	   The new products are ``tremendous bargains,'' said Richard
Doherty, of The Envisioneering Group, a Seaford, New York
consulting firm. ``These all-in-one devices are doing well with
first-time buyers.''
	   Motorola exhibited its new IDEN I1000 mobile phone, which does
much more than make phone calls. At dlrs 300 and weighing just 5
ounces (150 grams), it's also a radio and alphanumeric pager,
features one-touch call-back and enables users to hold voice
conferences with up to 30 groups of people.
	   For its part, Nokia's 6100 mobile-phone series, ranging from
dlrs 150-dlrs 250, includes an alarm clock, four computer games, a
calendar, calculator and currency converter. Nokia also is selling
its 9000 series of phones, which at dlrs 700 includes a large
screen and flips open like a small laptop computer to reveal a full
keyboard for composing messages, exchanging e-mail of up to 160
characters, sending and receiving faxes and accessing the Internet.
	   Portable computer makers also are getting into the game. Sony
Electronics, the San Jose, California-based unit of the Japanese
electronics giant, is exhibiting a small laptop computer that
doubles as a digital camera.
	   The Sony Vaio PCG-C1 ``sub-notebook'' machine features a
built-in rotating camera and an unusually wide screen for viewing
images.
	   Users simply touch a special button on the computer to snap a
photo, and touch another button to e-mail it to co-workers, friends
and relatives. The computer's casing is made of magnesium alloy, so
at 2 1/2 pounds (1.1 kilos) it's not too heavy to point and click.
	   Using software Sony developed itself, people can stitch together
photos taken with the computer to create a panoramic picture. The
computer is mainly aimed at people with a need to rapidly transmit
photos, such as insurance appraisers and real estate brokers, said
Sony spokeswoman Gina Aumiller.
	   Sharp Electronics Corp. sells a combined computer-camera using
Microsoft's more-basic Windows CE operating system, while Sony's
product runs on Windows 98.
	   Sony's hybrid product is the best-selling sub-notebook in Japan
and retails for dlrs 2,200. The company plans to start selling it
in the United States sometime next year.
	   Likewise, Nintendo is selling its dlrs 50 Game Boy Camera, a
swiveling lens that plugs in to any make or model of Nintendo's
popular but aging electronic toy. The lenses enable users to change
images and even stick a face on to characters in four different
games.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Being a former Miss Universe was never
enough for Irene Saez. She won acclaim as a local mayor and got
reelected with a record 96 percent of the vote.

first woman to become president of her country.
	   But with Venezuela's presidential election less than two weeks
away, Saez's once soaring campaign is imploding. Sugary slogans,
chaos among her staff and an alliance with a discredited political
party have sent her plummeting from first place to fourth in polls.
	   Saez, 36, spent last week racing to meetings with political
leaders and other candidates to plot last-ditch strategies for
defeating the new front-runner, former coup leader Hugo Chavez.
	   Many of the rank-and-file in the Social Christian COPEI party
want to drop the 1981 Miss Universe and throw their support behind
a coalition candidate to oppose Chavez in the Dec. 6 race.
	   But Saez insists she's in the race until the end _ a promise
many analysts say may be hard to keep as election day approaches.
	   ``I am not going to renounce, nor will I be renounced,'' she
told reporters last week. ``Irene will keep fighting for this
country.''
	   In a nation that proclaims itself the beauty queen capital of
the world, even fans of the Miss Venezuela pageant see Saez's
campaign as a mess.
	   ``Irene should have stayed as a beauty queen and never gotten
involved in politics. She's very superficial and frivolous,'' said
18-year-old waitress Yusbely Peralta.
	   A poll released last week by Caracas-based Datanalisis showed
Saez had 2.4 percent support, a breathtaking drop from the 36
percent she enjoyed in March, when she was the top contender.
	   Chavez, 44, a former army paratrooper who tried to overthrow the
government in 1992, now has 49 percent support.
	   Saez rose to the top of the presidential polls partly because of
her fame as a beauty queen. In the last two decades, Venezuela has
produced four Miss Universes, four Miss Worlds and two Miss
Internationals _ more than any other country.
	   But she also drew support because of her success as mayor of the
well-heeled Chacao municipality in the capital, Caracas. ``Irene,''
as most people call her, cut crime, slashed budget deficits and
spruced up public plazas.
	   She was seen as an honest and efficient politician, a rarity in
oil-rich Venezuela. Her 1995 reelection was a landslide.
	   Chacao became ``a kind of model municipality,'' said political
scientist Amalio Belmonte.
	   Casting her eye on the presidency, Saez crisscrossed the country
and the world, meeting with Pope John Paul II.
	   COPEI, one of Venezuela's two biggest parties, thought it could
regain the presidency by backing her. Former president and COPEI
leader Luis Herrera Campins courted her.
	   But the alliance was disastrous for Saez, whose support also was
based on her independence from the discredited traditional parties
many blame for squandering Venezuela's oil wealth. She had been
running as an independent with her own party, called IRENE.
	   More blunders followed. She came off to many as maudlin,
speaking constantly of her love for ``my people'' and the need to
``humanize'' politics. Still, in recent months she replaced vague
campaign slogans with actual policy talk, promising to balance the
budget, improve tax collection and reduce Venezuela's dependence on
oil exports.
	   Saez's campaign team became a revolving door of advisers. She
attracted some of the best talent in Venezuela. But many soon quit,
fed up with Saez's lack of direction.
	   ``Irene passes half her time constantly changing her clothes,
her hairdo, her make-up. She hasn't been able to come up with a
single idea that could impress voters,'' columnist Andres Galdo
wrote in El Nacional newspaper.
	   Meanwhile, Chavez has promised to fight corruption and mass
poverty.
	   While Saez's campaign may be coming to a merciful end, her
political life probably isn't over. Observers say she could rebound
and run for governor or Congress in two years.
	   Even her detractors acknowledge she's shown grit by staying in
the presidential race.
	   ``At the last moment we've discovered that she's not only
beautiful but also intelligent and a fighter,'' Galdo wrote in
another column, adding that the next president should name her
ambassador to the United States.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ Being a former Miss Universe was never
enough for Irene Saez. She won acclaim as a local mayor and got
reelected with a record 96 percent of the vote.
	   Then she set her sights higher and for a long time it looked

NHL suspends Kings forward for 12 games
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Los Angeles Kings forward Matt Johnson was
suspended for 12 games without pay Monday _ the longest National
Hockey League suspension since 1994 _ for punching New York Rangers
defenseman Jeff Beukeboom in the head.
	   The suspension will cost Johnson about dlrs 95,000 of his dlrs
650,000 salary.
	   ``The league has made clear that deliberate blows to the head _
particularly those which cause injury to the head of an opponent _
will be treated severely,'' said NHL senior vice president Colin
Campbell, who issued the suspension following a hearing Monday.
	   Johnson got a match penalty for punching Beukeboom in the back
of the head during a game last Thursday. Beukeboom collapsed to the
ice face-first and was still wobbly when he left the ice with help
from medical personnel a few minutes later.
	   Johnson has already served one game of the suspension and will
miss the Kings' next 11 games. The suspension is the longest in the
NHL since Tony Granato of the Kings was suspended 15 games for
slashing Pittsburgh's Neil Wilkinson on Feb. 9, 1994.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Although headed for an economic
recession, Brazil's crime-ridden cities are undergoing a boom in
the security business, a newspaper reported Monday.
	   Industry records show that sales of electronic surveillance such
as alarms, sensors and video cameras increased in 1998 by 35
percent, according to the Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper.
	   Industry leaders say sales of guard dogs and bullet-proof cars
have also increased in the past year.
	   Rottweilers remain the dog of choice and are slowly replacing
Dobermans and German Sheperds, according to the newspaper. A
Rottweiler puppy sells for between dlrs 336 (400 reais) and dlrs
840 (1,000 reais).

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A volcano near Mexico City rumbled Monday and
tossed a plume of steam and ash two miles (3 kms) into the air.
	   The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano likely would be blown
northward over sparsely populated areas, the National Center for
the Prevention of Disasters said.
	   A yellow alert signaling caution was in effect and authorities
warned people against venturing within 2 1/2 miles (4 kms) of the
crater. Volcanic ash can cause eye and respiratory irritations.
	   The volcano, 50 miles (80 kilometers) southeast of downtown
Mexico City, has been sputtering intermittently since 1994,
emitting gas, steam and ash.
	   Authorities continued to keep a close eye on the southern Colima
Volcano, which in recent days has oozed lava and expelled bursts of
ash into the air.

	   SANTA ELENA DE UAIREN, Venezuela (AP) _ Venezuelan President
Rafael Caldera and Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso on
Monday inaugurated a new 972-kilometer (580-mile) stretch of a
highway in the Amazon jungle.
	   The section, which was built for dlrs 168 million, will link the
Brazilian cities of Boa Vista and Manaos. The highway had already
connected Boa Vista with the southeast Venezuelan border city of
Santa Elena de Urairen.
	   The expanded highway should increase trade of steel, aluminum,
agricultural products and manufactured goods between the two
countries.
	   ``We hope that this is the first step so that the countries of
the Andean Community become part of Mercosur,'' Cardoso said.
	   Officials are hoping that a free-trade region is formed
throughout South America by 2005. Mercosur comprises Argentina,
Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. The Andean Community includes
Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia.

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ A 26-person delegation led by former
U.S. President Jimmy Carter will monitor Venezuela's Dec. 6
presidential election, the Atlanta-based Carter Center said Monday.
	   The team will include former U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas
Brady, former Chilean President Patrico Aylwin and former Bolivian
President Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada.
	   The European Union and the Organization of American States also
are sending delegations. The election is the first in Venezuela's
40 years of democracy in which significant groups of international
observers have participated, according to The Carter Center.
	   The election is polarizing Venezuelans between the poor who
support front-runner and former coup leader Hugo Chavez, and the
upper and middle classes who back U.S. college-educated businessman
Henrique Salas Romer.
	    &UR; ___
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) _ The military intelligence service is
looking for new subversive groups in Ecuador following a dynamite
attack on the U.S. Embassy, Defense Minister Jose Gallardo said
Monday.
	   A stick of dynamite thrown from the street exploded on a terrace
inside the U.S. Embassy in Quito on Friday. The bomb destroyed
floor tiles and burst a water pipe.
	   In September, bombs exploded in an office of President Jamil
Mahuad's Popular Democracy party in the port city of Guayaquil and
in Ecuador's Catholic Bishops Conference in Quito.
	   The bombings occurred on the eve of a national strike by
leftist-led unions to protest economic reforms imposed by Mahuad's
centrist government.
	   No one has claimed responsibility for the bombs and police have
made no arrests. The explosions have not killed anyone, but a
Spanish nun was injured by flying glass in the bishops conference
bombing.

Yeltsin hospitalized with pneumonia

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Sidelined yet again by illness, President Boris
Yeltsin is holding court in a hospital where he is likely to stay
for at least a week while he recovers from pneumonia.
	   Despite his doctors' complaints, Yeltsin played host to Chinese
President Jiang Zemin in a hospital reception room Monday.
Yeltsin's spokesman said the president would likely cancel other
meetings with foreign visitors this month but will meet Russian
officials at the hospital.
	   Jiang and Yeltsin adopted a declaration expanding Sino-Russian
relations and settling a dispute on their western border.
	   The document noted that the ``strategic partnership'' the former
Cold War rivals declared last year ``is not an alliance and is not
aimed against third countries.''
	   Instead, the partnership aims to block ``elements of
confrontation'' in the countries' relations and encourage
cooperation in all sectors, the 10-page statement said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   The two leaders also released a declaration settling disputes
over parts of the western stretch of the two nations' 2,700-mile
(4,345-kilometer) border, presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin
said.
	   Yeltsin, 67, was suddenly hospitalized with what the Kremlin
called pneumonia and a high temperature Sunday, his third ailment
in recent weeks, reviving worries about his ability to run a vast
country deep in economic crisis.
	   Yeltsin has insisted repeatedly that he will serve out his term,
which ends in the year 2000. Under the Russian constitution, the
prime minister takes over for three months if the president dies or
is incapacitated.
	   Yeltsin's condition ``hasn't worsened, but it hasn't improved
either,'' and he still has a slight temperature, Yakushkin said on
Russia's NTV television Monday night.
	   In television footage of his meeting with Jiang, Yeltsin was
chuckling and wearing a sweater and did not look very ill.
	   The Russian president has rarely been seen in public recently,
and the Kremlin has only allowed limited television coverage of
him, fueling speculation that he is seriously sick.
	   He fell ill twice in October. Doctors described the first as a
respiratory ailment and the second as high blood pressure and
exhaustion. Since then, the Kremlin appears to have been taking
little chance with the president's health, ensuring that he has
frequent medical checks and keeping his schedule to a minimum.
	   ``His doctors were not delighted that he decided to meet
Jiang,'' Yakushkin said.
	   He wouldn't say how long Yeltsin would stay in the hospital. He
said treatment for pneumonia usually takes 8-10 days.
	   Yeltsin aide Sergei Prikhodko, in an interview on NTV, added:
``Knowing the president's character, he will have his own point of
view on how long he has to stay in the hospital.''
	   Also Monday, a top Kremlin aide was quoted by the Interfax news
agency as saying that presidential power could be turned over to
Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who has already taken over most
responsibilities over the flailing economy.
	   ``It may happen at any moment, that the premier may take over
presidential duties for at least three months,'' said Natalia
Savyolova, a spokeswoman for Oleg Sysuyev, Yeltsin's first deputy
chief of staff.
	   Savyolova said her remarks were unrelated to the president's
latest illness.
	   Primakov said Monday the government was working as normal and he
was not assuming any extra powers.
	   Opposition leaders and a growing number of centrist politicians
have questioned whether Yeltsin can fulfill his duties and
speculation has grown about early elections.

Iraq accuses Richard Butler of fabricating new crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL;

 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has accused the chief U.N. weapons
inspector of fabricating a new crisis over its weapons programs.
Meanwhile, Iraqi television reported that a powerful official had
escaped an assassination attempt.
	   Deputy Foreign Minister Riyadh al-Qaisi said Monday that Richard
Butler's request for weapons-related documents takes Iraq back to
``square one'' in its effort to end crippling sanctions imposed by
the U.N. Security Council after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   ``Why is it that now Mr. Butler is requesting all over again the
same requests that were made in the past?'' al-Qaisi asked. ``All
we have, we gave. All we don't have, we stated we don't have.''
	   Butler asked last week for documents on Iraq's arms program and
information on its biological weapons program _ the field U.N.
inspectors say they have the most questions about. Iraq has balked
at the request, calling it an attempt to reignite a crisis.
	   ``What do we see? No light at the end of the tunnel. What we see
is the light of a locomotive coming head on at Iraq,'' al-Qaisi
said at a news conference.
	   His comments were the latest in a dispute that has raised again
the specter of an attack on Iraq, days after Iraq narrowly averted
airstrikes by allowing U.N. weapons experts to resume their
inspections.
	   Iraqi TV said Monday that assailants had lobbed two grenades at
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's deputy as he got out of his car to
attend a religious festival Sunday in southern Iraq.
	   Izzat Ibrahim, Saddam's deputy on the powerful Revolutionary
Command Council, escaped the attack without injury, Iraqi TV
reported. Several bodyguards and bystanders were wounded, it said.
	   In Washington, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said that
the United States could still attack Iraq if it did not fully
cooperate with the inspectors.
	   About 24,000 U.S. troops, about 210 aircraft and one aircraft
carrier are still in the Gulf region.
	   Iraq reversed its two-week ban on the work of U.N. inspectors on
Nov. 14 when faced with imminent airstrikes by U.S. and British
forces.
	   The inspectors returned last week and, with the cooperation of
the Iraqi government, they have since made daily visits to sites
that could be used to build weapons of mass destruction.
	   Inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated its nuclear,
chemical and biological weapons, long-range missiles and the
programs to build them before the Security Council can lift the
sanctions, which have caused widespread malnutrition, hunger and
poverty in the once-prosperous Arab country.
	   Al-Qaisi insisted that since inspections began in 1991, Iraq has
provided all the documents inspectors need. Others that Butler
requested were destroyed or irrelevant, he said.
	   The inspectors repeatedly have accused Iraq of trying to mislead
weapons teams. They checked nine sites Monday, including a surprise
visit to a cigarette and tobacco company in Baghdad that is not
under long-term surveillance, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
	   Earlier Monday, U.N. envoy Prakash Shah returned to Baghdad,
saying only that he would hold talks with Iraqi officials.
	   In London, Iraqi opposition groups gathered at the invitation of
the British government. The groups planned to meet here Tuesday
with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Martin Indyk, who held talks
last week with Ahmed Chalabi, the head of Iraqi National Congress,
an opposition umbrella group.
	   Riven by ethnic, religious and political differences, Iraqi
opposition groups have posed little threat to the government. But
the United States has turned to them in recent months with promises
of political and financial support in hopes of overthrowing Saddam.
	   At the United Nations on Monday, Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon
delivered a letter to the Security Council from Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz reiterating Iraq's position.
	   Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, Jeremy Greenstock,
said Iraq was not fulfilling its promises.
	   ``What this boils down to is less than full compliance, which is
what they promised eight days ago,'' Greenstock said.
	   Iraq's official media continued to focus on the dispute with
Butler. Al-Thawra, the newspaper of the ruling party, said Butler
viewed Iraq's decision to resume inspections ``as a personal
victory, which he believes will enable him to take revenge.''
	   In the streets, the renewed prospect of a military strike seemed
to generate little anxiety.
	   Shopkeeper Salman Ali, called the crisis ``ordinary.''
	   ``God willing, nothing will happen. We pray to God it doesn't,
but we know that America doesn't respect world opinion,'' he said.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices in Tokyo soared on Tuesday following a
new record high on Wall Street overnight. The U.S. dollar was
higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 224.49 points,
or 1.52 percent, to 15,004.43 in the first 30 minutes of morning
trading, climbing above 15,000 points for the first time since
Sept. 9.
	   Markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday. On Friday,
the Nikkei had gained 425.48 points, or 2.96 percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.48 yen, up 1.32 yen from late Friday in

	   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
214.72, closing at a new record high of 9374.27 points, boosted by
news of possible takeovers of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank and of
Netscape Communications by America Online. The Dow's previous
record was 9337.97 set in July.
	   The rally continued in Tokyo.
	   ``Shares are rising as expected on the strength of New York

	   On the foreign exchange market, Japanese institutional investors
were snapping up dollars for yen following dollar-bullish sentiment
carried over from overseas trading Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.910 percent from Friday's finish of 0.900
percent, driving its price down to 107.98 yen from 107.92.

Former British spy says he doesn't regret selling his story
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A former British spy living in forced exile in
France said he does not regret leaking information to a newspaper
about Britain's internal intelligence agency.
	   David Shayler also repeated his demand for immunity from
prosecution in Britain so he can return home. But he told the
British Broadcasting Corp. on Monday that he still wanted to
testify before lawmakers or write a book about what he contends to
be the failed operations of the MI5 agency.
	   A Paris court last week turned down a British request for
Shayler's extradition to face charges under Britain's Official
Secrets Act. Shayler, who worked for MI5 from 1994 to 1997, fled to
France after selling information to a British newspaper. He was
jailed four months ago, but a French appeals court released him
last week.
	   Shayler maintains, among other things, that Britain plotted the
assassination of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi _ an allegation the
government denies.
	   ''I've never regretted it _ I would do the whole thing again,''
Shayler told the BBC. ''It's increased my determination to see
through what I've started to do in terms of bringing this to the
attention of government and parliament.
	   He said he was willing to testify to a parliamentary committee
in exchange for not being arrested if allowed to return to Britain.
	   Shayler also told the BBC that while he wanted to write a book,
he would be prepared to have it approved by the intelligence
agencies, provided he was given a clear definition of the rules by
which it was censored.
	   ``I'm not an unreasonable person,'' he said.
	   Britain's Home Office has repeatedly said, however, that Shayler
would be arrested if he returns, and it was not doing any deal.

Paul McCartney helps charity battle disease that killed his wife
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney has stepped in to help raise
money to fight breast cancer, the disease which claimed the life of
his wife, Linda.
	   The former Beatle has donated a signed copy of his biography,
``Many Years From Now,'' to Britain's Cancer Research Campaign for
an auction aimed at raising funds for breast cancer research.
	   The book, which is signed: ``All the best _ Paul McCartney,'' is
expected to raise a considerable sum when it goes under the hammer
Wednesday as part of a Christmas book auction at the Royal College
of Art.
	   Linda McCartney died in April.

Ship poses no pollution problem, agency says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ A crippled Japanese whaling ship that
caught fire off the Queensland state coast poses no threat to ocean
pollution, the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said Tuesday.
	   AMSA search and rescue officer Paul Threlfall said the latest
report from the master of the Nisshin Maru said the fire, which has
been burning for five days, was almost under control.
	   ``The owner is still trying to arrange for a tow,'' Threlfall
said. ``They are making every effort to self-navigate back to home
port for repairs.''
	   No injuries were reported from the fire on the Nisshin Maru,
currently drifting 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) southeast of
Brisbane, Shimon Harima, a spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety
Agency, said Monday from Tokyo.
	   Fire crews have been battling a fire on board the vessel, the
mother ship of a five-vessel whaling fleet, since a blaze broke out
last week in the factory section where the whale meat is processed.
	   ``There's been no reports of pollution at this stage,''
Threlfall said.
	   He said the ship was closer to New Caledonia than Australia and
any pollution was unlikely to contaminate the Great Barrier Reef.
	   The majority of the ship's crew was transferred to other ships
in the fleet when the fire broke out. A fire fighting crew of about
40 people is still on board battling the blaze.
	   Threlfall said it was not yet clear what caused the fire, but it
was not unusual for such a blaze to be difficult to contain.
	   ``With something like this, there are all sorts of compartments
and overheads and air-conditioning ducts that the fire gets into
and continues to burn for a long time,'' he said.
	   ``It's a matter of pursuing the fire until you get it all out.''
	   The 7,575-ton Nisshin Maru, carrying a crew of 111, was on its
way to Antarctic seas for Japan's annual research whaling program.
That program has often been criticized because meat from the whales
killed for research is sold on the market, with proceeds going to
the whaling industry.
	   Commercial whaling is banned throughout the world. Japan has
continued with research in an effort to gather evidence that would
persuade regulators to lift the ban.
	   Greenpeace has been monitoring the ship, Japan's only factory
whaling ship, since last Thursday.
	   The environmental group has campaigned for an end to commercial
whaling for more than 25 years but is unsure what the impact of the
crippled mother ship will be on this year's whale hunt.
	   Greenpeace ocean campaigner Denise Boyd said Japanese whaling
ships had previously justified hunting in a whale sanctuary in the
Southern Ocean by claiming the whales were being taken for
scientific purposes.

As economy unravels, some Muscovites turn to soup kitchens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Inside a bright little cafe one snowy morning,
respectable members of Russia's fading intelligentsia are chatting
over soup and tea.
	   Suddenly, a tall, white-haired woman in a full-length,
cream-colored fur coat begins to sob.
	   ``We're not bums!'' she wails.
	   The others quickly reassure her. Of course they aren't. Over
there _ that man was a prominent screenwriter. That woman _ once a
leading engineer at a radar-making plant.
	   Now, however, they are among Moscow's swelling underclass,
eating free meals in an off-hours soup kitchen.
	   With winter approaching, alarms are being raised in Russia about
people going hungry. The United States, the European Union and the
International Red Cross have agreed to help, even as top Russian
officials insist the country has plenty of food.
	   It might, but that doesn't mean people can afford it. Since Aug.
17, when Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on its foreign
loans, the typical Russian's meager income has fallen by
two-thirds, and many people continue to go without any pay at all.
	   In post-Soviet Russia, Moscow was the one place that clearly
benefited from the country's patchy economic reforms. It rapidly
became a boom town. But it also took the main blow when the economy
collapsed last summer. Although a person of means can still splurge
and pay the equivalent of dlrs 5 a pound for German sausage, dlrs 1
a pound for Spanish oranges and dlrs 10 for a bottle of French
wine, many older and poorer Muscovites now face the hunger and
other problems fellow Russians have suffered for years.
	   The city offers free meals to retirees at cafeterias in each of
its 28 districts, but their capacity falls far short of the growing
need. The Salvation Army and hundreds of Russian Orthodox parishes
have stepped in to fill the gap. Neither the city nor the
charitable organizations can say how many people may be homeless or
hungry, but all concede they cannot meet the demand for free food.
	   ``It's a big problem in Moscow right now,'' says Nemerud Negash,
an Ethiopian immigrant who helped found the Center for Humanitarian
Aid, a non-profit dedicated to helping the homeless.
	   The numbers of needy in Moscow has been growing rapidly,
especially since the economic collapse, Negash says. A few months
ago, his organization was serving 130 to 150 free meals a day. Now,
he says, it serves 200 _ a number that is fixed only by the limit
of the center's resources. Every day, he says, he turns people
away.
	   Negash's center serves meals from the yard of the 300-year-old
Church of the Apostle Saints Peter and Paul, located a couple
blocks from three of Moscow's main train stations, which are
magnets for the homeless.
	   One recent day, with the temperature hovering around 5 degrees
(-15 C), the homeless begin lining up well before the 1 p.m. start
of the free lunch hour. When the gates open, there is a brief
scuffle as volunteers block the hungry from rushing the churchyard.
A line of sorts is formed. First women, then men, shuffle past a
folding table laden with a bucket of bread, an urn of hot soy milk
and a pot of steaming mixed grains and fish.
	   ``I come almost every day,'' says Lyudmila Baranova, a slender,
clear-eyed woman of 36 who lives in the nearby train station. She
came from Velikiye Luki, a small city to the west where she had
worked as a seamstress until being laid off in May.
	   She arrived in Moscow two months ago, figuring her prospects had
to improve. In her hometown, ``There are no jobs, no charity,'' she
says.
	   But in Moscow, she earns no more than 50 rubles a day, about
dlrs 3, peddling a newspaper written by the homeless. She is
disgusted by the situation in Russia.
	   ``Things are much, much worse,'' she says. ``We lived without
problems in the old days. We don't need the Soviet Union back, but
we don't need this, either _ not what's going on now.''
	   While a vast social gulf separates the homeless shivering in the
Peter and Paul courtyard from the fallen intelligentsia eating at
the ``U Kuzmi'' cafe, the essential difference is that one group
has homes, the other doesn't. Both are living on the edge of
hunger.
	   Nina Petrukholva, the former engineer, eats almost every day at
``U Kuzmi,'' where a consortium of Western and Russian charities
and the city government pays for a few dozen people to eat modest,
three-course meals of soup, salad and a small entree between 9 a.m.
and noon, before regular patrons arrive.
	   Petrukholva used to hike and climb mountains, and she looks far
younger than her 74 years. A lively, cultured woman, she still
cross-country skis in the winter, attends free performances at
Moscow's theaters and indulges her love of classic Russian
literature and music.
	   She once headed a large department in the Soviet Union's main
radar engineering and manufacturing enterprise. In Western terms,
she was a high-ranking executive, someone who might have expected
to pamper herself in retirement with travel and occasional fine
meals.
	   Instead, she gets by on a pension of just over 400 rubles a
month, the equivalent of dlrs 23.
	   ``People ask me, `How do you survive on such money?''' she says.
``I reply: `Silently.'''

10 Brazilian police officers go on trial in 1993 massacre

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Jurors will see graphic pictures
of 21 massacre victims projected on a large screen during the trial
of 10 former Brazilian police officers.
	   The 10 men, whose trial began Monday, are among 52 former
officers accused in the Aug. 29, 1993, massacre in the Vigario
Geral slum in Rio de Janeiro's poor north side. Four survivors who
barely escaped also will testify.
	   Prosecutors say the police shot the residents in retaliation for
the murder of four police there a day earlier. Those deaths were
blamed on drug traffickers.
	   None of the victims, however, was suspected of being responsible
for the police deaths. Nor were they linked to any criminal gang.
	   Shortly before midnight that day, hooded men with automatic
weapons poured out of unmarked cars and entered the slum firing,
seemingly at random. One tossed a grenade into an open-air bar,
while others burst into a house and shot down eight members of a
single family. Investigators say they were members of a police
death squad called the ``Running Horses.''
	   Since then, four trials have resulted in only two convictions.
	   Experts say the most damaging evidence in this week's trial will
come from a former police informer, Ivan Custodio, a member of the
Running Horses whose testimony led to the two convictions last
year.
	   As a police informant, Custodio is said to have participated in
numerous crimes, including homicide and regular shakedowns of drug
dealers. But on the day of the massacre, he overslept and missed
the raid. Several hours later, the 10 defendants gave him a
detailed account of what happened, he says.
	   Fearing he would be killed because he knew too much, Custodio
chose to testify against his former colleagues and has been in
hiding ever since.

Brazil's communications minister resigns amid scandal

<TEXT>
	   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's communications minister and
another official have resigned after being caught up in allegations
of influence-peddling in the sale of the state-run
telecommunications giant.
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso said the resignation was ``a
loss for Brazil, for the government and for myself''.
	   But analysts said the shake-up might be a blessing in disguise
for Cardoso, who is trying to push a fiscal stabilization plan
through Congress. Legislators had threatened to hold up debate
because of the scandal.
	   Cardoso accepted Monday's resignations of Communications
Minister Luiz Carlos Mendonca de Barros and Andre Lara Resende, the
president of Brazil's National Development Bank. But he said
Barros' actions were ``absolutely suitable.''
	   Barros strongly criticized government-allied politicians and the
media who had called for his resignation.
	   ``The government has an incompatibility between its economic
goals and its political base,'' he told the Agencia Estado news
agency. He made a reference to being ``stabbed in the back''.
	   The scandal broke earlier this month after several leading
magazines published transcripts of illegally taped phone
conversations between Barros and Resende about the sale of
telecommunications giant Telebras.
	   In the transcripts, the two men appeared to be trying to
influence the sale in favor of a consortium that included
ex-Central Bank chief Persio Arida and former privatization
director Elena Landau, which ultimately did not win the auction.
Police are investigating who was behind the phone taps.
	   Cardoso, speaking to reporters in the nothernmost state of
Roraima, said he was ``indignant at the fact that criminal tapping
had created a scandal instead of being repudiated''.
	   Telebras was sold in 12 separate blocks for a total of dlrs 19
billion at the July 29 auction.
	   Barros' brother, Jose Roberto, who heads the Foreign Trade
Council, and Jose Pio Borges, vice-president of the Development
Bank, stepped down as well although they did not appear to be
involved in the scandal.
	   Many feared a congressional investigation into the charges
against Barros and Resende would hold up approval of a dlrs 24
billion austerity package aimed at rebuilding investor confidence
in Brazil's ailing economy.
	   ``It might be a hard blow for Cardoso personally,'' said
political analyst Ricardo Pedreira. ``But it avoids serious risks
for the fiscal plan, which is now well on its way to approval in
Congress.''
	   Investors also appeared to approve of the resignations. The
country's main stock exchange index, the Sao Paulo's Bovespa,
closed up 1.2 percent Monday.
	   Opposition politicians, however, insisted the resignations
should not preclude a congressional inquiry.
	   Barros has denied wrongdoing, saying the transcripts were
``incomplete and edited.'' He said he was only trying to ``increase
competition.''
	   Barros' spokesman, Cesar Borges, was not immediately available
for comment Monday. Barros answered legislators questions for
nearly five hours on Thursday.

Asian crisis finally shows up in Taiwan, though not as badly as
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ At the sound of the whistle the
competitors began their frantic sprint down the basketball court _
44-pound (20 kilogram) bags of rice slung over their shoulders.
	   Not athletes or army recruits, they were candidates for garbage
hauling jobs _ usually not a career highly prized by middle-class
Taiwanese. At least not until the Asian crisis started hitting
home.
	   Despite Taiwan's relatively strong performance, secure if
unglamorous jobs are in demand. Nervousness and economic pessimism,
fed by a dive in exports and the stock market, are indications that
the crisis is starting to surface in Taiwan's economy.
	   ``This is stable work, even if the pay is a little less,'' said
Hsueh Kuang-jung, 28, who joined the garbage collection tryouts
after leaving his job as a real estate broker because of a drop in
business.
	   When 90 garbage hauler jobs recently opened, more than 3,000
people competed for them, including 100 college graduates. The jobs
pay a starting salary of 27,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 843) per
month, just below the Taiwanese average.
	   ``The economy is going to continue to weaken. Taiwan is going to
do better than most of the other countries in the region, but the
economy is going to grow much slower than Taiwan is used to,'' said
Duncan S. Wooldridge, who follows the Taiwan economy for the U.S.
investment bank Merrill Lynch.
	   The emerging economic troubles might seem a world away from the
bustle of the Saturday afternoon shopping crowds. But even there,
buying habits have shifted away from impulse items toward more
practical purchases, says Pan Hui-lang, spokeswoman for the
Shin-Kong Mitsukoshi department store chain.
	   ``Of course the crisis is hitting, but its mostly still a matter
of attitude,'' she said.
	   Feeling the impact of the regional recession, Taiwan's economy
is forecast to grow at 5.3 percent in 1998, down from 6.8 percent
last year. That's largely a reflection of a 7.4 percent drop in
exports _ the core of the economy _ that has sent the stock market
diving more than 20 percent since mid-July.
	   The government finally stepped in to restore stability, buying
up some shares and taking some companies temporarily off the
exchange after they got in trouble borrowing money to invest in
stocks, then using the stocks as collateral to borrow and invest
more.
	   Sellers of luxury products and high-ticket items like cars are
taking the brunt of the slowdown, though the going is also getting
rougher for restaurants and shoe stores.
	   ``People aren't much snatching up the 9,000 Taiwan dollar (U.S.
dlrs 272) bottles of whiskey anymore and businesses are cutting
back on their entertainment budgets,'' said Jenny Peng, manager of
a liquor store chain where business has fallen by 20 percent since
July.
	   While overall unemployment has held steady at 2.98 percent, the
numbers of street-side hawkers in Taipei have risen sharply in
recent months. Factories that used to struggle to find workers are
suddenly overwhelmed with applicants _ many of them former owners
of their own businesses.
	   Taiwan's resiliency lies in exactly the kind of flexibility and
adaptability shown by the labor market, economists say. The
island's economic backbone is made up of small businesses, many of
them exporters, which unlike Korean chaebols or Japan's hulking
corporations, must react quickly to survive.
	   ``Banks think small businesses are unreliable so they don't lend
to them much. When they go belly up, their debts are slight,'' says
Kuo Wen-jeng, an Cornell-trained economist at the Chung-Hua
Institution for Economic Research.
	   To see Taiwan through the crisis, Premier Vincent Siew's
government has imposed mild currency speculation curbs and sped up
or committed 193 billion dollars (U.S. dlrs 5.8 bill) in new
infrastructure spending through 2000.
	   Some say more gains could be gotten by demolishing unofficial
monopolies in sectors such as life insurance, where two companies,
Cathay Life and Nan Shan Life Insurance Co., control more than 90
percent of the market
	   ``You're not going to have a really strong economy where the

Iraq says resistance over documents in no way means noncooperation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous. Consultations scheduled to begin at 2030
GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The response by the Security Coucil to
Iraq's complaints about turning over documents is likely to boil
down to what they determine to be full Iraqi cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   The United States and Britain _ which generally take the hardest
line against Baghdad _ say that cooperation hasn't been sufficient
regarding the chief inspector's request for documents about Iraq's
proscribed weapons programs.
	   But U.S. and British officials noted Monday that cooperation has
been forthcoming on the ground in Baghdad, where inspectors have
been back at work since last Wednesday.
	   Rather than threatening Baghdad anew with airstrikes over the
document issue, they are hinting that Baghdad's reluctance will
simply put off the day they conduct a review of Iraq's disarmament
efforts _ a move Baghdad hopes will ease sanctions.
	   The council was scheduled to discuss the situation Tuesday.
	   ``We're not getting the pattern of cooperation that we want in
order to get into the comprehensive review and move this whole
thing positively forward, which is after all what the whole council
wants,'' British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock said.
	   Iraq said Monday it was committed to cooperating with inspectors
but again balked at giving them documents which it says don't exist
or have no bearing on the work of chief U.N. inspector Richard
Butler.
	   Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Nizar Hamdoon, delivered an 18-page,
single-spaced letter to the council explaining Iraq's position in
technical detail about why the document requests from the U.N.
Special Commission chief were unfounded.
	   ``We don't have any more documents that we believe are related
to disarmament at this point,'' Hamdoon told reporters.
	   Forcing Baghdad to open up its archives, he added, ``is
something that may jeopardize the national security of Iraq.''
	   Iraq has used the sovereignty argument before in trying to keep
inspectors at bay, and its sympathizers on the Security Council _
particularly Russia and China _ have generally supported the
position.
	   Council members won't lift sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait until U.N. weapons experts have certified that
Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons, and the missiles
to deliver them, are destroyed.
	   Iraq has said it has destroyed all its banned weapons.
	   In the letter, Tariz Aziz accused Butler of using the issue of
the documents to undermine the comprehensive review, which the
council has said it won't conduct until Butler reports that he has
received full cooperation from Baghdad.
	   Baghdad sees a review as its best hope for a lifting of the
eight-year U.N. oil embargo.
	   ``Providing information as well as access for the inspectors on
the ground are important parts of what I think all the council
believes the definition of cooperation to be,'' said the U.S.
deputy ambassador, Peter Burleigh.
	   Iraq ended that cooperation first in August and then more fully
on Oct. 31 _ a day after the council released a preliminary outline
for the review that didn't refer to a lifting of the embargo as a
possible result.
	   Baghdad reversed its decisions on Nov. 14.
	   ``Iraq wants to cooperate because it wants to finish this whole
job of the work of UNSCOM and to move on forward to the
comprehensive review,'' and hopefully the lifting of the embargo,
Hamdoon said.
	   Aziz took particular aim at Butler's request for information on
its biological weapons program, which inspectors have long said was
far from sufficient, saying ``no meeting of mind is possible.
	   ``Given the gulf between the respective positions and the
different approaches adopted, we concluded that the requests of the
executive chairman are impossible to satisfy,'' Aziz wrote.
	   He also repeated conditions Iraq placed on the viewing of one
particular air force document detailing expended munitions that may
have been filled with chemical and biological agents in the 1980-88
war between Iraq and Iran.

Guamanians eager for closer association with United States
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to UPDATE with Clinton back in Washington. &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAGATNA, Guam (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton wrapped up a
tour of Asia with a brief stop in Guam, where thousands of people
in this U.S. territory greeted him with calls for a closer
association with the United States.
	   ``Let us be your legacy,'' cried Michael San Nicholas, one of
two local students who helped introduce Clinton at campaign-style
rally in a grassy park overlooking the emerald seas. He and others
made a pitch for a greater right to self-determination for the
island people.
	   The people of Guam are American citizens, but they cannot vote
in federal elections. It's hard to miss reminders of their pride.
``Where America's day begins'' is a favorite promotional line for
an island that is the westernmost U.S. territory, 8,902 miles
(14,325 kms) from Washington, D.C.
	   Robert Underwood, Guam's delegate to the U.S. House of
Representatives _ whose vote counts in committees but not on the
House floor _ told Clinton that his wife had jokingly threatened to
move off Guam before the 1996 election so she could vote for
Clinton. The problem, he said, was that she then would have been
ineligible to vote for her own husband.
	   ``No American citizen should have to choose between voting for
their president and voting for their representative in Congress,''
Underwood said to a roar of applause.
	   Gov. Carl Gutierrez echoed that sentiment.
	   ``We are nobody's constituency,'' he complained. ``Somebody
needs to stand up and do what is right by we Americans in Guam. ...
You are that person,'' he said, turning to Clinton.
	   The president came armed with a package of proposals meant to
help Guam's economy and to satisfy their demand for the return of
more land held by the U.S. military. But he made no promises on
Guam's political status, saying it was up to them to decide what
they wanted.
	   Clinton said Guam deserved a ``more effective self-government,''
and he spoke of the island's ``special membership in the American
family.''
	   ``Though we live on opposite sides of the Earth, ... we are all
Americans,'' Clinton said.
	   The president's plane made a refueling stop at Hickam Air Force
Base in Hawaii before returning to Washington early Monday evening.
Clinton met at Hickam with Adm. Joseph Preuher, commander of U.S.
Pacific Command.
	   Guam, with a population of 145,000, was ceded to the United
States in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. It is a possession
of, but not part of, the United States. In 1987, Guam asked
Washington to establish an interim political relationship called a
commonwealth. The proposal made no progress, so the Guam
Legislature set up a Dec. 12, 1999, referendum to vote on one of
three options: independence, free association or statehood.
	   After speaking, Clinton walked along a ropeline holding back a
wildly enthusiastic crowd that at times seemed to nearly pull the
president into its midst. He posed for pictures, shook hands,
cuddled a baby or two, accepted a few kisses from adoring women,
and apparently enjoyed it so much he did it again, doubling back
for a second dose of the adulation.
	   Clinton also paid tribute to the American servicemen killed in
the liberation of Guam from the Japanese in 1944.

Court orders 10-year jail term for farmer who killed disabled

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court ordered a Saskatchewan farmer to
serve at least 10 years in prison for killing his severely disabled
daughter, overturning a lenient sentence issued by a judge who said
the father had acted out of love.
	   The ruling against Monday Robert Latimer was the latest twist in
a five-year case that has fueled divisive public debate over the
ethics of mercy killing.
	   Latimer was convicted last year of second-degree murder for the
1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who suffered from
severe cerebral palsy.
	   The judge in the murder trial provoked a national furor by
refusing to impose the mandatory life sentence with no chance of
parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking a rarely used exemption, he
sentenced Latimer to serve one year in a provincial jail and a
second year confined to his farm.
	   On Monday, Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld a prosecution
appeal and ruled that the trial judge erred by refusing to impose
the mandatory sentence.
	   Latimer said he was disappointed by the ruling but preferred a
long jail term to the alternative of watching Tracy suffer
indefinitely.
	   Latimer, who had been free on bail, turned himself in to police
while his lawyer applied for continuation of bail while they sought
permission to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
	   Latimer, who has three other children, admitted to killing Tracy
by placing her in his pickup truck at the family farm and pumping
carbon monoxide into the cab. Tracy had suffered from a severe form
of cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk, talk or feed
herself.
	   The girl had endured operations on her back, hips and legs, and
her parents believed she faced the prospect of a lifetime of
painful surgery.
	   After convicting Latimer last year, jurors told the trial judge,
Ted Noble, they felt the mandatory sentence was too harsh and
recommended Latimer be paroled after one year.
	   Noble agreed with the jurors, saying the mandatory sentence
would in this case be cruel and unusual punishment.
	   ``The evidence establishes Mr. Latimer was motivated solely by
his love and compassion for Tracy and the need _ at least in his
mind _ that she should not suffer any more pain,'' Noble ruled.
	   Activists for the disabled were infuriated by Noble's ruling,
saying it sent a signal that the disabled have less of a right to
life than other people.
	   Latimer was first convicted in the case in 1994, but the Supreme
Court threw out that conviction because some jurors had been
improperly questioned by police.
	   Latimer received thousands of letters of support from people
across the country who saw him as a loving father who relieved his
daughter from a life of misery.
	   He had been free on his own recognizance pending the outcome of
the appeals of last year's trial.

Trial of 127 anti-government protesters fixed for February
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The trial of 127 people arrested
during a demonstration demanding the resignation of Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad will begin in February, news reports said Tuesday.
	   The protesters appeared in court on Oct. 21, four days after
their arrest during a huge rally in support of jailed opposition
leader Anwar Ibrahim, who is on trial for 10 counts of corruption
and illegal sex acts.
	   Anwar's Sept. 20 arrest sparked angry protests in Malaysia. It
also triggered international outrage when he appeared in court with
a black eye and body bruises. Anwar said he was blindfolded by
police and beaten until unconscious while in jail.
	   The trial of his supporters was initially set for May. But a new
judge appointed to hear the cases ruled on Monday that the date be
brought forward to Feb. 2 in ``public interest,'' the Star and New
Straits Times newspapers said.
	   Conviction for disobeying police orders carries a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a fine of 10,000 ringgit (dlrs
2,600).
	   Police have arrested people each time groups sympathetic to the
ousted deputy prime minister have organized protests. But
protesters have often been released without being formally charged.
	   During the latest protest on Saturday, police arrested at least
four Anwar supporters, including opposition leader Tian Chua, a
human rights activist who heads up an opposition coalition founded
after Anwar's arrest.
	   They were remanded to eight days in jail on Monday pending
investigations against them. No charges have been pressed against
Chua or the other three.

<TEXT>
	   DAHANIEH, Gaza Strip (AP) _ After years of negotiations,
fund-raising and hope, the Palestinian people are moving one step
closer to nationhood with the opening of Gaza International
Airport.
	   ``It's a glorious feeling of independence, a feeling that we are
open to the world,'' said Fawzi Tabil, a Palestinian watching while
workers painted white lines Monday on the tarmac in the southern
Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was expected to greet the first
arrival on Tuesday morning, a plane carrying government officials
from Cairo.
	   At half-hour intervals, six more festive flights were to arrive
from places including Morocco and Spain. The European Union, which
donated dlrs 38 million for equipment and training, is sending its
Mideast envoy in a special plane.
	   Palestine Airlines, with a small fleet that includes one Boeing
727, will begin direct flights to Jordan, Egypt and Morocco next
week. Civil aviation contracts with other carriers are in the works
and expanded service plans include weekly flights to Cyprus and
Japan.
	   On Wednesday, Arafat will fly on his presidential plane for the
first time out of his homeland to Paris to meet with French
President Jacques Chirac. Until now, Arafat has had drive to Egypt,
where his plane was kept, and fly on from there.
	   The airport opening had been held up for two years because of
disputes between Israel and Arafat's autonomous government over
Israel's security role.
	   Israel will have a say over who and what enters Gaza, but the
Israeli monitors will operate discretely, behind one-way mirrors,
as they do now at two other crossings into autonomous Palestinian
areas. Israel will not interfere with departures from the airport.
	   The airport protocol was signed last week, as part of the Wye
River peace deal signed last month by Israel and the Palestinians.
	   Only hours before the first flights were to arrive, the control
tower was still without controls, the check-in counter had no
computers and the runway was missing flood lights for night
landings.
	   Palestinian officials said most for the equipment was being held
up at the Israeli shipping port of Ashdod. The opening of their own
seaport is next on the Palestinian wish list and was promised under
the Wye agreement.
	   Other gear such as X-ray machines and electro-magnetic equipment
were being inspected for safety standards by Israel, said Tomer
Degani, a spokesman for the Israeli military government in Gaza.
	   Portable control equipment in a van was to guide Tuesday's
flights to a safe landing. The passengers were to be checked in at
the Rafah border crossing, a 10-minute bus ride away. Until the
floodlights arrive, there will be no night flights.
	   Despite its shortcomings, many Palestinians consider the airport
a big step toward independence. For those living in the small,
overcrowded Gaza Strip, which is ringed by the Mediterranean on one
side and by barbed wire on the other three, it may help ease the
ever-present feeling of being trapped.
	   In the past, Palestinians wanting to fly abroad needed
permission to enter Israel and fly out of the international airport
near Tel Aviv. Israel rarely granted permission, however, forcing
Palestinians to travel through Israeli-controlled land routes to
Egypt or Jordan to catch flights.
	   ``Now we will be able to travel without the Israeli procedures
that we usually must go through,'' said Khaled Salmeh, adding that
he plans to fly next month to Saudi Arabia for a pilgrimage to
Mecca, Islam's holiest site.
	   West Bank Palestinians, separated from Gaza by Israel, will
still need Israeli permission to travel to the Gaza airport.
	   Designed in an Oriental style with elaborate tiles imported from
Morocco, the airport has one passenger terminal, a VIP lounge and a
three-kilometer (two-mile)-long runway. A 1-meter (4-foot)-tall
poster of Arafat hangs from the control tower wall.
	   For the time being, Israelis will not be permitted to use the
airport because of security concerns. However, many believe Gaza
International will eventually rival Ben Gurion International
Airport near Tel Aviv.

Nicaraguan leaders put differences aside for disaster relief
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FILADELFO ALEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Hurricane Mitch tore apart buildings
and homes in Nicaragua, but it also brought together two bitter
political foes for the first time.
	   Conservative President Arnoldo Aleman and former president
Daniel Ortega, leader of the leftist Sandinista Front, have clashed
repeatedly in the past but pledged to put aside ideological
differences in relief and recovery efforts after a meeting Monday.
	   ``We must put aside pettiness, egoism and work for Nicaragua,''
Ortega said, after the two men met to set up six non-partisan
committees on recovery and rebuilding plans.
	   Flooding and mudslides caused by Mitch earlier this month killed
more than 3,000 people in Nicaragua and at least 10,000 throughout
Central America. The storm caused more than dlrs 1.5 billion in
damage in Nicaragua, according to preliminary estimates.
	   The two have feuded publicly since Aleman beat Ortega in
Nicaragua's 1996 presidential elections. Ortega has accused Aleman
of trying to reverse land reforms instituted under the Sandinista's
1979-1989 administration.
	   Aleman warned that the Central American nations have to work
quickly to put together reconstruction plans and funding for
projects, ``because when we are no longer in the news, we will be
left abandoned.''
	   Ortega will accompany the president on a Dec. 10 visit to
Washington to present recovery plans before international lending
agencies and other organizations.
	   Also Monday, El Salvador's Public Health Ministry declared a
nationwide health alert to stem the spread of cholera in the wake
of flooding caused by Mitch.
	   Of the five cases of cholera detected so far in El Salvador,
four involved Guatemalan citizens who had traveled to El Salvador.

MacGill and Waugh strike crucial blows before lunch
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Spinners Stuart MacGill and Mark
Waugh struck crucial blows to England's hopes of saving the first
cricket test as the visitors struggled to 108 for three at lunch on
the fifth day at the Gabba Tuesday.
	   England lost opener Mark Butcher and captain Alec Stewart in the
space of 20 deliveries after being comfortably placed on 96 for one
15 minutes before the break.
	   England resumed the day on 26 without loss after Mark Taylor had
set the arch-rivals 348 to win in a minimum of 99 overs.
	   Nasser Hussain, who twice hit Waugh for straight sixes, was
unbeaten on 28 and Graham Thorpe yet to score after facing one
ball.
	   After Mike Atherton had fallen to fast bowler Glenn McGrath for
the 11th time in eight tests, Butcher, who scored 40 runs in more
than two hours, and Hussain looked like taking England safely
through to lunch.
	   But leg spinner MacGill, having conceded 10 runs in his first
over, removed Butcher with a top spinner that went on to hit the
left hander on the back leg and trapped him leg before wicket.
	   Stewart, who had fallen to a MacGill full toss in the first
innings, lasted eight balls. He pushed forward to a Waugh off break
and was caught pad/bat by Ricky Ponting at silly point. Stewart
scored three runs.
	   England needs 240 runs in two sessions to take a 1-0 lead in the
five-match series.

Report: Special loans to Asia to total 5 trillion yen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan plans to extend special low-interest loans to
struggling Asian economies totaling about 5 trillion yen (dlrs 41
billion), a newspaper reported Tuesday.
	   The loans will be made on condition they directly benefit
Japanese companies operating in the region, the mass-circulation
Asahi Shimbun said. They aim to help promote growth in Asia as well
as provide economic relief to Japan, the paper said.
	   The newspaper quoted Trade Minister Kaoru Yosano, on a visit to
Thailand, as providing the figure for the loans, but the ministry
said officials were still working out details of the plan.
	   Japan will provide 1 trillion yen (dlrs 8.2 billion) to Asian
countries a year over a five-year period, the Asahi said. The paper
did not say which Asian countries were likely to receive the loans.
	   The government announced the Asian loan plan earlier this month
as part of its record 24 trillion yen (dlrs 196 billion) yen
economic stimulus package to lift Japan out of its recession, but
did not provide the amount of the loans.
	   Countries throughout Asia have been battling a severe economic
crisis triggered by the plunge of regional currencies last year.

UN report: Nearly 6 million more AIDS cases this year
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: For release at 1030 GMT, time set by source &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-AIDS-Statistics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The estimated number of people with the AIDS virus
will increase by nearly 6 million this year, with two-thirds of the
new cases developing in Africa, according to a U.N. report released
Tuesday that urged greater efforts to prevent the disease.
	   ``Every one of these new HIV infections represents a prevention
failure _ our collective failure,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, executive
director of the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS.
	   Some 33 million people around the world are infected with HIV,
two-thirds of them in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the report
by the U.N. program and the World Health Organization.
	   The report said that of the 5.8 million new infections, 70
percent were in sub-Saharan Africa. Ninety percent of the 590,000
new cases involving children under 15 were also found there.
	   The report also estimated that there would be 2 million AIDS
deaths in the region this year, four times the total for the rest
of the world.
	   ``In Botswana, Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, current
estimates show that between 20 percent and 25 percent of people
aged 15-49 are living with HIV or AIDS,'' the report said. The
report said 5.2 million people ages 15 to 49 worldwide had been
infected with HIV this year.
	   South Africa accounted for 10 percent of all the new cases of
HIV/AIDS this year, according to the report.
	   More than 10 percent of the adults are believed to be infected
in the Central African Republic, the Ivory Coast, Djibouti and
Kenya, the report said. It added that 8 percent of adults in all of
sub-Saharan Africa were living with the virus.
	   In Zimbabwe, spot checks at 25 sites that were not identified
found a high incidence of HIV infection among pregnant women. At 23
of those sites, the rate was 20 percent or more; only two of the
sites had rates below 10 percent, the report said.
	   Although combination drug therapies have reduced AIDS deaths in
North American and western Europe, the report said rates of new
infections have remained unchanged in recent years.
	   The report emphasized that the numbers were all provisional and
could not be compared directly with estimates in previous reports.
	   It estimated the number of people living with infections was:
sub-Saharan Africa, 22.5 million; North Africa and Middle East,
210,000; South and Southeast Asia, 6.7 million; East Asia and
Pacific, 560,000; Latin America, 1.4 million; Caribbean, 330,000;
Eastern Europe and Central Asia, 270,000; Western Europe, 500,000;
North America, 890,000; Australia and New Zealand, 12,000.
	   The estimated numbers of new infections: sub-Saharan Africa, 4
million; North Africa and Middle East, 19,000; South and Southeast
Asia, 1.2 million; East Asia and Pacific, 200,000; Latin America,
160,000; Caribbean, 45,000; Eastern Europe and Central Asia,
80,000; Western Europe, 30,000; North America 44,000; Australia and
New Zealand, 600.

Key weapon against AIDS: knowing just how many afflicted
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED by source until 1030 GMT. &QL; 
 &UR; With UN-AIDS &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ How many people worldwide are afflicted by AIDS?
Data is getting better all the time, but for many countries,
scientists can still only make estimates.
	   United Nations scientists say one thing is sure: the number of
people living with the virus has risen to its highest point. The
latest estimate of that number: 33.4 million people, according to
the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS.
	   But it's just an estimate.
	   ``We are most comfortable with the accuracy of that number, but
we could still be off by 20-25 percent in each direction,'' says
Dr. Bernhard Schwartlaender, a top expert in the program. But he
said the margin of error is constantly getting smaller.
	   Even countries with extremely accurate reporting systems, such
as Switzerland, may be 10 to 15 percent off in their estimates,
U.N. experts say, because many people with HIV never are tested
until they become ill.
	   Uganda, whose health statistics are among the most accurate in
Africa, would have an error margin at least double the Swiss rate,
while the U.S. accuracy would be much closer to Switzerland's.
	   In the early 1990s, U.N. experts assumed that infection rates
and patterns were the same for all countries in a region.
	   For Africa they took the best data, from Uganda, and projected
the numbers for the whole region. But while infection rates were
leveling off in Uganda, they continued to rise elsewhere,
especially populous countries like Nigeria and South Africa.
	   By last year, more data were available.
	   ``It became clear that that there were huge differences in the
way the epidemic was developing in different countries and
communities within the same region,'' according to a UNAIDS report
last June.
	   UNAIDS has abandoned the regional approach and started working
with each country, with more accurate figures and better knowledge
of the varying patterns of infection and survival. U.N.
statisticians run checks over time on developing countries'
figures, and sometimes work back from the number of AIDS deaths to
figure how many people must have infected at a previous time.
	   That improvement showed that ``global levels of infection in
1996 had been underestimated by over a third,'' UNAIDS said. New
infections were closer to 5.3 million, compared with the 3.1
million reported at the time,
	   For the report issued a year ago, UNAIDS recalculated and found
that previous estimates were ``correct for most of the world,'' but
way off for Africa.
	   The real number of people living with AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa
in 1996 was closer to 18.6 million, compared with the 14 million
previously estimated.
	   Determining the number of people who have died from AIDS is also
difficult. Many death certificates list only the immediate cause of
death, such as pneumonia, and don't mention AIDS. In some cultures,
the stigma attached to AIDS is great and familties try hard not to
have the cause of death known.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ When they go for the gold, Asia's
athletes won't just be chasing medals.
	   The regional economic crisis notwithstanding, many of the 42
countries sending more than 6,000 athletes to the Asian Games next
month in Bangkok will be paying lucrative awards to those who
strike gold, silver and bronze.
	   After all, national pride is at stake in the region's largest
Olympic-style competition. Some countries are even raising the
value of the awards above what they paid at the last Asian Games
four years ago in Hiroshima, Japan, when the region was booming.
	   ``It's THE big event for every participating Asian country, even
though we're battered by economic crisis,'' said Chairat Kamnuan,
vice president of Thailand's Olympic Committee. ``No one can afford
to lose face in the games.''
	   Chairat said that setting awards for winners is an important
stimulant for Asian athletes _ who don't have a future lined with
huge pro football or basketball contracts _ to do their very best.
	   The awards rank from several hundred to tens of thousands of
U.S. dollars. Extra benefits are promised for record-breaking
performances.
	   The biggest prizes appear to be offered by rich countries likely
to win the fewest medals. Singapore, for example, is offering
250,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 154,000) to any of its athletes
winning gold.
	   A silver will bring 125,000 Singapore dollars (dlrs 77,000) and
bronze 62,500 Singapore dollars (dlrs 38,500).
	   Hong Kong is offering as much as 500,000 Hong Kong dollars (dlrs
64,120), while Malaysia will pay individual gold medal winners
80,000 ringgit (dlrs 21,052). The Malaysians are hopeful of winning
the 100 meters.
	   South Korea hopes its athletes will collect 65 gold medals to
come in second after powerhouse China. With a rocky economy and
more medals to pay for, the Koreans will be giving modest gold
medal bonuses of 3 million won (dlrs 2,300). Silver and bronze
fetch nothing.
	   China aims to capture more than 100 golds and will offer 4,000
yuan (dlrs 480) for each one. In 1994, China won 137 _ or 41
percent _ of 337 gold medals at stake.
	   Yuan Weimin, a sports vice minister, said recently that China
plans to use the Asian Games to lay a foundation for the 2000
Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia.
	   Kuwait, home of the Olympic Council of Asia, which is overseeing
Bangkok's organization of the games, is promising every gold
medalist a new car. Kuwait hopes to win medals in fencing, judo,
taekwondo, karate, soccer, shooting and athletics.
	   As the host, Thailand says it cannot let the worst recession in
decades affect the spirit of athletes who have been trained for
years for this competition.
	   The government is doubling financial incentives from what was on
offer four years ago, offering a gold medalist 1 million baht (dlrs
27,500). A silver will fetch 300,000 baht (dlrs 8,300) and a bronze
200,000 baht (dlrs 5,500).
	   Jurin Laksanavisith, deputy chairman of the Bangkok Asian Games
Organizing Committee, said the government has allocated 34 million
baht (nearly dlrs 1 million) for the awards. Eleven golds are hoped
for.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has said that additional
contributions can come from the national lottery office if needed.
	   ``I'm not concerned anymore about the preparations for the
games, but the performance of the athletes,'' Chuan said recently.
``We need to give them moral support.''

Back home: Brian Jordan signs five-year deal with Braves
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL NEWBERRY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The Atlanta Braves, changing the face of their
team after another postseason flop, agreed Monday to a dlrs 40
million, five-year contract with outfielder Brian Jordan.
	   Jordan, who played for the St. Louis Cardinals this year and
became a free agent, also was courted by the New York Mets, New
York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles.
	   But, when the Braves met his asking price, he couldn't resist
the urge to play in his adopted home. Jordan was with the NFL's
Atlanta Falcons from 1989-91 and still lives in suburban Stone
Mountain.
	   ``That was the deciding factor,'' he said after an evening news
conference at Turner Field, where he was flanked by wife, Pam, and
their children, daughter Brianna, 7, and son, Bryson, 4. ``I wanted
to be here with my kids. They're at an age where daddy needs to be
home with them.''
	   The Braves signed Jordan less than two weeks after making a big
deal with Cincinnati. Atlanta sent pitcher Denny Neagle, right
fielder Michael Tucker and a minor-leaguer to the Reds for All-Star
second baseman Bret Boone and pitcher Mike Remlinger.
	   By trading Tucker, the Braves created a gaping void in the
outfield and immediately set their sights on Jordan. In the final
season of a dlrs 6.5 million, two-year contract, he hit .316 with
25 homers for the Cardinals, both career highs. He also had 91 RBIs
and 17 stolen bases.
	   The deal calls for him to get a dlrs 3 million signing bonus,
dlrs 4 million next season, dlrs 7 million in 2000, dlrs 8.5
million in 2001, dlrs 6 million in 2002 and dlrs 9 million in 2003.
	   Atlanta has a dlrs 10.5 million option for 2004 with a dlrs 2.5
million buyout. If the option is exercised, Jordan would get dlrs
48 million over six seasons. There are no trade limitations in the
deal.
	   The Braves had the highest payroll in the National League this
year (dlrs 61.8 million) and already have committed more than dlrs
66 million for next season with only 13 signed players.
	   The 31-year-old Jordan gives Atlanta another potent bat in a
lineup that already produced a franchise-record 215 homers. The
Braves now have six players _ Andres Galarraga (44), Javy Lopez
(34), Chipper Jones (34), Andruw Jones (31), Boone (24) and Jordan
_ who eclipsed 20 homers in 1998.
	   All six of those players also had at least 90 RBIs, giving the
Braves a fearsome group of hitters to go along with a pitching
staff that still ranks among the best in the baseball despite
losing 16-game winner Neagle.
	   During an unprecedented seven straight postseason appearances
since 1991, the Braves have won only one World Series. They were
beaten the last two seasons in the National League championship
series, losing to San Diego in six games this year.

OPEC faces limited options at Vienna meeting

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Facing oil prices nearing 11-year lows,
OPEC members have gathered in Vienna with no clear solution on how
to address the worldwide oil supply glut.
	   Extending production cuts agreed upon in June ``is one of the
possibilities,'' said the president of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri, who is
also oil minister of the United Arab Emirates.
	   It's unclear how many of the ministers in attendance for the
year-end meeting beginning Wednesday will support the extension.
Several OPEC countries are coping with ballooning budget deficits _
a direct result of the drop in oil income.
	   Saudi Arabia's oil minister Ali Naimi, whose country is the
biggest producer in the 11-member organization, refused to comment
on OPEC's options. But a source close to the Saudi contingent said
OPEC members need to respect existing cuts, pointing out the group
was now producing 600,000 barrels a day more than it should,
contributing to an already glutted market.
	   Additional production cuts were unlikely, the source said.
	   Still Kuwait's oil minister Saud Nasser Al-Sabah appeared to
support the idea of more oil cuts, saying, ``We've been very clear
on this.'' Kuwait has vocally supported more cuts in the past.
	   The global oil glut, caused by a decision last winter to boost
production by 10 percent plus a mild North American weather and
lower demand from weaker Asian economies, spell ``a mess'' for
OPEC, said Leo Drollas, chief economist at the Center for Global
Energy Studies in London.
	   A big problem facing the ministers is that a 2.6 million
barrel-a-day production cut the cartel agreed to in June has failed
to lift prices.
	   OPEC oil prices averaged dlrs 12.33 a barrel in the third
quarter, compared to dlrs 18.03 a year ago.
	   On the New York Mercantile Exchange Monday, the contract for
light sweet crude to be delivered in January fell 44 cents to dlrs
12.45 a barrel. Refined products were also down, with December
heating oil falling .79 cent to 34.29 cents a gallon, and December
unleaded regular gasoline dropping 1.42 cents to 36.78 cents a
gallon.
	   Natural gas to be delivered in December fell 6.6 cents per 1,000
cubic feet (28 cubic meters), closing at dlrs 2.097. January Brent
futures trading closed at dlrs 11.74 a barrel in London on Monday.
	   But OPEC's biggest predicament lies beyond the cartel's control
_ the usually oil-hungry world just doesn't seem to need or want as
much oil as it used to.
	   The drop in demand means less income for the OPEC countries,
leading to predictions of tighter spending next year.
	   Saudi Arabia, which produces 8 million barrels a day and is
OPEC's largest producer, depends on oil revenues for 70 percent of
its income. This year, those revenues are expected to fall 27
percent below the country's target, bringing in dlrs 25.3 billion,
the Saudi British Bank forecast in a report issued Monday.
	   If OPEC is to succeed in bringing prices higher, it must at
least extend June's production cuts until the end of 1999. They
currently are due to expire in the middle of next year.
	   Without that extension, prices would likely fall further. ``The
market won't take it lightly,'' Drollas warned.
	   In an unusual move and reflecting its sense of crisis, Algeria
on Monday called for heads of state of OPEC countries to meet to
tackle directly the low prices. The United Arab Emirates said it
supports the idea, though other delegates were more skeptical.
	   Meanwhile, OPEC is still struggling with members who don't abide
by their quotas. Venezuela and Indonesia are among those producing
more than they should.
	   Tighter compliance is ``an absolute imperative,'' Drollas said.
``The logic is clear. You can't talk about further cuts if you
can't comply so far.''

French national charged with drug offenses

	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ A French resident of Indonesia has been
charged with importing 3 million Australian dollars (1.92 million
US dlrs) worth of amphetamines into Australia, police said Tuesday.
	   Cristoph Bourdy, 40, was arrested by federal police on Monday at
Sydney airport. He reserved his plea to charges of importing a
prohibited drug when he appeared in Central Local Court on Tuesday,
pending a forensic analysis of the substance alleged to have been
found in his baggage.
	   Police say Bourdy was carrying 3.3 kilograms (7.2 pounds) of
amphetamine powder and 1 kilogram (2.2 pounds) of amphetamine
tablets.
	   Bourdy, who lives in Bali and works as an advertising designer
for a magazine, had arrived in Australia on a plane from Japan,
police said.
	   He did not apply for bail. The matter was adjourned to Dec. 22.

Sampras begins quest to break No. 1 record
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous; will be updated after Sampras match, which
starts 1300 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOVER, Germany (AP) _ Pete Sampras knows Jimmy Connors won't
be rooting for him.
	   He also knows America won't be watching (and may not be caring)
as Sampras begins his quest for a record he feels may never be
touched again _ finishing as No. 1 for six years in a row.
	   ``It's unfortunate, but it's hard to sell Americans on tennis,''
Sampras said on the eve of the ATP World Championship, the dlrs 3.5
million season-ending event of the top eight players of the year.
	   ``I can't worry about it too much, but it's a once-a-lifetime
achievement.''
	   Sampras has finished the last five years as No. 1 in the world,
a record he shares with Connors, the fellow American who did it
from 1974 to 1978.
	   ``I'm sure he is not rooting for me,'' Sampras said.
	   ``He was a great player, but he wasn't really my role model. Our
personalities are too different.''
	   Only 33 points separate Sampras from Marcelo Rios on the
computer rankings. To remain ahead of Rios, Sampras basically has
to keep pace with the Chilean. Rios needs to win at least two
round-robin matches to have a shot at No. 1. Two players from each
group advance to the semifinals.
	   ``I am not putting too much pressure on myself,'' Sampras said.
``The pressure is on both of us, but I've done it five years and he
still has to do it.''
	   ``It's a record that's really hard to achieve. It's rare that
you have something in your hands that may stay for eternity. It
would be an achievement that I feel may never be touched,'' Sampras
said.
	   ``But the Grand Slam record is something I put above
everything,'' said Sampras, who has 11 Grand Slam title, one short
of the record of Roy Emerson.
	   Although he won Wimbledon for the fifth time this year, Sampras
has had a relatively modest season by his standards, winning only
three more titles.
	   Rios, who at 22 is five years younger than Sampras, on the other
hand leads the tour with seven titles. The Chilean has already held
the No. 1 spot twice briefly this year. This is his first
appearance at he World Championship.
	   Sampras opens the tournament Tuesday against Yevgeny Kafelnikov,
the Russian who he beat in last year's final to win his fourth
title at the elite tournament. Other players in Sampras' group are
Karol Kucera and Carlos Moya, the French Open champion who beat
Sampras in last year's round-robin.
	   Rios has Andre Agassi, Alex Corretja and Tim Henman in his
group.
	   While the draw left Agassi outside Sampras' group, back spasms
are threatening his appearance in the event he won in 1990.
	   ``I went to hit a shot and managed to get a little stuck on the
court and fell down,'' Agassi said. ``I still remain hopeful but if
I don't take care of it right now it's going to get worse, so I
need to treat it.''
	   ``I'll certainly do everything I can to play here.''
	   Agassi, a former No. 1, has surged back to No. 4 after falling
as low as No. 141 last year.

Dollar, stocks higher in early trading

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Share prices in Tokyo soared Tuesday morning
following a new record high on Wall Street overnight. The U.S.
dollar was higher against the yen.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 211.85 points,
or 1.43 percent, to 14,991.79 to close the morning session.
Earlier, the index had climbed briefly above 15,000 points for the
first time since Sept. 9.
	   Markets were closed for a national holiday on Monday. On Friday,
the Nikkei had gained 425.48 points, or 2.96 percent.
	   The dollar bought 121.42 yen, up 1.26 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and also above its New York level of 120.99 yen late Monday.
	   In New York on Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose
214.72, closing at a new record high of 9374.27 points, boosted by
news of possible takeovers of Bankers Trust by Deutsche Bank and of
Netscape Communications by America Online. The Dow's previous
record was 9337.97 set in July.
	   The rally continued in Tokyo.
	   ``Shares are rising as expected on the strength of New York
shares,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general manager of the stock
division at Tokyo Securities.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 18.38 points, or 1.63 percent to 1,149.12. The TOPIX
had climbed 26.74 points, or 2.42 percent, on Friday.
	   Trading in futures and options on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was
suspended Tuesday morning after a computer malfunction. Officials
did not know when trading would resume.
	   On the foreign exchange market, Japanese institutional investors
were snapping up dollars for yen following dollar-bullish sentiment
carried over from overseas trading Monday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.910 percent from Friday's finish of 0.900
percent, driving its price down to 107.98 yen from 107.92.

Three days of intense debate highlight division on council
</HEADLINE>
expansion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ In an indication of the rancorous issue of
enlarging the Security Council, U.N. delegates spent three days
debating a procedural issue before adopting a one-paragraph
resolution Monday.
	   Without a vote, the U.N. General Assembly decided that a
two-thirds majority of U.N. member states was required to pass any
resolution on council expansion.
	   Though seemingly innocuous, the issue nevertheless prompted
heated discussion in the assembly, where over 60 delegates gave
their thoughts on expanding the council with arguments about
fairness to smaller states and violations of the U.N. charter.
	   The debate boiled down to whether a two-thirds majority of U.N.
member states or merely those present and voting should be
required.
	   Security Council expansion, to be fair, is the most crucial of
all U.N. proposals on reform since it concerns enlarging the most
powerful U.N. decision-making body.
	   But the debate has become hopelessly mired in regional and
individual politics and has barely budged from where it began some
five years ago.
	   The council has 15 members, five of which are permanent and have
veto power: the United States, Britain, France, China and Russia.
Ten non-permanent members rotate in two-year stints.
	   Virtually everyone agrees the council should be expanded to
better represent the membership of the United Nations, which is
dominated by the developing world.
	   Views differ widely, however, on how many seats should be added,
who should get them, whether they should be permanent or rotating _
and most divisive, whether they should have the veto.

	   HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) _ A prosecutor told Bermuda's Supreme
Court that a Canadian teen-ager who was raped and killed was
tortured and stabbed 16 times before being left to die in a patch
of woodland.
	   Solicitor-General William Pearce said Monday that forensic
evidence showed that 16-year-old Rebecca Middleton of Belleville,
Ontario, was held down before the frenzied knife attack that ended
her life on July 3, 1996.
	   Justis Smith, a native of Bermuda, is charged with the
premeditated murder of Middleton. If convicted, Smith, who has
pleaded innocent, could be sentenced to death by hanging.
	   Middleton was killed while vacationing in Bermuda with a high
school friend. Another man, Kirk Mundy, has already pleaded guilty
to being an accessory after the fact in the death and is serving a
five-year jail sentence.
	   There was some speculation last week the trial would be
postponed to avoid seating a jury through the Christmas holidays.
It went ahead as scheduled, however.
	   Smith's parents have hired a British lawyer, John Perry, who was
to present his arguments on Tuesday.
	   Pearce spoke on the long-delayed opening day of the trial, at
which the victim's parents, David and Cynthia Middleton, were
present.
	   Middleton had flown to Bermuda with another a friend, Jasmin
Meens, whose father lived on one of the Bermuda islands.
	   The girls tried to find a taxi after a rained-out concert when
they were offered rides by some men on motorcycles. Hitchhiking is
not considered a dangerous practice in Bermuda, which prides itself
on a low crime rate with an average of three murders a year for the
last decade.
	   But the two girls were separated and hours later Rebecca's body
was found at the side of a quiet road.
	   Smith and Mundy, ages 17 and 21 at the time, were arrested and
charged with the teen's murder.
	   At his trial in October 1996, Mundy, a native of Jamaica,
testified he and Middleton had consensual sex in a park just before
she was killed.
	   ``He heard her scream repeatedly `No!' and said it looked like
Smith was punching her in the face,'' said Crown prosecutor Khamisa
Tokunbo.
	   The trial, expected to last six weeks, will call about 66
witnesses.

	   BEAVER CREEK, Colorado (AP) _ Patrik Jaerbyn of Sweden posted
the fastest second run Monday to win the inaugural Visa Super
Series giant slalom against a European-heavy field of racers at
Beaver Creek resort
	   Jaerbyn, who competed in two World Cup races over the weekend in
Park City, Utah, finished with two-run time of 1 minute, 49.66
seconds. Italy's Walter Girardi was second in 1:50.53.
	   Dane Spencer of Boise, Idaho, was third (1:50.62) and Thomas
Vonn of Newburgh, New York, fourth (1:50.81) to lead four U.S.
skiers into the top 10. Swiss veteran Urs Kaelin, who has won three
Olympic or World Championships silver medals in GS, was fifth with
more than two dozen Europeans racing.
	   ``Dane's been skiing well and he's been close to scoring points
in two World Cup races. This was another solid performance for him
and for Thomas,'' said U.S. Head Coach Bill Egan.
	   First-run leader Casey Puckett had problems on the bottom of the
afternoon course and dropped to sixth place in the field of 131
racers while hometown favorite Sacha Gros was eighth. Erik Schlopy
of Park City, who retired from World Cup skiing after competing in
the 1994 Olympics, started 131st and was 37th.

Tourism sector helps economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ With tourist arrivals up by more than 6
percent, officials expect Thailand's crisis-ridden economy to be
buoyed by 272 billion baht (dlrs 7.5 billion) in foreign exchange
earnings this year.
	   In a release received Tuesday, the government's Tourism
Authority of Thailand said international tourist arrivals through
the third quarter of 1998 totalled 5,610,000, an increase of 6.38
percent over the same period last year.
	   The weak Thai baht, which makes the country cheap for most
foreigners, as well as political turmoil in competitive
destinations like Malaysia and Indonesia have helped spur the
industry.
	   The government said arrivals from China, France, Germany, the
United Kingdom, India, the United States and Australia increased
significantly over the first three quarters compared to the same
period in 1997.
	   Thailand expects 7.7 million foreign tourists by the end of
1998, compared to 7.2 million last year.
	   ``The tourism sector has been performing well as we are about to
wrap up the first half of Amazing Thailand 1998-1999,'' said the
agency's chief Seree Wangpaichitr, referring to a major, two-year
tourist promotion campaign.
	   Popular destinations, like the resort islands of Phuket and
Samui, are virtually booked solid for the next few months.

Death toll from floods in central Vietnam reach 106
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Central Vietnam's death toll from flooding
caused by Typhoon Dawn has risen to 106 in one of the country's
poorest areas, local officials said Tuesday.
	   Truong Nhat Thanh of the Central Floods and Storm Control
Committee said Tuesday that an estimated 1,200 houses were
destroyed, 399,000 homes were flooded and damage was estimated at
420 billion dong (dlrs 30 million).
	   The Quang Nam provincial floods and storm control committee said
more than 1,000 vehicles were stranded on Highway 1.
	   Some parts of the country's main artery were open to through
traffic early Tuesday morning, while others were still covered by
water up to 0.8 meters (2.5 feet) deep.
	   Vietnam Railways authorities said it would take at least a week
to resume full north-south service, which was cut off Friday and
still contained a 60-kilometer (37-mile) break Tuesday.
	   A bridge in Quang Nam province was washed away Friday, and many
sections of track were under water until Monday. Limited service
was being operated, and officials hope to begin bus shuttle service
around the break as soon as Highway 1 is cleared. Work will start
on a new bridge when the water level drops.
	   Provincial floods and storm control committees said 24 people
died in Danang, 21 in Quang Nam, 19 in Thua Thien Hue, 11 in Quang
Ngai, nine in Binh Dinh, eight in Phu Yen, six in Khanh Hoa, five
in Quang Binh and three in Daklak.
	   The death toll was expected to rise as more reports trickled in
from isolated areas.
	   Two previous floods in the region over the last month killed 69
people and caused dlrs 22 million in damage. Until mid-August, the
area was suffering from its worst drought in at least half a
century.

Indonesian minister says unrest won't affect IMF relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's top economic minister said
recent riots in Jakarta won't affect the International Monetary
Fund's commitment to his country, a local newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   The daily Bisnis Indonesia quoted Coordinating Minister for the
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita as rejecting
speculation that the IMF might change its commitment.
	   ``I've never heard of such a thing,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   The IMF has organized a dlrs 43 billion international bailout
package to help the world's fourth most populous nation overcome
its worst economic crisis in more than 30 years.
	   The IMF itself has pledged a dlrs 11.3 billion loan to
Indonesia.
	   On Sunday 14 people were killed in an ethnically and religiously
charged riots in Jakarta. Muslim mobs burned or ransacked at 11
Christian churches.
	   Earlier this month as many as 17 people died in unrest and
student protests. The dead included at least nine students who were
killed when troops and police opened fire on protesters trying to
march on the Parliament.
	   Ginandjar, who has led Indonesia's dealings with the IMF, was
optimistic that the next dlrs 1 billion disbursement wouldn't be
affected by the trouble.
	   The next loan disbursement is scheduled for Thursday.

Court orders 10-year jail term for farmer who killed disabled
</HEADLINE>
daughter &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Latimer released on bail &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos CPT122-123 &QL; 
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ An appeals court ordered a Saskatchewan farmer to
serve at least 10 years in prison for killing his severely disabled
daughter, overturning a lenient sentence issued by a judge who said
the father had acted out of love.
	   The ruling Monday against Robert Latimer was the latest twist in
a five-year case that has fueled divisive public debate over the
ethics of mercy killing.
	   Latimer was convicted last year of second-degree murder for the
1993 killing of his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who suffered from
severe cerebral palsy.
	   The judge in the murder trial provoked a national furor by
refusing to impose the mandatory life sentence with no chance of
parole for 10 years. Instead, invoking a rarely used exemption, he
sentenced Latimer to serve one year in a provincial jail and a
second year confined to his farm.
	   On Monday, Saskatchewan's Court of Appeal upheld a prosecution
appeal and ruled that the trial judge erred by refusing to impose
the mandatory sentence.
	   Latimer said he was disappointed by the ruling but preferred a
long jail term to the alternative of watching Tracy suffer
indefinitely.
	   Latimer, who had been free on bail, turned himself in to police,
but he was released a few hours later and will be allowed to remain
free pending a decision by the Supreme Court of Canada on whether
it will consider an appeal of Monday's ruling.
	   Latimer, who has three other children, admitted to killing Tracy
by placing her in his pickup truck at the family farm and pumping
carbon monoxide into the cab. Tracy had suffered from a severe form
of cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk, talk or feed
herself.
	   The girl had endured operations on her back, hips and legs, and
her parents believed she faced the prospect of a lifetime of
painful surgery.
	   After convicting Latimer last year, jurors told the trial judge,
Ted Noble, they felt the mandatory sentence was too harsh and
recommended Latimer be paroled after one year.
	   Noble agreed with the jurors, saying the mandatory sentence
would in this case be cruel and unusual punishment.
	   ``The evidence establishes Mr. Latimer was motivated solely by
his love and compassion for Tracy and the need _ at least in his
mind _ that she should not suffer any more pain,'' Noble ruled.
	   Activists for the disabled were infuriated by Noble's ruling,
saying it sent a signal that the disabled have less of a right to
life than other people.
	   Latimer was first convicted in the case in 1994, but the Supreme
Court threw out that conviction because some jurors had been
improperly questioned by police.
	   Latimer received thousands of letters of support from people
across the country who saw him as a loving father who relieved his
daughter from a life of misery.
	   He had been free on his own recognizance pending the outcome of
the appeals of last year's trial.

Report: Singapore to cut unhealthy sulfur emissions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore will cut sulfur emissions from
vehicle and industrial fuel because levels of these unhealthy air
pollutants exceed international standards, a newspaper reported
Tuesday.
	   Certain sulfur by-products of diesel fuel have been linked to
respiratory and heart disease, and Singapore's level of these tiny
particles exceeds new health guidelines in the United States, said
The Straits Times.
	   The government is also targeting sulfur dioxide emissions as
part of an overall strategy to reduce air pollution in Singapore,
where a number of petrochemical processing facilities are
stationed.
	   Singapore's environment ministry has been meeting with oil
companies over how to reduce the sulfur level in diesel from 0.3
percent to 0.05 percent, the report added.
	   The United States, European Union, Hong Kong, Japan and Taiwan
have all lowered their diesel sulfur level to 0.05 percent in past
years, said the newspaper.

Japan's Sanwa Bank to sell U.S. subsidiary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Sanwa Bank Ltd., a major Japanese city bank,
announced Tuesday it will sell its U.S. business credit unit to
Boston-based Fleet Financial Group Inc.
	   Sanwa said in a statement it will sell all of shares of Sanwa
Business Credit Corporation, which specializes in leases and
asset-based lending, as it streamlines operations to prepare for
Japan's ``Big Bang'' financial deregulation measures.
	   The bank said the measures, aimed at invigorating the economy by
opening markets to greater competition, have led it to focus on
``strategically selected'' business areas, such as the retail
business.
	   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
	   Many Japanese financial institutions have been retreating from
overseas business as Japan's recession and financial turbulence
abroad force them to downsize.

Rodman files for annulment of marriage to Carmen Electra
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ORANGE, California, (AP) _ Basketball bad boy Dennis Rodman
filed annulment papers Monday to end his nine-day marriage to
television actress and ex-Playboy model Carmen Electra, a
spokeswoman for the bride said.
	   ``Carmen and Dennis spoke several days ago and mutually agreed
(to end the marriage),'' said Electra's publicist, Cindy Guagengi.
	   Details on the filing in Orange County family court were not
available after business hours Monday. Rodman has a home in nearby
Newport Beach.
	   The couple married Nov. 14 in Las Vegas, but Rodman's agent,
Dwight Manley, immediately expressed misgivings.
	   ``Obviously, anyone that would marry somebody that was
intoxicated to the point that they couldn't speak or stand had
ulterior motives of some sort,'' Manley said two days after the
wedding.
	   But the Chicago Bulls star said afterward he was indeed in love
and apologized ``for any false statements given on my behalf
regarding my marriage to Carmen Electra.''
	   Neither Rodman nor his agent could be reached for comment
Monday.
	   Rodman and Electra have been dating since the spring.
	   Electra, who has bared all in Playboy, left ``Baywatch'' this
month for another beach show, ``Hyperion Bay.''

Six students arrested in death of student
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ESTES THOMPSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RALEIGH, North Carolina (AP) _ Three female college gymnasts
were charged with alcohol violations Monday in connection with a
party that resulted in the death of a student.
	   That brought the total number of North Carolina State students
charged in the case to nine. Except for one student, all are
athletes at the school, including football players and wrestlers.
	   Among the three reserve football players charged Sunday was
David Stringer, son of Rutgers women's basketball coach C. Vivian
Stringer. His cousin, Korey Stringer, plays for the Minnesota
Vikings.
	   The charges were filed after Neil Davis Jr., a 21-year-old
junior from Fayetteville, was shot with his own gun during a
struggle with wrestler Clyde Blunt, 20, of Modesto, California.,
early Sunday, police said. Blunt, the defending ACC heavyweight
champion, was charged with involuntary manslaughter.
	   The gymnasts, Rebecca Ann Geiger, 21, Jennifer Erin Sommer, 20,
and Maggie Elaine Haney, 20, were charged with selling malt
beverages to a person under 21 and selling malt beverages without a
valid state permit. Their house was the scene of the party Davis
targeted with gunshots, police said.
	   Investigators said Davis fired several shots from a 9 mm pistol

nicked wrestler George Cintron in the shoulder, but he didn't
require treatment.
	   Davis was shot in the stomach during a struggle with Blunt, who
went to Davis' house with five other athletes after the shots were
fired, Raleigh police Capt. Michael Longmire said.
	   Longmire said the gun was in Davis' possession when the shot was
fired about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. Davis died about six hours later.

Following Dow's lead, Asian stock markets open with big gains
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By THOMAS WAGNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO, Japan _ Reacting to Wall Street's resurrection from last
summer's steep decline, Asia's top three stock markets followed
suit by opening sharply higher Tuesday.
	   But that didn't leave everyone optimistic. In fact, some
analysts said that even though the region's stock markets are
enjoying rebounds, too, their darkest days were so bad that
volatility and profit-taking remain significant risks.
	   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average surged 2.3 percent
to a new high on Monday, capping a nearly 2,000-point rebound from
last summer's plummet.
	   Extending a nearly non-stop rally that began less than two
months ago, the average rose 214.72 points to 9,374.27, topping the
July 17 record of 9,337.97.
	   The return to record terrain followed four months of volatility
that took the Dow as low as 7,400 on Sept. 1, and to 7,467 on Oct.
8, the day the market's recovery began.
	   Before the comeback started, it had seemed that Asia's financial
turmoil, and its spread around the world, would send Wall Street to
its first losing year since 1990. Now, several major indexes are
poised to extend an unprecedented streak of three straight years
with gains of 20 percent or more.
	   In Tokyo the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose
211.85 points, or 1.43 percent, to 14,991.79 during Tuesday's
morning session. Earlier in the day, the index had climbed briefly
above the psychologically significant 15,000-point level for the
first time since Sept. 9.
	   ``Shares are rising as expected on the strength of New York
shares,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, the general manager of the stock
division at Tokyo Securities.
	   Hope also is growing that Japan will expand its rescue efforts
beyond the dlrs 196 billion plan it announced this month in an
effort to help an economy with its worst recession in 50 years.
	   In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index was up 187.34
points, or 1.8 percent, on Tuesday morning, to 10,701.87. That jump
came atop Monday's gain of 2.7 percent.
	   Jason Tang, a broker at South China Brokerage Ltd., said the
rally was mostly due to the Dow's rise and gains by the Hong Kong
market's biggest listed company, banking giant HSBC Holdings PLC.
	   In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index opened 2
percent, or 27.62 points higher, to 1,404.56, an improvement that
broke through the closely watched 1,400-point plateau.
	   One trader called the gain a ``knee-jerk reaction'' to the surge
in New York, and warned that profit-taking had already begun to set
in and could increase during the day. Like many market analysts in
Singapore, he spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Across Asia, stock markets have been enjoying significant
recoveries from the striking lows they had reached since the Asia
financial crisis hit about 17 months ago.
	   Tokyo's Nikkei has increased nearly 12 percent since it fell to
13,406.39, on Sept. 30, its lowest point in 12 years. Singapore's
key index, which dropped to a low of 800.27 on Sept. 4, has since
risen 72 percent to close at 1376.94 on Nov. 23.
	   Since falling to a five-year low of 6,660.42 on August 13, Hong
Kong's benchmark Hang Seng has gained 58 percent.
	   The markets in Asia's three hardest-hit countries _ Thailand,
South Korea and Indonesia _ also have improved, some even more
dramatically than those of Singapore and Hong Kong.
	   But that also has left analysts warning that the region's
economic outlook just can't justify these gains, and trying to
figure just how long the rebound can last.

Large block of PLDT shares sold, suggesting First Pacific buy-in
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A large block of Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. shares was sold Tuesday to an undisclosed
buyer, fueling speculation that Hong Kong-based First Pacific Co.
has completed its buy-in of PLDT.
	   Dealers said ING Barings' Manila office handled the transaction,
involving at least 10.9 million PLDT shares worth around 11.5
billion pesos (dlrs 290 million).
	   First Pacific's local unit, Metro Pacific, was scheduled to hold
a news conference later Tuesday, and analysts expected it to
announce an agreement has been reached to acquire a sizable stake
in PLDT, the Philippines' largest telecommunications company.
	   The shares handled by ING Barings account for around 9 percent
of PLDT, roughly equivalent to the stake held by the family of PLDT
president Antonio Cojuangco.
	   Cojuangco's family holds its stake in PLDT through a 44 percent
interest in Philippine Telecommunications Investment Corp., the
single largest shareholder in PLDT with a 21 percent shareholding.
	   First Pacific earlier said it had acquired shares of PLDT
through the stock market and was negotiating with Cojuangco to
increase that holding. First Pacific usually seeks control of
companies it buys into.
	   In Hong Kong, First Pacific shares were suspended from trading
Tuesday at the company's request pending a company announcement,
the stock exchange said.
