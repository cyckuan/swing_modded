   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;

<P>
   GLOBAL-ECON-I (Undated) _ It is still not clear that the
financial upheavals, which began in Thailand in July 1997, will
ever damage the United States. But the collapse of Brazil's
currency in January and the jolt that it brought to markets
worldwide underscored the continuing risks of ``the most serious
financial crisis in a half a century,'' as Clinton called it in his
State of the Union address. This series of four articles is a
narrative of the worldwide financial crisis that over the last 20
months has toppled some governments and hobbled others. The crisis
illustrates how globalization increasingly stitches lives all over
the world into a single economic quilt. In the new economic
landscape that has emerged in recent years, the pool of
international investments has grown to dwarf the sums that
governments can muster, and money zips around the globe far faster
than ever before. The result is a world more prosperous; but also,
perhaps, a bit more wobbly. By Nicholas D. Kristof with Edward
Wyatt.

LAKERS AGAIN FOLD IN THE STRETCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Six games into the sprint, it's obvious the Lakers
haven't changed enough to beat the Utah Jazz and reach the NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   And even if they could somehow get past Utah and face the
Eastern Conference's expected representative, Indiana, the Lakers
would lose.
</P>
<P>
   For the second straight Sunday, the Forum played host to the
NBA's marquee matchup, and just as they did a week ago, the Lakers
melted in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Call it experience, veteran leadership or whatever else you
want. The Lakers still lost 101-99 to fall to 0-2 in games that
really, really mattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost against the two experienced teams, I still
think we're a better team,'' Lakers guard Derek Harper said. ``It's
having the resolve to hang in there, and we haven't found the
resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, who failed to record a double-double for the first
time this season, had a chance to find the Lakers' resolve, not to
mention make amends for a less-than-stellar outing, but couldn't do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant (18 points, two rebounds) pulled the Lakers within 100-99
with a 3-pointer with 4.8 seconds left, but after Rik Smits made a
free throw, Bryant's deep 3-pointer from straight away rattled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that comes in here is coming in here thinking they
have an opportunity to win the game down the stretch,'' Bryant
said. ``That's exactly what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal mustered up some genie magic to heal his aching
abdomen, or groin, depending on who's doing the talking, to
dominate the middle with 36 points and 17 rebounds. Not that they
mattered much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individually, we have a lot of guys who can go out and score
points and have the game be all about them,'' Lakers forward Rick
Fox said. ``But then we're not going to win. It can only get worse.
Last year we were unselfish: Move the ball, take the open shot. If
it was open you shoot, or you pass it. We haven't gotten that
mindset yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the Lakers' ability to relentlessly feed the ball into
the low post, which left O'Neal tossing up 30 shots, a key element
was missing from the offense.
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't Robert Horry, who spent the afternoon in the
hospital after complaining of chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   The missing ingredient was getting to the free-throw line, which
Indiana did throughout the second half. The Pacers (4-2) shot 27
free throws in the second half, five more than the Lakers attempted
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   So in a game in which the Lakers shot fairly well, rebounded
extremely well and played solid defensively, it was another facet
that did them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's about as well as we can play right now,'' Lakers coach
Del Harris said in a scary indictment of his team's predicament.
``We couldn't get to the foul line. A good veteran team like
Indiana is going to get themselves to the foul line, and I thought
that was the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Veteran teams usually have a few more tricks that makes it
look like you got fouled whether you do or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   There was other evidence that savvy is lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 84-76 early in the fourth quarter, but there was
no sign of panic by the Pacers, only poise and smarts and a
willingness by players to do the tough work.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows the last time a Lakers player took back-to-back
charges? The Pacers last did it with 3:19 and 2:52 to play against
the Lakers. It was done by Indiana's Antonio Davis, who got O'Neal
and Knight on consecutive possessions.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller (26 points) followed the first one with a free
throw to give to give the Pacers a 91-90 lead, then finished it
with a 3-pointer after Knight's charge as Indiana went up 94-90.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling (our guys) when they were going on that run at
the end of the third quarter that we're only down two points,''
Miller said. ``Let experience take over in the fourth. Let's just
settle down, make plays, play within ourselves and just keep in
close. If we keep it close we'll win.''
</P>
<P>
   One would say the Pacers resolved to win this one down the
stretch.

PARENTS FLY BACK TO AFRICA WITH BODY OF SON KILLED BY POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Escorted by his physically and emotionally exhausted
parents, Amadou Diallo, the unarmed street peddler shot to death by
police officers 11 days ago, began the long, final journey home to
West Africa on Sunday in a simple wooden box.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving behind a crush of supporters and angry demonstrators who
gathered in Harlem to protest Diallo's death in a barrage of 41
shots, the gray hearse carrying his body formed the head of a long
motorcade that wound its way, under police escort, from 125th
Street in Manhattan to Newark International Airport in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rev. Al Sharpton at their sides and surrounded by a
crush of reporters and well wishers, Diallo's parents seemed almost
impervious to the intense scrutiny of their every move. Apparently
left with few words to say after a week as an object of worldwide
attention, they boarded a Continental Airlines jet bound for Paris,
with the pine coffin of their 22-year-old son in the cargo hold.
</P>
<P>
   The family, and Diallo's body, are scheduled to arrive in their
native land, Guinea, by Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Diallo had lived his days in New York
peacefully, but his departure added to the crescendo of outrage
among the city's black residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is much anger, the black community is enraged,'' said
Wayne Hazzard, swathed in cream-colored African robes, standing
outside the National Action Network on Madison Avenue near 125th
Street, where the airport motorcade formed. He called for the Bronx
district attorney to act swiftly in investigating the four officers
who shot Diallo. ``If these cops here are not taken care of, this
city's going to go up in smoke.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much of the outcry on that Harlem block, packed with
hundreds of people young and old, came in furious tones. Some
advocated violence to avenge Diallo's death, and everyone demanded
justice for his killing.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was killed when four undercover New York City Police
officers fired 41 bullets in the early morning hours of Feb. 4.
Diallo, who was in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment building at
the time, was struck by 19 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   As mourners riding in cars festooned with Guinean flags and
carrying signs that read simply ``Amadou'' gathered on Monday
afternoon, protesters began intermittent chants of ``No justice, no
peace'' and ``Giuliani must go.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing away from the noise and bustle, Mary Butler, 55,
endured the day's deep chill in silence. Asked her thoughts on
Diallo's death, she spoke in one-word sentences: ``Cold. Blooded.
Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People will not forget about it,'' she added. ``He was only
22. That could have been my son.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps one quarter of the 500 people in front of the National
Action Network, Sharpton's office, shouted angrily about the police
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. But almost everyone agreed that the
anger would not dissipate with Diallo's departure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to go on for a while,'' said Henry Walker, 68,
calmly smoking a pipe as others chanted anti-Giuliani slogans.
``You can kill a man with just one bullet. It doesn't take 41
bullets to kill even an elephant.''
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall on Sunday, Giuliani continued his defense of the
police department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people in other major urban police departments want to
learn about restraint,'' he said at a news conference, ``they come
to the city of New York and look at the things the Police
Department in New York City does to teach police officers
restraint, cultural awareness, cultural sensitivity. It's not done
perfectly, it will never be done perfectly, it should be done even
better, but the strategies actually are working very, very
effectively and almost everybody outside New York City who is in
this business understands that.''
</P>
<P>
   He also challenged the notion that the police are
disproportionately targeting members of minority groups. When a
reporter said that 85 percent of the people shot by the police in
the last five years were black or Hispanic, the mayor responded,
``But that is actually less than the number that are actually shot
in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the news conference, he said: ``There are more
shootings involving black victims and black shooters as a
percentage than there are of police officers doing it. So I know
those are difficult facts for people to deal with but what we
should be about in government and what you should be about in the
media is leading people to the truth, not to reinforcing biases and
prejudices.''

PACERS OUTSMART LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Derek Fisher and a soaring Eddie Jones had the Forum
fans standing and cheering with the identical fast-break lob-dunks
that put the Lakers in front of the Indiana Pacers in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   A spinning, snarling, shouting Shaquille O'Neal kept the crowd
on its feet with the three powerful dunks that gave the Lakers
their biggest lead of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Pacers' Antonio Davis made the biggest plays of the
afternoon, turning all of the Lakers' highlight footage into
meaningless fluff, with his spectacular display of . . . (begin
ital)standing still(end ital).
</P>
<P>
   So went the young Lakers' latest lesson in the art of winning
basketball from a smart, seasoned NBA opponent, a 101-99 loss
Sunday afternoon in a portentous early-season game.
</P>
<P>
   With just over 3 minutes to play and the Lakers trying to break
a 90-all tie, Davis drew a charging foul by O'Neal, leading to
Indiana's go-ahead free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to make sure he didn't fall on me,'' Davis
shrugged later.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)That's(end ital) smart.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Davis drew another charge, this one by Travis
Knight, setting up the Reggie Miller 3-pointer that put the Pacers
in command.
</P>
<P>
   The same highlight films that show you the third-quarter
dunkfest will tell you the Lakers lost this game because Kobe
Bryant's buzzer-beating jump shot rimmed out.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not why the Lakers lost.
</P>
<P>
   They lost because it was one of those games that experience
seems to win every time. And knowing how to take advantage of
overwrought opponents, as Davis did, is what experience is all
about.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the charge _ twice in a row! _ was, dare we say, a Dennis
Rodman play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling (teammates), when they were going on that run
with all the dunking and whooping and hollering, at the end of the
third quarter we were only down by two points,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Let experience take over in the fourth quarter.
Settle down, play within ourselves, and we'll come up with big
enough plays.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Which they did, to win a game billed as an NBA finals preview,
just as the Utah Jazz did a week earlier, to win a game billed as a
Western Conference finals preview.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no Showtime here today,'' said Indiana's Sam
Perkins, the former Laker, ``because we played smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antonio has been in the league a few years. Maybe at one time
he wouldn't have known any better and he would have challenged (the
driving Lakers). That's a good example of being smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, consensus favorites to win the East in the first
year AM _ After Michael _ average 33 years of age in their starting
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   That means they're old enough to remember the Pacers' last
title, 1973 in the American Basketball Association, where George
McGinnis, Mel Daniels and Roger Brown overcame the Kentucky
Colonels' Dan Issel, Artis Gilmore and Louie Dampier in a
seven-game final series.
</P>
<P>
   That also means they weren't panicked by the prospect of
finishing the first full week of the lockout-shortened NBA season
with a 3-3 record after playing five straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   They'd received so much publicity for being the lone NBA team to
work out together in the idle months, some people expected the
Pacers to blow rustier opponents off the court. But they knew
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did during the lockout isn't going to pay dividends
until late, when (other) teams will be tired,'' Miller said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Pacers appear better conditioned than other teams?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, but we're not playing that well,'' coach Larry Bird said
before the game. ``Maybe it's the road. I don't know. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big game. I'd rather be 4-2 than 3-3 going home.
Maybe then we'll get our confidence back.''
</P>
<P>
   In front of a network audience and a 17,505-fan sellout,
including a season high for celebrities, the Lakers made the
spectacular plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, a clever assortment of role players, made the big
plays.
</P>
<P>
   They went to the free-throw line 42 times (making 33) while the
Lakers went just 22 times (making 16).
</P>
<P>
   They grabbed the rebounds of their own misses on back-to-back
possessions to cut a five-point Lakers lead to one with 5{ minutes
to play.
</P>
<P>
   They spread the scoring among Miller (6), Jalen Rose (5), Davis
(4), Travis Best (3) and Rik Smits (2) in the last 5{ minutes while
the Lakers got 13 of their last 17 points from O'Neal and Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   And they knew when to stand still.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely guys on this team who know how to make
plays late in the game and guys who aren't afraid to touch the
ball,'' said Best. ``You saw Kobe touch the ball a lot late in the
game, whereas there's probably three or four of us who are ready to
make plays and take free throws. That could be the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they sign Rodman and shore up their own
experience, the Lakers could learn something from the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to learn how to play together,'' Davis said,
offering the kind of criticism the Jazz wouldn't last week. ``They
have to learn to play to each other's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   All that Lakers talent, Davis said, ``should make the game that
much easier. But sometimes it makes it harder.'' &QL;

NILSMARK DEFEATS SORENSTAM IN PLAYOFF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ Annika Sorenstam will be skiing today in Lake Tahoe,
enjoying herself and trying to clear her mind of golf.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing she wants to think about is what happened Sunday
in the final round of the Valley of the Stars Championship at
Oakmont Country Club. Sorenstam three-putted from four feet for a
bogey on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff and lost to
Catrin Nilsmark.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning end to a final round that featured a spirited
duel between good friends and fellow Swedes. Nilsmark was seeking
her first LPGA victory; Sorenstam had won 16 times since turning
pro in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never give up... never, ever,'' said Nilsmark, who won
$97,500 to Sorenstam's $60,510. ``It's not always going to end like
this, but sometimes it happens.''
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the tournament was hers, especially after she
chipped in from 40 feet on the par-4, 360-yard 16th hole for a
two-stroke advantage, but Sorenstam, who shot a final-round 67,
wouldn't go away. Nilsmark then bogeyed the par-5 17th and
Sorenstam birdied the par-5 18th to force the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam was just short of the green on the first extra hole
(No.18) and chipped to four feet above the hole for what looked
like a certain birdie. Nilsmark was in a greenside bunker in two
holes and blasted out to five feet, but she missed the putt and
felt the tournament had slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's such a good putter,'' Nilsmark said. ``She's good when
it counts. Then my caddy said, `Well, you still had a good
tournament.' Then I said, `We still might go down 10.' A minute
later, I'm the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who missed from three feet, took the loss hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shocked, just very disappointed,'' she said. ``But I
have to look at the bright side. I fought really well. I started
four shots behind, and this is a tough course to chase somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You work really hard for 18 holes, then come out in a
playoff... the way it ended wasn't as fun as if somebody did it
with a birdie. It's not a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsmark, who hasn't won since the 1994 Ford Golf Classic on the
Women's Professional Golfers' European Tour, attributed her victory
to good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's what it takes to beat Annika when she's playing
well,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was referring to several stunning shots, especially
Saturday's holed bunker shot on the 18th hole for an eagle. There
also was her drive on the par-4, 334-yard fifth hole Sunday.
Instead of going around a large tree that guards the dogleg, her
ball went through it cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was her chip-in on the 16th hole, when she was
desperately trying to stay ahead of Sorenstam. She hoped to get it
within 10 feet, and the next thing she knew she made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one was really tricky,'' she said. ``I actually was
standing over the ball and I thought, `Just remember you still have
a one-shot lead. Don't get too cute, and make sure you get over the
longer grass.' I was hoping it would stop 10 feet, if I was lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been happy with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Lowe, two strokes behind Nilsmark at the start of
Sunday's play, struggled to a 4-over 76 and finished in a
fourth-place tie with Jane Geddes. Liselotte Neumann finished alone
in second, at 8-under 208.
</P>
<P>
   La Canada's Helen Alfredsson and defending champion Dale
Eggeling tied for sixth at 3-under 213.

U.S. DODGES `GROUP OF DEATH'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ Most observers agreed that the United States women's
national team avoided the so-called ``Group of Death'' following
the announcement of the 1999 Women's World Cup Draw at halftime of
the FIFA World All-Stars' 2-1 victory over the U.S. team at Spartan
Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But when the third women's world championships begin this summer
in the United States, the U.S. will likely have to fight a little
harder than it wanted to reach the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark, the only European team to beat the U.S. in the 1990's;
Nigeria, who claimed its third consecutive African title by
outscoring opponents 28-0 in qualifying; and Korea joined the
American team in Group A of the four-group, 16-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S., the inaugural World Cup champions in 1991 and
third-place finishers in 1995, will open with Denmark on June 19 at
Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria and Korea are two teams the U.S. has never faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a draw that I would say is unknown because I don't know
anything about Nigeria or Korea,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said.
``Nigeria is the first seed from Africa, North Korea has stretched
China in two games and we all know how tough China is. Denmark, of
course, is one of the best teams in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we would get a draw that wouldn't be an easy draw and
certainly we don't think this is an easy draw. We will have to play
better than we did tonight to reach the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forward Tiffany Milbret is a little nervous about facing a
pair of teams she's never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'm a little scared of unknown teams,'' she said.
``You don't know how they are going to play really, and often those
types of teams are scrappy teams. And scrappy teams' strengths tend
to match up against our weaknesses pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, believed to be the best of the non-seeded teams, joined
Italy and top-seeded Germany in Group C, dubbed the ``Group of
Death.''
</P>
<P>
   In group B, top-seeded and defending World Cup champion Norway
drew Japan, Canada and Russia in its group. In group D, Australia,
Ghana and Sweden joined China, the final top seed of the four
groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl will host the World Cup final July 10 and also a
first-round doubleheader on June 20 with Germany-Italy and
Korea-Nigeria.

NEUMANN BLAZED SWEDISH TRAIL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENDALE _ Liselotte Neumann certainly doesn't look the part of
a pioneer. She is only 32 years old and is blessed with Swedish
blonde good looks.
</P>
<P>
   But more than a decade ago Neumann began the Swedish invasion on
the LPGA Tour by winning the 1988 Women's U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big thing,'' said Catrin Nilsmark, a fellow Swede who
earned her first LPGA title on Sunday by defeating Swedish
superstar Annika Sorenstam in a playoff at the Valley of the Stars
Championship at Oakmont Country Club. ``That made a huge impact on
Swedish golf. Just the year before she had been playing with us (in
Europe).''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years after her breakthrough victory, Neumann is still
going strong. On Sunday she completed a one-two-three Swedish sweep
by shooting a final round 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably playing better than I did back then,'' said
Neumann, referring to her win at Five Farms in Maryland. ``I'm more
experienced, more solid, a better ball striker.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I won the Open it was one of those weeks when everything
went my way. The thing now is to be able to go out and do it every
week.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, a winner of 12 titles and more than $3 million on the
LPGA Tour, has certainly has been consistent in recent years. She
has finished seventh or better on the money list in four of the
last five years and won a career-high $665,069 last season. This
year she has two top-10 finishes in four starts and is seventh on
the money list with $92,957.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann may not be the current queen of the Swedes when it comes
to the general public, but her peers know just how good she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very steady, a very good player,'' said Sorenstam.
``She's not overlooked at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Neumann, who jokes she is no longer one of the ``young ones,''
takes pride in whatever role she had in paving the way for players
such as Nilsmark, Sorenstam and Helen Alfredsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to have been here from the beginning,'' she said.
``To maybe help open the doors and make people realize you don't
have to play 12 months a year to come out and be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   And she certainly enjoys seeing a leaderboard like Sunday's,
which also included Alfredsson, who finished tied for sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all live over here (in the United States) now, but it's
still fun to look up and see three Swedes. It makes you feel
good,'' said Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   Although Neumann fully realizes that ``a lot of girls don't make
it,'' she predicts more Swedish stars will surface on the LPGA Tour
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very determined and overall they are very good
athletes doing a lot of sports,'' said Neumann, who played soccer
and hockey as a youngster. ``They are hard workers and they have
goals and dreams and that's very important.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IN retrospect, it was inevitable. We should have seen Charles
Barkley's injury coming. You stick a frisky 20-year-old kid in a
soon-to-be-36-year-old man's body, and this is what you get, a
mangled medial meniscus.
</P>
<P>
   For you laymen, that's a torn cartilage in the knee. Barkley
wanted at first to play through the pain, but that was never going
to work, so in went the arthroscope Sunday and out came the debris.
We're told Sir Charles will be as good as new in three to four
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, he won't be.
</P>
<P>
   And by the way, three to four weeks isn't what it used to be,
either.
</P>
<P>
   With NBA teams trying to cram 50 games into three months, a
ridiculous aspiration regardless of the circumstances, the
likelihood of players getting hurt greatly increases, and the
impact of even relatively minor ouches is magnified. If Barkley is
lost to the Rockets for the full four weeks, he'll miss 16 games,
or almost one-third of the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   That, by the way, is the equivalent of 26 in a normal season of
82. A comparable layoff at the outset of last season would have
cost him just 11 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Say it then takes him another couple weeks to approach 100
percent _ lots of happy talk from the optimistic doctors
notwithstanding, rehabbing a knee is not the ideal way to maintain
one's aerobic conditioning, which has been a Barkley problem _ he
could be impaired for eight to 10 more games after his return.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, with tipoffs scheduled every other night, on average, the
risk of reinjury looms huge as well. Barkley has a lot of mileage
on that wide body of his already.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Rockets, in the interim, are in the midst of
trying to reinvent themselves with the integration of Scottie
Pippen, who is hardly your everyday plug-in, passing-through free
agent. Losing such a critical component as the Chuckster at such an
early juncture is tantamount to putting a match to Rudy
Tomjanovich's new playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, while that itty-bitty cleft in Chaz's cartilage might be
mosquito-bite insignificant under different circumstances, it has
the potential to _ excuse my mixed metaphor here _ seriously
hamstring the Rockets' chances of positioning themselves properly
for a championship run.
</P>
<P>
   The current season is a mad sprint, not the usual leg- and
brain-numbing marathon. The margin for error is minuscule. Never
have the pro thump-thumpers embarked upon a more demanding, or
Darwinian, campaign, one that will ensure the survival of only the
most fit.
</P>
<P>
   Such are these weirdest of circumstances that Barkley, for once
in his career, might have been better served to report less fit,
then gradually work himself into condition instead of trying to
destroy opponents single-handedly.
</P>
<P>
   His contract calls for him to make $1 million, a veteran's
minimum, and frankly an insulting sum for a jock of his stature.
Yet he was acting as though Leslie Alexander had secretly slipped
him a major equity position in the franchise. He charged from the
gate, light on his feet and heavy on his opponents. There was a
hunger inside of him that had nothing to do with nachos,
cheeseburgers or cigars.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen points and 17 boards per? This was a man on a mission,
with a point to prove. Pride may be a deadly sin _ it figures
Barkley would possess a surfeit of it _ but it isn't always all
bad.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley went soft on us last season. He knew it, and he knew we
knew it. There was no hiding his precipitous decline. I mean,
things devolved to the point where, exactly a year ago, he went on
national TV and said he was going on the wagon. Although of course
he fell off soon thereafter, that he would dare consider such a
drastic lifestyle change _ remember, his second Houston home used
to be a place called the Liquid Lounge _ told us how concerned he
had become.
</P>
<P>
   Since the real Charles, the essential Charles, is equal parts
mouth, butt and heart, he wasn't going to embarrass himself on the
floor any further. Admittedly, he had done so in a game against
Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   After recovering from offseason elbow and hernia surgeries, he
perspired himself into arguably the best shape of his life. While
there were lapsed moments featuring the debauchery of old, they
lacked the former wantonness. He even experimented with meditation
_ the Zen kind, not what he used to practice at our local
gentlemen's clubs.
</P>
<P>
   He took a big one for the Rockets by reupping early, for a bunch
fewer dead presidents than he could have pocketed elsewhere, then
went to work proving that not every modern athlete is motivated
solely by the size of his check stub. When the season finally
began, he was completely recharged, a repentant round mound on full
rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Then pop.
</P>
<P>
   A tough break, or tear, this. Barkley deserved better, doggone
it. Tell him so if you see him. He'll appreciate your kind words
and won't throw you through a window, I promise.

FEISTY BORGIA GAVE COMMAND PERFORMANCES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a world of trains and DC-9s. It was a world of
10 bucks a day meal money _ if that. It was a world in which
trainers didn't go on the road. It was a world in which some of the
owners coached their own teams.
</P>
<P>
   It was the NBA of the 1940s, '50s, and even the '60s. It was a
very intimate, personal league, in which every player, coach and,
yes, referee had a recognizable personality. And, for 20 years,
there was no bigger officiating personality than the feisty Sid
Borgia, who died Jan. 25 at the age of 82.
</P>
<P>
   Borgia and Red Auerbach were one of the great pairs of the day.
Each man was short, bald, and of the opinion that he was the
smartest man in the room. One of the enduring images of the time is
that of Auerbach, the rolled-up program in his hand, shouting at
Borgia, who would be wagging his index finger in Red's face. If you
went to a Celtics game refereed by Borgia, and there was no Red-Sid
contretemps, you wanted half your money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one tough mother,'' reflects Auerbach, who was so moved
by the death of his old adversary that he sent a note to the family
described by son Joe as ``full of respect and love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just loved controversy,'' Red says.
</P>
<P>
   That opinion was seconded by the late Earl Strom in his 1990
autobiography, ``Calling The Shots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have been the toughest of all time,'' the late NBA
officiating great tells us. ``He certainly was the most
rambunctious. Sid was fearless when it came to clashes on the court
or the stands. I swear, he was never happier than when he had
10,000 people howling for his head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you always wanted Sid on the road,'' Red explains.
``You never liked to see him at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Strom tells us about the time Sid flat-out popped a fan who had
challenged him to call a technical foul on Bill Russell. ``Sid told
him he could try his guts any time,'' wrote Strom. The fan stepped
onto the court and Sid nailed him, loosening some teeth. Not bad
for a guy who, according to his son, ``was 5-5 and going
downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in Syracuse,'' Auerbach recalls, ``and there was a
blizzard raging outside. We all come out of the arena and some kid
hits Sid with a snowball. He says, `Watch this,' pointing to his
bag, and he takes off after the kid. He chases the kid for a block,
block and a half, and he catches him. He rubs the kid's face in the
snow. When he comes back, he's got this big grin on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Sid was a man of his times. Simply put, he often made it up as
he went along. The following vignette is said to be the gospel
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Sid blows the whistle. Turning to the offensive player, he says,
``You walked.'' Turning to the defensive player, he says, ``You
made him walk. Forced walk. Offensive ball out of bounds!''
</P>
<P>
   Forced walk?
</P>
<P>
   Why not? For Sid Borgia is the man who coined the phrase, ``No
harm, no foul,'' which has made a comfortable leap from basketball
lingo to accepted American phraseology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't believe in ticky-tack fouls,'' points out son Joe,
himself an NBA official before injury forced him to retire. ``Sid
believed that not all contact was a foul.''
</P>
<P>
   Red, of course, agreed with that philosophy when the Celtics
were on defense. He was not quite so compliant when one of his guys
was knocked hither and yon while Sid stood by with the whistle in
his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say, `Sid, don't make up your own freakin' rules,''' Red
laughs, knowing there was no chance Borgia was ever going to
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sid refereed everything,'' says Joe Borgia. ``Painting the
house. Dinner, even. He'd have the salt and pepper shakers out, and
he'd say, `OK, here's Russell. Here's Wilt. It's all about the
proper angle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sid was out of the NBA before they added the third ref, and it's
a good thing because he never understood the need.
</P>
<P>
   ``To him it was like being a boxing ref,'' says son Joe.
```You've got to keep moving,' he'd say. `Stand still?''' He never
got it.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for any new fan to imagine how powerful the referees
were in those days. Pat Kennedy. Richie Powers. Mendy Rudolph. Norm
Drucker. Strom. They were all strong personalities who really ran a
game, and no one ran one with more brio than Sid Borgia, who
officiated eight of the first 14 NBA All-Star Games (what more do
you really need to know?) and was a 20-year fixture in the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   It's all different now. The modern NBA referee is bred to be
nothing more than an officiating robot. Nice theory. But
frightfully dull.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Borgia found himself torn when his own officiating career
was taking shape. He was Sid's kid, so naturally he had some Sid
tendencies. But the NBA wasn't looking for any new Sids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally had to say to him, `Dad, I can do it your way and
make you happy, or I can do it their way and get a job,''' Borgia
relates.
</P>
<P>
   Sid's NBA world is simply unimaginable today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was cleaning out his desk,'' says Joe, ``and I came across a
lot of fascinating stuff. There were old, old rule books. And there
was a letter from (first NBA commissioner) Maurice Podoloff
reminding people that `there is a TV game coming up and everybody
must behav.' I just sat there and said, `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   Red Auerbach knows more about the NBA than any man on Earth, and
here is what he has to say about Sid Borgia: ``Sid was always in
command. He wasn't going to call the chintzy stuff. Of all the
referees we've ever had, I'd say the three best were Pat Kennedy,
Earl Strom, and Sid Borgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it means something and maybe it doesn't, but let the
record show that both Red Auerbach quit coaching and Sid Borgia
quit officiating following the 1966 season. Somehow I think that
when Red himself reaches that Great Playoff Game In The Sky, he'll
find Sid Borgia waiting for him, the finger wagging, reminding Red
who was right and who was wrong on some play that took place in
Rochester or Syracuse 45 years ago.

HOOPER LEADS UPSET OF U.S. WOMEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE _ On a cold and windy Sunday evening meant to celebrate
the U.S. national team's upcoming foray into Women's World Cup '99,
it was only fitting that Chicago resident Charmaine Hooper stole
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the bundled-up pro-American crowd of 15,367
that packed Spartan Stadium, Hooper is of Canadian descent.
</P>
<P>
   The former North Carolina State star scored twice within a
six-minute span early in the second half as the World All-Stars
humbled the U.S. national team 2-1 in an exhibition matchup
culminating the festivities for the Women's World Cup '99
tournament draw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame my dad, he was a diplomat and that pretty meant I became
a citizen there,'' Hooper said. ``I guess I could have just have
easily decided to become an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Since exhibition results aren't counted as official, the U.S.
women's team's 21-game international winning streak remains intact,
although its confidence might be another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprised (at losing)? I'd have to say no (because of their
talent),'' U.S. midfielder Mia Hamm said. ``But the fact they got
together just a couple of days ago... well, then yes (I'm
surprised).''
</P>
<P>
   The World All-Stars, whose first and only practice as a unit
came Saturday, were clearly plagued by a lack of timing on offense
at the outset, practically negating the short passing game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Americans repeatedly linked together passes
upfield, resulting in nine first-half shots. The U.S. finally found
the net at 23:03 of the first half, when a buildup at midfield
became a pass to Hamm flashing down the left wing. Hamm quickly
centered the pass to an on-rushing Julie Foudy, who chipped a
right-footed shot to beat World All-Stars keeper Gao Hong of China
inside the far right post for the 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on, however, the World All-Stars began to read
each other better, with second-half substitute Irina Grigorieva of
Russia emerging as a key playmaker the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper tied the score when her direct kick at 54:09 deflected
off the wall set up by U.S. defenders and found itself just beyond
the reach of substitute goalkeeper keeper Tracy Ducar. Hooper
closed the scoring at 60:22 with her second unassisted goal, this
time beating Ducar on a quick shot from high inside the penalty
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let them have the opportunity to take the game away from us
and they did,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said. ``But I'm not
surprised. Soccer is a universal language and they eventually
played together beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were also dealt a blow early on. Midfielder
Michelle Akers was escorted off the field in the 13th minute after
a head-on collision with Norway's Linda Medalen. Akers, who was
rushed to the hospital, suffered a severe cut over her left eyebrow
and a severe bruise to her left cheekbone. Her near-term prospects
for returning to action were not immediately known, according to
team officials. &UR; !end! &QL;

 ALPINE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   VAIL, Colo. _ In the largest crowd of spectators to watch a ski
race in this country, there was not one Finnish flag among the
dozens of national flags that were waving.
</P>
<P>
   Not one shirtless spectator had his face or body painted with
grease paint in Finland's colors. Austrian and Norwegian colors
dominated, with Swiss and Italian not far behind.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, before 23-year-old Kalle Palander came pounding
over the lip of Pepi's Face to win the slalom gold medal in the
World Alpine Championships, few race fans ever had seen a Finnish
Alpine racer.
</P>
<P>
   Palander, who vowed all week he would win a medal here, said his
breakthrough would turn his country on to Alpine skiing and loosen
up some cash from the ski federation, most of which goes to Nordic
events, for which Finland is famous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was skiing well,'' said an ebullient Palander, who
was not used to the crush of reporters at the finish. ``I knew I
could make the podium if I stayed solid and made good turns, and
did not ski out on the ice. But I never dreamed this, a gold medal,
a world champion. It is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest to any Alpine ski glory for Finland came in 1996
when Janne Leskinin placed fourth in a World Cup slalom. Aside from
that, they never have made the top 10 in a World Cup, world
championship, or Olympic event.
</P>
<P>
   Another sweet note for Palander: His astonishing second run _
more than eight-10ths of a second faster than the nearest
competitor _ knocked two from dominant ski countries down a peg on
the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Settling for the silver was Norway's Lasse Kjus, though he set a
world record with five medals in a world championships or Olympics.
Just behind him came Austria's Christian Mayer.
</P>
<P>
   The smarting United States team had its poorest showing since
the 1988 Olympics at Calgary. One of two bright spots in two weeks
of racing came Sunday when Bode Miller, a 21-year-old Franconia,
N.H., native who cut his edges on Sugarloaf Mountain in Maine with
the Carrabassett Valley Academy, started from deep in the second
seed to finish eighth, ahead of such Swiss stars as Michael Von
Gruenigen and Paul Accola. Two weeks ago, the US's Chad Fleischer
placed sixth in the Super-G.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous all the way down,'' said Miller of his second
run. ``But then I got to the top (of Pepi's Face) and I heard this
crowd roaring. It sounded like they were inside my helmet. I never
heard anything like that and I was really nervous. I just wanted to
stand up.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's morning run started at 30th place, and he had a
slashing, rhythmic run that propelled him to 13th, and a top-seed
start _ third _ in the afternoon, in which he picked up five more
places. Some 25,000 boisterous fans with flags and cowbells packed
the stands and lined the International Course with its rolling
terrain. According to US Ski and Snowboarding Association spokesman
Tom Kelly, Sunday's crowd was even larger than many European
Championship and Olympic crowds. ``Even (Alberto) Tomba didn't draw
this many at Sestriere (worlds, two years ago),'' said Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   For Miller, a rookie who has been showing hints of a top
performance all season, the second run loomed huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to make a plan and stick to it,'' he said. ``When you
start skiing, you have to have the mind strength to stick to the
plan. It's hard, especially with all that crowd noise.''
</P>
<P>
   The trickiest part of the course was the last eight gates down
the steep Pepi's Face that drop into the stadium. Miller said he
knew the lip of Pepi's was sheer ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was obvious and I slowed down when I had to,'' he
said. ``Today I was lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's performance took some of the sting out of a dismal two
weeks for the US Ski Team, with particular disappointment in the
fizzle of medal hopeful Kristina Koznick Saturday in the women's
slalom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just didn't perform here,'' said Bill Marrolt, president
and CEO of the US Ski Association. ``We came to ski better than we
did. We'll just have to start over with our young team and look
ahead to Salt Lake City.''
</P>
<P>
   The final medal count: Austria 13 (5 gold, 4 silver, 4 bronze);
Norway 9 (3 gold, 3 silver, 3 bronze); Sweden 2 (1 gold, 1 silver);
Switzerland 2 bronze; Australia 1 gold; Finland 1 gold; France 1
bronze.

GOLDEN BOY IS NOW THE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The Golden Boy became the Hombre de Oro Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Challenged stiffly for the first time in his professional
career, Oscar De La Hoya responded as a champion must when trying
to defend a world title. He fought with fire.
</P>
<P>
   Those flames consumed undefeated former World Boxing Association
welterweight titleholder Ike Quartey in a firestorm of left hands
in the opening minute of the 12th round at the Thomas &AMP; Mack
Center, one sending Quartey crumpling to the floor seconds into the
final round of a close fight and two dozen more leaving him stunned
and badly hurt on the ropes before he could escape.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey, to his credit, refused to fall a second time, but by
the time De La Hoya's assault was over the crown prince of Hispanic
boxing had transformed himself from Golden Boy to a bruised but
still battling man.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, De La Hoya was spent and unable to finish Quartey
but he was awarded a curious split decision that allowed him to
retain the World Boxing Council welterweight title on a night when
he had answered all the critics who questioned his chin, his heart,
and his punching power when facing bigger men.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Larry O'Connell of England had Quartey a 115-114 winner
while scoring two rounds even, but John Keane of England had it
116-113 and Ken Morita of Japan scored it 116-112 for De La Hoya.
The Globe card also had De La Hoya winning, 116-112, by virtue of
his taking the last three rounds after the fight was even after
nine.
</P>
<P>
   It is those championship rounds _ the ones from the 10th on _
that often define who a fighter is, and in each of them it was De
La Hoya who threw more punches and, more important, landed more.
Quartey long has had a habit of fading down the stretch, as he did
in his last fight 16 months ago when he fought to a draw with Jose
Luis Lopez, and again was dropped late in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The same pattern emerged against De La Hoya. Although the final
punch count was a razor-thin 206-201 for De La Hoya, he enjoyed a
wide margin in the last three rounds, including a devastating 41-18
edge in Round 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Oscar was going to kill him (in the final round),''
said De La Hoya's co-trainer, ring-wise Gil Clancy. ``He hit Ike
with left hooks I don't think anybody I know could take. The way he
stood up and tried to come back, you have got to give Ike a lot of
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Quartey believed he deserved more than that, angrily complaining
that he earned the decision but could not win on points in Las
Vegas, where unquestionably De La Hoya is king. Quartey spit those
words out through a right cheek so swollen it appeared someone had
stuffed three rolls of nickels inside it in case he wanted to play
the slots later in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet neither his cheek, the fact he was knocked down twice, nor
the overwhelming advantage De La Hoya had in the final rounds could
keep him from believing things would have been different had they
been fighting in his native Ghana.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did nothing,'' Quartey (34-1-1) said. ``I did everything.
All he did was come to survive and that is what he did. You saw the
fight. You know I won the fight. You knew I couldn't win a decision
in Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   He also couldn't win one landing on the seat of his satin pants
twice or by being badly outpunched in the final round while
throwing only 41 and 43 punches in Rounds 10 and 11. He couldn't
win it if in the moments when a champion is crowned _ the late
rounds _ he was found wanting, which he was.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Quartey still gave De La Hoya his toughest 36 minutes in the
ring, a battle that forced the champion to be nearly an hour late
for the post-fight press conference. When he finally arrived his
left cheek was badly swollen and discolored, causing his eye to be
half shut and forcing him to press a Dixie cup full of ice against
it throughout the questioning.
</P>
<P>
   Now The Golden Boy who had traded as much on his charm and good
looks as his boxing ability to become a Hispanic cult hero finally
looked the way many Mexican fight fans like to see their champions.
He was pretty no more, a man now not a boy, but a champion still,
which was the point of enduring all the pain in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat one of the best in the world,'' De La Hoya (30-0) said.
``I give him all the credit in the world. He's a solid fighter. A
strong fighter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went at it, but I was never worried that I had to come back
dramatically. I thought I was in total control. But I wanted to go
out with a bang. I wanted to prove I can fight. I wanted to do
everything possible to get a devastating win.''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya did that, but not before suffering some problems of
his own. Quartey's thudding left jab did a great deal of damage,
reddening his face by the end of two rounds and causing his cheek
to begin the slow process of growing to twice its normal size.
</P>
<P>
   He also had an advantage nearly turn to disaster in the sixth
round when he dropped Quartey for the first time with a
tremendously fast left hook that sent the challenger to the floor.
De La Hoya tried to jump on Quartey then and learned the hard way
that he was in with a very strong man when he missed a wild right
uppercut and was countered by a thunderous left hook from Quartey
that sent the champion to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   When he got up De La Hoya was still hurt, his eyes wide now with
concern and astonishment more than concentration as Quartey pressed
him. But the challenger never was able to land the finishing
combination he needed and De La Hoya escaped a wiser man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a bit dazed, but I thought `I'm going to get right back
up and stay in this fight,''' De La Hoya said. ``I'm not a
quitter.''
</P>
<P>
   That was obvious, but he also became more cautious, giving
ground more than he had in any of his previous 29 victories as
Quartey kept walking straight in with a menacing smile, his left
jab thudding, thudding, thudding into the champion's mouth in the
middle rounds.
</P>
<P>
   As the fight wore on, however, Quartey seemed to wear down as he
often has. De La Hoya's people had done a computer analysis of
Quartey's punch stats and found he threw considerably less often in
the late rounds and when he began to slow down, De La Hoya picked
up the pace.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, De La Hoya continued to ignore both his fight plan
and the pleadings of Clancy and head trainer Robert Alcazar, who
asked him to use his speed and movement to keep the mechanical
Quartey at bay. This he did not do, instead staying right in front
of Quartey while searching for openings, a Golden Boy choosing this
night to fight like a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted Oscar to stay on the outside and use his legs, which
he didn't do,'' Clancy said. ``He got caught up in it and showed he
has the ability to fight as well as box. He showed a lot of heart,
which is what got him through, but he spent the entire fight
fighting Quartey's fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he used his legs, it would have been a lot easier for
Oscar, but it was one of those nights he wanted to fight more than
he wanted to box.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, he also wanted to fight more than Quartey did, a
point a man claiming to be Quartey's uncle made outside the Thomas
and Mack Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the difference between Ike and Oscar,'' he said.
``Oscar wanted to win more tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   And win he did over an opponent who elevated his status more in
defeat than by anything he had achieved in victory. What Ike
Quartey proved Saturday night was that he belongs among the world's
top welterweights.
</P>
<P>
   What Oscar De La Hoya proved was that he belongs at the top of
that list, a Golden Boy who is now The Man.

CLIPPERS BACK TO OLD WAYS
</HEADLINE>

By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even on calendar dates defined by stuttering
hearts, the beating goes on for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Hallmark momentum killer was provided by the Minnesota
Timberwolves, who clobbered the home team 95-73 in front of 8,592
at the Sports Arena. When placed in cahoots with Golden State's
victory over Portland, the loss leaves the Clippers as the NBA's
only winless team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame,'' said first-year coach Chris Ford, whose 0-5
team demonstrated both pulse and spine in Saturday's overtime loss
at Phoenix. ``It was looking like we were making strides. We've got
to go back to the drawing board tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   The drawing board was cluttered with numbers that failed to add
up to Clippers success. The T'wolves (3-1) _ who had two nights of
rest after beating the Lakers in Minneapolis on Thursday _ played
with a defensive abandon that limited the Clippers to 37-percent
shooting from the field. And when they had the ball, the T'wolves
frequently found rangy forward Kevin Garnett available to finish a
fast break with a screaming dunk.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-foot Garnett, who somehow had made less than 40 percent of
his shots before this game, scored a game-high 24 points and
grabbed 11 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good game,'' said Clippers power forward Maurice
Taylor, who added understatement to his disturbing habit of
under-rebounding. ``Guys in the NBA are gonna have good games.''
</P>
<P>
   And tired teams without star-caliber players are going to
struggle with fresh teams that have players like, well, Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a superstar we can just hang our hat on,'' Ford
said. ``We have to have 12 guys who stay within the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had a superstar-on-training-wheels offensive game in
Phoenix, led the Clippers with 19 points on Sunday but missed 10 of
16 field-goal attempts. For the second consecutive night, he had
only four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never gonna say we can't have a good team,'' Taylor said.
``But we have to concentrate more on both ends.''
</P>
<P>
   A fine example of this would be the lively Garnett, whose
numbers included three steals and a blocked shot. His fastball slam
with 32 seconds left in the third quarter put the T'wolves up 73-53
and suggested that any signature Clippers rally would have to wait
for another night.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Lamond Murray had 12 points for the Clippers but managed
only 10 shots against the warrior defense of Garnett. The rapid
rise of rookie center Michael Olowokandi was stalled for the second
night in a row. The 7-footer from Pacific had just six points and
four rebounds in 27 minutes. Free-agent rookie Tyrone Nesby
continued to make Wednesday's cut-down day an interesting topic by
scoring nine points in 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that and a garbage-time moment that featured Taylor
guarding Minnesota's Bill Curley, there was little left to shout
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will they be embarrassed with this loss?'' Ford said of his
team. ``I hope so.''

MORE QUESTIONS THAN ANSWERS WITH RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Here, hard by the banks of the Caloosahatchee
River, in the home of those two beacons of light, Thomas Alva
Edison and Neon Deion Sanders, the Red Sox soon will announce their
presence for another spring.
</P>
<P>
   On Yawkey Way, the equipment truck was due to leave Monday
afternoon, stuffed with bats, balls, warmup jerseys, sunflower
seeds, and Dr. Joe Kerrigan's Pitching Pals, dummies all. The real
pitchers, along with the catchers, are due to report Saturday, with
the rest of the squad expected on hand next Tuesday. The first
exhibition game is March 4 here against the Minnesota Twins, with
the annual exhibition against Boston College the next night. The
regular-season opener will be April 5 in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the Red Sox' seventh spring here since their move
from Winter Haven, whose replacement tenants, the Cleveland
Indians, twice have been to the World Series since the Sox left. It
also is their first without Mo Vaughn, who will spend 40 days and
40 nights in the Arizona desert with his new band of followers, the
Anaheim Angels, who have given the slugging first baseman 80
million reasons never to look back.
</P>
<P>
   What will Vaughn's absence mean on Charlie Wagner Way, the
entrance to the Sox training complex that bears a red street sign
emblazoned with the name of the former Sox player, longtime scout,
and unofficial spring-training master of ceremonies?
</P>
<P>
   Glad you asked. That's as good a place as any to begin this
informal primer on the Sox' 81st spring since they last won the
World Series. What's to miss about Mo?
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 40 home runs, .337 average, and 115 RBIs, only this:
a camp so quiet, you'll be able to hear the wind ruffle the
bristles on the top of Dan Duquette's head. No weight controversy,
no public wishing the Rocket and Jose were still here, no contract
squabbles, no Duke-bashing, no strip clubs, no alcohol and drug
innuendo, no Harrington-bashing, no hugs for Kevin Kennedy, no
State of the Sox address, no pick-a-new-team speculation, no Leroy
and Shirley Vaughn, no king of the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   To that list, some might add these: No replacement, no fun, no
hope. But one man's ennui is another man's peace of mind, and
Messrs. Harrington and Duquette, assuming they leave their office
curtains open, may look down from their private boxes in City of
Palms Park and decide the view never has been better.
</P>
<P>
   OK, enough already about Mo. We've had since November to get
used to the idea that he's gone. If I'm laying out 35 bucks a seat,
I want to know about the guys who are still here. Tell me this: Is
there a chance this spring Duquette will find another big bat?
</P>
<P>
   Possible, but not likely. Plenty of big boppers changed teams
this winter _ Albert Belle, Rafael Palmeiro, Greg Vaughn, Brian
Jordan, Will Clark _ but none wound up in a Red Sox uniform. The
White Sox plan to hold on to Frank Thomas, so Duquette's best bet
may be to keep after the Atlanta Braves about first
baseman/outfielder Ryan Klesko, a Jimy Williams favorite from their
days in Atlanta. The Braves would move Klesko, but they were
seeking to extract one of Boston's best young prospects in return,
either 1998 No. 1 pick Adam Everett or top Dominican find Julio
Guerrero. Baseball rules prohibit the Sox from moving Everett
before June 1, but with the Braves having acquired Jordan over the
winter, they may be willing to move Klesko, a lefthanded slugger
who has averaged 23 home runs in the last five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are we supposed to make of Jose Offerman, besides the
fact that the baseball universe generally agrees it laughable that
the Sox shelled out $26 million for him?
</P>
<P>
   Pity the poor guy, for one, if you can find sympathy for a man
who crumbled under Tommy Lasorda-induced pressure in Los Angeles,
put up some nice offensive numbers in Kansas City, but never has
faced the scrutiny to which he'll be subjected in Boston,
especially in the wake of Vaughn's departure. Finding Offerman a
position will be Williams's biggest challenge. Originally an
error-prone shortstop for the Dodgers, he played exclusively the
last two seasons at second base, where the Sox have Jeff Frye
returning. First base is a possibility, but Offerman played there
just part-time one season. He'll make Vaughn look like a Gold
Glover by comparison. But he's making too much money to be only a
DH, which sets up a scenario where Frye could be odd man out, over
Williams's objections.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-hitting Offerman could wind up hitting third in front
of Nomar Garciaparra, and off last season's numbers _ .315 average
(.360 after the All-Star break), .350 with runners in scoring
position, 13 triples, 45 steals _ could thrive there.
</P>
<P>
   But it hardly can be reassuring to Sox fans to hear what Royals
manager Tony Muser said about his leading hitter at a banquet after
the season. Muser first talked about how Hall of Fame inductee
George Brett once wished that on his last at-bat in the big
leagues, he'd have to hustle to beat out a routine grounder. Then,
Muser described Offerman's last at-bat as a Royal as ``a single
that Offy just jogged to first on.'' Muser reportedly added:
``That's OK, Offy. Take the $26 million and go to Boston. We're
going to get ya.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulp.
</P>
<P>
   Tell us about some of the kids. And what happens if Trot Nixon
has a terrible spring? Who plays right field?
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's the one, and at the moment there appears to be no
fallback plan. Michael Coleman's reputation needs reconstructive
surgery, and the only other outfielders in camp are minor league
journeymen. The plan is to employ the same platoon Williams used
with such success last season, with Nixon taking the place of
Darren Bragg in a rotation that included Darren Lewis and Damon
Buford. Nixon seems eminently qualified for the role, and has a
Braggian thirst for the action that will endear him to the fans,
but the Sox are thin here.
</P>
<P>
   The next great hope is Dernell Stenson, the 20-year-old
outfielder who is drawing the same kind of raves Coleman did a year
ago. Stenson doesn't turn 21 until June 17, so he's probably a year
away, but with a football player's build (6 feet 1 inch, 230
pounds) and lefthanded power, the Sox hope he comes quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the team's better young prospects are third basemen, Cole
Liniak and Wilton Veras, while two young catchers bear watching as
well. Shea Hillenbrand led the organization in hitting with a .349
average, though he has yet to find a position. And Peabody product
Steve Lomasney showed some pop (22 home runs) in Single A Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   By our calculation, Pedro Martinez, Bret Saberhagen, and Tim
Wakefield combined for 51 wins last season. But has the bottom of
the rotation been upgraded with the additions of Mark Portugal and
Pat Rapp?
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan is expecting 28 pitchers in camp, including seven
nonroster invitees. He and Williams did a masterful job of
protecting Saberhagen, who in 18 of his 31 starts had at least one
extra day of rest. By the end of the season, Saberhagen was
throwing harder than he had been in June. Portugal is 36 and has
been hurt so many times, his kids think his first name is D.L. Rapp
has won as many as 14 games in a season and once threw a one-hitter
in Denver, no easy feat. But he also walked a career-high 107 last
season, third highest total in the league. That's no way to survive
Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also don't have a lefthander in the rotation, which is
not the ideal scenario. Robert Ramsay and Brian Barkley are long
shots to break through, while righty Brian Rose will be brought
along slowly after last season's elbow woes.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does Tom Gordon do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   He hopes that everyone has sense enough to know he can't
possibly duplicate last season's near-perfection. The Sox hope that
former Dodger Mark Guthrie will be a serviceable lefthanded setup
man, while Kerrigan will sift through a motley crew (Kip Gross,
Brad Clontz, Marino Santana) to see who will join Derek Lowe and
Jim Corsi as righthanded help.
</P>
<P>
   Does Nomar have a girlfriend?
</P>
<P>
   What kind of question is that? Happily, Garciaparra is a big
believer in keeping his private life out of the public domain. But
just in case you were wondering, the MVP-in-waiting devoted a big
chunk of his offseason as he usually does, in intense workouts that
require a monk's dedication.
</P>
<P>
   Will he miss Mo? Of course. Will it change anything about his
game? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Which in itself is reason to look forward to spring.

BRUINS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE ON ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins spent all day Sunday flying back from a
dismal 1-2 road trip out west. Their plane landed late in the
afternoon but their playoff chances remained up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   They are injured, beat up, sick, and hurting. And that's just
the physical aspect. Truth be told, the Bruins could use a little
bit of repair on their psyche and a big-time retooling of the
roster.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time, they were trying to secure home ice for
a playoff spot. They didn't quite make it, but fifth place wasn't
anything to sneeze at. Now they'd be thrilled to make it at all.
Sure, there's plenty of time remaining in the season, but now is
not the time for the club's version of community auditions, and
that's what is happening. It's training camp all over again.
</P>
<P>
   After the odious 5-4 loss to the Islanders at home Feb. 4,
president/ general manager Harry Sinden brought up Antti Laaksonen
and Cameron Mann with the idea they would skate a regular shift for
coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   They gamely tried, but the fact is their presence wasn't the
answer and made no discernible difference as the roster grew
thinner and thinner because of injuries. Defenseman Darren Van Impe
(shoulder) went down in Edmonton, left wing Sergei Samsonov
(charley horse) went down in Calgary and spent a third day on
crutches Sunday, and left wing P.J. Axelsson (sprained right wrist)
went down in Vancouver. Steve Heinze is out with a hip flexor
strain, Kyle McLaren skated on the trip but didn't play because of
a bum shoulder, and Anson Carter played but still isn't 100 percent
after coming back from an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Laaksonen was sent back Sunday and Mann remains. Next up from
Providence will be center Randy Robitaille and right wing Landon
Wilson. Will they make a difference? Perhaps, but not likely.
Wilson has been up here before and done nothing. Robitaille is a
decent scorer, but as we've seen with Mann, points in the AHL don't
always translate to the next level.
</P>
<P>
   The reinforcements needed are more substantial than what Boston
has in Providence, with all due respect to the players involved.
Burns is being asked to juggle 20 balls in the air at once, all of
varying sizes. The Bruins' roster was thin to begin with. If one of
those balls drops out of the air, the rest become more unstable.
Even a two-time Jack Adams Trophy winner as coach of the year can't
pull the trigger on an empty gun and expect it to fire.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins were devastated by the 4-3 loss to the Flames in
the final seconds Friday night, they were out-and-out depressed
after a 3-1 loss to the Canucks Saturday. The defining moment of
the Vancouver game was when big forward Todd Bertuzzi skated
through the entire team, knocked down normally reliable
6-foot-7-inch defenseman Hal Gill with one hand like he was 3-7,
and scored a highlight film goal that held up as the winner 33
seconds into the second period. It was gorgeous to watch but
horrible to deal with if you're a Bruin.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe management will make a deal, maybe it won't. Maybe,
instead, it'll let Burns tear out his hair while trying to put
together a competitive combination that is too talent-thin to
weather the loss of more than a couple of players. Burns is no
doubt crossing all fingers and toes and praying to any god who will
listen that nothing happens to Ray Bourque.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the most upbeat players on the team _ goalies Byron Dafoe
and Rob Tallas _ seemed the most crestfallen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get four shots in the third period, one coming in the
final 20 seconds of the game, that's not being hungry, that's not
playoff hockey,'' said Tallas, who was tagged with the loss to the
Canucks. ``We're just not ready for it and that's what is
disappointing. I wish I had the answers. No one has the answers
right now. If something goes right, we're waiting for something to
go wrong. We can't do that. Last year, it didn't matter the score,
it didn't matter what was happening in the game, we were always
positive no matter what the outcome was. On most nights, even if we
lost, we know we put in a good effort. When we're losing like this,
we're not putting in a good effort. That's why it's hard''
</P>
<P>
   Burns has kept a stiff upper lip through the struggle, through
the occasional good games and the all-too-frequent bad ones. He's
mitigated the situation when he sensed his team's fragility, he's
gone to the whip when he thought it would help. More often, he's
used the velvet glove on a roster even he has to know won't take
him to the promised land. If Burns is frustrated by the front
office's inertia, he hasn't said so, but the players say they sense
the coach's anguish about the way this season has gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe this is happening to us, it's so
frustrating,'' said Tallas. ``You can just see it in the guys. It's
a strain. I think Pat has every right to be frustrated. It's the
little things that are killing us. It's the simple things that are
really hurting us on the ice. If there's a rebound, it's picking up
that second shot. We never had second shots that much last year. We
trapped so well that if a team made a mistake, we capitalized on it
and scored a goal and that's how it worked last year. He has every
right to be frustrated by us. He's continuing to stick with it. It
worked last year and there's no reason it shouldn't work this year.
I don't know why we're getting off the page and trying to do our
own things.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is that it isn't the same team as last year.
The hunger of last season has been absent in some players. There
has been no second line. The defensemen are another year older and
some have been less effective. Contract squabbles put the Bruins
under the gun early and injuries are keeping them under the gun
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see teams that you know are having fun,'' said Tallas.
``You know the players are coming together. You know they're having
a good time. Things are rolling right. You always say we're getting
bad bounces, but you create your bad bounces.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we score a goal, we should be excited, and it's almost
like we sit down on the bench and we're quiet rather than getting
up and cheering. It's tough to do that when you're going through a
stretch like that. You don't want to be having too much fun (in a
tough time).
</P>
<P>
   ``We just fell into this rut and we can't allow ourselves to do
that. Last year, we took pride, we never lost too many games back
to back. If we did, the third game we won and that's one thing
we're getting away from. We've got to make a goal of it in this
dressing room. Right now, we're just sitting back and waiting to
see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an absence of confidence in this team, an absence of
enjoyment for some players. The roster that looks like it could use
an infusion of Prozac definitely could use an infusion of healthy
talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been losing games in dramatic ways,'' said Dafoe, who
was in net for the dreadful loss to the Flames in which Jarome
Iginla won it with 3.4 seconds left in regulation. ``Not only do
you lose a game, but (when) you lose a game you should've won or
should've gotten a tie out of, it hurts twice as much. The way
we've been losing has really hurt our confidence. We come back,
have a couple strong games, and outside we're on top of the world.
Inside, I think there's still some hesitancy, guys just aren't
sure. We've got to blow that out, we've got to get rid of it.
You've got to be a confident hockey team to make the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tallas, Dafoe said he sees the frustration in the coaching
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they are,'' he said. ``They put a lot of hours in,
showing video, coming up with different philosophies. From one
night to another, a certain player doesn't do it, a certain line,
I'm sure it's frustrating on their part. Pat can only come in and
give the same speech so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   At this moment, a two-word speech is all that is needed: ``Send
help.''

CROSS COUNTRY CHAMP PICKS UP PERFECT VALENTINE GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPANAWAY, Wash. _ In the chaos of getting ready for the USA
Winter Cross Country Championships, Alan Culpepper forgot one very
important thing.
</P>
<P>
   A Valentine's Day gift for his wife, Shayne.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Shayne got a glimpse of something she really wanted
during the two-day event at Lake Spanaway Golf Course. It was one
of the carved wooden duck bowls that were presented to the winners
in each of the six championship races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came up just before my race started and said one of those
bowls would look really good in our home,'' said Culpepper, who
lives and trains in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   No problem? Competing with him in yesterday's senior men's
12-kilometer race were five of the past seven national champions.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Culpepper surged to a 20-yard lead midway through
the next-to-last lap in the six-lap race and won impressively in 34
minutes, 23 seconds. He was the only runner to break 34{ minutes
and finished seven seconds ahead of runner-up and Adidas teammate
Tony Cosey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've got Shayne's Valentine's Day present,'' Culpepper
said afterward, stuffing the bowl into his bag. ``Before this, I
was going to give her a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he got the bowl and a trip for two to Northern Ireland
next month. The top six finishers in each of the championship races
qualified for the U.S. team that will compete in the World
Championships March 27-28 in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Shayne Culpepper will join her husband on the U.S. team because
she was fourth in Sunday's senior women's 4-kilometer race won by
defending champion Amy Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other championship race, Adam Tenforde, a senior at
Hanford High School in Richland, Wash., finished sixth in the
junior men's race to earn a place on the U.S. team. The race,
billed as 8 kilometers but shortened to 7,865 meters, was won by
Luke Watson, a freshman at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   But the day belonged to the senior men, and that race was
claimed by Culpepper in part because no one else in the field of 96
runners seemed willing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was going to be a one-move race,'' Cosey said,
``because the field was so even, but also because a lot of times in
these 12-kilometer events guys run just to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pace lagging, it was time for someone to do something
because, as Cosey put it, ``It's easy to get stale in the middle of
a race like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But who would be the mover? Not defending champion Tim Hacker.
He finished 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kicking yourself because you know no one is running
that hard, yet you can't go any harder,'' Hacker said. ``I tried to
quicken the pace, but I never felt good from the start today.''
</P>
<P>
   Former event winners Reuben Reina (1996 and 1994) and Todd
Williams (1993 and 1991) also struggled, finishing 27th and 14th,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That left it up to Culpepper, who last year missed a spot on the
U.S. world team by one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got to the point where I said, `All right, if I'm
going to take this thing, I want to really break away,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alan made the move,'' Cosey said, ``I didn't respond, and
no one else did either.''
</P>
<P>
   That left the rest of the field racing for second through sixth
to qualify for worlds. Cosey beat Dan Middleman (34:31) to the
finish line by a second, and Rodney DeHaven (34:34), Gary Stolz
(34:35) and Clint Wells (34:36) slugged it out down the final
stretch to finish in one-second intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Ray Appenheimer, who led or shared the lead for
three laps only to slip to a non-qualifying seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running a good race,'' he said, shaking his head. Then,
pointing to his head, Appenheimer added, ``But you have to get it
done up here, too.''

GORDON CAPTURES DAYTONA 500 
</HEADLINE>
 500-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ First and foremost, Jeff Gordon gave
thanks to God for the many blessings _ all 2,172,246 of them _ that
were bestowed upon him after winning Sunsday's Daytona 500. Then,
almost in the same breath, Gordon gave thanks to runner-up Dale
Earnhardt, the man who rendered some unlikely drafting help that
enabled Gordon to pass Rusty Wallace for the lead on Lap 190, but
who also gave Gordon a hellish time in an exciting shootout in the
final 10 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Praise the Lord _ and the Intimidator _ and pass the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Picking up where he left off from his NASCAR Winston Cup
championship of a year ago, Gordon captured his second Daytona 500
in three years while thwarting Earnhardt's attempt to become a
repeat winner of a race in which he took 20 years to record his
first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon stood upon the winner's podium in Victory Lane, where he
was joined by his wife, Brooke, crew chief Ray Evernham, and John
Hendrick, brother of ailing car owner Rick Hendrick, who retreated
to his Charlotte, N.C., home to watch the race. He was treated to a
confetti shower of imitation dollar bills after pocketing that
$2,172,246, the largest purse ever paid in an American auto race.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's record windfall was bolstered by a $1 million bonus
from the Winston No Bull 5 program, which also paid $1 million to a
lucky fan, Ray Grimm, 46, of Hagerstown, Md., one of five fans
paired with an eligible driver for the prize _ and a devout
Earnhardt fan.
</P>
<P>
   That was, of course, until Gordon made Grimm an instant
millionaire by winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to keep him behind me is one of the toughest things
I've ever had to do in a race car,'' said Gordon, who has won three
consecutive races dating back to last season at Rockingham and
Atlanta. ``I wanted it bad. He wanted it bad, and that's why it was
such a great race down to the checkered.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, and Gordon had just crossed the finish line
ahead of Earnhardt, with Kenny Irwin, Mike Skinner, and Michael
Waltrip right on their heels, the Intimidator's black No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet Monte Carlo pulled alongside Gordon's No. 24
Dupont Chevy Monte Carlo. Earnhardt then congratulated the winner
in his own inimitable style: He sideswiped Gordon's car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thinking that he was saying, `This car is going to
Daytona USA, and I'm just going to put my mark on it before it goes
(for enshrinement Monday),''' Gordon said with a laugh. ``I think
we both knew it was a great exciting race. There's been several
times there's been mention of it coming down to a finish between
Gordon and Earnhardt. Even though we battled for a championship in
'95, we really didn't have too many tight battles all the way to
the finish. I really can't think of a better way to do it than here
at the Daytona 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Earnhardt, who had to correct an ignition problem early on,
``I couldn't really muster much on Jeff. His car was strong from
the center of the corner off. I just never could get to him. If I
could've got to him in the corner, I might have got under him, but
I just couldn't get there. I got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Earnhardt's gesture? ``I think he was just showing me how
much fun he was having,'' Gordon said. ``He's a great champion and
a great sport. He just came up and gave me a little donut _ and
then he waved.''
</P>
<P>
   But the goodwill gesture that really caught Gordon by surprise
was Earnhardt's decision to link up with him as he was gunning for
the lead on Lap 190, and ran three-wide into Turn 3 with Wallace
and Skinner, Earnhardt's stablemate at Richard Childress Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon executed the day's most spine-tingling move at the start
of Lap 190 when Wallace, who led thrice for 102 laps total, tried
to hold his ground, forcing Gordon well below the yellow blend line
and into the path of Ricky Rudd's badly limping car, which had
returned to the race after it was involved in a 12-car melee
started by Dale Jarrett on Lap 136.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rusty was doing everything he could've done,'' said Gordon,
who averted disaster by squeezing his car between Rudd's and
Wallace's on the apron in Turn 1. ``He ran me down low. There's a
lot of apron there and I utilized it as much as I could. Then I got
down there and looked ahead of me and saw Ricky Rudd running. I
said, `Oh, Ricky, I hope you see me coming, because I'm coming
really fast.' Finally, he moved a little bit and I got up there,
but I didn't make the pass.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't until he got Earnhardt's help. Hung out to dry by the
Daytona Draft of single-file cars on more than one occasion, Gordon
was unable to find a drafting partner until Earnhardt tucked his
car behind Gordon's and helped him get past Wallace and Skinner as
they went three abreast into Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty surprised,'' Gordon admitted, ``although I had
the preferred line, I had the bottom groove, and the bottom groove
was the way to go all day long today. He had a tough choice there.
He had a teammate, his buddy Rusty in the middle, and me. I thought
he would have gone with the other two long before he would have
gone with me, but I think he knew he had a fast race car and he
could race anybody. Maybe he just wanted to race me to the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad he went with me, and I'm glad I was able to race
him all the way to the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   After wrapping up his 1998 Winston Cup campaign with 13
victories, more than $9 million in earnings, and his second
consecutive and third overall Winston Cup championship, ``People
ask me, `How can you top it?''' Gordon said, shaking his head in
disbelief. ``I'll tell you what ... a $2 million dollar payday ...
a battle with Dale Earnhardt to the finish ... and a second Daytona
500 victory, how can you beat that?''

PATRIOTS LOSE ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Heath Irwin is the Patriots' starting center
barring the signing of a veteran or the drafting of a center in
April. That became clear Sunday after the expansion Cleveland
Browns made Dave Wohlabaugh the richest center in the NFL with a
six-year deal averaging $3.5 million per.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, who have lost two major free agents in the
offseason (punter Tom Tupa the other), weren't able to match that
offer, preferring to get Ty Law and Lawyer Milloy in the fold.
</P>
<P>
   As they were parting ways with Wohlabaugh, the Patriots were
putting a press on defensive tackle Henry Thomas, trying to sign
him before he defected to the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president of business operations Andy Wasynczuk
made a new proposal and was mulling over a counter-proposal from
Thomas's agent, Jeffrey Durand, Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a big step made in the right direction,'' said the
Minneapolis-based agent. ``I liked the tone the conversation was
taking. Andy called with the intent of getting a deal done and
though what the Patriots proposed was still a little short of what
the other teams had offered, they were making progress with the
front portion of the contract, which is where we would like to see
the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Durand said he has three offers higher than the Patriots', but
said Thomas would take less to stay in New England.
</P>
<P>
   While it appeared the Patriots' offer was in the $2.5 million
range per year, that increased to more than $3 million given the
market established by other signings, including that of Gary
Walker, who bolted the Titans for the Jaguars.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh made a quick decision on Cleveland, realizing he
wouldn't get as much money in New England. The Patriots tried to
sign Wohlabaugh last offseason, but he wanted to test the free
agent waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the moment we visited Cleveland there was a good feel to
it,'' said Wohlabaugh. ``If I had to leave, this is the place I'd
leave New England to go to. The familiarity with Coach (Chris)
Palmer was very important. After he explained the offensive
philosophy to me, it's one that I'm familiar with having known
Chris when he was in New England (as wide receivers and later
quarterbacks coach). It just felt right for me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quality of life decision,'' said Wohlabaugh, who was
born and raised in Buffalo and graduated from Syracuse. ``We felt
this was a good area to raise our family. It's only about three
hours from my parents' home and it just seemed like it was the
right fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlabaugh enjoyed playing for Pete Carroll and the Patriots'
coaching staff. But he knew New England had a salary cap problem
and he quickly realized it wouldn't be resolved any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For anyone who thinks the New England situation is
deteriorating, just watch that team next season,'' said Wohlabaugh.
``When they get their injured guys back they'll have an explosive
offense. No team could have done any better with all of the
injuries we had. Maybe we didn't get as far as we wanted to get,
but we were in the playoffs two years in a row under Pete, and we
had to overcome a lot of problems with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after that Jacksonville game some things were said
that are going to help this team next year. I think the players got
a lot closer.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why leaving New England wasn't easy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of good friendships with my teammates and with a
lot of people in the New England area from Foxborough up to New
Hampshire where I lived,'' he said. ``It's a time I'll never forget
and I wish it could have worked out. But I'll always remember good
things about the Patriots organization and New England. We went to
a Super Bowl and made the playoffs three out of my four years
there. That's tough to match, but hopefully we can do it in
Cleveland in a short period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Coach Palmer has a plan on how to build it up and I
think he's going to get the job done. I got to know him very well
in New England and he's a brilliant coach.''
</P>

KWAN CARRYING THE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
 FIGURE SKATING-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Maybe they should put Michelle Kwan in a
biosphere and keep her warm and germ-free for the next month.
Because if anything happens to her, the US figure skating team may
well get blanked at the world championships in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
   Kwan, who hasn't lost since last year's Olympics, will be
odds-on to win her third crown in four years. But unless Michael
Weiss can crack the Russian troika that has ruled men's skating all
winter, the rest of the squad will be going overseas purely for the
sauna and the experience.
</P>
<P>
   The post-Olympic season is always a reconstruction project for
the Americans, but this time they're rebuilding from Ground Zero.
When the US championships were done inside the Delta Center
Saturday night, everybody was thumbing through the biography
binders to see who these people were. Trifun Zivanovic? Sarah
Hughes? Laura Handy and J. Paul Binnebose?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not since 1962, the year after the squad was wiped out
in a plane crash en route to Prague, has the US sent such an
inexperienced team to the worlds. Only six of the 16-member roster
have ever competed there, and only Kwan has come close to the
awards podium.
</P>
<P>
   Zivanovic, a 23-year-old from Los Angeles who played hockey
until he was 18, was pinching himself after finishing second to
Weiss. ``I've never been in this position before,'' exulted
Zivanovic, who never had been higher than seventh at nationals.
``I'm totally psyched.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, a 13-year-old from Great Neck, N.Y., whose father John
is a former Cornell hockey captain, was making her senior debut.
``I can't believe I'm sitting at a press table with Michelle
Kwan,'' Hughes marveled.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes never dreamed about making it to worlds. But she got a
ticket to Helsinki because 13-year-old Naomi Nari Nam, who finished
second, is too young. Hughes gets her pass because she's a world
junior medalist.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew there would be end-of-quadrennium turnover, with
champions moving on and pairs and dance couples breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   Then five-time titleist Todd Eldredge took the amateur season
off. Kyoko Ina-Jason Dungjen and Jessica Joseph-Charles Butler, the
top returning pair and dance couple, went pfffft. Four-time
medalist Nicole Bobek pulled out because of endometriosis. Anyone
want a week in Finland?
</P>
<P>
   The men's and women's champions here were completely
predictable. Kwan breezed to her third title in four years, which
no woman had done since Jill Trenary nearly a decade ago.
``Everyone predicted I wouldn't be here,'' said Kwan, who'll start
college in the fall but plans to keep competing. ``Well, I'm here _
and I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, believed to be the first father to win the men's title
since Roger Turner in the '30s, inherited Eldredge's crown after
two years as runner-up. ``A lot of international judges take you
more seriously,'' mused Weiss, ``when they see the national title
under your name.''
</P>
<P>
   How seriously the judges will take the new pairs and dance
champions is another matter. Danielle and Steve Hartsell, the
youngest US pair (at 18 and 21) since Melissa and Mark Militano in
1973, literally were the only entry to stand up in the free skate.
And Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev topped a dance event that had
only eight entries _ and none of the men among the top three
finishers are US citizens.
</P>
<P>
   So unless Weiss can elbow his way past a group that includes two
world titlists (Alexei Yagudin and Elvis Stojko), an Olympic gold
medalist (Alexei Urmanov), and a global medalist (Evgeni
Plushenko), it'll be up to Kwan to prevent the first star-spangled
wash-out since 1994. She'd better button up her overcoat, wear a
surgical mask, and megadose on vitamin C.

CROSS COUNTRY CHAMP PICKS UP PERFECT VALENTINE GIFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPANAWAY, Wash. _ In the chaos of getting ready for the USA
Winter Cross Country Championships, Alan Culpepper forgot one very
important thing.
</P>
<P>
   A Valentine's Day gift for his wife, Shayne.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Shayne got a glimpse of something she really wanted
during the two-day event at Lake Spanaway Golf Course. It was one
of the carved wooden duck bowls that were presented to the winners
in each of the six championship races.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came up just before my race started and said one of those
bowls would look really good in our home,'' said Culpepper, who
lives and trains in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   No problem? Competing with him in yesterday's senior men's
12-kilometer race were five of the past seven national champions.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Culpepper surged to a 20-yard lead midway through
the next-to-last lap in the six-lap race and won impressively in 34
minutes, 23 seconds. He was the only runner to break 34{ minutes
and finished seven seconds ahead of runner-up and Adidas teammate
Tony Cosey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've got Shayne's Valentine's Day present,'' Culpepper
said afterward, stuffing the bowl into his bag. ``Before this, I
was going to give her a flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he got the bowl and a trip for two to Northern Ireland
next month. The top six finishers in each of the championship races
qualified for the U.S. team that will compete in the World
Championships March 27-28 in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   Shayne Culpepper will join her husband on the U.S. team because
she was fourth in Sunday's senior women's 4-kilometer race won by
defending champion Amy Rudolph.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's other championship race, Adam Tenforde, a senior at
Hanford High School in Richland, Wash., finished sixth in the
junior men's race to earn a place on the U.S. team. The race,
billed as 8 kilometers but shortened to 7,865 meters, was won by
Luke Watson, a freshman at Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   But the day belonged to the senior men, and that race was
claimed by Culpepper in part because no one else in the field of 96
runners seemed willing to take it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew this was going to be a one-move race,'' Cosey said,
``because the field was so even, but also because a lot of times in
these 12-kilometer events guys run just to make the team.''
</P>
<P>
   With the pace lagging, it was time for someone to do something
because, as Cosey put it, ``It's easy to get stale in the middle of
a race like this.''
</P>
<P>
   But who would be the mover? Not defending champion Tim Hacker.
He finished 43rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kicking yourself because you know no one is running
that hard, yet you can't go any harder,'' Hacker said. ``I tried to
quicken the pace, but I never felt good from the start today.''
</P>
<P>
   Former event winners Reuben Reina (1996 and 1994) and Todd
Williams (1993 and 1991) also struggled, finishing 27th and 14th,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   That left it up to Culpepper, who last year missed a spot on the
U.S. world team by one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just got to the point where I said, `All right, if I'm
going to take this thing, I want to really break away,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alan made the move,'' Cosey said, ``I didn't respond, and
no one else did either.''
</P>
<P>
   That left the rest of the field racing for second through sixth
to qualify for worlds. Cosey beat Dan Middleman (34:31) to the
finish line by a second, and Rodney DeHaven (34:34), Gary Stolz
(34:35) and Clint Wells (34:36) slugged it out down the final
stretch to finish in one-second intervals.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Ray Appenheimer, who led or shared the lead for
three laps only to slip to a non-qualifying seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running a good race,'' he said, shaking his head. Then,
pointing to his head, Appenheimer added, ``But you have to get it
done up here, too.''

US WOMEN KICK OFF AGAINST DENMARK 
</HEADLINE>
 WORLD CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ FIFA president Sepp Blatter predicted Sunday that ``the
future of football is feminine'' during the draw for the third
Women's World Cup. If so, the tournament, scheduled June 19-July 10
at seven United States sites, will be a milestone event.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 tickets have been sold for the tournament, and
the championship match is expected to be sold out at the Rose Bowl
in Pasadena, Calif., making this the most popular women's sporting
event ever.
</P>
<P>
   The US will kick off against Denmark at 3 p.m. Saturday, June
19, at Giants Stadium. US coach Tony DiCicco called Group A the
``unknown group'' because of Nigeria, the Americans' foe June 24 in
Chicago, and North Korea, their opponent June 27 at Foxboro
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there is mystery about many of the teams, since the
women's sport is in the early stages of development. Only China and
Norway have rivaled the US in previous tournaments. The US won the
first Women's World Cup in China in 1991, the Norwegians prevailed
in 1995 in Sweden, and the US captured the first Olympic women's
event in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   What is known is that if the Americans qualify for the second
round, their opponent will be difficult, since the US would meet a
Group B team _ Germany, Brazil, Italy, or Mexico _ at Jack Kent
Cooke Stadium July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Foxboro Stadium will host doubleheaders involving
Australia-Ghana and Norway-Russia June 20, and Mexico-Italy and
US-North Korea June 27; and a semifinal match, which will be part
of a Revolution-MetroStars doubleheader July 4.
</P>
<P>
   Teams likely will choose training sites in the area of their
opening match. Norway, which twice has defeated the US in
exhibitions in the Boston area, likely will set up its camp in New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said Norway is developing ``a new
generation'' of players. The Norwegians are led by captain Linda
Medalen, now a defender, the nation's all-time leading scorer with
61 goals, and striker Marianne Pettersen.
</P>
<P>
   Norway gave the US its only defeat of 1998, a 4-1 decision at
the Algarve Cup in Portugal as Pettersen scored twice. The US edged
the Norwegians, 2-1, in the first Women's World Cup final and
Norway eliminated the US, 1-0, in the 1995 semifinals before
blanking Germany, 2-0, in the title match.
</P>
<P>
   Since the defending champion does not automatically qualify for
the finals, Norway was placed in European qualifying, and had to
rally with victories over Germany and England in its final two
matches. Ragnild Gulbrandsen scored twice in the 3-2 victory over
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The draw prevents the US and Norway from meeting until the final
day of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The US was 22-1-2 in 1998 and is 9-1-1 in World Cup finals play.
The US began the 1995 finals with a 3-3 draw against China as
Michelle Akers was injured in an early collision.
</P>
<P>
   Akers was injured early in Sunday night's US-FIFA World
All-Stars game in San Jose, Calif., while contesting a cross with
Medalen. The World All-Star team won, 2-1, on goals by Canada's
Charmaine Hooper.
</P>
<P>
   The US has the most experienced team in the world, with seven
players with more than 100 international appearances. Julie Foudy,
who scored for the US Sunday night, leads the midfield. The top
scoring threats are Akers, Mia Hamm, and Kristine Lilly, and
goalkeeper Briana Scurry guides defenders Brandi Chastain, Lorrie
Fair, captain Carla Overbeck, and Kate Sobrero.

 PRESSURE MOUNTS ON APPAREL INDUSTRY IN SAIPAN  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAIPAN, Northern Mariana Islands _ Last month, some of America's
biggest clothing companies were caught with their pants _ and
shirts and dresses _ down by a sudden public-relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   A breaking scandal over rampant labor abuses on this tiny
Pacific island cast a pall over the publicity-conscious companies,
which spend billions each year on advertising to create a glamorous
image.
</P>
<P>
   A $1 billion series of class-action lawsuits against the
clothing firms was the newest gambit in a corporate reform movement
stretching from the nation's streets and college campuses to
Fortune 500 boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   At stake in Saipan and elsewhere is the creation of a 21st
century rule book for U.S. industries, such as apparel, that have
moved much of their domestic production to low-wage havens
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than seeking reform through government regulation, this
new movement emphasizes consumer pressure and boardroom lobbying to
create ``codes of conduct'' barring labor and environmental abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Even governments are starting to act as informed consumers. In
San Francisco and elsewhere, local governments are using their
power as purchaser and investor to press corporations to end
sweatshop practices and old-growth logging. Institutions such as
the University of California are joining in.
</P>
<P>
   The movement is deeply divided over goals and tactics. Many of
its leaders are from the Bay Area, ranging from companies such as
Levi Strauss Co. and private-sector alliances such as Business for
Social Responsibility to liberal activist groups such as Global
Exchange and lawmakers such as Rep. George Miller, D-Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits were filed in California and federal courts by
Global Exchange, two other groups and a labor union. The suits
charged The Gap, Gymboree of Burlingame, Tommy Hilfiger, J. Crew,
Nordstrom, Sears and nine other apparel corporations, along with
their Saipan contractors, of creating a system of indentured
servitude on U.S. soil to avoid $200 million in annual customs
duties.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with garment factories in neighboring Asian
countries, which churn out billions of dollars of clothing each
year for the U.S. market, Saipan's manufacturers are would-be
reformers.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the Saipan garment makers adopted a voluntary set
of rules to prevent labor abuses. The code of conduct was based on
the Apparel Industry Partnership, a landmark agreement sponsored by
the White House and signed in 1997 by leading apparel corporations,
human-rights groups and labor unions. The Saipan plan requires
local clothing factories to respect labor rights and safety
standards and to open their plants for regular inspection by
independent monitors.
</P>
<P>
   But as the Saipan contractors quickly found, declarations of
goodwill often are too little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Miller and the Clinton administration renewed a
campaign to remove Saipan's longtime exemption from federal minimum
wage, immigration and customs laws. And after the class-action
lawsuit was filed, several large apparel corporations _ jittery
from the bad publicity and the push from Washington _ canceled or
reduced their contracts on the island.
</P>
<P>
   The Saipan Garment Manufacturers Association, which represents
the island's 33 garment makers, tried in vain to head off the
pressure by suspending two of its member factories after the U.S.
Department of Labor found them liable for an array of labor abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Charron, chairman and chief executive officer of Liz
Claiborne Inc., flew to Saipan last week to warn that the island
``could be a ghost town'' unless sweatshop abuses are eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Charron urged Saipan's garment contractors, which provide about
10 percent of his company's global production, to speed up
enforcement of their code of conduct. ``If we take action now, we
can be an example to the rest of the world and remove the cloud
hanging over Saipan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, for Liz Claiborne, like many corporations that have
adopted codes of conduct, reform doesn't necessarily mean pay
raises.
</P>
<P>
   Charron urged Saipan's contractors and government officials to
fight attempts to end the island's exemption from federal minimum
wage. If the local minimum wage of $3.05 is raised to the federal
level of $5.15 per hour, he said, ``it begins to price (Saipan's
garment industry) out of the competitive global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The garment industry is one of America's most globalized and
hyper-competitive sectors. Many apparel corporations manufacture
little or none of their clothes, instead contracting out the work
to firms in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of men's apparel and 60 percent of women's
apparel sold in the United States is imported, mostly from
low-wage, developing nations. For example, the Gap and Levi Strauss
each have their garments produced by more than 1,000 contractors in
several dozen nations simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, several scandals have linked major corporations
_ clothing brands such as the Gap, Kathie Lee Gifford and Nike, and
coffee outlets such as Starbucks _ to child labor and horrific
sweatshop abuses by their contractors.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, these firms and dozens of Fortune 500 corporations
have created and adopted their own codes of conduct banning labor
abuses, and the Clinton administration has spearheaded the Apparel
Industry Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many economic reasons why companies have adopted
codes of conduct, but helping prevent bad publicity like this
Saipan controversy is clearly a motivator,'' said Aron Cramer, vice
president of Business for Social Responsibility, a San
Francisco-based corporate coalition of Fortune 500 giants and
smaller firms that has taken a key role in the Apparel Industry
Partnership and is advising the Saipan garment manufacturers on
implementation of their reform plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporations are realizing that socially responsible business
practices have real bottom-line benefits'' such as improved quality
control and higher worker motivation, Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   But many industry leaders say that despite the economic benefits
of reform, sweatshop-style cost-cutting remains more profitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a shark-feeding frenzy in this industry in the past
30 years,'' said Paul Gill, executive director of Made By the Bay,
a San Francisco-based coalition of garment factory owners, labor
unions and government that is trying to help the Bay Area's apparel
industry _ with 20,000 local manufacturing jobs _ survive against
foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``As trade barriers go down, work gets sent overseas and the
cost of labor becomes the variable. So abuses become all too
common, and that's what we're competing against,'' Gill said.
</P>
<P>
   Codes of conduct are a great idea, most observers agree. The
only problem is that almost no one agrees on what they should cover
or how they should be enforced. For example, disagreement is
widespread over whether codes should require corporations to do the
following:
</P>
<P>
   --Publicly disclose the identities and locations of all their
contractors. No codes do.
</P>
<P>
   --Ensure freedom of organization for workers, even in nations
such as China where the government bans independent unions and
jails their leaders. Most codes don't.
</P>
<P>
   --Require contractors to pay the nation's prevailing
garment-industry wage or a higher ``living wage'' _ a level defined
as covering the total basic needs of an average-size family,
divided by the average numbers of wage earners in a family. Most
codes require only the prevailing wage.
</P>
<P>
   --Require contractors on Saipan to prohibit their labor
recruiters in China, the Philippines, Bangladesh and other nations
from charging workers exorbitant recruitment fees, effectively
creating a system of indentured servitude in Saipan. (No overseas
locations have a similar system.) No codes do.
</P>
<P>
   Between the high-sounding rhetoric and the dog-eat-dog
international competition, there is often little room for
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   In Saipan, industry leaders say consumers had better take what
they get and not demand too much from a fashion label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working conditions here are far better than in any of the
countries we compete with,'' said Richard Pierce, executive
director of the Saipan Garment Manufacturers' Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the apparel companies leave Saipan because of this bad
publicity, they'll just go to Mexico or China. Now tell me, would
that make things better?''

 CHRON - NET FILES  
 THE NET FILES/JON SWARTZ  &HT;     Amazon _ Read at Your Own Risk 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Amazon.com misled the public and paid the price with a public
relations shellacking. But did it commit an unpardonable sin on the
wild, wild Web, where the lines between advertising and editorial
content are frequently fuzzy? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   To one degree or another, most commercial Web sites intersperse
paid ads with news, feature stories and opinion pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, e-commerce giant Amazon.com admitted that it charges
book publishers for premium placement of certain recommendations on
its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   While a lot of people interpreted that as charging advertisers
for positive reviews, Amazon says it doesn't cross that line.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; You be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing visitors encounter when they enter Amazon.com is
a feature titled, ``What We're Reading,'' that features books
selected by its staff reviewers.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon insists that an advertiser cannot pay to have its book
recommended in this section though it can pay to have it placed
prominently or for an extended period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity storm prompted Amazon to adopt a new policy:
Beginning in March, it will identify which featured placements have
been paid for and which haven't. The Seattle company also offered a
full refund to anyone who bought a book that was recommended on the
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Amazon incident gave the company a black eye and temporarily
could bruise e-commerce sales. But the real issue is this: Who
should be responsible for differentiating between editorial and
advertising content on the Web _ the site operator or the consumer?
Experts are divided over the question.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Online vendors _ not consumers _ should be responsible for
clearly identifying what is editorial content and what is paid,
says Paul Grabowicz, coordinator of the New Media program in the
Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you charge (for placement of) recommendations and claim
they're objective, that creates a credibility gap between you and
your customers,'' Grabowicz said. ``You have to come clean, or it
blows up. Hopefully, (the Amazon disclosure) will get others in
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Or will it?
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, who tracks e-commerce for Jupiter
Communications in New York, argues that Amazon.com is a classic
merchandiser that is simply abiding by well-established retail
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no coincidence that Budweiser gets an end (display) in a
grocery store instead of Miller. That's because they paid for it,''
Vanderbilt says.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery stores don't place a sign on their end displays saying
that Bud paid for the space. So why should Amazon?
</P>
<P>
   ``If consumers don't understand the same thing is happening
online, then they're being foolish,'' Vanderbilt adds. ``Like
brick-and-mortar booksellers, Amazon.com and others are not
promoting certain titles out of the editorial kindness of their
hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   A major difference between the Web and traditional media is that
retailers usually don't own newspapers or magazines or TV stations.
Through years of experience with these media, consumers usually
know what is an ad and what is independent news and opinion. No one
would ever confuse a Target store and Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But many retailers do own their own Web sites and create them to
look a lot like online newspapers and magazines. The rules _ for ad
placement and disclosure _ still are being written.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``clearly, it is up to consumers to take
responsibility because there is no government authority over the
Net. They need to embrace self discipline,'' agreed Bob Rucker, a
former CNN correspondent and journalism professor at San Jose State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker said he looks at hundreds of commercial Web sites but
can't remember any that clearly differentiate between editorial
content and sales pitches. ``That's probably by design,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One exception is BabyCenter.com. The San Francisco Web site says
it provides ``guidance and gear for expectant parents'' and has
stories on topics such as twins and toilet training.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom of its site is a section labeled, ``Featured Areas
from Our Sponsors,'' that includes about a dozen articles such as
``A Safer Ride brought to you by General Motors'' and ``College
Savings brought to you by Charles Schwab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is to never violate the trust of our readers,''
BabyCenter CEO Matt Glickman said. ``It's easy to be tempted to
cash in in the short term, which is what happened to Amazon, but it
undermines the long-term credibility you're trying to build with
customers. We will accept money for ad placements, and we will make
that clear to our users.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has adopted a hands-off policy toward
the Internet, encouraging self regulation that so far has put few
limits on what and how things are sold online. Although that has
fueled an explosion in e-commerce sales and helped the overall
economy, it also has led to many misunderstandings.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as online retailers are under the gun to sell ads to
survive, don't expect the rest of the industry to turn virtuous
overnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE FORGOTTEN &QL; 
When you're a fledgling startup in the go-go Internet industry,
forget about trifling details like sales, profits and long-range
plans. The cardinal rule is: Cash in with a jaw-dropping stock
offering while the market is hot.
</P>
<P>
   Before there was an eBay, industry wags were drooling over
Marimba, which once was touted as the Next Big Thing on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, however, the onetime ``push'' company has yet
to cash in. Kim Polese, the Marimba CEO who once graced the pages
of Time magazine, has all but vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word that Marimba is preparing an initial public
offering for the spring. Company officials aren't talking.
</P>
<P>
   Marimba has spent the past year trying to distance itself from
push technology, which broadcasts custom-tailored information over
the Internet directly to a PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Menlo Park company has repositioned its products and now
distributes software updates and content over corporate networks.
It boasts more than 800 customers, including Federal Express and
Ford Motor.
</P>
<P>
   If it doesn't pull off an IPO soon, however, it runs the risk of
gaining an asterisk in Internet history as one of the biggest
busts.
</P>
<P>

   1. LEARNING TO FORECAST THE MYSTERIOUS EL NINO El Nino helped
make 1998 the hottest year ever recorded. Its dramatic weather
changes have been linked to an upsurge of diseases such as cholera,
malaria and dengue fever around the globe, as well as a brutal
drought in Texas, wildfires in Indonesia and Brazil, marine mammal
deaths in the western Pacific and a host of other woes. Scientists
are hard at work trying to improve their ability to predict El Nino
so we can prepare for the extremes of weather. Meanwhile, there is
speculation that global warming may be compounding El Nino's
effect. By Carl Zimmer. From Discover magazine. 1,000 words +
photos. 2. DEAD IN THE WATER Two dozen Pakistani sailors aboard the
Delta Pride have been abandoned in the Gulf of Mexico for more than
six months. The merchant marine, even now the lifeblood of
international commerce, is still a hazardous calling. By Thomas
Hackett. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (3,500
words) and edited article available. 3. EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT
SHOWS PROMISE FOR CHILDHOOD ARTHRITIS Rheumatoid arthritis is an
auto-immune disease that affects millions of people worldwide. It
occurs when, for unknown reasons, a person's immune cells begin to
attack their joints. In many cases, the disease causes severe
disability. In a new study, Dutch researchers report they have been
able to curb the autoimmune attack in four children with a severe
form of childhood arthritis that could not be controlled with drugs
by giving the children bone marrow transplants. By Michael
McCarthy. The Lancet News Service. 1,000 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 4.
KOSOVO GIMMICKS, NOT THREATS, MAY BUY TIME The new element in the
Kosovo talks now going on at Rambouillet near Paris was underlined
by President Jacques Chirac in his formal welcoming speech. It is
that Europe can no longer tolerate war on its continent. By Flora
Lewis. 800 words.
_______________________________________________________________ 5.
CREATING COLETTE In our time, when authors and biographers debate
the morality of plundering other peoples' lives, it is a guilty
pleasure to plunge into a world where everyone's life was fair
game. No sooner was a liaison begun or ended than it appeared
thinly disguised in a gossip column, humorous essay or novel. No
writer has plundered her own life and the lives of those around her
so successfully as the French writer Colette. The first volume of a
biography of Colette effectively destroys the old myth that she was
an innocent, inexperienced girl from Burgundy exploited by a
no-talent husband 13 years her senior who locked her in her room to
write and published the ``Claudine'' novels under his name. Julie
Martin reviews ``Creating Colette'' by Claude Francis and Fernande
Gontier. From The New York Times Book Review. 1,500 words.

   A. Despite Misgivings, Herbal Medicine Flourishes Herbal
medicine, the mainstay of therapeutics for centuries before modern
purified drugs relegated it to the status of near-quackery, has in
the last five years emerged from the fringes of health care with an
astonishing flourish and now shows clear signs of joining the
medical mainstream. By Jane E. Brody. 3,000 words + graphic.

   B. In Nepal, Arranged Marriage Gives Way to Courtship by Missive
In an isolated village in Nepal, ancient traditions are changing --
foremost among them, the ritual of courtship. Young people are now
writing love letters, for a reason. The practice of parental
matchmaking is being abandoned, and in its place come love letters
that reach out to grab the future. By Erica Goode. 1,300 words. 7.
ON THE LATIN EMPIRE Frangoise Waquet has written a cultural history
of Latin in the modern era. She looks at why Latin continued to
play a key role in the education of elites at a time when it had
ceased to be professionally useful. The practice of Latin became
not only a criterion of exclusion for women, who were regarded as
``illiterate'' since, with very few exceptions, Latin was omitted
from their education, but also an instrument of domination over
peoples. Latin was a vehicle not only of ostentation and authority,
but of ``forbidden'' knowledge. As Gustave Flaubert put it:
``Beware of quotations in Latin; they always conceal something
risqui.'' By Roger Chartier. Le Monde. 1,500 words. (English
translation available.)

ENOUGH OF IMPEACHMENT, IT'S TIME FOR SOMETHING CRUCIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1999 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The end of the Clinton impeachment trial, which did not begin
with a bang and has not ended with a whimper, means we finally can
get on to something more important. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For you that may mean the Academy Awards or how to make up to
your sweetheart for buying her an ironing board for Valentine's
Day. My focus will be more substantial. I intend to revel in the
opening of baseball spring training. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the pitchers and catchers show up and begin to work
out muscles made sore by a winter of punching adding machines to
keep track of their money, it's time to think about the evolving
language of our national pastime. For there's no question that it's
changing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When I was a boy listening to the likes of Jack Brickhouse
broadcast Chicago Cubs' games, I heard about fastballs and curves.
It was not until I was well along in my own young-adult baseball
ineptitude that sliders first came to my attention. Later, I
learned about slurves, a term now almost as extinct as bunts by a
clean-up hitters. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays the language of pitching has become even more technical
and abstruse. We hear, for instance, about cut fastballs and
four-seam fastballs and circle change-ups and other bizarre
deliveries whose meaning is, quite simply, beyond my ability to
grasp. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the people who invent the recondite language of
high-tech systems analysis have bled the stifling complexity of
their enterprise onto the baseball diamond. My-oh-my-oh-my. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for us I know a man who can help us through this maddening
morass. The mortal Paul Dickson, who began watching major league
baseball as a child in 1946 at Yankee Stadium, has just published a
revised edition of a baseball word book he first released 10 years
ago. This is ``The New Dickson Baseball Dictionary,'' and its
(arguably impossible) task is to offer a compendium of terms used
in baseball along with a guess as to their meaning. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This new edition, as Dickson says, acknowledges that ``the game
has continued to change, occasioning the need for terms like `wild
card,' `realignment,' `Executive Council,' `interleague play' and
`acting commissioner.' '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One helpful thing about Dickson's collection is that now and
then he helps us see how and when the evolution of baseball's
jargon occurred. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, under the entry ``hit for the cycle'' _ which
means a batter in one game has singled, doubled, tripled and
homered (though not necessarily in that order) _ Dickson quotes
slugger Dave Kingman after he accomplished this rare feat in 1972:
``When Chris Speier mentioned it to me in the dugout, I didn't know
what it meant. I had never done it, and I had never even heard of
it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the same entry, we learn the wonderful story that former
umpire Ron Luciano told about Lou Piniella, whom Luciano described
as the worst baserunner in history: ``He ran for the cycle. In a
single game he managed to get himself thrown out at every base.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There also are lots of references in Dickson's book to the
changing financial realities of major league baseball. For
instance, there's an entry for ``small market club,'' meaning a
low-revenue team in a relatively thinly populated area, such as the
Kansas City Royals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the real surprise of the new book is that this is not found
among the meanings of ``foul ball'': First pitch thrown out by a
disgraced president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

 By SCOTT VEALE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A MOTHER'S PLACE: CHOOSING WORK AND FAMILY WITHOUT GUILT OR
BLAME &LR;  By Susan Chira. Harper Perennial, $13. Chira, the deputy
foreign editor of The New York Times, argues that parenting and
working are compatible and helpful to mothers and children, and
that day care is not harmful. In 1998 the Times reviewer Carol
Tavris said this ``splendid book ... makes an eloquent,
well-documented case that motherhood does not require martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RIVEN ROCK &LR;  By T. Coraghessan Boyle. Penguin, $13.95. Stanley
McCormick is a rich schizoid who spends 20 years holed up in his
California mansion out of sight of women because he both loves and
hates them too much. That includes his wife, a scientist,
suffragist and lifelong virgin who remains loyal to her husband
through all his years of madness. Surprisingly, both characters in
this ambitious novel are based on actual early-20th-century
figures. In 1998 D.M. Thomas wrote that even though the prose
strayed toward the purple, ``the book is filled with good writing
and richly observed scenes; it has humanity and humor in
abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PAINTING BY NUMBERS: KOMAR AND MELAMID'S SCIENTIFIC GUIDE TO
ART &LR;  Edited by JoAnn Wypijewski. University of California, $24.95.
Noting the gap between a democratic culture and its elitist art
world, two mischievous Soviet exiles, Vitaly Komar and Alexander
Melamid, conducted opinion polls to find out what people prefer to
see in paintings, and then set out to give the public what it
wants. Their audacious project is ``funny, prickly, complex,
humane, dense with implications and a baited trap for ideologues
and hypocrites,'' Luc Sante wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MANET'S MODERNISM: OR, THE FACE OF PAINTING IN THE 1860S &LR;  By
Michael Fried. University of Chicago, $35. This book explains the
pioneering quality of Manet's work, which was considered to be ugly
and obscure in its day. In 1996 Arthur C. Danto called this ``art
history of the highest originality and distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TURN, MAGIC WHEEL &LR;  By Dawn Powell. Steerforth, $14. In this
comic novel set in prewar New York, a young writer betrays a close
friend by publishing a book that trashes her former husband, a
famous novelist living abroad, and exposes her as sadly delusional
about her past. In 1936 in The New York Times Book Review, Edith H.
Walton called this ``a barbed and immensely entertaining satire on
a certain phase of New York's literary life.'' The same publisher
has reissued one of Powell's earlier novels,  &UR; DANCE NIGHT &LR;  ($14), a
love story about two sensitive teen-agers who dream of escaping
their working-class Ohio town, where all the social life takes
place at the local dance hall. ``Out of `Dance Night' emerge
unforgettably real people, drawn with an unerring instinct for
characterization,'' the Times Book Review said in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER: A STORY OF TWO TOWNS, A DEATH, AND
AMERICA'S DILEMMA &LR;  By Alex Kotlowitz. Anchor/Doubleday, $14.95. A
Wall Street Journal reporter probes the death of a black teen-ager
in Michigan, revealing a sharp divide between the local black and
white communities and a mystery full of contradictions. The result
is ``a chronicle of American racial attitudes seen through the
lenses of a signal event and a specimen landscape,'' Alec Wilkinson
wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHAT'S GOING ON: PERSONAL ESSAYS &LR;  By Nathan McCall. Vintage,
$11. This takes on such topical subjects as the African-American
middle class and the culture of pickup basketball. In 1997 the
reviewer Michael E. Ross found the terrain to be somewhat familiar,
but praised the author's ``moral authority.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JESUS SAVES &LR;  By Darcey Steinke. Grove, $12. The parallel
stories of two troubled girls _ a teen-ager abducted from summer
camp and a Lutheran minister's daughter with a seriously twisted
boyfriend _ give the author an opportunity to explore the
strip-mall culture and Gothic religious sensibility of the suburban
South. In 1997 Catherine Texier called this ``a consistently and
disturbingly beautiful'' novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE VIEW FROM POMPEY'S HEAD &LR;  By Hamilton Basso. Louisiana State
University, $16.95. Anson Page is a young Wall Street lawyer
dispatched to his Southern hometown to solve a thorny business
crisis; revisiting his roots, he discovers he abandoned a part of
himself when he moved to the city. The reviewer John Brooks called
this ``the most pleasantly and sensibly romantic novel to come my
way in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HERMITS: THE INSIGHTS OF SOLITUDE &LR;  By Peter France. St.
Martin's Griffin, $13.95. The author finds much to admire in the
lives of famous hermits through the ages, notably their redemptive
spirit and formidable skills of discernment. In 1997 the reviewer
Carol Zaleski called this ``a gently understated affirmation of the
solitude for which many of us long.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SALT &LR;  By Earl Lovelace. Persea, $15. This Trinidadian novel
revolves around a spinner of folk tales who represents the island's
native values, and a teacher turned politician whose adherence to
European ideals consigns him to a life of disillusionment. In 1997
the reviewer William Ferguson praised the book's ``generous,
torrential prose.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Wounded and enraged, Clinton-zilla lurches left!
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a delicious new thrill running through conservatives,
who sometimes seem to like nothing more than scaring themselves
with lurid frights. This one has President Clinton veering to the
far left after escaping the impeachment posse.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario figures that the president owes his survival to the
Democratic Party's base, which is defined by conservatives as
left-wing, and so must now do whatever the Democratic left wants.
There are a couple of things amiss with this.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the GOP right has spent six years denouncing Clinton
as a crazed left-winger already. His first budget was going to
bankrupt the country and make bag ladies out of stock-club ladies.
Actually, it boosted bag ladies into the market. His national
health care plan was going to ``socialize'' medicine. Instead, the
private sector is socializing it through HMOs. Some leftism.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in order to have their scare, conservatives have to recast
Clinton as moderate after all, so they can fear his leftward turn.
Awkward.
</P>
<P>
   A somewhat larger problem is the simple fact that there is no
left-wing in this country. (Keep that to yourself. Talk radio
couldn't stand the shock.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic left''? What on Earth would that be? It turns out,
upon inspection, to be folks who want to raise the minimum wage,
think well of Social Security and fret, almost always futilely,
that the rich-poor gap in this country leaves some of our people
living in a sort of in-house Third World.
</P>
<P>
   For a left wing, we have only environmental groups that may
feather toward the fringe at their edges but in the main reflect a
national consensus; Planned Parenthood, whose support of lawful
abortion mirrors majority opinion; the American Civil Liberties
Union, a zealot about the Constitution; outfits like People for the
American Way, keen for anything even vaguely liberal but
particularly vivacious on behalf of church-state separation, as
were our Founding Fathers.
</P>
<P>
   And that hoary bugaboo, the AFL-CIO, although unions go back
more than a century and are as often conservative _ currently, for
instance, in fighting free trade _ as liberal. And maybe
gun-control advocates, who hold _ again as the Founders did, most
citizens do and as the courts always have _ that the Second
Amendment isn't absolute.
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, radical characters from left to right,
from ranters like Louis Farrakhan to the woodsy militia creeps, but
neither fringe has standing in either party.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in the late '60s and early '70s were benumbed by their
outres _ Animal-Rights Hysterics for Free Love and Unilateral
Disarmament, or some such. They paid a political price. Now it is
Republicans' turn, as their party cozies with would-be theocrats
and loopy divines. The Rev. Jerry Falwell has it that one of kid
TV's ``Teletubbies'' is a gay stalker. The GOP is beginning to pay,
too.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, the natural gravity of American politics still pulls
toward the middle. Bill Clinton _ the ol' triangulator, splitter of
all differences _ is of all people almost laughable as a looming
left-wing bogeyman.

   WASHINGTON _ In the end, it was not so much the evidence that
saved him, and certainly not his awesome communications skills. It
was not even the economy.
</P>
<P>
   It was his office.
</P>
<P>
   While almost every member of Congress says that William
Jefferson Clinton cheapened  &UR; his &LR;  presidency, a critical mass of
senators chose not to follow his example by casting a vote they
believed would diminish  &UR; the &LR;  presidency.
</P>
<P>
   On neither charge, not perjury nor obstruction of justice, did a
majority agree with Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., who told the
Senate: ``To keep a president in office whose gross misconduct and
criminal actions are a well-established fact will weaken the
authority of the presidency, undermine the rule of law, and cheapen
those words which have made America different from most other
nations on Earth: Equal Justice Under Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Senate seemed more taken with the argument of the
president's lawyers: ``These kinds of wrongs are simply not
subjects fit for impeachment. To remove a president on this basis
would lower the impeachment bar to an unprecedented level and
create a devastating precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   The senators seemed to conclude that their former colleague,
Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., had it right when, speaking for the
president, he told them: ``If you vote to convict, in my opinion,
you're going to create more havoc than he could ever possibly
create. After all, he's only got two more years left.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so,  &UR; the &LR;  presidency is a weaker office today than it was
on Jan. 20, 1993, when Clinton first assumed it. A series of
judicial decisions, provoked by the relentlessness of his enemies
and by a short-sighted Clinton defense that considered only him,
and not the office he held, have undercut the immunity from
ordinary legal processes that he and his predecessors assumed they
possessed.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic change came in May 1997, when the Supreme
Court ruled that a sitting president was not immune from a civil
lawsuit like Paula Jones'. It held, among other things, that a
lawsuit would be ``highly unlikely to occupy any substantial
amount'' of the president's time.
</P>
<P>
   The breathtaking naivete of that conclusion is only part of the
problem, though it is hard to imagine that future presidents will
not find enemies clever enough to file pleadings, demand discovery
and take depositions.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem for some future president is that the
language of the opinion suggested, in the opinion of Professor
Ronald Rotunda of the University of Illinois Law School, ``that the
Constitution provides no bar to the indictment, trial and
conviction of a sitting president for a federal crime.'' Rotunda is
an adviser to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and his opinion
has apparently convinced Starr of the constitutionality of
indicting Clinton any time at all, though it may not have convinced
him it would be the wise thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   That case went to the Supreme Court because the president would
not include an apology as part of a settlement. That same sort of
doggedness, sometimes by Clinton and sometimes by Starr, provoked
other court rulings that may make the lives of future presidents
riskier and their connections to their advisers less frank.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, seeking evidence that Clinton was alone with Monica
Lewinsky or perhaps even observed in flagrante with her, subpoenaed
Secret Service agents despite intense arguments from the service
that making its agents potential witnesses would make presidents
less willing to keep them close. Congress may someday legislate a
protective privilege and undo the court decision upholding Starr,
but was the information he sought worth the risk?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly Clinton, by interposing a string of losing objections
to testimony by his aides, forced a clarification of the law of
executive privilege that has to make it harder for future
presidents to keep secrets from Congress _ the body against which
that privilege is typically cited. This points toward what Douglas
Brinkley, a Carter biographer at the University of New Orleans,
calls the potential ``glass house effect _ treating the president
as not a human being, where everything they think or dream or
mutter is fair game.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond those hard legal facts, there are no certainties about
how this case will affect the office Clinton holds. Charles Jones,
a retired political-science professor from the University of
Wisconsin, said that is so because it is difficult to separate
Clinton personally from the office he holds. ``If that had been
easy to do,'' Jones said, ``he might well have been gone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Jones said, ``if what has gone on is more about Clinton
than the presidency, then the long-term effects may not be great.''
Others, like Arthur Schlesinger Jr., a historian retired from the
City University of New York, feel that a cheapened impeachment,
even without a conviction, will leave a wounded, weakened
presidency behind.
</P>
<P>
   Because politics in Washington is not a zero-sum game, a
weakened presidency is possible without some other institution
seizing its power. Certainly Congress, which used the weakness of
President Richard M. Nixon facing impeachment and then Nixon's
resignation to gain strength, has neither the prestige nor the
agenda to do anything similar today.

   Alan Brinkley, a Columbia University history professor (and no

   In the lawyers' arguments, and in the senators' speeches, there
was a sense of foreboding over the impeachment verdict, about how

damage Americans' faith in their leaders and their rule of law
reflected a very short memory; presidential lies about Vietnam, not
under oath to be sure, had a lot more impact on the lives and
deaths of Americans than anything Clinton may have said about sex
and how to conceal it. Even so, now the test will be whether the
accusers were right that alleged perjury gone unpunished will shake
the Republic.

American government are much more resilient and elastic than we

SEX ON THE WITNESS STAND: GET USED TO IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By WILLIAM GLABERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't just about sex. Or was it?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, graphic sexual detail was a main focus of the
Clinton scandal, and like it or not, that was partly because the
legal system has come to permit extensive questioning about
once-private matters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was ridiculed for his tortured legalistic
explanations of who did what to whom. However unpopular his hair
splitting, the case highlighted a reality of modern legal culture:
Sexual acts are grounds for litigious scrutiny far more often _ and
in far more detail _ than most people realize.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, one legacy of the impeachment trial is a
re-examination in politics, academia and in communities around the
country of how the law in a formerly puritanical country got so
sexualized. A debate is beginning over what might be called the
law's obsession with sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the aftermath of this, people can say, `Let's shut the door
on the whole thing; we don't even want to know about any of this,'
and have a sweeping libertarian definition of privacy, which would
undermine many issues of fundamental importance to women's
equality,'' said Jane Larson, a feminist legal scholar at the
University of Wisconsin Law School.
</P>
<P>
   American sexual attitudes have always included swirling
contradictions, and so it's not surprising that the impeachment
aftermath includes divergent schools of thought about sex and the
law. The ``enough is enough'' school suggests that sex has become a
distraction from more important legal matters. And some people who
believe that sexual litigation has gone too far cite as evidence
the public's widespread revulsion over the sexual details that were
talked about at length by lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   A second school of thought suggests that sexual matters are so
central to modern life that the courts cannot avoid getting more
deeply involved in such issues. ``Get used to it,'' Professor
Larson said.
</P>
<P>
   Any debate about sexual explicitness in the courts is also a
veiled debate about legal changes introduced as a result of the
women's movement. Starting in the 1970s, for example, prosecutors
showed new interest in acquaintance-rape cases and other sexual
crimes more subtle than violent rapes by strangers. New civil
claims like sexual harassment were born that required lawyers to
delve into details.
</P>
<P>
   The ``enough is enough'' argument, some say, is little more than
repackaged gender politics. ``I don't think this theme of revulsion
would be there if it wasn't in the context of Clinton, but it has
been lurking and bubbling there about sexual-harassment law,'' said
Elizabeth Schneider, a professor at Brooklyn Law School.
</P>
<P>
   But some proposals to reduce the law's focus on sex come from an
unexpected quarter: feminist legal scholars who argue that the
concentration on sexual interaction has hurt women because it has
diverted attention from wider issues that affect women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Schultz, a Yale Law School professor, has attracted
national attention by arguing that the courts' preoccupation with
sexual issues has undermined the goals of civil rights laws.
Courts, she said, have often lost sight of such questions as
whether women receive equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, sexualized interaction occurs,'' Professor Schultz said.
``But it is only one tool among many used against women. But we
have become obsessively focused on, `Did he make a sexual
advance?'''
</P>
<P>
   The focus has become so narrow, she said, that courts often
dismiss harassment claims filed by women. She mentioned as one
example a case of a woman supervisor who said men at work had made
it impossible for her to do her job by laughing dismissively
whenever she issued orders. But since the supervisor did not claim
she had been subject to sexual advances, a court said she had no
case.
</P>
<P>
   In hundreds of such cases, Professor Schultz said, courts have
said they are powerless to act because there is no evidence of a
hostile work environment unless there is evidence of sexual
advances.
</P>
<P>
   If there are two distinct schools of thought about sex and the
legal system, the ``Get used to it'' advocates seem to have the
momentum, with some judges and scholars arguing that a modern
justice system must pay increased attention to sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a few states, for example, judges have begun to consider
cases of ``sexual fraud,'' an offense that reverses decades of
modern law by defining sex as a transaction much like any other
that can be a ground for suit. One partner's false statement of
sexual health, for example, could be a basis for courtroom inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a University of Chicago law professor, Stephen
Schulhofer, argues that rape law is too narrowly focused on whether
an attacker uses violence. He urges that the legal system expand
the definition of rape to include other forms of intimidation
beyond violence, like the coercion of women to have sex with men
who have power over them, like professors, therapists or lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal, advanced in ``Unwanted Sex'' (Harvard University,
1998), would sharply expand the need for testimony about how and
why sexual acts occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Professor Larson and a colleague are drawing notice
with a new book that argues that lawyers and judges should shake
off remaining inhibitions and dive more fully into the sexual fray.
In ``Hard Bargains: The Politics of Sex'' (Oxford University),
Professor Larson and Linda Hirshman, a professor at Brandeis
University, maintain that the legal system should expand its focus
on some forms of sexual activity because shifting sex roles dictate
changes in a legal system they say was designed to assure that men
retained control in sexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest that the law abandon its preoccupation with
some sexual matters, arguing, for instance, that prostitution
should be decriminalized. But they add that in many instances more
regulation of sexual activity is warranted _ for example, a
betrayed spouse should be allowed to sue the sexual partner of the
betraying spouse for money damages.

whenever she issued orders. But since the supervisor did not claim
she had been subject to sexual advances, a court said she had no
case.
</P>
<P>
   In hundreds of such cases, Professor Schultz said, courts have
said they are powerless to act because there is no evidence of a
hostile work environment unless there is evidence of sexual
advances.
</P>
<P>
   If there are two distinct schools of thought about sex and the
legal system, the ``Get used to it'' advocates seem to have the
momentum, with some judges and scholars arguing that a modern
justice system must pay increased attention to sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   In a few states, for example, judges have begun to consider
cases of ``sexual fraud,'' an offense that reverses decades of
modern law by defining sex as a transaction much like any other
that can be a ground for suit. One partner's false statement of
sexual health, for example, could be a basis for courtroom inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a University of Chicago law professor, Stephen
Schulhofer, argues that rape law is too narrowly focused on whether
an attacker uses violence. He urges that the legal system expand
the definition of rape to include other forms of intimidation
beyond violence, like the coercion of women to have sex with men
who have power over them, like professors, therapists or lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   His proposal, advanced in ``Unwanted Sex'' (Harvard University,
1998), would sharply expand the need for testimony about how and
why sexual acts occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Professor Larson and a colleague are drawing notice
with a new book that argues that lawyers and judges should shake
off remaining inhibitions and dive more fully into the sexual fray.
In ``Hard Bargains: The Politics of Sex'' (Oxford University),
Professor Larson and Linda Hirshman, a professor at Brandeis
University, maintain that the legal system should expand its focus
on some forms of sexual activity because shifting sex roles dictate
changes in a legal system they say was designed to assure that men
retained control in sexual relationships.
</P>
<P>
   They also suggest that the law abandon its preoccupation with
some sexual matters, arguing, for instance, that prostitution
should be decriminalized. But they add that in many instances more
regulation of sexual activity is warranted _ for example, a
betrayed spouse should be allowed to sue the sexual partner of the
betraying spouse for money damages.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the legal system has always had to deal with
sex. But getting used to it has taken time. Prosecutors in rape
cases have always had to prove that sexual penetration occurred.
But until a few decades ago, it was routine for courtrooms in some
places to be closed or women excused when the details were
discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Until the early 1960s, adultery was one of the few grounds for
divorce in many states. But proof of the sex act was often avoided
with oblique testimony about such issues as arrival and departure
times from hotel rooms, said Carol Sanger, a professor at Columbia
Law School. ``Adultery came into court quite a lot,'' Professor
Sanger said. ``But there was no sex.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, very discreet state laws prohibited
oral sex and other disapproved sex acts in language drafted with
such propriety that the acts were seldom actually mentioned. One
Florida statute forbade ``the abominable and detestable crime
against nature'' without describing exactly what that crime was.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1975 decision, the Supreme Court approved of such
discretion in drafting legislation. ``Anyone who cared to do so,''
the court said in an unsigned opinion, ``could certainly determine
what particular acts have been considered crimes against nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Since those days, sexual controversies of extraordinary variety
have landed in court. In fact, the courts have been an important
forum in the revolution in sexual attitudes, said Richard Posner, a
leading conservative who is chief judge of the 7th Circuit U.S.
Court of Appeals in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Posner wrote ``Sex and Reason'' (Harvard University, 1992),
which he described as a book intended to shame fellow judges into
learning more about the sexual issues they routinely face in court.
</P>
<P>
   Posner said such education was necessary because the courts have
been flooded with all kinds of sexual issues, including cases
involving child molestation, palimony, Internet pornography and
even sex change operations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the courts have opened their doors to subjects that
were once seen as salacious, society has come to see sex as just
another subject for the numbing routine of litigation. For judges
caught in the avalanche of descriptions of body parts, Posner said,
sex is now a stock in trade.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, judges everywhere have lost the inhibitions that
once helped limit courtroom explicitness. ``If you are a butcher,''
Posner said, ``you are not squeamish about blood.''

BETTER LOVING THROUGH CHEMISTRY: SURE, WE'VE GOT A PILL FOR THAT

<P>
   Given the national spectacle set off by a pair of runaway
libidos, it might seem an odd moment in history to suggest that
what Americans really need is medical help to juice up their sex
drives.
</P>
<P>
   But that is precisely what researchers said last week on the
basis of a survey showing that 43 percent of women and 31 percent
of men suffered from ``sexual dysfunction'' _ a catchall diagnosis
applied to troubles like lack of interest in sex, inability to have
an orgasm, difficulty with erection or finding sex painful or not
pleasurable. Writing in the Journal of the American Medical
Association, the researchers called this sexual malaise ``a
significant public health concern'' and said work was needed to
develop ``appropriate therapies,'' especially for women.
</P>
<P>
   Such therapies might include counseling, hormone treatments,
and, if studies now under way indicate it helps, giving the drug
Viagra to women as well as men, the researchers said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean that disappointment in the bedroom, once
considered part of life's normal ups and downs, should become the
next frontier in public health policy, another enemy to be
conquered along with heart disease, cancer, AIDS and drug
addiction? Do 43 percent of American women and a third of men
really need or want professional help between the sheets?
</P>
<P>
   The sex survey might be taken as an example of creeping
medicalization: a trend to seize upon aches and pains that people
used to live with and declare them dysfunctions that must be
treated. Where it was once acceptable to leave certain conditions
alone, doing so now might be considered cruel neglect.
Medicalization transforms people into patients and creates new
markets for specialty clinics, diagnostic tests, pills, shots,
self-help books, diet plans and the ultimate cash cow _ regular
medical monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Industries have sprung up to cash in on menopause, prescribe
psychiatric drugs for troubled dogs, diagnose the vaguest of back
pains, counsel people who want sex too much and now, of course,
tune up those who do not want sex enough.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion that more people need sex doctors was trumpeted
nationwide on radio and television and on the front pages of
newspapers. But there were problems with the study that produced
this conclusion. For one thing, it was based on a new analysis of
old data that had already been published in a 1994 book.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, two of the authors had served as paid consultants to
Pfizer, the manufacturer of Viagra, which could see a doubling of
its market for the drug if the studies in women were to pan out.
The authors' financial connection was not mentioned, due to ``an
oversight'' at the Journal of the American Medical Association,
according to Dr. Richard Glass, an editor there.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer did not pay for the sex survey, but the authors'
relationship with the company raised questions nonetheless, because
drug companies have an obvious interest in research that suggests
expanded uses for their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must stop ignoring female sexual dysfunction,'' said Dr.
Raymond Rosen, co-director of the Center for Sexual and Marital
Health at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Brunswick,
N.J. and one of the Pfizer consultants who wrote the article.
``That's what I'm hoping will come out of this survey, accelerated
research on female sexual dysfunction.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosen said Viagra was ``being very actively studied'' in women,
on the theory that it might stimulate sexual response in them as it
does in men, by increasing blood flow to the genitals. He said the
male hormone testosterone was also being tested as a means of
enhancing sex drive in women past menopause, along with estrogen,
which can strengthen vaginal tissue and improve lubrication.
</P>
<P>
   Before such treatments were proposed, when sexual desire waxed
and waned, people were more willing to chalk it up to the passage
of years or the good times and bad that characterize most lives.
But drugs like Viagra and hormones that can affect sex drive have
created a powerful incentive for both drug companies and doctors to
find new customers. One way to do that is to label the lack of
desire an abnormal condition in need of treatment, which may create
a social climate in which people who are not in the mood often
enough are expected to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   The trend has advantages in providing relief for conditions that
people used to suffer from. Viagra, for instance, has been a boon
to some impotent men and their partners. But researchers point out
that providing more and more medical care for more and more
ailments, particularly conditions that do not directly threaten
health, can have a downside as well. In addition to costing a lot,
extra treatment exposes people to extra risks. Another paper
published recently in the same journal as the sex survey noted
several instances in which efforts to step up treatments actually
led to harm.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, pregnant women at risk for giving birth to
premature babies were monitored at home for signs of early labor.
The monitoring led to the use of more drugs to hold off labor,
which had adverse effects like lung problems and high blood sugar
in 7 percent of the women but did not lower the rate of early
births.
</P>
<P>
   In another case, people who had had heart attacks were given
drugs to treat slight abnormalities in heart rhythm, some so mild
they did not even cause symptoms. But compared to people with
similar histories who were not treated, those who took the drugs
had death rates two to three times higher.
</P>
<P>
   People who contemplate drug therapy to resuscitate their sex
lives may also risk unwanted side effects: Viagra, for instance,
can cause headaches and nausea and temporarily add a bluish tinge
to one's vision.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs may not always be the solution to sexual woes, anyway.
Despite Rosen's enthusiasm for them, the study itself acknowledged
that some of the most common sexual problems had social and
emotional roots that no pill could fix. Young women, for instance,
tended to have more pain from sex and less satisfaction than older
women, probably because they changed partners more often. They
tended also to alternate between intervals of no sex and episodes
of frequent activity, a pattern that may contribute to higher rates
of bladder infection _ a condition all but guaranteed to take the
joy out of sex.
</P>
<P>
   John Gagnon, an emeritus professor of sociology at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said it was little wonder
that young women felt disappointed by sex, given the ineptitude of
many young men. ``I sometimes wonder why young women put up with
it, except that they probably don't know any better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some women in their 60s lose interest in sex, he said. ``They
say, `I had my kids, and that's why I did it, and I never really
got much else out of it,''' he said. They consider the sexual phase
of their lives finished, they do not miss it, and idea of taking a
drug to create a yearning for it may not appeal to them.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what seems to be the prevailing belief, Gagnon said,
people are not necessarily unhealthy or in need of medical
treatment if they do not feel like having sex all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people find their hobbies more interesting,'' he said.
``Sex is a modest pleasure.''

TWO CHICKENS IN A POT? NO, MARDI GRAS FOR EVERYONE!

   NEW ORLEANS _ Ron Kelly would probably be depressed by the
impeachment trial of President Clinton if he did not have a parade
to go to. He would probably be troubled by last week's denouement,
or mad about shameless partisan politics, if he were not so busy
trying to snag some beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we worry about that when we're trying to figure what
day the parade is, and what time it starts, and what the route is,
and, when it's all over, who's gonna be making the gumbo,'' said
Kelly, 32, a valet at the Pontchartrain Hotel here who, like most
everybody else, is consumed with Carnival, the robust countdown to
Mardi Gras on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country can march in step to the funeral
procession of its own national spirit, fretting, cursing and
wondering, now that all the salaciousness has been wrung out of the
Monica Lewinsky affair, whether there is nothing left but shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not us; we got a party to worry about,'' Kelly said. ``We'll
worry about Clinton on Ash Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Mardi Gras, the last pagan rout before the
abstinence of Lent, were not unique to New Orleans and places like
Mobile, Ala., and Galveston, Texas, where the celebrations are
smaller? What if, in the midst of all the embarrassment, anger and
creeping numbness caused by the Clinton scandal, the whole country
put on a feathered mask, draped some worthless beads around its
neck and, as one New Orleans band sings, ``party till the money run
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a hangover would be better than what we're going
through,'' said Dan T. Carter, a historian at Emory University in
Atlanta and author of ``The Politics of Rage'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1995), about the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   What if the notion consuming talk down at the health club was
not the constant claims by Republican lawmakers that they are only
doing what's best for the country but who would be crowned King of
the Zulus? What if, instead of watching Democrats on CNN still
quibbling over exactly what sexual relations are _ people in New
Orleans know _ all some folks really cared about was the ball or
showering the crowd with glittering doubloons. While elsewhere
pundits were analyzing the 50-to-50 vote on the second article of
impeachment, crowds were gathering on Bourbon Street to watch women
flash their breasts in exchange for cheap plastic beads.
</P>
<P>
   What if America just threw down, as they say here, and had a big
ol' wooly Carnival?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it,'' said Kirk Strang, a lawyer from Madison, Wis.,
who will soak up Carnival until Monday, and then, loaded down with
beads and King Cakes, fly home to Wisconsin where the Carnival
tradition has been going on for years.
</P>
<P>
   If Cheeseheads can eat crawfish, oysters and jambalaya and wash
it all down with liquid Hurricanes, why can't everybody?
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras is not simply parades and drunken revelry but a
sequined, satin cloak that settles over this old city's shoulders
around this time every year. People with a lot of money and people
with just a little bit join secret societies and attend masked
balls, put on sometimes lavish, sometimes skimpy parades, and crown
each other King This and Queen That. Men wear tights.
</P>
<P>
   There is still crime, poverty, potholes and late car payments
here. There is still the Lewinsky affair and all that it implies.
Just nobody gives a damn. With no such distractions, the rest of
the country languishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it,'' Carter said. ``We need to cut loose and yell and
shout, `Throw me somethin', mister.'''
</P>
<P>
   What if, say, Atlanta had Carnival? Atlanta could use one. The
night before its Falcons were to play Denver in the Super Bowl, a
star player was arrested for trying to solicit a prostitute on
Miami's Biscayne Boulevard. Later, after Denver beat the Falcons
like an ugly red-headed stepchild, another player was charged with

MAKING HIS MARK: MARK WAHLBERG BIDS FOR ACTION STARDOM

 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Alma Wahlberg wants to see less of her son Mark.
 &HT;    It was bad enough when he was modeling Calvin Klein underwear,
but in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997) he often wore nothing at all, and
in fact prominently displayed his ... well, his endowment for the
arts. And for the past few months the movie has been playing around
the clock on cable.
 &HT;    ``I can already hear the message on my answering machine,''
Wahlberg says. ``It will go something like, `Honey, Aunt Gertrude
saw ``Boogie Nights'' on HBO and she passed out. What are we going
to do?'''
 &HT;    Just one more complication of life post ``Boogie Nights'':
 &HT;    ``I've been very busy,'' the actor sums up. ``I get bothered.
People ask me about my private parts. A lot.''
 &HT;    The organ in question was artificial, Wahlberg adds, a fact
which he's stressed in interviews any number of times.
 &HT;    ``But just the other day a journalist asked me if it was real. I
said, `Look, ask the director.' The journalist said, `No, I'm
talking about Burt Reynolds' hair in the film.'
 &HT;    ``I was like, `Hey, I really have no idea.''' He laughs. ``Now,
that's a tough question!''
 &HT;    Wahlberg can afford to laugh. The former Marky Mark has left his
rap days behind, and finds himself suddenly famous _ if not quite
as much so as his buddy Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom he co-starred
in ``The Basketball Diaries'' (1995), certainly enough to change
his life.
 &HT;    ``Fame is such a scary proposition,'' Wahlberg says. ``I talk to
Leo about the pressure of having everyone suddenly love you. I was
in a similar situation when I first started in music ... The weird
thing is that one day you're the poster on some girl's wall, and
the next she's ripping you down to put up Marilyn Manson.
 &HT;    ``It's all about survival for me now,'' Wahlberg says. ``For me
the `Boogie Nights' years represent a time to stop dealing in the
b---sh-t and just do good work.''
 &HT;    The 27-year-old is working even now, despite appearing relaxed
in jeans and a sweater in a suite at New York's Regency Hotel. He's
there to do interviews about ``The Corruptor,'' opening March 5.
It's an action movie in which a Los Angeles police officer
(Wahlberg) with a canny Chinatown cop (Chow Yun-Fat) team up to
combat some vicious ganglords.
 &HT;    ``Chow is amazing, man,'' Wahlberg says of the legendary Hong
Kong star. ``He's a different type of action hero in this movie.''
 &HT;    Wahlberg signed on to do ``The Corruptor'' after turning down a
role _ eventually taken by Joaquin Phoenix _ in Joel Schumacher's
upcoming sleazefest, ``8 mm.''
 &HT;    ``It was a great script, but they wanted me to play Dirk Diggler
Part Two, and I couldn't do it,'' he says. ``I would have loved to
have worked with Nic Cage, but the minute I read in the script that
my character would be introduced in a porn shop and that he knows
everything about porn and S&AMP;M, I said `Nah.' I just couldn't get up
the energy to do it.
 &HT;    ``They told me, `Kevin Costner did two baseball films.' I said,
`Yeah, but that's America's pastime. We're talking about porn here,
and I don't even like porn, man.'''
 &HT;    That same reaction almost caused him to reject ``Boogie
Nights,'' he recalls. Though such previous films as ``Renaissance
Man'' (1995), ``The Basketball Diaries'' and ``Fear'' (1997) hadn't
set the box office on fire, and he really couldn't afford to turn
down high-profile roles, he nonetheless hesitated.
 &HT;    ``When I started acting,'' he explains, ``I vowed there would be
three things I would never do in a film: sing, dance and take my
clothes off. In one film, I broke every rule.''
 &HT;    Wahlberg is used to breaking the rules, though. He grew up in
Dorchester, Mass., son of a nurse and a trucker who divorced when
Wahlberg was 11. As a child of a working single parent, the young
man had plenty of time to get into trouble, and he usually did.
 &HT;    ``Every day I had this routine: Wake up, go outside, make money,
get into something bad,'' Wahlberg recalls. ``I knew it was just a
matter of time before I would be locked up and somebody would just
throw the key away.''
 &HT;    In 1988 it happened. The 15-year-old Wahlberg did a 45-day jail
stint for assaulting a man over a bottle of beer.
 &HT;    ``It was a real wakeup call,'' he recalls. ``I convinced myself
during those 45 days that I was never coming back.''
 &HT;    At the time of his release, his brother Donnie had just become a
teen idol with the band New Kids on the Block. Inspired, Wahlberg
became the front man for his own group, Marky Mark and The Funky
Bunch.
 &HT;    Their 1991 album went platinum. And one night on stage, on a
dare, Wahlberg dropped his drawers _ and hit paydirt. He landed a
lucrative contract as the official Calvin Klein underwear model.
 &HT;    Those were raucous years for a young man who loved to cause a
stir. He loomed over Times Square on a billboard, virtually naked.
He dedicated his 1993 autobiographical photo book to his penis.
Gossip columnists buzzed about public brawls.
 &HT;    As the initial hype died down, Wahlberg reassessed his life and
decided to take control of things. He said goodbye to rap and to
modeling, and declared that Marky Mark was dead _ long live Mark
Wahlberg, the actor.
 &HT;    ``I'm not totally knocking it, but once I did those ads, I
started to feel like my voice was being taken away from me,''
Wahlberg says. ``I started to feel like I was just this body. I
knew I had to totally turn things around so I would be heard.''
 &HT;    Hollywood laughed, but Wahlberg stuck with it and, with ``Boogie
Nights,'' his efforts paid off. Now he has boxloads of scripts to
consider, and he can turn down anything which doesn't strike his
fancy.
 &HT;    Next up may be a boxing film, ``Out On My Feet.'' It's a drama
about a young man being trained by an aging boxer, a role to be
played by none other than the ``Raging Bull'' himself, Robert De
Niro.
 &HT;    Working with a Hollywood heavyweight such as De Niro was
inspiring, the younger actor says.
 &HT;    ``We're doing these fight scenes together,'' he recalls, ``and I
didn't want to hit hard. But De Niro is like, `Go, go, go, kid!' So
I had to hit him. I couldn't be scared. I had to go for it.''
 &HT;    He's also got a new album in the works _ but don't expect it to
be more of the same old thing.
 &HT;    ``Marky Mark is retired,'' he says flatly. ``I love to make
music. But as far as going out, pulling down my pants and running
around in my underwear, well, I don't think I could do that
anymore.''
 &HT;    At least not right now.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'll do a 20th-anniversary reunion tour,'' he says
jokingly. ``I'll come out with my big beer belly, pull my pants
down and listen to the people groan.''

TWO CHICKENS IN A POT? NO, MARDI GRAS FOR EVERYONE! 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

   NEW ORLEANS _ Ron Kelly would probably be depressed by the
impeachment trial of President Clinton if he did not have a parade
to go to. He would probably be troubled by last week's denouement,
or mad about shameless partisan politics, if he were not so busy
trying to snag some beads.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we worry about that when we're trying to figure what
day the parade is, and what time it starts, and what the route is,
and, when it's all over, who's gonna be making the gumbo,'' said
Kelly, 32, a valet at the Pontchartrain Hotel here who, like most
everybody else, is consumed with Carnival, the robust countdown to
Mardi Gras on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country can march in step to the funeral
procession of its own national spirit, fretting, cursing and
wondering, now that all the salaciousness has been wrung out of the
Monica Lewinsky affair, whether there is nothing left but shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not us; we got a party to worry about,'' Kelly said. ``We'll
worry about Clinton on Ash Wednesday.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if Mardi Gras, the last pagan rout before the
abstinence of Lent, were not unique to New Orleans and places like
Mobile, Ala., and Galveston, Texas, where the celebrations are
smaller? What if, in the midst of all the embarrassment, anger and
creeping numbness caused by the Clinton scandal, the whole country
put on a feathered mask, draped some worthless beads around its
neck and, as one New Orleans band sings, ``party till the money run
out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a hangover would be better than what we're going
through,'' said Dan T. Carter, a historian at Emory University in
Atlanta and author of ``The Politics of Rage'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1995), about the late Alabama Gov. George Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   What if the notion consuming talk down at the health club was
not the constant claims by Republican lawmakers that they are only
doing what's best for the country but who would be crowned King of
the Zulus? What if, instead of watching Democrats on CNN still
quibbling over exactly what sexual relations are _ people in New
Orleans know _ all some folks really cared about was the ball or
showering the crowd with glittering doubloons. While elsewhere
pundits were analyzing the 50-to-50 vote on the second article of
impeachment, crowds were gathering on Bourbon Street to watch women
flash their breasts in exchange for cheap plastic beads.
</P>
<P>
   What if America just threw down, as they say here, and had a big
ol' wooly Carnival?
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it,'' said Kirk Strang, a lawyer from Madison, Wis.,
who will soak up Carnival until Monday, and then, loaded down with
beads and King Cakes, fly home to Wisconsin where the Carnival
tradition has been going on for years.
</P>
<P>
   If Cheeseheads can eat crawfish, oysters and jambalaya and wash
it all down with liquid Hurricanes, why can't everybody?
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras is not simply parades and drunken revelry but a
sequined, satin cloak that settles over this old city's shoulders
around this time every year. People with a lot of money and people
with just a little bit join secret societies and attend masked
balls, put on sometimes lavish, sometimes skimpy parades, and crown
each other King This and Queen That. Men wear tights.
</P>
<P>
   There is still crime, poverty, potholes and late car payments
here. There is still the Lewinsky affair and all that it implies.
Just nobody gives a damn. With no such distractions, the rest of
the country languishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need it,'' Carter said. ``We need to cut loose and yell and
shout, `Throw me somethin', mister.'''
</P>
<P>
   What if, say, Atlanta had Carnival? Atlanta could use one. The
night before its Falcons were to play Denver in the Super Bowl, a
star player was arrested for trying to solicit a prostitute on
Miami's Biscayne Boulevard. Later, after Denver beat the Falcons
like an ugly red-headed stepchild, another player was charged with
laundering money for a drug dealer. Then, in the wake of the
accusation that Salt Lake City bought the 2002 Winter Games,
leaders of Atlanta's own bid for the 1996 Olympic Summer Games had
to explain their own lavish treatment of Olympic dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   What if New York had one? Or even Washington?
</P>
<P>
   Mardi Gras in America's political epicenter might be asking too
much, Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea, but I just don't think it would
work,'' he said. ``You'd have to tie some of those people down and
pour the booze in them with a funnel, to get them to loosen up.''

BACK TO BASICS: VINCE GILL LOOKS FOR HIS COUNTRY ROOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of country singer Vince Gill. 
 By BETH TORROLL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He may be the poster boy for today's emerging traditional
country music, but don't say it to Vince Gill's face.
 &HT;    The singer/songwriter, whose personal artistic style has run the
gamut from bluegrass to country/pop, looked back to his country
roots for his latest studio album, ``The Key'' (1998), a salute to
the style of classic country.
 &HT;    But Gill insists that he recorded this particular set of songs
for himself, not intending to lead any parade back to what he
interprets country music to be.
 &HT;    ``It's really a very traditional country record, what I find
country music is to me,'' he says. ``I don't think what is on the
majority of country radio these days is country music. I don't say
that with my fingers crossed behind my back, because I've made a
lot of records that I don't think are country music.''
 &HT;    Certainly Gill has recorded more than a few songs that have
riled the country-music establishment, building his career on the
emotional pop/country ballad alongside his trademark,
sometimes-giddy uptempo numbers, featuring Gill's crystal-clear,
high-tenor voice and masterful guitar work.
 &HT;    Gill is a pretty casual guy, with a passion for fast food, a
quick wit and a mean golf game. He is what he is with no apologies,
he says, and when he hears something in his head, he goes with it.
This time around it was a classic-country voice that he heard, so
that's what he recorded.
 &HT;    It's no wonder that the sad sound of classic country came
naturally to Gill, because his year leading up to the August 1998
release of ``The Key'' was a rough one. His divorce from wife Janis
Gill, herself a performer with Sweethearts of the Rodeo, was
compounded by the loss of his father, Stan Gill, to cancer.
 &HT;    Together, the two blows rocked Gill's emotional foundation,
driving him from the stage for a nine-month rest in 1997 and early
1998. During this time, he continued to write, record, golf, spend
time with Jenny, his teen-age daughter, staying close to his
Nashville home much of the time.
 &HT;    ``I don't know that I did a lot of soul searching or did a lot
of in-depth looking at my life or any of that,'' Gill says. ``I'm
not that deep.''
 &HT;    But the loss of his father caused the singer to reflect on the
songs he was raised on, classic country that helped to shape the
tone of ``The Key.''
 &HT;    ``Me losing my dad made me remember old songs,'' the 41-year-old
musician recalls. ``It made me really remember what I love about
country music. It's not me trying to say, `OK, country music has
gone way too far' _ that was not the exercise of this record in the
least.
 &HT;    ``All it was is me missing, personally, that style of country
music. I missed recording it, and I wanted to make a record that
never strayed from it.''
 &HT;    Not only did Gill's father inspire the tone of the project, but
his lessons inspired the singer to write a particularly emotional
song for the album.
 &HT;    ``The most poignant song, to me, is the song about my father
that I wrote called `The Key To Life,''' he says. ``That one is
really the heart-on-the-sleeve of the songs.''
 &HT;    An Oklahoma native, Gill began in bluegrass as a member of the
Bluegrass Alliance and Byron Berline's Sundance. He branched out in
1979 as the lead singer for the pop/country group Pure Prairie
League, rendering lead vocals on several hits, including ``Let Me
Love You Tonight.''
 &HT;    The young musician spent most of the 1980s as a sideman, joining
Rodney Crowell's Cherry Bombs and touring with Emmylou Harris, as
well as singing and playing guitar on numerous Nashville
recordings.
 &HT;    He had signed his first solo recording deal, with RCA executive
Tony Brown _ formerly a Cherry Bombs piano player _ as early as
1983. But his solo career didn't lift off until he followed Brown
to MCA in 1989. ``When I Call Your Name'' (1990), a tailor-made
showcase for Gill's talents, earned a Grammy and two Academy of
Country Music awards.
 &HT;    Thereafter one hit led to another _ ``Pocket Full of Gold'' to
``Look At Us'' to ``Go Rest High on That Mountain'' to ``When I
Call Your Name'' _ and Vince Gill became a household name. Along
the way, he earned a shelf of trophies, including 11 Grammy awards,
20 BMI Songwriter awards and 17 Country Music Association awards _
more CMAs than any other performer has ever won.
 &HT;    Gill insists that popularity isn't an issue for him. He makes
music because it's in his soul, he says, and he gives the
impression that, even if his spotlight fades, he'll continue down
his own artistic path regardless, stretching and exploring.
 &HT;    So when he had to piece together ``The Key'' during a period
when his personal world was askew, Gill naturally turned to artists
who had inspired the generation before him, artists whose music had
helped form the foundation of music as he knew it.
 &HT;    ``The records of Ray Price were inspirational, but also the
record that Ray Charles made in the early '60s (``Modern Sounds In
Country and Western Music'') was a very beautiful, orchestrated way
of doing really traditional country songs. It wasn't all edgy and
up tempo and all of that, so that's where I started, that's what I
heard in my head.
 &HT;    ``I'm not trying to be retro,'' he adds. ``I'm not trying to be
anything that I haven't been. It's just inspired my music.''
 &HT;    Gill invited friends such as Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, LeAnn
Womack and Alison Krauss to sing on the album, and when ``The Key''
was released it debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums
chart.
 &HT;    In addition to ``The Key,'' 1998 also brought ``Breath of
Heaven,'' Gill's second Christmas album, featuring a collection of
holiday standards.
 &HT;    ``That's my opportunity to step out of my country career, so to
speak,'' he says, ``and try to be Nat `King' Cole and try to be
Johnny Mathis or Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra.''
 &HT;    The latter resonance was particularly noteworthy, because the
album was recorded on the day after Sinatra's death, at the Capitol
Records studio in Los Angeles that Sinatra made famous and with
famed arranger Patrick Williams using several of Sinatra's band
members.
 &HT;    The new year began with Gill's Jan. 30 appearance on A&AMP;E's
popular concert show, ``Live By Request.'' Next up is a major tour
that will begin March 4 at the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show.
 &HT;    He'll even stretch his wings as a producer when new artist Sonya
Issacs releases her debut album later in the year. Producing is
more than just a lark for him, the singer adds.
 &HT;    ``It's a lot of fun,'' he says. ``Something for me to do when I
get old, instead of riding buses!''
 &HT;    Gill's turn toward the traditional side of country is no
about-face, merely a shift in emphasis for an artist who has always
leaned toward the classic sound.
 &HT;    ``I'm not out to be the new Roy Acuff,'' he says. ``I'm not out
to save the Opry. I'm not out to make a traditional record and say
`Hey, everybody, we're going too far.'
 &HT;    ``I'm just doing what I do, what moves me.''

   Call her Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, she thought she had pulled her life together.
After years of heavy drinking and drug abuse, she was clean and
sober, ``and I had just met the man of my dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, mindful of her past, she asked for an AIDS test. The
results came back negative for the HIV virus, but the lab work
detected something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I had been exposed to the hepatitis C antibody, but
I was OK,'' she said. ``I wasn't actively sick from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, six months later, Pat returned to her home in Wilmington,
N.C., after a trip, ``and I was just literally struck down. I
couldn't get out of bed. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sleep. I had no
idea what was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat had become the victim of a little-known disease that is
nearing epidemic proportions. According to the National Institutes
of Health, some 4 million Americans are infected with hepatitis C,
a virus that affects the liver. Estimates of new infections each
year vary from 30,000 to 150,000 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the trouble is, the therapies are not very good yet,''
said Dr. John W. Sanders, an infectious-disease specialist in
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Most victims don't realize they have it. Perhaps 15 percent of
those infected clear the virus from their systems within six months
or so, according to the NIH. Most of the rest show no symptoms at
all, at least at first. Perhaps one in five develops mild symptoms,
such as fatigue or a general malaise.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Pat now remembers ``feeling tired a lot'' for a
number of years. ``I told my mom, TI feel like I have mono.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet hepatitis C _ or HCV, as doctors abbreviate it _ works
slowly and insidiously.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades or more, perhaps 20 percent of those infected
will develop cirrhosis, a scarring of the liver. HCV has replaced
chronic alcoholism as the most frequent cause of cirrhosis.
</P>
<P>
   As scar tissue replaces the normal, spongy tissue of the liver,
this organ is less able to perform its functions, such as making
key proteins or filtering the blood. Excess fluids might build up
in the abdomen, causing swelling. Internal bleeding might result.
In severe cases, ``either you have a liver transplant or you die,''
said Saunders. At least 8,000 to 10,000 people die from HCV each
year, according to federal statistics.
</P>
<P>
   HCV is also associated with hepatoma or hepatocellular carcinoma
(HCC), a form of cancer that is usually fatal. It typically appears
only after years of cirrhosis, although a tiny minority of HCV
victims may develop the cancer early.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was something you had and got over,'' said Pat.
But many patients will carry the HCV virus for the rest of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is, ``It's not a death sentence,'' said Steven
Zacks, a clinical assistant professor of medicine at the University
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In most patients, the disease can be controlled. Yet it can be a
complex, and costly, process.
</P>
<P>
   First detected in the 1970s, HCV is unlike hepatitis A, which is
spread by human wastes in contaminated food or water. It is also
different from hepatitis B, which is more infectious and can easily
be spread by sexual contact.
</P>
<P>
   HCV is carried from victim to victim primarily by blood. At
first, hemophiliacs, kidney dialysis patients and others who had
transfusions were at risk. Since 1992, however, doctors and the Red
Cross have had a reliable test to screen for HCV. Today,
transfusions and blood donations are considered safe.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the virus is spread mainly by intravenous drug use
and the sharing of needles or by tattooing and body piercing with
unsterilized equipment. The use of internasal cocaine _
``snorting'' the drug _ also seems to be an infection route, said
Zacks. Veterans who collected tattoos as a souvenir of military
service overseas may be especially at risk, Saunders said. Health
professionals who prick themselves with infected needles can also
contract HCV. A small number of infants may get the virus before
birth if their mothers are infected.
</P>
<P>
   Data ``have been conflicting'' on the links between HCV and sex,
according to the NIH; however, the risk of giving the disease to a
monogamous sexual partner ``is thought to be minimal,'' according
to the agency's 1997 consensus statement on the disease.
Prostitutes and others who have sex frequently with different
partners may face a slightly greater risk, Saunders said.
</P>
<P>
   Drs. Willis C. Maddrey and Eugene R. Schiff, authors of a
standard manual for patients, even urge spouses to use condoms if
one of them is HCV-positive. Zacks counsels partners to seek
testing for the virus, but in the case of monogamous couples, he
thinks that condom use can be optional.
</P>
<P>
   The disease's course can be sped up by heavy alcohol
consumption. Patients with a chronic infection should not drink,
Zacks said.
</P>
<P>
   Hepatitis C can be worsened further if one takes acetaminophen,
an ingredient in Tylenol and other headache and cold remedies,
while drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the treatment of choice for HCV is the drug
interferon. Patients take up to three injections a week, and some
of them can give themselves the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bit like taking insulin for diabetes,'' said Saunders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet interferon has drawbacks. Only about half of the patients
treated with it will have normal liver function restored after six
months. Of these, about half will suffer a relapse within a year or
so. In other words, its effectiveness rate is only about 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration recently approved a combination
treatment of interferon injections together with Ribavarin, which
can be taken in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the treatments are expensive. A supply of
interferon can cost between $300 and $600 per month; with
Ribavarin, the cost of care can range from $1,200 to $1,500 per
month.
</P>
<P>
   HCV patients will need to revisit their doctor _ generally a
gastroenterologist or infectious disease specialist _ for regular
blood tests. One will measure alanine aminotransferase, ALT for
short, a liver enzyme. The higher the levels of ALT in the
bloodstream, the more inflamed one's liver is likely to be. Another
test measures the ``viral load,'' the amount of HCV virus in the
bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope for new drugs now in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made a lot of progress in the last couple of years,''
Zacks said. ``There's a lot of potential for new drugs in the
pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, doctors focus on suppressing or reducing the virus
and delaying the onset of cirrhosis for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   For Pat, the disease has taken its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from being an outgoing person, always out, talking to
people, doing things constantly, to being a recluse,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She no longer has the energy to ride her bicycle or to dash off
on the cross-country road trips which she loved. The former night
owl now often goes to bed, exhausted, by 8 o'clock.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she'll still walk past the bars and night spots she
used to like. ``But everything seems so empty, all the partying. I
want to yell at those kids, if you only knew . . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``People had better wake up.''

SEEING CHINA'S CHALLENGE THROUGH A COLD WAR LENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone charting the rise of China, it has been a pretty
scary couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, the first reports surfaced that China's Communist
Party leaders had set out to funnel money into Democratic political
campaigns to buy influence. Then there was a stream of reports that
Chinese rocket scientists had taken advantage of their American
partners in the space-launch business to improve the accuracy of
China's strategic nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a bipartisan congressional panel concluded in a
700-page classified report that Chinese agents had pilfered an
array of sensitive U.S. military technology over the last two
decades, including, perhaps, the design secret of one of America's
most sophisticated thermonuclear warheads, the W-88, which sits
atop the Trident II missiles in U.S. submarines.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems to add up to an alarming picture of military
modernization, coinciding with steadily expanding defense budgets
to finance the purchase of new Russian warplanes, submarines and
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Is the China threat coming true?
</P>
<P>
   The question betrays America's Cold War legacy. China certainly
intends to establish itself as a credible military power, one that
can defend its national interests near its shores, whether that
means fighting for its share of the oil resources of the South
China Sea or asserting its sovereignty over Taiwan _ still
separated from the mainland since Chiang Kai-Shek fled there with
his army in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that China is seeking to compete with
the United States as a global military power as the Soviet Union
once did.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts now argue that with the collapse of the Soviet
Union, China is turning into America's foremost rival, arming
itself for the day when it can kick the United States out of Asia
and then lord it over Japan, Taiwan and the Southeast Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
   These experts cite as evidence of China's hostility its missile
tests and war games near Taiwan in 1995 and 1996; in response, U.S.
aircraft carriers were dispatched to deliver a pointed message to
Beijing that military coercion would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But others say America should relax about China and resist the
Cold War reflex, with every Chinese advance, to grab a shovel to
dig that bomb shelter in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, the dean of the Cold
Warriors in the 1970s, says: ``China is not going to be a world
power in the existing period, and possibly never. They recognize
it, and the last thing they want is to tangle with the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Suettinger, until recently the CIA's senior analyst for
Asia and now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution,
agrees. The intelligence community consensus on China ``doesn't add
up to a threat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the passing of the Cold War, during which China and
the United States had common interest in opposing Soviet
adventurism in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, there is little
today that anchors the U.S. relationship with China. Hence
President Clinton's difficulty in sustaining a policy of engagement
in the face of each new report of dissident arrests, technological
espionage and the missile buildup against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever challenge China might pose in the future, it won't be
anything like the danger once posed by Soviet divisions poised
against Europe, by Soviet armadas in every ocean and thousands of
Soviet nuclear warheads aimed at America.
</P>
<P>
   While Moscow built a wall around its irrational economy, China
has been busy building export markets, opening its economy and
expanding personal freedom at home (up to a point). Having
witnessed Japan's success, China's leaders believe that in the next
century, national power will be measured by economic strength, not
military.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, China is joining world institutions, not threatening
them. Chinese exports are the engine of China's growth. They have
given Beijing the same stake in peace and stability that every
other nation has in the era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger says the danger of overindulging America's worst
fears about China is that it might actually produce the hostile
opponent that some Americans foresee. Get over it, he says.
</P>
<P>
   To experts like him, China's gradual military modernization is
an inescapable outgrowth of national development. In this view, the
disturbing record of Chinese espionage in the United States proves
only that Beijing has been pursuing its own interests much as
Taiwan, Egypt, Israel, Russia, France and Brazil all have, at the
United States' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Even that reality may not be so alarming. The roots of the
Chinese espionage go back to the late 1970s, when Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping pressed U.S. officials for technology to help China
modernize. It is now known that he also hedged his bets by ordering
China's spy agency to go after critical technologies through the
back door. Much of the effort, however, was bungled or detected by
U.S. intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, for all of China's illicit acquisitions, the Chinese
military stubbornly refuses to improve.
</P>
<P>
   John Culver, the CIA's military expert on China, told a National
Defense University forum last year that China's army ``is still
largely the same force it was at the time the USSR collapsed,'' and
that ``it is still overwhelmingly a ground army with an inventory
of weapons that, in most cases, has been deployed with the same
units for up to 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with new Russian jet fighters, submarines, destroyers and a
whole array of new missiles, Culver argued, the Chinese army has
created only a few ``pockets of modernity'' and has failed to alter
the military balance with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Chinese pilots fly far fewer training hours than
those in any modern air force. The Chinese navy and air force are
facing obsolescence of their Soviet-era warplanes and warships.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Two Stanford University researchers, John W. Lewis and Xue
Litai, report in a new study that by 1990, half of the aircraft in
the Chinese air force were not operational. Even with new Russian
purchases, Chinese air power hardly exists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the risk of confrontation remains. Since 1960, China has
fought border wars with India, the Soviet Union and Vietnam. The
borders with those countries are now quiet, but Taiwan looms as an
unresolved conflict where both sides see sovereign interests at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   If Taiwan declared its independence tomorrow, or if Beijing
issued an ultimatum for Taiwan's reunification with the motherland,
a new crisis could erupt.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over China is only going to get louder as the 2000
presidential election season approaches. Both Republican and
Democratic strategists see China policy as a rallying point for
voters concerned about human rights, religious freedom and the
proliferation of Chinese nuclear and missile technologies to
unstable regions.
</P>
<P>
   A huge factor is China itself, where repression remains a
dominant feature of the security apparatus, and where some military
leaders wear their chauvinism like a battle ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Since Woodrow Wilson's time, Americans have insisted that their
foreign policy reflect moral values, and China continues to rub
America the wrong way. Ten years after the Tiananmen massacres,
polls show that Americans, by a roughly two-thirds majority, are
still inclined to think the worst of China.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger is among those who are inclined the other way, which
may seem strange for an old Cold Warrior. China, he says, should
not become America's ``designated enemy.'' The Chinese still look
to America to help them overcome the daunting challenges of
rebuilding backward industries, managing scarce resources,
alleviating poverty and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be self-defeating as well as a negation of the
magnanimity of the United States,'' he says, ``to presuppose that
China must turn into a hostile nation.''
</P>
<P>
   China could still turn hostile, says Schlesinger. But if it
does, he adds, it would be best if America were not the cause.

WAS THERE LOVE ENOUGH FOR ANOTHER BABY?
</HEADLINE>
  By LEAH INGRAM 
 c.1999 Leah Ingram 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing up as an only child, I was determined not to have only
one child. So imagine my surprise when halfway through my second
pregnancy, I started having doubts about having another child.
</P>
<P>
   I loved my firstborn Jane, now 3, so fiercely that simply
looking at her brought tears to my eyes. How could I possible love
another child as I love Jane?
</P>
<P>
   My husband, Bill, ever the pragmatic thinker and the second of
two children, knew fully well that a parent could love both kids.
He kept telling me, ``Love isn't finite. You will be able to love
both children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill wasn't the one feeling ambivalent -- I was. Turns out I
wasn't alone. Ask almost any woman who is mother to more than one
child, and she'll tell you about her own, albeit fleeting, feelings
of ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   These feelings are quite normal during pregnancy, says Dr.
Monica Reed, an obstetrician and gynecologist and medical director
of the women's center at Celebration Health in Celebration, Fla. In
fact, Reed, a mother of two, shares with her patients her own
long-ago feelings of ambivalence. ``I tell my patients, 'The love I
had for my first child exceeded anything, and I was unsure I could
love a second child in the same way. I discovered that the love I
have for my second is just as great as it is for my first.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed's words of assurance probably would have fallen on deaf
ears had she told them to Andrea Hessekiel of Rye, N.Y., who says
she momentarily regretted getting pregnant again only after
daughter Sophie, now 4, was born. ``It was Sophie's second day of
life, I'd had my second C-section, and as I hobbled into the
bathroom to use the toilet, I began to cry. I said, 'What have I
done? I had this perfect life, this adorable child, and I've gone
and messed everything up,'' she recalls thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Hessekiel says she felt so intensely connected to her first
born, Kira, now 7, that she wasn't sure how she could have the same
kind of relationship with her new daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, you can't have the same relationship with your
second child as you did with your first, says Kim Dell'Angela, a
psychologist at Chicago's Loyola Medical Center, mostly because you
won't have as much time. In fact, ``time is one of a mother's
biggest concerns,'' says Hilory Wagner, author of ``And Baby Makes
Four'' (Avon Books, 1998), a book about welcoming the second baby
to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   But worrying about time management issues while you're pregnant
can cause more stress than relief. Instead, talk about your
feelings, especially with your spouse. ``If you have concerns that
your partner won't pull his share of child care with this baby,
address that before the baby gets there,'' Wagner adds. Getting
your husband involved will benefit you -- and your kids, too. If
your husband becomes the primary caregiver for one child, as my
husband did with Jane, after her sister, Anne, now 1 1/2, was born,
he may discover a newer and deeper relationship with his first
born.
</P>
<P>
   A number of factors contributed to my feelings of ambivalence.
Just weeks before I'd gotten pregnant with Anne, I'd finally lost
all my prepregnancy weight, and here I was packing on the pounds
again. I was also concerned about the already diminished time I had
with Bill. ``You need to budget your time with every one,'' says
Lillian Glass, a New York City marriage/family counselor in private
practice, and plan ways that you and your spouse can get time
alone, even if it means staying up later at night, after the kids
have gone to bed, just so you can talk uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Another cause of ambivalence is the issue of going back to work,
something Dell'Angela blames on the media. ``Women are always
hearing, 'If you love your children, you'll spend more time with
them.' Or people may say to women who work outside of the home,
'Well now that you're going to have two kids, you'll be staying
home now, right?' We lump love with time,'' but time does not equal
love.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of things you can do to bid your ambivalent
feelings farewell. First, don't listen to what anyone else has to
say about your decision to have another child. ``Sometimes, it can
feel like open season on your parenting,'' says Dell'Angela. Also,
don't stress yourself out worrying that your first child will be
permanently scarred by the birth of his sibling. Instead, prepare
him for the new baby by taking him to sibling classes and reading
books about the new baby, Wagner suggests. And remember: you're
giving your child a brother or sister whom he will grow to love and
cherish. Furthermore, your younger child will benefit from the love
and companionship of his older sibling -- something your first born
did not have.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, talk to other parents about how they handle having two
children. ``You'll hear others tell you that your feelings are
normal and that you should trust that everything is going to be
OK,'' says Dell'Angela. However, if your feelings of uncertainty
about your pregnancy become so intense that you fear you might hurt
yourself or your unborn child, speak to your healthcare
practitioner immediately.
</P>
<P>
   After Anne was born, my feelings of ambivalence faded along with
the memory of labor pain. It's hard to remember how freaked out I
was about become a mother of two. The best part for me now is not
only loving two children, but seeing my daughters becoming friends
and growing to love one another.

MILDER WILDER: A MORE THOUGHTFUL GENE WILDER RETURNS TO THE SMALL
SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes a color slide of Gene Wilder in a scene from ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He may be playing the Mock Turtle in the upcoming
television-movie version of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' but he's
mocking no one today. In fact, the comic actor Gene Wilder may be
open, talkative and friendly, but he's a distinctly serious man.
 &HT;    That's understandable, since he's know his share of unhappiness
along with the laughter, most notably the 1989 death from ovarian
cancer of his wife, comedian Gilda Radner.
 &HT;    ``My early life was a combination of sadness and hilarity,'' the
63-year-old Wilder says, relaxing on a couch at a
satellite-television studio in Manhattan. ``There was a lot of
sadness in my life. My mother was so ill, and I was told not to
ever argue with her, because it might kill her. But I was told to
make her laugh.
 &HT;    ``So there was always an underpinning of sadness around, lurking
in the shadows,'' he says. ``In my actual life, especially now, I'm
the happiest man I know.
 &HT;    ``I'm very fortunate to have found love again after Gilda died.
I'm very fortunate to live a wonderful, quiet life in the country,
to write and paint and act, really, when I want to act.''
 &HT;    For a long while, Wilder _ who starred in such memorable films
as ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde'' (1967), ``The Producers'' (1968), ``Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (1971), ``Young Frankenstein''
(1974) and ``Stir Crazy'' (1980), as well as the lamentable 1995
television sitcom, ``Something Wilder'' _ simply didn't feel the
urge to act.
 &HT;    But lately he's been increasingly visible. He wrote and starred
in ``Murder in a Small Town'' (1999), a cable movie which aired on
the Arts &AMP; Entertainment Network in January, and on Feb. 28 he'll
turn up as the Mock Turtle in NBC's three-hour-long retelling of
Lewis Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.''
 &HT;    The special-effects-driven movie, directed by Nick Willing,
stars Tina Majorino as Alice, along with an all-star cast that
includes Whoopi Goldberg, Martin Short, Ben Kingsley and Miranda
Richardson. To play the singing, dancing and 2-inch-tall Mock
Turtle, Wilder sported shells and hair extensions, performing in
front of a blue screen and interacting only with Majorino.
 &HT;    It was a revelatory experience for the actor, who had never
liked ``Alice in Wonderland,'' either the book or the classic
Disney animated film.
 &HT;    ``I started performing at 13, and that was about the time I
became inquisitive about literature, about Dostoevski, Carroll and
Dickens,'' Wilder recalls. ``I just didn't get `Alice,' though. It
went by me _ I enjoyed some parts, but didn't understand what the
whole thing was about.
 &HT;    ``Later I understood more,'' he adds, ``but I never quite got
the meat of it, the heart and soul. And I never wanted to see the
cartoon version.
 &HT;    ``Then I received the script for the television movie last
summer,'' Wilder says, ``and I read it from beginning to end. It
was magnificent. It captured the essence of Carroll's story, and I
think I got what he was going for.
 &HT;    ``Let me put it in terms of Mock Turtle and Alice,'' he says
with a smile. ``Nick Willing told me that the fears we all have of
abandoning our childhood and venturing out into adulthood can be so
terrifying that sometimes we don't want to let go.
 &HT;    ``In Alice's case,'' he says, ``it was her fear of singing a
song in public. I related to that in a very personal way _ not
about singing, not about acting, but about getting up and speaking
to people.
 &HT;    ``I can perform before 2,500 people, but ask me to make a speech
at a banquet and it's still as hard for me as giving an oral book
report was at school,'' Wilder admits. ``I related that to Alice.''
 &HT;    In a sense, he says, the encounter between Alice and the Mock
Turtle represents a coming-of-age for Alice.
 &HT;    ``By the time she gets to Mock Turtle and the Gryphon, she can
say `This isn't right' or `I don't believe this,''' he says. ``I
put her through all kinds of tests, nudging her on to be brave, to
try singing with me. When we're done I've made her laugh and sing.
I've exposed my emotions to her, and I see that she's ready to move
on.
 &HT;    ``I tell her, `Dear, you're ready to go on,' and what I'm really
saying is that she's ready to become a woman and to let her fears
drop.''
 &HT;    Wilder is even more pleased with ``Murder in a Small Town.''
Based on its solid reviews and ratings, A&AMP;E has already
commissioned Wilder and director Joyce Chopra for a follow-up.
 &HT;    ```Murder' was everything I set out to do as a writer and an
actor,'' he says proudly. ``There was a particularly huge sense of
satisfaction at having written it.
 &HT;    ``I'm on page 70 of the next one, which won't be a sequel,'' he
adds. ``Four characters are the same, and Joyce Chopra and I are
hoping to form a repertory company of sorts, using the same actors,
even if their characters died, in different roles in the next one.
 &HT;    ``If we're lucky, we'll do one movie every 10 or 12 months.''
 &HT;    It's no accident that both ``Alice'' and ``Murder'' are
small-screen projects, or that Wilder hasn't made a theatrical film
since the abysmal ``Another You'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``The world of film has changed,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``I
took some time off, and when I came back I didn't like what I was
being offered.
 &HT;    ``At this point I don't want to do anything I don't like, don't
want to see, that I think might disappoint an audience,'' he says.
``Why do it? I'd rather wait until the bell goes off in my head.''
 &HT;    Wilder has never been a prototypical movie star, anyway. In
fact, he notes, most of the films for which he's best known
originally flopped.
 &HT;    ```The Producers' failed,'' he says. ``It was sold down the
river to television so the producer could make his money back. Now
it's a cult film.
 &HT;    ```Willy Wonka' failed at the box office,'' he continues. ```The
Frisco Kid' (1979) failed at the box office. My three favorite
films are `The Producers,' `Young Frankenstein' _ which did not
fail at the box office _ and `Frisco Kid.'
 &HT;    ```Blazing Saddles' was great fun, too, and very popular,''
Wilder adds, ``but it amazes me that two out of my favorite three
films were failures initially. Then again, so was `The Wizard of
Oz' (1939).''
 &HT;    Wilder currently lives in Connecticut with his second wife,
Karen, in a home left to him by Radner. The actor spends a good
deal of time raising funds for cancer causes, and says he often
thinks of Radner.
 &HT;    ``Her spirit is the first thing that comes to mind,'' he says
wistfully. ``She was a firefly, and if you knew her you saw that
her flame didn't go off very often.
 &HT;    ``Gilda just had a great spirit.''
 &HT;    Though he's experienced his ups and downs, the actor isn't
complaining. All in all, he thinks Jerry Silberman, the Milwaukee
boy who grew up to be Gene Wilder, would be impressed by Gene
Wilder's life and career.
 &HT;    ``If you talked about that with Jerry when he was Jerry, he'd be
tickled to death _ or tickled to life,'' Wilder says. ``He'd be
very happy.
 &HT;    ``It's scary when you want to be an actor and you're just a
little pipsqueak from Milwaukee,'' he says thoughtfully. ``You
don't know if you'll make it or not, and things like eating and
surviving don't even enter your mind.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to get roles in plays. It may have been ignorant
intuition, but I thought that if I got parts in plays, everything
would eventually take care of itself.
 &HT;    ``And it did.''

 Includes a color slide of Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa
Kudrow in a scene from ``Friends.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 From TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many ways, ``Friends'' is like a fast-and-funny soap opera:
All of the cast are attractive, all have interesting lives, great
clothes and cool apartments. And, just like on a soap, the six
``Friends'' players interact only with each other, whether on a
romantic or platonic level.
</P>
<P>
   In its sixth season, the slick formula still works. In fact,
it's propelled ``Friends'' to its highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real challenge now,'' deadpans David Schwimmer, who
plays Ross, ``is coming up with new hairstyles every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It's never dull. And, if you're a fan, you
literally have to watch every week to keep up on who's sleeping
together or breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   Take this current, eventful season: Chandler (Matthew Perry) and
Monica (Courteney Cox) spent the early stages furtively trying to
hide their steamy love trysts. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Ross
called it quits _ again _ prompting Ross' current midlife crisis,
while Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) was busy playing surrogate mother to her
sister's twins. As for slow-witted Joey (Matt LeBlanc), well, he's
been occupied enough just being Joey.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often you get the entire cast of ``Friends'' to
assemble for an interview, but when it does happen, you realize
just how good-looking they are. And how levelheaded they are about
their success, as Perry demonstrates when asked about their
characters' glamorous-if-hectic lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I kind of like that Chandler is finally getting a little
less neurotic this season,'' Perry says jokingly. ``Plus he's in a
relationship with Monica _ I love that I get to kiss Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   On the breakup front, Aniston is grateful that the long,
drawn-out affair between Rachel and Ross apparently has finally
reached a finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing was that Rachel had the ability to let Ross
go when she finally saw what was at stake for him,'' she says. ``As
painful as that was, it was also a wonderful thing for her as a
woman in terms of self-growth and being selfless.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it's not unusual for any of the ``Friends'' cast
to talk about their characters as if they were real people. In some
ways they are, since each performer was cast directly to type and
has varied little over five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They may live in a fanciful sitcom world, in short, but to
Aniston there's a lot of realism in the friendships played out on
the show. For example, she doesn't see any comparison between the
soulful, supportive female relationships on ``Friends'' and those
combative, business-suit-clad babes on ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, with girls at each other's throats?'' Aniston says
with a grimace. ``I don't think that's real life. It exists, I'm
sure, but not with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the show's creators/executive producers,
Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright, always planned to
keep things hopping on ``Friends.'' That explains why the story
lines bounce back and forth between the six pals in equal
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have six characters,'' Kauffman says, ``they all have
lives of equal importance, but the variations are endless. We have
to keep pushing ourselves to keep it different, fresh and funny ...
In an odd way, these six are our children. We love them all
equally.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps, of course, that those children are all still
extremely attractive and have collectively kept out of any
career-ending tabloid scandals. Their dating lives may occasionally
turn up in the gossip columns _ with veiled whispers of Aniston
dating Brad Pitt or Perry getting cozy with ``Party of Five'' star
Neve Campbell _ but they wear their success quite well.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they've come a long way from the histrionics
of their first breakout season, when each went from relative
unknown to magazine covers in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, we got some undergarments in the mail,''
Schwimmer says sheepishly. ``Uh, a marriage proposal. That was
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sextet nod as a group when asked if these days they're more
comfortable about going out in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in your attitude,'' Aniston says. ``If you want to go
to the store, you go to the store. There's always going to be
someone who recognizes you. But it's not like you can't leave the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we all live and work in Los Angeles, which is full of
actors and celebrities, makes it easier,'' he says. ``It's easier
to go to the supermarket here than if we lived somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears extremely unlikely that the show will be leaving the
Warner soundstage in Burbank for another road trip in the near
future. Last season finished with a three-episode arc that had the
entire cast _ except Kudrow, who was pregnant _ on location in
London for Ross' ultimately disastrous wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few personal highlights, including their meeting
quasi-royal Sarah Ferguson _ a.k.a. the Duchess of York _ when she
made a cameo appearance, the trip was a one-shot deal, the actors
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just too hard,'' Aniston says with a sigh. ``We were
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides uprooting the cast and crew and shooting in a
different time zone,'' Kauffman adds, ``we were in a foreign
country in unfamiliar surroundings. It took a lot longer than it
would have if we did it here. That was our one time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Friends'' forecast for the immediate future is, no
surprise, that we'll see the six stars in constant contact with
each other, no outsiders allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show always works best when we have the six of them
involved with each other,'' Kauffman says. ``When you bring someone
in from outside, it's never as successful as what we have between
them. These are the people viewers care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, they bug us all the time to let them kiss each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Since each of the six are also contractually obligated for two
more seasons _ and each received a cool $250,000 bonus from NBC
this past Christmas _ ``Friends'' isn't going anywhere soon.
</P>
<P>
   It does pose an interesting question, though: How could you ever
pull the plug on a show with such beloved characters?
</P>
<P>
   The previously silent Kudrow speaks up: ``What ending other than
a happy one could you want for these people? Oh! A tragic fire!''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, is there any cast member brave enough to
hazard a guess as to where the chaotic lives of Ross, Rachel,
Monica, Joey, Phoebe and Chandler will be, let's say, 10 years down
the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll all be married,'' Perry offers helpfully.
``Not to each other, you know, but married by then. We will have
each learned a lot _ and probably our hair will be even more
different.''

MAKING HIS MARK: MARK WAHLBERG BIDS FOR ACTION STARDOM

 Includes a color slide of Mark Wahlberg in a scene from ``The
Corruptor.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Alma Wahlberg wants to see less of her son Mark.
 &HT;    It was bad enough when he was modeling Calvin Klein underwear,
but in ``Boogie Nights'' (1997) he often wore nothing at all, and
in fact prominently displayed his ... well, his endowment for the
arts. And for the past few months the movie has been playing around
the clock on cable.
 &HT;    ``I can already hear the message on my answering machine,''
Wahlberg says. ``It will go something like, `Honey, Aunt Gertrude
saw ``Boogie Nights'' on HBO and she passed out. What are we going
to do?'''
 &HT;    Just one more complication of life post ``Boogie Nights'':
 &HT;    ``I've been very busy,'' the actor sums up. ``I get bothered.
People ask me about my private parts. A lot.''
 &HT;    The organ in question was artificial, Wahlberg adds, a fact
which he's stressed in interviews any number of times.
 &HT;    ``But just the other day a journalist asked me if it was real. I
said, `Look, ask the director.' The journalist said, `No, I'm
talking about Burt Reynolds' hair in the film.'
 &HT;    ``I was like, `Hey, I really have no idea.''' He laughs. ``Now,
that's a tough question!''
 &HT;    Wahlberg can afford to laugh. The former Marky Mark has left his
rap days behind, and finds himself suddenly famous _ if not quite
as much so as his buddy Leonardo DiCaprio, with whom he co-starred
in ``The Basketball Diaries'' (1995), certainly enough to change
his life.
 &HT;    ``Fame is such a scary proposition,'' Wahlberg says. ``I talk to
Leo about the pressure of having everyone suddenly love you. I was
in a similar situation when I first started in music ... The weird
thing is that one day you're the poster on some girl's wall, and
the next she's ripping you down to put up Marilyn Manson.
 &HT;    ``It's all about survival for me now,'' Wahlberg says. ``For me
the `Boogie Nights' years represent a time to stop dealing in the
b---sh-t and just do good work.''
 &HT;    The 27-year-old is working even now, despite appearing relaxed
in jeans and a sweater in a suite at New York's Regency Hotel. He's
there to do interviews about ``The Corruptor,'' opening March 5.
It's an action movie in which a Los Angeles police officer
(Wahlberg) with a canny Chinatown cop (Chow Yun-Fat) team up to
combat some vicious ganglords.
 &HT;    ``Chow is amazing, man,'' Wahlberg says of the legendary Hong
Kong star. ``He's a different type of action hero in this movie.''
 &HT;    Wahlberg signed on to do ``The Corruptor'' after turning down a
role _ eventually taken by Joaquin Phoenix _ in Joel Schumacher's
upcoming sleazefest, ``8 mm.''
 &HT;    ``It was a great script, but they wanted me to play Dirk Diggler
Part Two, and I couldn't do it,'' he says. ``I would have loved to
have worked with Nic Cage, but the minute I read in the cript that
my character would be introduced in a porn shop and that he knows
everything about porn and S&AMP;M, I said `Nah.' I just couldn't get up
the energy to do it.
 &HT;    ``They told me, `Kevin Costner did two baseball films.' I said,
`Yeah, but that's America's pastime. We're talking about porn here,
and I don't even like porn, man.'''
 &HT;    That same reaction almost caused him to reject ``Boogie
Nights,'' he recalls. Though such previous films as ``Renaissance
Man'' (1995), ``The Basketball Diaries'' and ``Fear'' (1997) hadn't
set the box office on fire, and he really couldn't afford to turn
down high-profile roles, he nonetheless hesitated.
 &HT;    ``When I started acting,'' he explains, ``I vowed there would be
three things I would never do in a film: sing, dance and take my
clothes off. In one film, I broke every rule.''
 &HT;    Wahlberg is used to breaking the rules, though. He grew up in
Dorchester, Mass., son of a nurse and a trucker who divorced when
Wahlberg was 11. As a child of a working single parent, the young
man had plenty of time to get into trouble, and he usually did.
 &HT;    ``Every day I had this routine: Wake up, go outside, make money,
get into something bad,'' Wahlberg recalls. ``I knew it was just a
matter of time before I would be locked up and somebody would just
throw the key away.''
 &HT;    In 1988 it happened. The 15-year-old Wahlberg did a 45-day jail
stint for assaulting a man over a bottle of beer.
 &HT;    ``It was a real wakeup call,'' he recalls. ``I convinced myself
during those 45 days that I was never coming back.''
 &HT;    At the time of his release, his brother Donnie had just become a
teen idol with the band New Kids on the Block. Inspired, Wahlberg
became the front man for his own group, Marky Mark and The Funky
Bunch.
 &HT;    Their 1991 album went platinum. And one night on stage, on a
dare, Wahlberg dropped his drawers _ and hit paydirt. He landed a
lucrative contract as the official Calvin Klein underwear model.
 &HT;    Those were raucous years for a young man who loved to cause a
stir. He loomed over Times Square on a billboard, virtually naked.
He dedicated his 1993 autobiographical photo book to his penis.
Gossip columnists buzzed about public brawls.
 &HT;    As the initial hype died down, Wahlberg reassessed his life and
decided to take control of things. He said goodbye to rap and to
modeling, and declared that Marky Mark was dead _ long live Mark
Wahlberg, the actor.
 &HT;    ``I'm not totally knocking it, but once I did those ads, I
started to feel like my voice was being taken away from me,''
Wahlberg says. ``I started to feel like I was just this body. I
knew I had to totally turn things around so I would be heard.''
 &HT;    Hollywood laughed, but Wahlberg stuck with it and, with ``Boogie
Nights,'' his efforts paid off. Now he has boxloads of scripts to
consider, and he can turn down anything which doesn't strike his
fancy.
 &HT;    Next up may be a boxing film, ``Out On My Feet.'' It's a drama
about a young man being trained by an aging boxer, a role to be
played by none other than the ``Raging Bull'' himself, Robert De
Niro.
 &HT;    Working with a Hollywood heavyweight such as De Niro was
inspiring, the younger actor says.
 &HT;    ``We're doing these fight scenes together,'' he recalls, ``and I
didn't want to hit hard. But De Niro is like, `Go, go, go, kid!' So
I had to hit him. I couldn't be scared. I had to go for it.''
 &HT;    He's also got a new album in the works _ but don't expect it to
be more of the same old thing.
 &HT;    ``Marky Mark is retired,'' he says flatly. ``I love to make
music. But as far as going out, pulling down my pants and running
around in my underwear, well, I don't think I could do that
anymore.''
 &HT;    At least not right now.
 &HT;    ``Maybe I'll do a 20th-anniversary reunion tour,'' he says
jokingly. ``I'll come out with my big beer belly, pull my pants
down and listen to the people groan.''

BACK TO BASICS: VINCE GILL LOOKS FOR HIS COUNTRY ROOTS

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of country singer Vince Gill. 
 By BETH TORROLL  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He may be the poster boy for today's emerging traditional
country music, but don't say it to Vince Gill's face.
 &HT;    The singer/songwriter, whose personal artistic style has run the
gamut from bluegrass to country/pop, looked back to his country
roots for his latest studio album, ``The Key'' (1998), a salute to
the style of classic country.
 &HT;    But Gill insists that he recorded this particular set of songs
for himself, not intending to lead any parade back to what he
interprets country music to be.
 &HT;    ``It's really a very traditional country record, what I find
country music is to me,'' he says. ``I don't think what is on the
majority of country radio these days is country music. I don't say
that with my fingers crossed behind my back, because I've made a
lot of records that I don't think are country music.''
 &HT;    Certainly Gill has recorded more than a few songs that have
riled the country-music establishment, building his career on the
emotional pop/country ballad alongside his trademark,
sometimes-giddy uptempo numbers, featuring Gill's crystal-clear,
high-tenor voice and masterful guitar work.
 &HT;    Gill is a pretty casual guy, with a passion for fast food, a
quick wit and a mean golf game. He is what he is with no apologies,
he says, and when he hears something in his head, he goes with it.
This time around it was a classic-country voice that he heard, so
that's what he recorded.
 &HT;    It's no wonder that the sad sound of classic country came
naturally to Gill, because his year leading up to the August 1998
release of ``The Key'' was a rough one. His divorce from wife Janis
Gill, herself a performer with Sweethearts of the Rodeo, was
compounded by the loss of his father, Stan Gill, to cancer.
 &HT;    Together, the two blows rocked Gill's emotional foundation,
driving him from the stage for a nine-month rest in 1997 and early
1998. During this time, he continued to write, record, golf, spend
time with Jenny, his teen-age daughter, staying close to his
Nashville home much of the time.
 &HT;    ``I don't know that I did a lot of soul searching or did a lot
of in-depth looking at my life or any of that,'' Gill says. ``I'm
not that deep.''
 &HT;    But the loss of his father caused the singer to reflect on the
songs he was raised on, classic country that helped to shape the
tone of ``The Key.''
 &HT;    ``Me losing my dad made me remember old songs,'' the 41-year-old
musician recalls. ``It made me really remember what I love about
country music. It's not me trying to say, `OK, country music has
gone way too far' _ that was not the exercise of this record in the
least.
 &HT;    ``All it was is me missing, personally, that style of country
music. I missed recording it, and I wanted to make a record that
never strayed from it.''
 &HT;    Not only did Gill's father inspire the tone of the project, but
his lessons inspired the singer to write a particularly emotional
song for the album.
 &HT;    ``The most poignant song, to me, is the song about my father
that I wrote called `The Key To Life,''' he says. ``That one is
really the heart-on-the-sleeve of the songs.''
 &HT;    An Oklahoma native, Gill began in bluegrass as a member of the
Bluegrass Alliance and Byron Berline's Sundance. He branched out in
1979 as the lead singer for the pop/country group Pure Prairie
League, rendering lead vocals on several hits, including ``Let Me
Love You Tonight.''
 &HT;    The young musician spent most of the 1980s as a sideman, joining
Rodney Crowell's Cherry Bombs and touring with Emmylou Harris, as
well as singing and playing guitar on numerous Nashville
recordings.
 &HT;    He had signed his first solo recording deal, with RCA executive
Tony Brown _ formerly a Cherry Bombs piano player _ as early as
1983. But his solo career didn't lift off until he followed Brown
to MCA in 1989. ``When I Call Your Name'' (1990), a tailor-made
showcase for Gill's talents, earned a Grammy and two Academy of
Country Music awards.
 &HT;    Thereafter one hit led to another _ ``Pocket Full of Gold'' to
``Look At Us'' to ``Go Rest High on That Mountain'' to ``When I
Call Your Name'' _ and Vince Gill became a household name. Along
the way, he earned a shelf of trophies, including 11 Grammy awards,
20 BMI Songwriter awards and 17 Country Music Association awards _
more CMAs than any other performer has ever won.
 &HT;    Gill insists that popularity isn't an issue for him. He makes
music because it's in his soul, he says, and he gives the
impression that, even if his spotlight fades, he'll continue down
his own artistic path regardless, stretching and exploring.
 &HT;    So when he had to piece together ``The Key'' during a period
when his personal world was askew, Gill naturally turned to artists
who had inspired the generation before him, artists whose music had
helped form the foundation of music as he knew it.
 &HT;    ``The records of Ray Price were inspirational, but also the
record that Ray Charles made in the early '60s (``Modern Sounds In
Country and Western Music'') was a very beautiful, orchestrated way
of doing really traditional country songs. It wasn't all edgy and
up tempo and all of that, so that's where I started, that's what I
heard in my head.
 &HT;    ``I'm not trying to be retro,'' he adds. ``I'm not trying to be
anything that I haven't been. It's just inspired my music.''
 &HT;    Gill invited friends such as Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, LeAnn
Womack and Alison Krauss to sing on the album, and when ``The Key''
was released it debuted at No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums
chart.
 &HT;    In addition to ``The Key,'' 1998 also brought ``Breath of
Heaven,'' Gill's second Christmas album, featuring a collection of
holiday standards.
 &HT;    ``That's my opportunity to step out of my country career, so to
speak,'' he says, ``and try to be Nat `King' Cole and try to be
Johnny Mathis or Bing Crosby or Frank Sinatra.''
 &HT;    The latter resonance was particularly noteworthy, because the
album was recorded on the day after Sinatra's death, at the Capitol
Records studio in Los Angeles that Sinatra made famous and with
famed arranger Patrick Williams using several of Sinatra's band
members.
 &HT;    The new year began with Gill's Jan. 30 appearance on A&AMP;E's
popular concert show, ``Live By Request.'' Next up is a major tour
that will begin March 4 at the Houston Livestock and Rodeo Show.
 &HT;    He'll even stretch his wings as a producer when new artist Sonya
Issacs releases her debut album later in the year. Producing is
more than just a lark for him, the singer adds.
 &HT;    ``It's a lot of fun,'' he says. ``Something for me to do when I
get old, instead of riding buses!''
 &HT;    Gill's turn toward the traditional side of country is no
about-face, merely a shift in emphasis for an artist who has always
leaned toward the classic sound.
 &HT;    ``I'm not out to be the new Roy Acuff,'' he says. ``I'm not out
to save the Opry. I'm not out to make a traditional record and say
`Hey, everybody, we're going too far.'
 &HT;    ``I'm just doing what I do, what moves me.''

SEEING CHINA'S CHALLENGE THROUGH A COLD WAR LENS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone charting the rise of China, it has been a pretty
scary couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, the first reports surfaced that China's Communist
Party leaders had set out to funnel money into Democratic political
campaigns to buy influence. Then there was a stream of reports that
Chinese rocket scientists had taken advantage of their American
partners in the space-launch business to improve the accuracy of
China's strategic nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, a bipartisan congressional panel concluded in a
700-page classified report that Chinese agents had pilfered an
array of sensitive U.S. military technology over the last two
decades, including, perhaps, the design secret of one of America's
most sophisticated thermonuclear warheads, the W-88, which sits
atop the Trident II missiles in U.S. submarines.
</P>
<P>
   It all seems to add up to an alarming picture of military
modernization, coinciding with steadily expanding defense budgets
to finance the purchase of new Russian warplanes, submarines and
destroyers.
</P>
<P>
   Is the China threat coming true?
</P>
<P>
   The question betrays America's Cold War legacy. China certainly
intends to establish itself as a credible military power, one that
can defend its national interests near its shores, whether that
means fighting for its share of the oil resources of the South
China Sea or asserting its sovereignty over Taiwan _ still
separated from the mainland since Chiang Kai-Shek fled there with
his army in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no evidence that China is seeking to compete with
the United States as a global military power as the Soviet Union
once did.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts now argue that with the collapse of the Soviet
Union, China is turning into America's foremost rival, arming
itself for the day when it can kick the United States out of Asia
and then lord it over Japan, Taiwan and the Southeast Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
   These experts cite as evidence of China's hostility its missile
tests and war games near Taiwan in 1995 and 1996; in response, U.S.
aircraft carriers were dispatched to deliver a pointed message to
Beijing that military coercion would not be tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   But others say America should relax about China and resist the
Cold War reflex, with every Chinese advance, to grab a shovel to
dig that bomb shelter in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger, the dean of the Cold
Warriors in the 1970s, says: ``China is not going to be a world
power in the existing period, and possibly never. They recognize
it, and the last thing they want is to tangle with the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Suettinger, until recently the CIA's senior analyst for
Asia and now a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution,
agrees. The intelligence community consensus on China ``doesn't add
up to a threat,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with the passing of the Cold War, during which China and
the United States had common interest in opposing Soviet
adventurism in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, there is little
today that anchors the U.S. relationship with China. Hence
President Clinton's difficulty in sustaining a policy of engagement
in the face of each new report of dissident arrests, technological
espionage and the missile buildup against Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever challenge China might pose in the future, it won't be
anything like the danger once posed by Soviet divisions poised
against Europe, by Soviet armadas in every ocean and thousands of
Soviet nuclear warheads aimed at America.
</P>
<P>
   While Moscow built a wall around its irrational economy, China
has been busy building export markets, opening its economy and
expanding personal freedom at home (up to a point). Having
witnessed Japan's success, China's leaders believe that in the next
century, national power will be measured by economic strength, not
military.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, China is joining world institutions, not threatening
them. Chinese exports are the engine of China's growth. They have
given Beijing the same stake in peace and stability that every
other nation has in the era of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger says the danger of overindulging America's worst
fears about China is that it might actually produce the hostile
opponent that some Americans foresee. Get over it, he says.
</P>
<P>
   To experts like him, China's gradual military modernization is
an inescapable outgrowth of national development. In this view, the
disturbing record of Chinese espionage in the United States proves
only that Beijing has been pursuing its own interests much as
Taiwan, Egypt, Israel, Russia, France and Brazil all have, at the
United States' expense.
</P>
<P>
   Even that reality may not be so alarming. The roots of the
Chinese espionage go back to the late 1970s, when Chinese leader
Deng Xiaoping pressed U.S. officials for technology to help China
modernize. It is now known that he also hedged his bets by ordering
China's spy agency to go after critical technologies through the
back door. Much of the effort, however, was bungled or detected by
U.S. intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   And anyway, for all of China's illicit acquisitions, the Chinese
military stubbornly refuses to improve.
</P>
<P>
   John Culver, the CIA's military expert on China, told a National
Defense University forum last year that China's army ``is still
largely the same force it was at the time the USSR collapsed,'' and
that ``it is still overwhelmingly a ground army with an inventory
of weapons that, in most cases, has been deployed with the same
units for up to 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with new Russian jet fighters, submarines, destroyers and a
whole array of new missiles, Culver argued, the Chinese army has
created only a few ``pockets of modernity'' and has failed to alter
the military balance with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   On average, Chinese pilots fly far fewer training hours than
those in any modern air force. The Chinese navy and air force are
facing obsolescence of their Soviet-era warplanes and warships.

MILDER WILDER: A MORE THOUGHTFUL GENE WILDER RETURNS TO THE SMALL
SCREEN

 Includes a color slide of Gene Wilder in a scene from ``Alice in
Wonderland.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He may be playing the Mock Turtle in the upcoming
television-movie version of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' but he's
mocking no one today. In fact, the comic actor Gene Wilder may be
open, talkative and friendly, but he's a distinctly serious man.
 &HT;    That's understandable, since he's know his share of unhappiness
along with the laughter, most notably the 1989 death from ovarian
cancer of his wife, comedian Gilda Radner.
 &HT;    ``My early life was a combination of sadness and hilarity,'' the
63-year-old Wilder says, relaxing on a couch at a
satellite-television studio in Manhattan. ``There was a lot of
sadness in my life. My mother was so ill, and I was told not to
ever argue with her, because it might kill her. But I was told to
make her laugh.
 &HT;    ``So there was always an underpinning of sadness around, lurking
in the shadows,'' he says. ``In my actual life, especially now, I'm
the happiest man I know.
 &HT;    ``I'm very fortunate to have found love again after Gilda died.
I'm very fortunate to live a wonderful, quiet life in the country,
to write and paint and act, really, when I want to act.''
 &HT;    For a long while, Wilder _ who starred in such memorable films
as ``Bonnie &AMP; Clyde'' (1967), ``The Producers'' (1968), ``Willy
Wonka and the Chocolate Factory'' (1971), ``Young Frankenstein''
(1974) and ``Stir Crazy'' (1980), as well as the lamentable 1995
television sitcom, ``Something Wilder'' _ simply didn't feel the
urge to act.
 &HT;    But lately he's been increasingly visible. He wrote and starred
in ``Murder in a Small Town'' (1999), a cable movie which aired on
the Arts &AMP; Entertainment Network in January, and on Feb. 28 he'll
turn up as the Mock Turtle in NBC's three-hour-long retelling of
Lewis Carroll's ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland.''
 &HT;    The special-effects-driven movie, directed by Nick Willing,
stars Tina Majorino as Alice, along with an all-star cast that
includes Whoopi Goldberg, Martin Short, Ben Kingsley and Miranda
Richardson. To play the singing, dancing and 2-inch-tall Mock
Turtle, Wilder sported shells and hair extensions, performing in
front of a blue screen and interacting only with Majorino.
 &HT;    It was a revelatory experience for the actor, who had never
liked ``Alice in Wonderland,'' either the book or the classic
Disney animated film.
 &HT;    ``I started performing at 13, and that was about the time I
became inquisitive about literature, about Dostoevski, Carroll and
Dickens,'' Wilder recalls. ``I just didn't get `Alice,' though. It
went by me _ I enjoyed some parts, but didn't understand what the
whole thing was about.
 &HT;    ``Later I understood more,'' he adds, ``but I never quite got
the meat of it, the heart and soul. And I never wanted to see the
cartoon version.
 &HT;    ``Then I received the script for the television movie last
summer,'' Wilder says, ``and I read it from beginning to end. It
was magnificent. It captured the essence of Carroll's story, and I
think I got what he was going for.
 &HT;    ``Let me put it in terms of Mock Turtle and Alice,'' he says
with a smile. ``Nick Willing told me that the fears we all have of
abandoning our childhood and venturing out into adulthood can be so
terrifying that sometimes we don't want to let go.
 &HT;    ``In Alice's case,'' he says, ``it was her fear of singing a
song in public. I related to that in a very personal way _ not
about singing, not about acting, but about getting up and speaking
to people.
 &HT;    ``I can perform before 2,500 people, but ask me to make a speech
at a banquet and it's still as hard for me as giving an oral book
report was at school,'' Wilder admits. ``I related that to Alice.''
 &HT;    In a sense, he says, the encounter between Alice and the Mock
Turtle represents a coming-of-age for Alice.
 &HT;    ``By the time she gets to Mock Turtle and the Gryphon, she can
say `This isn't right' or `I don't believe this,''' he says. ``I
put her through all kinds of tests, nudging her on to be brave, to
try singing with me. When we're done I've made her laugh and sing.
I've exposed my emotions to her, and I see that she's ready to move
on.
 &HT;    ``I tell her, `Dear, you're ready to go on,' and what I'm really
saying is that she's ready to become a woman and to let her fears
drop.''
 &HT;    Wilder is even more pleased with ``Murder in a Small Town.''
Based on its solid reviews and ratings, A&AMP;E has already
commissioned Wilder and director Joyce Chopra for a follow-up.
 &HT;    ```Murder' was everything I set out to do as a writer and an
actor,'' he says proudly. ``There was a particularly huge sense of
satisfaction at having written it.
 &HT;    ``I'm on page 70 of the next one, which won't be a sequel,'' he
adds. ``Four characters are the same, and Joyce Chopra and I are
hoping to form a repertory company of sorts, using the same actors,
even if their characters died, in different roles in the next one.
 &HT;    ``If we're lucky, we'll do one movie every 10 or 12 months.''
 &HT;    It's no accident that both ``Alice'' and ``Murder'' are
small-screen projects, or that Wilder hasn't made a theatrical film
since the abysmal ``Another You'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``The world of film has changed,'' he says matter-of-factly. ``I
took some time off, and when I came back I didn't like what I was
being offered.
 &HT;    ``At this point I don't want to do anything I don't like, don't
want to see, that I think might disappoint an audience,'' he says.
``Why do it? I'd rather wait until the bell goes off in my head.''
 &HT;    Wilder has never been a prototypical movie star, anyway. In
fact, he notes, most of the films for which he's best known
originally flopped.
 &HT;    ```The Producers' failed,'' he says. ``It was sold down the
river to television so the producer could make his money back. Now
it's a cult film.
 &HT;    ```Willy Wonka' failed at the box office,'' he continues. ```The
Frisco Kid' (1979) failed at the box office. My three favorite
films are `The Producers,' `Young Frankenstein' _ which did not
fail at the box office _ and `Frisco Kid.'
 &HT;    ```Blazing Saddles' was great fun, too, and very popular,''
Wilder adds, ``but it amazes me that two out of my favorite three
films were failures initially. Then again, so was `The Wizard of
Oz' (1939).''
 &HT;    Wilder currently lives in Connecticut with his second wife,
Karen, in a home left to him by Radner. The actor spends a good
deal of time raising funds for cancer causes, and says he often
thinks of Radner.
 &HT;    ``Her spirit is the first thing that comes to mind,'' he says
wistfully. ``She was a firefly, and if you knew her you saw that
her flame didn't go off very often.
 &HT;    ``Gilda just had a great spirit.''
 &HT;    Though he's experienced his ups and downs, the actor isn't
complaining. All in all, he thinks Jerry Silberman, the Milwaukee
boy who grew up to be Gene Wilder, would be impressed by Gene
Wilder's life and career.
 &HT;    ``If you talked about that with Jerry when he was Jerry, he'd be
tickled to death _ or tickled to life,'' Wilder says. ``He'd be
very happy.
 &HT;    ``It's scary when you want to be an actor and you're just a
little pipsqueak from Milwaukee,'' he says thoughtfully. ``You
don't know if you'll make it or not, and things like eating and
surviving don't even enter your mind.
 &HT;    ``I just wanted to get roles in plays. It may have been ignorant
intuition, but I thought that if I got parts in plays, everything
would eventually take care of itself.
 &HT;    ``And it did.''

 Includes a color slide of Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox and Lisa
Kudrow in a scene from ``Friends.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 From TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In many ways, ``Friends'' is like a fast-and-funny soap opera:
All of the cast are attractive, all have interesting lives, great
clothes and cool apartments. And, just like on a soap, the six
``Friends'' players interact only with each other, whether on a
romantic or platonic level.
</P>
<P>
   In its sixth season, the slick formula still works. In fact,
it's propelled ``Friends'' to its highest ratings ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real challenge now,'' deadpans David Schwimmer, who
plays Ross, ``is coming up with new hairstyles every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It's never dull. And, if you're a fan, you
literally have to watch every week to keep up on who's sleeping
together or breaking up.
</P>
<P>
   Take this current, eventful season: Chandler (Matthew Perry) and
Monica (Courteney Cox) spent the early stages furtively trying to
hide their steamy love trysts. Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) and Ross
called it quits _ again _ prompting Ross' current midlife crisis,
while Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) was busy playing surrogate mother to her
sister's twins. As for slow-witted Joey (Matt LeBlanc), well, he's
been occupied enough just being Joey.
</P>
<P>
   It's not often you get the entire cast of ``Friends'' to
assemble for an interview, but when it does happen, you realize
just how good-looking they are. And how levelheaded they are about
their success, as Perry demonstrates when asked about their
characters' glamorous-if-hectic lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I kind of like that Chandler is finally getting a little
less neurotic this season,'' Perry says jokingly. ``Plus he's in a
relationship with Monica _ I love that I get to kiss Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   On the breakup front, Aniston is grateful that the long,
drawn-out affair between Rachel and Ross apparently has finally
reached a finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest thing was that Rachel had the ability to let Ross
go when she finally saw what was at stake for him,'' she says. ``As
painful as that was, it was also a wonderful thing for her as a
woman in terms of self-growth and being selfless.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, it's not unusual for any of the ``Friends'' cast
to talk about their characters as if they were real people. In some
ways they are, since each performer was cast directly to type and
has varied little over five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   They may live in a fanciful sitcom world, in short, but to
Aniston there's a lot of realism in the friendships played out on
the show. For example, she doesn't see any comparison between the
soulful, supportive female relationships on ``Friends'' and those
combative, business-suit-clad babes on ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean, with girls at each other's throats?'' Aniston says
with a grimace. ``I don't think that's real life. It exists, I'm
sure, but not with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that the show's creators/executive producers,
Marta Kauffman, David Crane and Kevin Bright, always planned to
keep things hopping on ``Friends.'' That explains why the story
lines bounce back and forth between the six pals in equal
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have six characters,'' Kauffman says, ``they all have
lives of equal importance, but the variations are endless. We have
to keep pushing ourselves to keep it different, fresh and funny ...
In an odd way, these six are our children. We love them all
equally.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helps, of course, that those children are all still
extremely attractive and have collectively kept out of any
career-ending tabloid scandals. Their dating lives may occasionally
turn up in the gossip columns _ with veiled whispers of Aniston
dating Brad Pitt or Perry getting cozy with ``Party of Five'' star
Neve Campbell _ but they wear their success quite well.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they've come a long way from the histrionics
of their first breakout season, when each went from relative
unknown to magazine covers in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first year, we got some undergarments in the mail,''
Schwimmer says sheepishly. ``Uh, a marriage proposal. That was
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The sextet nod as a group when asked if these days they're more
comfortable about going out in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in your attitude,'' Aniston says. ``If you want to go
to the store, you go to the store. There's always going to be
someone who recognizes you. But it's not like you can't leave the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   LeBlanc agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact we all live and work in Los Angeles, which is full of
actors and celebrities, makes it easier,'' he says. ``It's easier
to go to the supermarket here than if we lived somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears extremely unlikely that the show will be leaving the
Warner soundstage in Burbank for another road trip in the near
future. Last season finished with a three-episode arc that had the
entire cast _ except Kudrow, who was pregnant _ on location in
London for Ross' ultimately disastrous wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a few personal highlights, including their meeting
quasi-royal Sarah Ferguson _ a.k.a. the Duchess of York _ when she
made a cameo appearance, the trip was a one-shot deal, the actors
agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just too hard,'' Aniston says with a sigh. ``We were
exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides uprooting the cast and crew and shooting in a
different time zone,'' Kauffman adds, ``we were in a foreign
country in unfamiliar surroundings. It took a lot longer than it
would have if we did it here. That was our one time.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Friends'' forecast for the immediate future is, no
surprise, that we'll see the six stars in constant contact with
each other, no outsiders allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show always works best when we have the six of them
involved with each other,'' Kauffman says. ``When you bring someone
in from outside, it's never as successful as what we have between
them. These are the people viewers care about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, they bug us all the time to let them kiss each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Since each of the six are also contractually obligated for two
more seasons _ and each received a cool $250,000 bonus from NBC
this past Christmas _ ``Friends'' isn't going anywhere soon.
</P>
<P>
   It does pose an interesting question, though: How could you ever
pull the plug on a show with such beloved characters?
</P>
<P>
   The previously silent Kudrow speaks up: ``What ending other than
a happy one could you want for these people? Oh! A tragic fire!''
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, is there any cast member brave enough to
hazard a guess as to where the chaotic lives of Ross, Rachel,
Monica, Joey, Phoebe and Chandler will be, let's say, 10 years down
the road?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we'll all be married,'' Perry offers helpfully.
``Not to each other, you know, but married by then. We will have
each learned a lot _ and probably our hair will be even more
different.''

MEXICO CITY'S AIR: A FATAL CASE OF FATALISM

   CIUDAD NEZAHUALCOYOTL, Mexico _ This winter the residents of
Mexico City, who are long accustomed to breathing toxic
concentrations of ozone, are also breathing poisonous amounts of
something else: tiny airborne particles of bus exhaust, industrial
smoke, garbage and what the authorities refer to, with scientific
detachment, as fecal matter.
</P>
<P>
   Since December the city government has twice declared pollution
emergencies in which, for the first time, the chief cause was not
ozone but dismal clouds of particles. Schoolchildren were required
to stay indoors and vehicles with dirty engines were barred from
the streets. Health Ministry surveys showed that within a week
after the highest particle levels were registered, fully half of
the metropolis' 18 million residents became sick with some
respiratory ailment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the inhabitants have endured the new indignity of inhaling
refuse and excrement with the same calm they show when choking on
car fumes. Once again, the only protests have come from drivers
whose vehicles were immobilized during the emergency.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two decades since Mexico City first recognized its
critical pollution problem. Successive governments have taken some
measures to confront it, from improving gasoline quality to
restricting the movements of polluting vehicles. But public buses,
open dumps, unsupervised industries and aging cars continue to
cough out contaminants. The Mexican capital remains one of the most
dangerous places on the planet to take a breath.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say Mexican officials are to blame for being
slow to react. But an important part of the inertia comes from the
citizens who live with the bad air. For decades they suffered under
governments that were venal and ineffective and that often failed
to respond to demands for the most basic services, like water and
sewage. Until 1997, city politics was dominated by an overbearing
one-party system that discouraged independent grass-roots
organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Now many city residents are sunk in a cycle of self-fulfilling
powerlessness. They don't believe they can bring about a change in
a problem as stubborn and pervasive as smog, so they don't try. As
a result, there has never been any groundswell of popular outrage
to push decision-makers to make the ambitious changes needed to
achieve drastic reductions in pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The syndrome is illustrated by Ciudad Nezahualcoyotl, a city of
2 million working-class Mexicans in the northeast corner of the
metropolitan area. One of its borders is a vast, rank-smelling
desert of dust and garbage. In the days of the Aztecs, the plain
was the bed of Lake Texcoco. But the water was drained away during
the voracious development of Mexico City in the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Now the parched lake bed is an open-air dump cluttered with
mountains of burning tires, construction rubble, factory waste and
rotting trash. An open sewer canal running with viscous black water
winds through the dump into the city. Poor water pressure and
drainage leave hundreds of thousands of Nezahualcoyotl residents
without running water in their homes. The dump and canal often
substitute for indoor plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Countless animals relieve themselves there as well. In the dry
winter months the prevailing southerly winds swirl over the lake
bed, lifting its foul dust and spreading it over the rest of Mexico
City.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live near the dump know well how the dust can
damage health _ and what it would take to get it cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just breathe pollution, so we never get well,'' said Ivonne
Vega, 23, as she pressed a tissue to her nose. Alongside her
toddled her sniffling 18-month-old son; he was just recovering, she
said, from one of his almost-constant throat infections.
</P>
<P>
   Franceli Vela Uriostegui, 37, went at mid-morning to a public
primary school a block from the dump to pick up her 8-year-old
niece, who had suddenly developed flu-like symptoms and a red chest
rash. ``I think we're just dying slowly,'' Mrs. Uriostegui said
mournfully.
</P>
<P>
   But Nezahualcoyotl residents respond to the threat with a
consistent refrain, typified by Alejandra Perez, 18, who drives a
horse-drawn garbage collection cart. ``Of course it bothers us,''
he said. ``But we don't do anything about it. No one in power would
pay any attention to us if we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents have many needs they consider much more pressing that
the city government has failed to meet. After 30 years in her
house, for example, Isabel Bustamante still has no running water.
</P>
<P>
   As for pollution, Jose Luis Lezama, a sociologist who studies
the politics behind the issue, says: ``The citizens and the
government share in a will to minimize the problem. Since the
possibilities for change are so slight, the best solution is to
ignore it. Mexicans have other priorities. They see pollution as a
luxury problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City does have a sophisticated system for monitoring
smog, and over the last decade a clear decrease in ozone has been
achieved, even though levels remain far above international
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But Alejandro Encinas, the city's environment secretary, said he
receives nothing but complaints from drivers who have been forced
to clean up their engines or whose dirty cars have been halted on
high-pollution days. ``People in this city would rather drive than
breathe,'' Encinas said.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, to get better air Mexicans will have to start
changing some of their own ways. But they are reluctant, because
they believe they can only lose. Among the worst sources of ozone
and particles, for example, are the thousands of driver-owned
minibuses that are the only public transportation in many poor
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Encinas, an energetic idealist who is full of novel
anti-pollution plans, wants residents to give them up and go back
to using the metro, which is far less convenient. There is,
predictably, little public backing for this. So for now, Encinas
said, he will try to persuade the minibus drivers to convert to
natural gas, a cleaner fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The most vulnerable victims of the sullied air are the city's
youth. A study that the World Health Organization is conducting
looked at the combined effects of three leading contaminants in
most of the world's large, heavily-polluted cities and found that
Mexico City's unique cocktail is the most noxious for children _
the equivalent of smoking two packs of cigarettes a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico City has the most children facing the greatest risk,''
said Devra Davis, an epidemiologist at the World Resources
Institute in Washington who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their parents, the children do not believe they are
doomed to live with aching lungs, researchers say. Last year the
Health Ministry held a contest in city primary schools asking for
solutions to the smog. The students came up with all kinds of ideas
for improving their own performance, from adopting trees to
cleaning up after their pets. The reward for the winners was a
little help from the Ministry in helping them put their proposals
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But those are Mexico City's children. There is no sign that
their optimism has helped to dispel the haze of fatalism that
engulfs their parents.

<P>
   Two Stanford University researchers, John W. Lewis and Xue
Litai, report in a new study that by 1990, half of the aircraft in
the Chinese air force were not operational. Even with new Russian
purchases, Chinese air power hardly exists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the risk of confrontation remains. Since 1960, China has
fought border wars with India, the Soviet Union and Vietnam. The
borders with those countries are now quiet, but Taiwan looms as an
unresolved conflict where both sides see sovereign interests at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   If Taiwan declared its independence tomorrow, or if Beijing
issued an ultimatum for Taiwan's reunification with the motherland,
a new crisis could erupt.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over China is only going to get louder as the 2000
presidential election season approaches. Both Republican and
Democratic strategists see China policy as a rallying point for
voters concerned about human rights, religious freedom and the
proliferation of Chinese nuclear and missile technologies to
unstable regions.
</P>
<P>
   A huge factor is China itself, where repression remains a
dominant feature of the security apparatus, and where some military
leaders wear their chauvinism like a battle ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Since Woodrow Wilson's time, Americans have insisted that their
foreign policy reflect moral values, and China continues to rub
America the wrong way. Ten years after the Tiananmen massacres,
polls show that Americans, by a roughly two-thirds majority, are
still inclined to think the worst of China.
</P>
<P>
   Schlesinger is among those who are inclined the other way, which
may seem strange for an old Cold Warrior. China, he says, should
not become America's ``designated enemy.'' The Chinese still look
to America to help them overcome the daunting challenges of
rebuilding backward industries, managing scarce resources,
alleviating poverty and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be self-defeating as well as a negation of the
magnanimity of the United States,'' he says, ``to presuppose that
China must turn into a hostile nation.''
</P>
<P>
   China could still turn hostile, says Schlesinger. But if it
does, he adds, it would be best if America were not the cause.

FOR Y2K UTOPIANS, A CHANCE TO REMAKE THE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the more sober prognosticators are right, the millennial
odometer will turn over in 10{ months with scattered disruptions,
some medium-sized glitches, but hardly a disaster anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that will count as a Y2K casualty will be
the vague sense of disappointment settling in on those who were
hoping, deep down, for a major change. After all the excitement and
anticipation, the empire of the technocrats won't have collapsed
after all. Lost will be the longed-for opportunity to start over
from scratch and finally bring on the Age of Aquarius.
</P>
<P>
   For years, sociologists and historians have predicted that
millennial anxiety would bring out a record number of religious
fundamentalists and right-wing survivalists joyfully preaching
doomsday scenarios and hoarding food and ammunition. Far more
surprising has been the manner in which a loose coalition of New
Agers, veterans of the 1960s counterculture and grass-roots
populists have enthusiastically embraced Y2K as a chance to cut
free from their stifling addiction to The System and remake
society.
</P>
<P>
   This is their vision: Threatened by the collapse of the power
and communications grids, the banking and financial networks, the
transportation system _ all the webs imposed from on high by the
technological elite _ people will join together to grow their own
vegetables, energize their homes with solar cells and windmills,
trade advice over the backyard fence and ``empower'' their
neighborhoods into old-fashioned communities.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be just the misprogrammed computer chips turning back
the clock at year's end. In the minds of these visionaries, Dec.
31, 1999, will be followed by 1900, a time before civilization was
so dependent on the corporate superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000 computer problem is not just a technical
problem, it is an opportunity for citizens to get together with
their neighbors and prepare themselves, their families and their
communities for the challenges that may lie ahead,'' the publisher
and editor Eric Utne wrote recently, announcing a 360,000-copy
printing of his Utne Reader ``Y2K Citizen's Action Guide.'' A kind
of ``Whole Earth Catalog'' for the new millenarianism, the booklet
is filled with advice on becoming as self-sufficient as a
Woodstock-era commune.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we prepare for Y2K, something surprising and quite
wonderful is going to happen,'' Utne predicts. ``We're going to get
to know our neighbors. Our communities will become safer, more
intimate, more resilient, more neighborly places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   All over the country, people will drift away from their
soon-to-be-darkened computer screens and meet at the community
garden for a homemade cappuccino and some organic greens. Or as
Utne put it in an introduction to the guide, ``Y2K is the excuse
we've been waiting for to stop making so many compromises in how we
know we should, and want to, live our lives.'' Finally, a chance to
do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   While there are sensible arguments for encouraging people to
prepare for the worst, some officials are worrying that the most
disruptive thing about Y2K will be runs on dehydrated food, bottled
water, fuel and other survival supplies. ``As it becomes clear our
national infrastructure will hold, overreaction becomes one of the
biggest remaining problems,'' John Koskinen, chairman of the
President's Commission on Year 2000 Conversion, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But for some who pine for the earthy optimism of the '60s, Y2K
is being greeted as something of a godsend, an antidote to the
sanitized '90s. In these artificial times, the old neighborhood
food co-ops have been co-opted by superchains like Wild Oats,
Alfalfa's, Whole Foods, and Fresh Fields, where nostalgic baby
boomers can scoop their own granola from plexiglass bins, pick up
homeopathic potions and grab a couple of 16-ounce chemical-free
porterhouse steaks for the grill. All that's missing is an organic
liquor section.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K offers the hope of returning to the real thing, Esalen-style
rhetoric and all. ``Using well-developed dialoguing and visioning
processes involving the entire community, people could develop new
ways to organize themselves with community-supported agriculture,
barter and alternative currencies, solar and wind energy, wholistic
and complementary medicine, and co-ops of all kinds,'' write two
contributors to the Utne guide, Gordon Davidson and Corinne
McLaughlin, cofounders of the Center for Visionary Leadership in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people realize they can mobilize their personal resources
and contribute to community-preparedness efforts, they feel more
confident and empowered that they can get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article called ``From Chaos to Coherence: The Emotional
Challenge of Y2K,'' Doc Childre and Bruce Cryer of a Silicon Valley
``wellness'' outfit called the Institute of HeartMath, see disaster
survival as an opportunity for personal self-actualization through
``intui-technology'': ``Institute of HeartMath research shows that
aligning the mind with the heart increases intelligence, enhances
intuition and helps you find creative solutions in balance with the
needs of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enthusiastic of the Y2K apostles is Paloma
O'Riley, cofounder of a Colorado-based organization named, with no
apparent irony, the Cassandra Project. Like the prophetess of Greek
mythology who foresaw the fall of Troy, Mrs. O'Riley travels the
country holding town meetings on how to preserve food, store water
in 55-gallon drums, foster neighborhood support groups and
generally fend for one's self in the face of a possible shutdown.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cassandra of old was cursed by Apollo to have her
prophecies ignored, Mrs. O'Riley, who became enthusiastic about
self-sufficiency when she left New York to homestead in the Alaskan
bush, finds ready audiences of people who seem to secretly long for
an extended Y2K camping experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will survive this, if we all work together,'' she assures
her followers. ``Eventually, the storm will pass and we'll wade
ashore _ together.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing to survive may be the anticlimax. A litany of
horror stories in an article in January's Vanity Fair about ``the
Y2K nightmare'' is oddly more reassuring than alarming: A batch of
chemicals at Amway was rejected because a computer figured it had
expired in 1900 instead of 2000; a medical information network
froze when asked to schedule a doctor's appointment in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But these incidents happened years ago, demonstrating that
companies have been confronting and overcoming Y2K problems all
along, as has every consumer who now carries a working credit card
expiring in 00 or 01. The fixes can be expensive but they are being
made.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of complex, intertwined systems that their
behavior cannot be precisely predicted, so the world may still be
in for a shock. Some experts warned that the first would come on
Jan. 1, 1999, when many systems started dealing with dates 12
months in the future. With that occasion safely behind, the next
milestone is in April for companies starting a new fiscal year, and
then in September, when 9/9/99 rolls around, possibly confusing
some computers.
</P>
<P>
   If these dates too pass uneventfully, along with the big one on
Dec. 31, then the new millenarians will be in much the same
position as the old religious fundamentalists who painstakingly add
up biblical generations to calculate, and then recalculate, the day
of the second coming. One by one, the milestones come and go,
judgment day postponed for another time.

<P>
   If the more sober prognosticators are right, the millennial
odometer will turn over in 10{ months with scattered disruptions,
some medium-sized glitches, but hardly a disaster anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that will count as a Y2K casualty will be
the vague sense of disappointment settling in on those who were
hoping, deep down, for a major change. After all the excitement and
anticipation, the empire of the technocrats won't have collapsed
after all. Lost will be the longed-for opportunity to start over
from scratch and finally bring on the Age of Aquarius.
</P>
<P>
   For years, sociologists and historians have predicted that
millennial anxiety would bring out a record number of religious
fundamentalists and right-wing survivalists joyfully preaching
doomsday scenarios and hoarding food and ammunition. Far more
surprising has been the manner in which a loose coalition of New
Agers, veterans of the 1960s counterculture and grass-roots
populists have enthusiastically embraced Y2K as a chance to cut
free from their stifling addiction to The System and remake
society.
</P>
<P>
   This is their vision: Threatened by the collapse of the power
and communications grids, the banking and financial networks, the
transportation system _ all the webs imposed from on high by the
technological elite _ people will join together to grow their own
vegetables, energize their homes with solar cells and windmills,
trade advice over the backyard fence and ``empower'' their
neighborhoods into old-fashioned communities.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be just the misprogrammed computer chips turning back
the clock at year's end. In the minds of these visionaries, Dec.
31, 1999, will be followed by 1900, a time before civilization was
so dependent on the corporate superstructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year 2000 computer problem is not just a technical
problem, it is an opportunity for citizens to get together with
their neighbors and prepare themselves, their families and their
communities for the challenges that may lie ahead,'' the publisher
and editor Eric Utne wrote recently, announcing a 360,000-copy
printing of his Utne Reader ``Y2K Citizen's Action Guide.'' A kind
of ``Whole Earth Catalog'' for the new millenarianism, the booklet
is filled with advice on becoming as self-sufficient as a
Woodstock-era commune.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we prepare for Y2K, something surprising and quite
wonderful is going to happen,'' Utne predicts. ``We're going to get
to know our neighbors. Our communities will become safer, more
intimate, more resilient, more neighborly places to live.''
</P>
<P>
   All over the country, people will drift away from their
soon-to-be-darkened computer screens and meet at the community
garden for a homemade cappuccino and some organic greens. Or as
Utne put it in an introduction to the guide, ``Y2K is the excuse
we've been waiting for to stop making so many compromises in how we
know we should, and want to, live our lives.'' Finally, a chance to
do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   While there are sensible arguments for encouraging people to
prepare for the worst, some officials are worrying that the most
disruptive thing about Y2K will be runs on dehydrated food, bottled
water, fuel and other survival supplies. ``As it becomes clear our
national infrastructure will hold, overreaction becomes one of the
biggest remaining problems,'' John Koskinen, chairman of the
President's Commission on Year 2000 Conversion, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But for some who pine for the earthy optimism of the '60s, Y2K
is being greeted as something of a godsend, an antidote to the
sanitized '90s. In these artificial times, the old neighborhood
food co-ops have been co-opted by superchains like Wild Oats,
Alfalfa's, Whole Foods, and Fresh Fields, where nostalgic baby
boomers can scoop their own granola from plexiglass bins, pick up
homeopathic potions and grab a couple of 16-ounce chemical-free
porterhouse steaks for the grill. All that's missing is an organic
liquor section.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K offers the hope of returning to the real thing, Esalen-style
rhetoric and all. ``Using well-developed dialoguing and visioning
processes involving the entire community, people could develop new
ways to organize themselves with community-supported agriculture,
barter and alternative currencies, solar and wind energy, wholistic
and complementary medicine, and co-ops of all kinds,'' write two
contributors to the Utne guide, Gordon Davidson and Corinne
McLaughlin, cofounders of the Center for Visionary Leadership in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``As people realize they can mobilize their personal resources
and contribute to community-preparedness efforts, they feel more
confident and empowered that they can get through this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article called ``From Chaos to Coherence: The Emotional
Challenge of Y2K,'' Doc Childre and Bruce Cryer of a Silicon Valley
``wellness'' outfit called the Institute of HeartMath, see disaster
survival as an opportunity for personal self-actualization through
``intui-technology'': ``Institute of HeartMath research shows that
aligning the mind with the heart increases intelligence, enhances
intuition and helps you find creative solutions in balance with the
needs of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most enthusiastic of the Y2K apostles is Paloma
O'Riley, cofounder of a Colorado-based organization named, with no
apparent irony, the Cassandra Project. Like the prophetess of Greek
mythology who foresaw the fall of Troy, Mrs. O'Riley travels the
country holding town meetings on how to preserve food, store water
in 55-gallon drums, foster neighborhood support groups and
generally fend for one's self in the face of a possible shutdown.

WHO'S WHO? MATCHING SKETCH TO SUSPECT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The police sketches of wanted suspects frequently
bear a striking resemblance to someone with two eyes, two ears, a
nose and a mouth. Sometimes they look like just about everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The four police officers from New York City's elite Street Crime
Unit who fired the barrage of 41 shots that killed an unarmed West
African immigrant earlier this month were carrying such a sketch, a
rendering of rapist who had been terrorizing a Bronx neighborhood
and for whom they were searching.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old victim, Amadou Diallo, was shot in the doorway
of his apartment in the Soundview section of the Bronx at 12:45
a.m. on Feb. 4. A lawyer for the officers said they mistakenly
thought Diallo had a gun. He did not have a gun; nor did he have a
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   While much of the controversy that swirled around the shooting
concerned the aggressive tactics of the police unit _ which prowls
the darkened city streets in unmarked cars and rough clothes,
hoping to pounce on criminals _ the incident also raised questions
about just how useful police sketches really are.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, sketches are often made with sophisticated computer
software that gives options for various facial features, and some
have proved to be enormously helpful in identifying suspects. But
the sketches or computer-generated photographs are still only as
good as a victim's recollection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty with a sketch is that it's based on eyewitness
information which can be fallible and imprecise,'' said James Alan
Fox, dean of Northeastern University's College of Criminal Justice.
``Because it's based on eyewitness recall, it's subject to error.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims are usually ``fearful and stressed,'' Fox added, which
can affect the descriptions they give to police sketch artists.
``It is a rendering of what people remember, and these
recollections are often flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Vernon Geberth, a retired New York city homicide detective who
is the author of the definitive textbook in the field, ``Practical
Homicide Investigation'' (CRC Press, 1996), was similarly cautious
about the use of the composite sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to go out there with some of the sketches I've seen,
I'd be laughing,'' he said, recalling his own investigative
experience in the Bronx. ``Some of them look like not everybody,
but nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   And when they look like almost everybody, there is a danger that
police officers can go after the wrong person, as apparently
happened in the case of Diallo. That problem can be compounded by
differences in race between suspects, victims and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran detectives said the best use of the sketches was not in
trying to match someone on the street with a drawing, but in
showing it while canvassing a neighborhood for leads.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that someone acquainted with the suspect will
recognize some feature of the drawing _ a distinctive jaw line,
perhaps, or a mustache _ and provide some detail _ a name, a
regular hangout _ that could enable detectives to take their
investigation further.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tool, like anything else,'' said Geberth, who also
stressed the difficulty with eyewitness accounts, pointing out that
forensic evidence was much more important in tying a suspect to a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said that while the sketches could be a useful tool, ``they
can be counterproductive if people feel it's more reliable than it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They might fit lots of people who are innocent,'' he added.
``Or they may be wrong, and the real perpetrator might not look
like that at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can use a composite sketch to go around a neighborhood
where someone may have operated or committed a crime and see if
some one recognizes him. It can provide a lead. But it takes much
more than that, some form of corroboration to turn someone into a
suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the sketch the officers in the Bronx were carrying,
Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said: ``I don't know
that it looks like everybody. It might look like lots of people.''
</P>
<P>
   By the weekend, the suspected rapist whom the police were
seeking when they encountered Diallo 10 days ago had not been
caught.

 UNDATED: possible shutdown. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But while the Cassandra of old was cursed by Apollo to have her
prophecies ignored, Mrs. O'Riley, who became enthusiastic about
self-sufficiency when she left New York to homestead in the Alaskan
bush, finds ready audiences of people who seem to secretly long for
an extended Y2K camping experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will survive this, if we all work together,'' she assures
her followers. ``Eventually, the storm will pass and we'll wade
ashore _ together.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing to survive may be the anticlimax. A litany of
horror stories in an article in January's Vanity Fair about ``the
Y2K nightmare'' is oddly more reassuring than alarming: A batch of
chemicals at Amway was rejected because a computer figured it had
expired in 1900 instead of 2000; a medical information network
froze when asked to schedule a doctor's appointment in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But these incidents happened years ago, demonstrating that
companies have been confronting and overcoming Y2K problems all
along, as has every consumer who now carries a working credit card
expiring in 00 or 01. The fixes can be expensive but they are being
made.
</P>
<P>
   It is the nature of complex, intertwined systems that their
behavior cannot be precisely predicted, so the world may still be
in for a shock. Some experts warned that the first would come on
Jan. 1, 1999, when many systems started dealing with dates 12
months in the future. With that occasion safely behind, the next
milestone is in April for companies starting a new fiscal year, and
then in September, when 9/9/99 rolls around, possibly confusing
some computers.
</P>
<P>
   If these dates too pass uneventfully, along with the big one on
Dec. 31, then the new millenarians will be in much the same
position as the old religious fundamentalists who painstakingly add
up biblical generations to calculate, and then recalculate, the day
of the second coming. One by one, the milestones come and go,
judgment day postponed for another time.

MAKING TONS OF MONEY AND FORDS, TOO

   WAYNE, Mich. _ Two weeks ago, Ford Motor Co. agreed to pay $6.5
billion for the car operations of Volvo of Sweden. Last week, Ford
hinted that it might also be interested in buying Germany's BMW _
and with more than $17 billion in cash remaining in the company
kitty, Ford can easily afford it.
</P>
<P>
   How did Ford, which is known for its plebeian, low-profit
Escorts and Tauruses, accumulate wealth on a scale not seen since
Japanese companies were buying up American real estate in the
1980s?
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the answer lies in this gritty industrial suburb
west of Detroit, home to what appears to be the world's most
profitable factory in any industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan Truck Plant here used to make full-sized Ford
pickup trucks, a good business. Now it manufactures the Ford
Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, both full-sized sport utility
vehicles _ a great business. With factory profits approaching those
of the entire Chrysler Corp. in all of 1997, this plant is earning
enough money every 34 months to pay for the entire Volvo deal,
which included four assembly plants, two engine factories and an
engineering center, as well as Volvo's world-famous brand name.
</P>
<P>
   The $36,000 Expedition and $45,000 Navigator are essentially
Ford pickups under the sheet metal but with much longer cabs and
three rows of seats. They cost only a few thousand dollars more to
make than the pickups, yet sell for an extra $10,000 to $20,000.
Financial analysts estimate that Ford, which has already recovered
all of its modest costs for developing the vehicles, now earns a
profit of about $12,000 on each Expedition and $15,000 on each
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of money at stake, the work here never stops.
Three crews of workers put in 10-hour shifts around the clock. Six
days a week, the bright yellow conveyor belt clanks through the
building, carrying the gray shells of sport utility vehicles past
rows of 10-foot-tall white robot welders and dozens of crews. The
equipment repairs, maintenance and adjustments that take all night
and much of the weekend at many auto factories are done in two-hour
bursts of feverish activity between shifts and on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   When a blizzard clogged southeastern Michigan roads in January
and stranded 5,000 people at Detroit's airport, Ford diverted
shipments of scarce engines and axles from other factories to make
sure the assembly line here stayed on schedule. The highly
motivated workers, who earn up to $100,000 a year including
overtime, showed up in full strength at the factory even when state
police officials were urging anyone who did not have a medical
emergency to stay home. The factory did not lose an hour of
production to the snowstorm, said Michael McCarney, the plant
manager.
</P>
<P>
   All this activity cranks out an incredible number of vehicles _
about 245,000 Expeditions and 48,000 Navigators a year or
approximately 1,040 sport utilities a day. That works out to about
$3.7 billion in pretax profits, and about $2.4 billion in after-tax
profits, on annual sales of almost $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has 53 assembly plants worldwide, the one here
accounted for a third of the company's total profits last year. By
comparison, there were only 54 companies in the world that earned
more than this factory in all of 1997, the most recent year
available, according to the annual Fortune global 500. Many of
them, like State Farm Insurance and Wal-Mart, do not have
factories. The rest, like Intel and the General Electric Company,
earn more modest profits from each of many different factories and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ford's stock has soared. It has produced a
total return on investment of 215 percent since the Expedition was
introduced in October 1996, compared with an 85 percent return for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 large stocks. Ford's stock has
also climbed because it has cut costs by improving productivity,
part of a national trend in corporate America over the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Full-sized sport utility vehicles are highly profitable because
demand for the gas guzzlers far outstrips supply at a time when
gasoline prices are the lowest ever, adjusting for inflation. When
gas prices fell in the mid-1980s, Ford also earned large profits
from a car factory near here that made full-sized Lincoln cars. But
tight fuel-economy regulations prevent automakers from making cars
bigger now; instead they build large light trucks, which are
subject to less stringent rules.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign competition is also negligible in the full-sized sport
utility vehicle market, a fact that helps to keep prices high.
Since 1964 the United States has imposed a 25 percent tax on
imported pickup trucks; until the Bush administration, this tax
also applied to imported sport utility vehicles. Europe and East
Asia have prohibitively high gasoline prices and tiny parking
spaces, so there is little demand overseas for gargantuan sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several years have foreign automakers begun
designing huge light trucks just for the American market. Honda and
Nissan are working on new models while Toyota, which already sells
small numbers of Land Cruisers and Lexus LX470s, has just built a
factory in Indiana that will manufacture full-sized pickup trucks
this year and begin making a new, full-sized sport utility vehicle
version next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's immensely profitable plant may not go unrivaled for long
_ Ford plans to start selling a bigger sport utility vehicle next
fall. The vehicle, which will probably be called the Excursion,
will be built in Louisville, Ky., as a variation of an
industrial-size pickup already in production there. Two feet longer
than an Expedition or Navigator and nearly a foot longer than a
Chevrolet Suburban, the Excursion will be the world's largest
family vehicle and also one of the most profitable.

rows of 10-foot-tall white robot welders and dozens of crews. The
equipment repairs, maintenance and adjustments that take all night
and much of the weekend at many auto factories are done in two-hour
bursts of feverish activity between shifts and on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   When a blizzard clogged southeastern Michigan roads in January
and stranded 5,000 people at Detroit's airport, Ford diverted
shipments of scarce engines and axles from other factories to make
sure the assembly line here stayed on schedule. The highly
motivated workers, who earn up to $100,000 a year including
overtime, showed up in full strength at the factory even when state
police officials were urging anyone who did not have a medical
emergency to stay home. The factory did not lose an hour of
production to the snowstorm, said Michael McCarney, the plant
manager.
</P>
<P>
   All this activity cranks out an incredible number of vehicles _
about 245,000 Expeditions and 48,000 Navigators a year or
approximately 1,040 sport utilities a day. That works out to about
$3.7 billion in pretax profits, and about $2.4 billion in after-tax
profits, on annual sales of almost $11 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While Ford has 53 assembly plants worldwide, the one here
accounted for a third of the company's total profits last year. By
comparison, there were only 54 companies in the world that earned
more than this factory in all of 1997, the most recent year
available, according to the annual Fortune global 500. Many of
them, like State Farm Insurance and Wal-Mart, do not have
factories. The rest, like Intel and the General Electric Company,
earn more modest profits from each of many different factories and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Ford's stock has soared. It has produced a
total return on investment of 215 percent since the Expedition was
introduced in October 1996, compared with an 85 percent return for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 large stocks. Ford's stock has
also climbed because it has cut costs by improving productivity,
part of a national trend in corporate America over the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Full-sized sport utility vehicles are highly profitable because
demand for the gas guzzlers far outstrips supply at a time when
gasoline prices are the lowest ever, adjusting for inflation. When
gas prices fell in the mid-1980s, Ford also earned large profits
from a car factory near here that made full-sized Lincoln cars. But
tight fuel-economy regulations prevent automakers from making cars
bigger now; instead they build large light trucks, which are
subject to less stringent rules.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign competition is also negligible in the full-sized sport
utility vehicle market, a fact that helps to keep prices high.
Since 1964 the United States has imposed a 25 percent tax on
imported pickup trucks; until the Bush administration, this tax
also applied to imported sport utility vehicles. Europe and East
Asia have prohibitively high gasoline prices and tiny parking
spaces, so there is little demand overseas for gargantuan sport
utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several years have foreign automakers begun
designing huge light trucks just for the American market. Honda and
Nissan are working on new models while Toyota, which already sells
small numbers of Land Cruisers and Lexus LX470s, has just built a
factory in Indiana that will manufacture full-sized pickup trucks
this year and begin making a new, full-sized sport utility vehicle
version next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's immensely profitable plant may not go unrivaled for long
_ Ford plans to start selling a bigger sport utility vehicle next
fall. The vehicle, which will probably be called the Excursion,
will be built in Louisville, Ky., as a variation of an
industrial-size pickup already in production there. Two feet longer
than an Expedition or Navigator and nearly a foot longer than a
Chevrolet Suburban, the Excursion will be the world's largest
family vehicle and also one of the most profitable.

   LONDON _ Everybody is looking for love on Valentine's Day _ even
literary types. Even smelly, unattractive, misanthropic British
literary types with no charm or lives to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the impression left by a perusal of recent
personal ads in the London Review of Books, which began accepting
such ads in October.
</P>
<P>
   This development presents an unusual opportunity in cultural
comparison: How do the London Review's personal ads stack up
against the personals of its American literary counterpart, the New
York Review of Books?
</P>
<P>
   Wow, big surprise: While the British ads embrace droll
understatement and deep self-deprecation (especially those placed
by men), the ads in the New York Review of Books tend toward
typically American self-promotion and sappy romanticism.
</P>
<P>
   David Rose, acting advertising manager at the London Review,
concedes that among those placing personal ads in the British
publication, ``there's almost a competition to see who can sound
the most pathetic.'' He notes, though, that the ad writers may also
be subtly poking fun at the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that they are trying to mock them, to present an
antithesis to the American type of ads,'' he said, adding that ``I
don't believe for a second that they're as pathetic as they say
they are.'' Some selected odd couplings follow.

MOVING TARGET: GUN MAKERS

(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By LAURA MANSNERUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, N.J., promises that as soon as the
health care and law enforcement costs are toted up, the city will
go to court against the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our legal theory is that if firearms are creating a social
debt in our community _ health and medical costs, all kinds of
misery _ then the people who put out these instruments should be
held accountable,'' James said last week.
</P>
<P>
   How this rates as a legal argument is a slippery question, which
was only confounded last week when a U.S. District Court jury in
Brooklyn found several gun manufacturers liable for negligence in
their marketing practices. But whatever answers emerge _ in the
appeal of this decision and from other courts presented with
similar suits _ they may not be all that useful.
</P>
<P>
   Several cities have already sued gun makers, many others are
lining up and the Brooklyn decision insures that private plaintiffs
will, too. The cases have more to do with politics than with law,
as people on both sides of the issue point out, and you don't need
a verdict to get results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy is to emulate what took place in the tobacco
wars,'' said Lester Brickman, a professor at the Benjamin N.
Cardozo School of Law in New York City. ``What the plaintiffs'
lawyers relied on was their political ability to bring in enough
states to reach a threat level that would cause the tobacco
companies to cave in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can get 20 suits going on, they could raise the cost
to the gun manufacturers to $1 million a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal costs like this can force concessions, effectively
short-circuiting the judicial process. But the bigger issue,
Brickman said, is using the courts to short-circuit the
legislature. (Legislatures sometimes fight back, as the Georgia
Legislature did in passing legislation barring the city of
Atlanta's suit against gun manufacturers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wild way to make public policy,'' said Jeffrey
O'Connell, a law professor at the University of Virginia. But he
also recalled Tocqueville's observation that, sooner or later,
every social question in America becomes a legal question.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, personal injury law has banished Pintos,
bankrupted asbestos makers and altered the technology of vaccines
and contraception, among other things. The $206 billion tobacco
settlement resulted in a price increase for cigarettes _ 45 to 60
cents a pack at the counter _ that most legislatures had found
politically out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The hostilities with gun makers were opened by the city of New
Orleans, which filed suit in October, followed by Chicago, Miami,
Atlanta and Bridgeport, Conn. Like the states that sued tobacco
companies, the cities seek to recover expenses, which in these
cases extend to law enforcement and hospital costs, and pension
benefits and more remote costs. The complaint filed by Miami-Dade
County, for example, contends that ``the county has lost
substantial tax revenues due to lost productivity and tourism as
well as reduced property values.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the argument that gun manufacturers should be held
responsible for the use of their products, ``there is absolutely no
limitation on this theory,'' said Ralph Boyd, a Boston lawyer who
has advised the tobacco and gun industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auto industry makes vehicles that exceed by two the lawful
speed limit in any jurisdiction,'' Boyd said. ``What would stop
someone from using this type of legal theory from saying, hey, you
know those commercials that show cars speeding across the
countryside, making tight turns on mountains, zipping around pylons
on race courses? Why isn't that negligent marketing? Why isn't the
auto industry responsible for all the accidents resulting from
excessive speed?''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers and public officials respond that they
choose defendants based on the harm they do. Several years ago,
when a Mississippi official wondered sarcastically if the state's
suit against tobacco makers would be followed by one against pizza
parlors, the attorney general replied, ``When pepperoni kills
425,000 people a year, we'll go after the pepperoni business.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, a lawyer with the Violence Policy Center, an
advocacy organization in Washington, said the Brooklyn decision
logically applied to any industry's marketing and distribution
practices. The jury found that some of the manufacturers had
knowingly oversaturated markets in states with lenient gun laws,
leading to illicit sales in the New York area. The suit was brought
by relatives of shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say pharmaceutical companies were found to be selling to
people outside the legitimate stream of commerce, to people on
street corners,'' Ms. Rand said. ``People would say, of course,
they should be held liable for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cities' suits contend that the manufacturers failed
to incorporate the best safety technology. Some, like the Brooklyn
plaintiffs, also argue that the manufacturers are obligated to take
steps to keep guns away from unauthorized users.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rand said the cities were in an even better position than
private plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   James can hardly wait to make that argument. ``In my
state-of-the-city address,'' he said, ``this got a 10-minute
ovation.''

companies, the cities seek to recover expenses, which in these
cases extend to law enforcement and hospital costs, and pension
benefits and more remote costs. The complaint filed by Miami-Dade
County, for example, contends that ``the county has lost
substantial tax revenues due to lost productivity and tourism as
well as reduced property values.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the argument that gun manufacturers should be held
responsible for the use of their products, ``there is absolutely no
limitation on this theory,'' said Ralph Boyd, a Boston lawyer who
has advised the tobacco and gun industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The auto industry makes vehicles that exceed by two the lawful
speed limit in any jurisdiction,'' Boyd said. ``What would stop
someone from using this type of legal theory from saying, hey, you
know those commercials that show cars speeding across the
countryside, making tight turns on mountains, zipping around pylons
on race courses? Why isn't that negligent marketing? Why isn't the
auto industry responsible for all the accidents resulting from
excessive speed?''
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs' lawyers and public officials respond that they
choose defendants based on the harm they do. Several years ago,
when a Mississippi official wondered sarcastically if the state's
suit against tobacco makers would be followed by one against pizza
parlors, the attorney general replied, ``When pepperoni kills
425,000 people a year, we'll go after the pepperoni business.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristen Rand, a lawyer with the Violence Policy Center, an
advocacy organization in Washington, said the Brooklyn decision
logically applied to any industry's marketing and distribution
practices. The jury found that some of the manufacturers had
knowingly oversaturated markets in states with lenient gun laws,
leading to illicit sales in the New York area. The suit was brought
by relatives of shooting victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say pharmaceutical companies were found to be selling to
people outside the legitimate stream of commerce, to people on
street corners,'' Ms. Rand said. ``People would say, of course,
they should be held liable for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the cities' suits contend that the manufacturers failed
to incorporate the best safety technology. Some, like the Brooklyn
plaintiffs, also argue that the manufacturers are obligated to take
steps to keep guns away from unauthorized users.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rand said the cities were in an even better position than
private plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   James can hardly wait to make that argument. ``In my
state-of-the-city address,'' he said, ``this got a 10-minute
ovation.''

   The Secret View From the Top
</P>
<P>
   If every union member's apartment were half as nice as Gus
Bevona's penthouse atop the headquarters of the janitors' union,
class tensions would disappear. But there isn't enough marble in
the world for everyone to have such a place. Bevona, who headed New
York City's main union for janitors and doormen for 18 years,
designed the penthouse in lower Manhattan. Union dues _ $500 a year
from each of 55,000 members _ helped finance his 23rd-floor spread.
</P>
<P>
   The penthouse has green marble in its floors and wainscoting.
Thick slabs of black marble went into the conference tables and the
dressing room counters. Creamy white and grey marble climbs from
floor to ceiling in the bathrooms. There is rosewood galore _
illuminated built-in rosewood display cases, a rosewood liquor
cabinet and built-in rosewood entertainment centers. There were his
and her's bathrooms and his and her's dressing rooms (each with
three cedar closets.) There were two terraces with spectacular
views and an immense kitchen chock full of the finest German
appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Bevona's parent union, the Service Employees International
Union, got so fed up with his high salary ($450,000), princely
lifestyle and dictatorial ways, that it pushed him out of his job
two weeks ago. Until the parent union opened the penthouse last
week, union members had no idea of the treasures inside. Bevona,
who insisted that he did not use the penthouse as an apartment,
said he deserved his pay and penthouse because his members were the
nation's highest paid janitors.

   Where Jeans Are A Rape Defense
</P>
<P>
   The signs held by five female legislators in front of the
Italian Parliament read, ``Jeans, an alibi for rape.'' The women,
all wearing jeans, were protesting a decision last week by Italy's
highest appeals court that a woman's claim that she was raped must
be untrue because she had been wearing jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Carmine Cristiano, a 45-year-old driving
instructor, had argued not that the jeans were provocative, but
that they were difficult to take off, and therefore the woman, an
18-year-old student, must have consented. The appeals court agreed,
overturning a 1996 verdict in which a lower court had found
Cristiano guilty and sentenced him to two years and eight months in
prison. The appeals court said it was ``common knowledge'' that
jeans ``cannot even be partly removed without the effective help of
the person wearing them,'' and that it is ``impossible, if the
victim is struggling with all her force.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision drew expressions of outrage. Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema of the Democratic Party of the Left said he was
``indignant, as a citizen.'' The female legislators pledged to
continue wearing jeans to Parliament until the decision is
reversed. Alessandra Mussolini, the granddaughter of the Fascist
dictator, who represents the conservative National Alliance in
Parliament, called the ruling ``shameful'' and said, ``Women are
already afraid to report rapes _ this just makes it worse.''

   No Chemical Threat Found At Bombed Plant in Sudan
</P>
<P>
   More evidence emerged that raised questions about the Clinton
administration's cruise missile attack on a Sudanese pharmaceutical
plant last August. Scientists hired by lawyers for the owner of the
plant examined 13 soil, sludge and debris samples from the wrecked
factory, but found no trace of chemical weapon compounds.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the National Security Council stood by their
forensic evidence that the plant was targeted only after a soil
sample obtained clandestinely by the CIA indicated the presence of
a precursor chemical used to produce the deadly VX nerve gas.

   Linda Tripp, the woman whose secret recordings of Monica
Lewinsky led to President Clinton's impeachment, broke a long
silence, saying in an interview that her deepest regret is the pain
she caused her former friend.
</P>
<P>
   She betrayed Ms. Lewinsky, she said, to save her from being
abused by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always saw Monica as a kid, I always saw her as a lost
soul,'' Mrs. Tripp told The New York Times. ``I believe she and the
country will never understand that I believed this was in her best
interest, and that makes me very sad.''

   Push to Temper Mandatory Sentences
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter-century that drug laws requiring mandatory
sentencing have been in place in New York and other states, critics
have repeatedly denounced them as Draconian.
</P>
<P>
   Now a powerful voice has been added to that criticism, as New
York State Chief Judge Judith Kaye, proposed softening the laws to
allow judges to temper the 15-year mandatory sentences when such a
punishment seemed a ``miscarriage of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   She also suggested that those accused of possessing small
quantities could be given drug treatment, not prison _ a plan that
could keep 10,000 low-level offenders a year free. The plan, Gov.
George Pataki said, ``warrants further review.''

   Salt Lake City Blues
</P>
<P>
   An ethics panel working for the Salt Lake Olympic Organizing
Committee issued a scathing report about that city's desperate
campaign to win the 2002 Winter Games. Officials showered Olympic
delegates with cash and an array of gifts, from free trips to the
Super Bowl to doorknobs and furniture, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In the most detailed account yet, the report said a fifth of the
International Olympic Committee delegates may have received some
form of improper benefits. And it implicated 10 more members of the
International Olympic Committee in accepting gratuities like free
vacations and air fare. Fourteen Olympic delegates have already
been tied to the widening scandal. Six of them have already been
expelled.

   The ``Teletubbies'' character Tinky Winky is an unlikely target
for moral outrage. But the Rev. Jerry Falwell, with his knack for
locating sin, writes in his magazine National Liberty Journal that
he has ``the gay-pride color'' (purple) and ``the gay-pride
symbol'' (a triangle) and that his bag resembles a purse. The
little fellow, in short, is a gay role model, which he has been
called before.

   But that bag, Tinky's licenser said, is merely a bag _ a
``magic'' one.

   Feeling Slighted, Jordan Gets More U.S. Aid
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to getting U.S. foreign aid in the Middle East, it
pays to be the squeaky wheel.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein's death, coupled with a royal succession crisis
that blindsided Washington and raised fears of instability in a
country that had long been the bulwark of Arab moderation, prompted
the Clinton administration to scramble to accelerate $300 million
in assistance to Jordan. Yet until the controversy surrounding the
royal transition over the last few weeks, senior Jordanian
officials had grumbled privately that Washington did not seem to
appreciate the valuable role that Amman plays as a force for
moderation in the Arab world, and the degree to which the United
States relies on Jordan's intelligence and security services in the
war on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Jordanian officials argue, Clinton administration aid
policies slighted Jordan while heaping billions of dollars on Egypt
and Israel. Now, being seen as a country in crisis may actually pay
dividends for Jordan in Washington.

   Internet Reality Check
</P>
<P>
   If investors in high-flying Internet stocks secretly suspect
they are playing with Monopoly money, there was some evidence to
back up the fear last week. Lycos, a modest Internet gateway with a
stock price in never-never land, said it was merging with the
electronic shopping units of USA Networks, including Home Shopping
Network and Ticketmaster _ a business with 20 times the revenues.
In other words, little Lycos had made it to the big time. This was
the payoff. Or so it would seem.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that investors said, wait a second: This isn't an
Internet stock anymore! Lycos, they realized, would now be a very
measurable part of an earthbound company, and they quickly shoved
their money back in their pockets. Lycos shares plunged 26 percent
in a day.

   Attorney General Janet Reno's in-house ethics investigators want
to know whether she was misled by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
a year ago when he first obtained expanded authority from the
Justice Department to investigate the Monica Lewinsky matter. The
ethics inquiry will focus on whether Starr's prosecutors misled the
attorney general about possible conflicts of interest that might
have prompted Reno to keep the Lewinsky matter out of Starr's
hands. His prosecutors have objected that any misconduct review
would intrude on their independence.

 &HT;    Frequent fliers fume for fairness
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ One way for Congress to regain a few of
the approval points it squandered on the impeachment debacle would
be to do something about air travel. To talk to a frequent flier is
to open yourself to hair-raising tales of hardy souls braving
discomfort, dislocation and airline treatment that can border on
false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have taken
such action in proposing a Passenger Bill of Rights. I would give
up my aisle seat to them. The bill would force airlines to admit
when they overbook and give the real reasons they bumped you. It
would also make it easier and faster for passengers to get refunds
of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   These things are good as far as they go, but something more is
called for. We don't need a few more regulations. We need a
movement. We need a stirring document setting forth the basic
rights that Nature's God bestows on anyone with an airline ticket.
We need a real statement on passenger rights to which travelers can
rally as they storm the ticket counters and barricade themselves
behind vinyl chairs in terminal lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this:
</P>
<P>
   The Passenger Bill of Rights
</P>
<P>
   Preamble: We, the airline passengers of North America, are not
animals, we are human beings. Most of us, at least. Many of us
don't want to be on your stupid ol' airplane, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   1. We have the right to the entire can of soda. Don't you try to
pour that Coke into three cups for three passengers. We demand the
cup and the rest of the can, too. With ice.
</P>
<P>
   2. We have the right to breathe air that is 20 percent oxygen.
Nothing less. Canaries in cages should be posted in conspicuous
locations so passengers can note when they keel over for lack of
breathable air.
</P>
<P>
   3. We have the right to remain silent. Don't even try to wake us
up before we land.
</P>
<P>
   4. We have the right to eat peanuts. Crackers and stale pretzels
are not valid substitutes. On long flights, mystery meat will be
provided for all carnivorous passengers.
</P>
<P>
   5. We have the right to confront ticket agents. Announcing
flight cancellations and then clearing out all employees is an
invitation to civil insurrection. Passengers are due a living,
breathing human face to yell at.
</P>
<P>
   6. We are three-dimensional beings with the right to take up
space. We may be taller than average, we may be wider than average,
we may even wear overcoats: it's not our fault. Roller coasters,
vintage spacecraft and many swing-sets have bigger seats than
today's airliners.
</P>
<P>
   7. Anyone under 6 must get a plastic pilot's-wings badge. Girls,
too. No exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   8. No airport hot dog should ever cost more than $5.00. Even
with chili on top.
</P>
<P>
   9. We have the right to bring on as many things as we can stuff
into one overhead compartment, no matter how hard we have to push
to get it all in. If the door closes, it's legal.
</P>
<P>
   10. We have the inalienable right to a decent cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   11. Detroit Airport will be razed and salt will be sown into the
soil where the terminal used to be. It is necessary as a warning to
others.
</P>
<P>
   12. We have the right to television-free sections in all
terminals, no matter what the contract with CNN says.
</P>
<P>
   13. Each terminal in a major metropolitan area shall have at
least one (1) dimly lit bar that will be open late, staffed by a
sympathetic bartender who speaks in a thick accent associated with
that airport's geographic region. On a bad trip, it might be our
only feeling having been somewhere away from home.
</P>
<P>
   14. We have the right to air-terminal phone booths with seats.
</P>
<P>
   15. Passengers stuck on the runway for long periods of time have
the right to receive mail and packages from home. International
humanitarian agencies have the right to inspect conditions.
</P>
<P>
   16. We have the right to see our suitcases again, or any parts
of them that might be handy.
</P>
<P>
   These are not outrageous requests, but throughout history,
revolutions have been founded on people's more basic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Things are getting ugly near the baggage-claim area. And even
extra peanuts may no longer quell the angry masses.

 &HT;    Stumbling into a fine young man
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The first crash jolts me awake.
Instinctively, I open my eyes and glance at the bedside clock. It's
3:37. I lie motionless in the dark _ waiting, listening, trying not
to breathe. Then I hear movement outside the bedroom door.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief, terrifying moment, I'm a little kid again,
scrunched under my flowered chenille spread, hiding from the
alligators that I always knew were living under the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Thud! Bump! Something slams into the bathroom door.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash I eliminate the impossibilities. A storm? Not
tonight. The cats? Nope. They don't use the upstairs bathroom.
Theirs is in the basement. Then I hear an ominous squeak and a
click, followed closely by a hollow, Thunk! Oh Lordy, I'm gonna'
die at the hands of a hired gun. Then I remember report cards went
out last week.
</P>
<P>
   Resigned to my fate, I decide to go with dignity. I'll not die
cringing under the comforter. Whatever is after me is going to have
to look me straight in the eye first. I fling back the covers,
plant my bare feet firmly on the carpet, and head for the bedroom
door.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, I manipulate the knob and ease into the hall. Nearby,
much too close for comfort, I hear a metallic rattle followed by
... the sound of rushing water? I make like a statue just outside
the bathroom ... listening. Clunk! Shuffle (or was that, Sniffle?)!
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I'm wide awake. It's the damnedest thing I've ever
heard of. A burglar has broken in to use my toilet. His towering
shadow is outlined by the night light. Omigosh! I'm being stalked
by a behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Then the giant spoke. ``Hi, Mom, guess I wasn't as quiet as I
thought. Sorry I woke you up.'' Just like that. The kid has almost
given me the ``big one'' that Fred Sanford was always threatening
when he assured his dead wife, ``I'm coming, Elizabeth! This is the
big one!'' and all he has to say for himself is, ``Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   My first instinct is to threaten to pull his inheritance. But
quickly that thought is replaced with a strong urge to take a swing
at him. ``You have scared me to death and now I'm going to hurt
you,'' I warn as I move in on him. My threats are met with a
giggle, for obvious reasons. He's a foot taller and a whole people
bigger than I am. My son, home for the weekend, picks me up, tucks
me under one arm, and hauls me back to bed, assuring me he'll be
``quiet as a little mouse'' and will see me in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   As I slide back under the covers, I'm thinking how good it is to
have him home and wondering how, with his crashing and banging, I
ever managed to get any sleep when we were housemates. Guess I just
got used to it.
</P>
<P>
   Kristofor was not a quiet kid. He was cautious, but
uncoordinated. By the time he was 2, he was running into the
furniture, tripping over the cats, and toppling unwary visitors.
Walls were little more than sideboards of the giant carom board he
called home. I began to worry so I set up an appointment for an eye
exam.
</P>
<P>
   Kindly old Dr. Patrick was our neighbor. Often, he'd stop out
front and tell me what a handsome boy I had there. He packed
Kristofor into the little booster chair and they discussed what the
boy was seeing and how many. I held my breath. No one wants to hear
her child is less than A-1 Perfecto. I wasn't disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   When the exam was over, he helped Kristofor crawl down and told
him the disappointing news. ``You don't need glasses, son. You saw
all of the duckies just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So I don't get a lollipop?'' Kristofor asked, brokenhearted.
Doc assured him his eyes were so good he deserved two, and sent him
to the receptionist to collect. We watched as he toddled down the
hall, bouncing from a wall here and tripping over an imaginary
something or other there. I grimaced but Dr. Patrick chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth, don't worry,'' he said reassuringly. ``The boy will
be fine _ once''he grows into those feet of his.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, he never has. He's 6'4'' and still stumbling. But it's OK.
He's finally found the lady of his dreams. She's almost his size
and equally as graceful. Their affectionate gestures remind me of
the bears I used to
</P>
<P>
   watch in Chicago's Brookfield Zoo. All paws.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason he's banging around the house in the middle of
the night? He's come home to break the official news. ``Amy and I
are going to be married.'' He's glowing and I couldn't be happier _
although I do fear for their children. But I won't mention it
because I get to play with the cubs.

 &HT;    How the cookie crumbles
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People love cookies and milk. People hate cookies and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't have your ``Internet for Dummies'' handbook
nearby, a computer ``cookie'' is a file that Web sites install on
your computer's hard drive when you visit a site that offers
cookies. They are very small files, never more than 225 characters
or 4K of disk space. Not all sites send cookies to your computer,
but an increasing number do.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless though they might be, most Internet users have a
knee-jerk reaction to anyone or anything trying to gather
information about them. The notion that merely typing in a Web
address opens up the opportunity for companies to find out anything
at all about them is distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an advertiser might set a cookie on your computer
to track how many people have viewed an online advertisement. Web
sites also send cookies to monitor how many users might view a
particular page or section. The folks who send these cookies say
they do it to help determine which parts of their Web sites get the
most traffic so they can add or subtract content accordingly and to
keep users from looking at the same advertisements over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies, for the most part, are harmless both to your computer
and your privacy. There's really no harm in sites such as ESPN
SportZone sending baseball-related ads to users browsing the
baseball section. In fact, some users may find the products and
services being offered to them useful.
</P>
<P>
   However, cookies can also be used to track your password, user
name, credit card numbers and any other information you have
provided via an online form. Sites like The New York Times, which
require user ID and passwords, store this information as a cookie
in your hard disk, so registered users won't have to keep filling
out forms every time they go to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines use cookies to ``remember'' individual user
habits and deliver customized news and services targeted to them.
</P>
<P>
   Online vendors, such as Amazon.com, can read the user's cookie
and match it with a stored profile that would contain credit card
information, so the user won't have to enter the information each
time.
</P>
<P>
   Given what cookies do, it won't come as a surprise that Internet
advertisers love cookies _ all kinds and any kind. Cookies with
news, with entertainment, with sports, with search engines. If you
can put it on the Web and you can advertise there, you can bet
there's a marketing department somewhere making sure every Web ad
comes with cookies. Most cookies are active only during a single
Web surfing session and disappear after users log off.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sheer vastness of the Internet and the complexity
of home PCs make many Web users wary of cookies. There are concerns
that cookies can be used to lift personal information from your PC
or perhaps something more insidious. A special Web site called
Cookie Central (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .cookiecentral.com) explains the various uses and potential
misuses of cookies. Ironically, the site uses cookies itself to
deliver its own banner ads to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, the U.S. government says it likes cookies.
A report issued last March from the Energy Department's Computer
Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) said, despite the fear and
loathing some users have, ``the hype about cookies has far
outweighed the actual hazards of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular concepts and rumors about what a cookie can do has
reached almost mystical proportions,'' the report stated. ``It is
not an executable program and cannot do anything to your machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The report helped quiet rumors that America Online planned to
use cookies to gather private information from its members' hard
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing consultants such as DoubleClick
(http://www.doubleclick
</P>
<P>
   .com) use cookies to increase the efficiency of the placing of
advertisements on Web sites and deliver ads to the people most
likely to be interested in a particular company's products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick addresses the issue of cookies and Internet privacy
directly at its Web site. The company reassures all Web surfers
that any user information gleaned from cookies remains completely
anonymous. ``We do not sell or rent any information to third
parties,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the information is anonymous, DoubleClick maintains, only
the sites themselves and advertisers could benefit from the
information the company gathers.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick believes cookies make the Web a better place. ``We
believe that cookies enhance the Web experience for the user by
limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level
of relevant content on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   While DoubleClick might paint too rosy a picture of cookies,
there really isn't anything dangerous about them. There are ways
you can monitor what sites are sending you cookies and/or stop them
altogether, and you can read about them below.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who will abuse cookies _ unscrupulous Web sites
might take your information and sell it to offline marketers, but
as Electronic Frontier Foundation director Stanton McCandlish told
CNet last year, ``It's really difficulty to imagine a technology
that can't be abused.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT COOKIES DO ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Web site tracking: It's a way to help Web designers and
developers keep tabs on which areas of their sites are most
popular. It also provides more accurate accounts of how many people
have actually visited a Web site and what pages they viewed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Marketing: Cookies deliver targeted advertisements for
products consumers might want _ for example, advertising sporting
equipment to users who visit the sports area of a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3. Storing IDs: Cookies can store passwords and user IDs, so
subscribers to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Slate
or any site that requires a user ID and password won't have to keep
filling out registration forms everytime the visit the site. Online
retailers like Amazon.com and others use cookies to streamline
their online ordering process, remembering what orders have been
placed, or items that have been selected but not yet purchased.
Users can return weeks later and find the items still in their
``online shopping baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Personalization: Even the most anti-cookie contingent agrees
this is one of the best uses of cookies. Microsoft and Netscape
browsers use cookies to create personal start pages. Users can come
to a large site such as CNN, MSNBC or Excite and select which areas
of the site they want to view and which areas they don't. The
cookie stores that information and uses it on the next visit.
</P>
<P>
   5. Target marketing: Cookies can be used to build a profile of
you _ where you surf, and what advertisements you click on. This
information is used to send ads to you that supposedly will be of
interest to you based on your Web surfing history.
</P>
<P>
   COOKIES DON'T ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Mine your PC and gather information about you from other
programs such as letters, spreadsheets or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   2. Send information to any other sites you surf.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make changes to any information you've supplied previously.
</P>
<P>
   4. Damage your computer or your hard drive in any way.
</P>
<P>
   5. Taste good dunked in milk or purchased from a supermarket.

 &HT;    Cuff monitors average blood pressure
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Mark of Fitness Inc. wristwatch-style blood
pressure and pulse monitor can store data about two people and
sells for around $100 at selected health product and electronic
stores.
</P>
<P>
   To use the MF-72, as the unit is called, you strap it over your
wrist and push the start button. A cuff inflates, and the device
automatically measures your pulse and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The reading is comfortable and takes less than a minute. And
because the unit is portable, a person needing to monitor his blood
pressure can keep it with him at all times. It runs on two AAA
batteries and comes shipped in a clamshell carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   The MF-72 holds records for two people and gives current
readings plus averages of the past seven readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your blood pressure can be up at one reading just because you
were walking around,'' said Wayne Baker, sales manager for Mark of
Fitness. ``An average of seven readings gives your doctor a much
clearer picture of where you really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the MF-72 won an innovation award at the recent
International Consumer Electronics Show, the product is not yet
widely distributed. If you can't find it, call the company at (732)
842-7200 for information.

 &HT;    Tax software: They're not like putting an accountant in your PC,
but programs make unpleasant task easier
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHIC
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Back in the Dark Ages before home computers,
anyone preparing his income tax returns had to sit down with
pencil, paper and a calculator and shuffle through a box of records
for hours to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Now that person can sit down in front of his computer screen and
accomplish the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   It will still take hours, and he'll have to shuffle through the
same box of records, but at least his return will look neater.
</P>
<P>
   A review of three tax preparation software products, two online
tax assistance services and the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer
assistance Web site showed basically that the pencil, paper and
calculator method aren't that bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   One rule seems to apply: If you don't have your records in order
and you can't figure out the meaning of the applicable tax
regulations, filling out your tax returns will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Dixon, public affairs officer for the Internal Revenue
Service office in Cincinnati, said tax software reduces the chance
of math errors. And if you file electronically _ more on that later
_ you'll get a quick acknowledgement that your return has been
received, and you'll get a quicker refund.
</P>
<P>
   But Dixon said, ``The best software can't help you if you don't
have good records. That's our No. 1 tip.''
</P>
<P>
   The software packages may help walk you through the process of
filling in a tax return, but they're generally only a bit more
helpful than the tax preparation books you can pick up for free at
the local post office or library.
</P>
<P>
   And while flipping back and forth through a booklet is fairly
easy, trying to navigate through an online help index can be
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-preparation software takes care of all the adding,
subtracting and dividing. It also checks the charts to fill in the
blanks on how much tax you owe or what your standard deduction
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. The reason some people go to an accountant or a
professional tax preparer is that they hope the professional will
know some tricks to reduce their taxes. They don't want to break
the law, but they want to twist it a little to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The software packages are good about pointing out tax savings an
inexperienced private citizen might miss, but they seem to stick
very close to the rules and language found in official Internal
Revenue Service tax booklets.
</P>
<P>
   TAX SOFTWARE
</P>
<P>
   Most programs follow a similar pattern: The program flashes
interview questions across the computer screen, and the user types
answers into little boxes. The questions range from ``What's your
first name?'' to ``How much did you receive in rent from your
tenants in out-of-state rental property?''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the questions, most programs offer one or more
``help'' options. Some have a list of frequently asked questions
related to the information the program is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the program might ask if you earned any tax-exempt
interest in the past year. The nearby help option explains what
types of interest are taxed and which are tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   A major shortcut is available if you have kept accurate,
up-to-date records on a computerized personal accounting program
such as Quicken. The software packages claim to be able to import
information directly from your financial records, greatly reducing
the time required to fill out the return.
</P>
<P>
   One annoying and time-consuming feature in tax-preparation
software is that users must type in everything on their W-2 forms.
Each W-2 has about 25 boxes, and the programs usually ask questions
about each box on each W-2.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional paper filing, you just copy numbers from the
W-2s and enter them on the tax forms, then put a copy of the W-2 in
the envelope when you mail the return.
</P>
<P>
   The software programs reviewed were all designed for individual
taxpayers and they all were fairly flexible. They easily handled
simple returns where the taxpayer took the standard deduction and
had no unusual sources of income.
</P>
<P>
   They also did fine with more complicated returns involving home
businesses and self-employment taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the software did not do well was answer specific
questions that often come up during a typical tax-preparation
session.
</P>
<P>
   They have answers for frequently asked questions, of course, but
what if your question isn't that frequently asked? The help subject
indexes within the programs are often difficult to use.
</P>
<P>
   After you have answered all the questions in the federal tax
interview, the programs calculate your taxes and tell you how much
you owe or how big of a refund you should receive.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs offer the option of completing a state income tax
return. In most cases, you must pay extra for a separate program
capable of handling your state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The state tax return is completed much like the federal return;
the program interviews you, you type in answers and the program
plugs the answers into the forms.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a tax-preparation software package now, it should be
useful well into the future. The packages are designed to be
updated by linking them to their manufacturers through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   FILING
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way to file taxes is to fill out paper forms,
put them in an envelope along with W-2s and mail them to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   All the tax software packages and online services we tested
allow filers to print out completed forms and send them to federal
and state tax authorities by mail.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the IRS also has been accepting various
forms of electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with the simplest returns can file their returns
directly with the Internal Revenue Service with the TeleFile
system. The taxpayer follows instructions and types tax information
using a telephone keypad, which leads to a quicker refund than
paper filing.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with more complicated returns generally must pay a
third party such as a tax-preparation service to file their taxes
electronically. You can't log onto an IRS Web site and file your
taxes directly.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the IRS uses third parties because it has certified
that its approved third-party providers know what they're doing and
won't send through a lot of improperly filed forms.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said security is a concern. The Internal Revenue
Service doesn't want an unlimited number of people tying into the
service's computers.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she doesn't know if the IRS will ever allow direct
electronic filings from individuals. ``I can't see that far into
the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of $10 to $15 are common for electronic filing. A few
online service providers also offer free electronic filing to
low-income filers.
</P>
<P>
   The methods for electronic filing are set by the software or
online service you choose, but they all promise a quicker refund
than filing by mail.
</P>
<P>
   PROGRAMS AND ONLINE TAX HELP
</P>
<P>
   _ MacIntax (Intuit Inc.): Intuit is the clear leader in the
tax-preparation software business with its MacIntax and TurboTax
products accounting for 73 percent of the market, according to
figures from the company. MacIntax is the basic version of Intuit's
tax software for use on Macintosh computers. The program is very
similar to TurboTax for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Data entry was quick and easy and users should have no trouble
navigating from one form to another. The more sophisticated
programs have more built-in help features, but MacIntax was more
than adequate for simple returns. It also can import information
from Quicken financial management programs. One drawback that
MacIntax shares with TurboTax is that it doesn't come with software
to complete state tax returns. That state software costs $27.95
through Intuit's online store. MacIntax has a suggested retail
price of $34.95, but you should be able to find it cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger TaxCut Deluxe Multimedia (Block Financial): Block
apparently is trying to cut into Intuit's market by offering
products very similar to TurboTax and MacIntax at reduced prices.
Unlike the Intuit products, for example, TaxCut downloaded an Ohio
income tax program from the Internet for free. The state form was
not very sophisticated, however, and required the user to check a
state tax booklet for several questions.
</P>
<P>
   TaxCut's language and graphics have a homey feel. Online help
items say things like ``Congress just loves to change tax laws, and
you can be sure that new rules that can save you money are built
into TaxCut.'' The software is simply organized under three
headings: prepare, review and file, and it's easy to navigate.
TaxCut has multimedia features such as little video movies in which
tax advisers pop up on the screen to explain new tax rules.
</P>
<P>
   TaxCut says it can import information from Quicken, Microsoft
Money and other management software. The tested version offered the
first year's electronic filing free after a mail-in rebate, and
fees for electronic filing were slightly less for TaxCut than for
Intuit products. Most stores carry the Deluxe version for about
$40. Basic versions and Macintosh versions are available.
</P>
<P>
   _ TurboTax Deluxe (Intuit): This product has all the bells and
whistles of TaxCut Deluxe Multimedia plus a few extras. In addition
to video tax advisers, TurboTax Deluxe has a built-in library of
tax books such as Money magazine's ``Income Tax Handbook.'' Turbo
Tax Deluxe also has a planner to help you plot tax strategy for the
current year. The program is clear and easy to use, but if you want
to complete a state income tax form, you have to buy a separate
program for $27.95. The suggested retail price for TurboTax Deluxe
is $49.95, including electronic filing, and you should be able to
find significant discounts on that price.
</P>
<P>
   _ TaxACT 98 Standard Edition (2nd Story Software Inc.): If you
just want the experience of filling in a simple tax return on your
computer, you can download TaxACT 98 Standard Edition from the
Internet for free. The software doesn't offer much help with
complicated tax situations, but if you already know which number
goes in which box, TaxACT works just fine. Log on at taxact.com and
follow the instructions to download the standard program. It took
about 15 minutes to download using a 56 bps modem. All the time the
free program was downloading and during its use, 2nd Story is
lobbying to sell you the more sophisticated TaxACT 98 Deluxe for
$9.95. The company also offers a state tax program for $12.95.
Electronic filing on the TaxAct site costs $7.95 per return.

<P>
   _ OneTax.com (Thomson Investor Network): This service at
onetax.com seems to be working out some bugs and is not recommended
at this time. It offers an attractive price _ federal and state
returns prepared and filed electronically for $9.95 _ but the
system is prone to problems. Three times while attempting to
prepare a return the reviewer was logged off the site. Also
OneTax.com delayed filing a federal return electronically several
times and failed completely to electronically file a state return.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Digital Daily (Internal Revenue Service): This is the main
online help site for the IRS, and it contains links to just about
everything you need to file your federal taxes. It has forms and
publications on most subjects that can be viewed online or
downloaded to your home computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the Digital Daily at www.irs.ustreas.gov, and one
page on the site claims to offer tax regulations in plain English.
Don't be surprised if their idea of plain English doesn't match
yours, however. You can't use this site to file your taxes
electronically, but from the home page you can navigate to the IRS
e-file page that links you to TaxACT and other online tax services,
including the online versions of TurboTax and Taxcut.

 &HT;    Don't replace that slow computer until you have to
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'd think _ judging from the computers my friends
own _ that many people of my personal acquaintance are spending
their evenings designing nuclear submarines and figuring ways to
control the Hubble Space Telescope from home.
</P>
<P>
   It's created a weird sort of modern neurosis. I think of it as
PC envy. People who have relatively low-powered computers at home
spend a huge amount of time fretting they don't have a powerful
enough computer. After all, they're bombarded with ads and articles
that discuss the merits of having a super computer.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's e-mail brought me a note from a reader who uses
an old Mac Classic computer. She said she was really happy with it
and wondered if she should buy a new iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The answer isn't exactly what you might think. There's nothing
wrong with replacing an old computer, even one you're happy with,
because newer and more powerful computers do things faster (that's
convenient and less frustrating) and can run more-powerful programs
(some of the best new programs won't run on old machines).
</P>
<P>
   If you have plenty of money and want a new computer, then there
are good reasons for buying one. But if you are one of those people
who have to count pennies, and who have to make decisions between
buying a new computer and going to New Orleans on vacation, or
paying the mortgage, then don't feel blue or compelled to buy just
because you have this vague notion that you need more.
</P>
<P>
   Among my power-hungry friends, the most common uses for a home
computer (besides games, and we'll get to that by and by) are
e-mail, using the Web, writing old-fashioned paper letters and
running Quicken or some other money management program. It doesn't
take a super computer to do all that. And if the machine you have
at home now does it all for you, then you won't hurt yourself in
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes Husted's Rule of Computer Replacement: Unless you
have plenty of money to spare, only buy a new machine when the one
you own won't run a program you truly need to use, or when it runs
the program so slowly you just about can't stand it (put in
scientific terms).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of following that rule is that you're taking
advantage of a computer world truth: The computers on sale next
month are always more powerful and cost less than the ones last
month. So, when you do buy, you'll get the very most bang for your
buck.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I said I would come back to the topic of games.
</P>
<P>
   If playing computer games is a big part of your computing life
(and it isn't necessarily a sin to actually have fun with that
expensive piece of hardware that sits ugly and beige on your desk
at home), then Husted's Rule still holds true. But you will find
the games you most want to play require enormous computing power.
And the demands from the games don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   You'll soon find out that games push every component. That
designers _ stretching to get the most realistic video and the most
powerful sound _ write the games with rich folks in mind. You'll
find the latest video card is important to the hottest games and,
if you want to hear the crunching sound just right when the Alien
Creature From the Third Grade eats your hero, you'll need a hot
sound card and the latest in speakers.
</P>
<P>
   There is one small gleam of hope, however, that I can offer even
the game players in the crowd. In a calculated way, I stay two
generations behind on the games I play. That way, I save money
twice. I find games that are new to me in the bargain bin at the
software store, and I also postpone the day when I enrich the
credit card people by dropping big money on a new machine.

 &HT;    Web world also blankets local entertainment events
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sure, they call it the World Wide Web. And, yes
indeed, you can zip from Paris, France, to Paris, Ark. Click your
mouse button and you can visit almost any spot on the globe within
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes down to real life, most of us find that the
happenings in our neighborhood and city occupy most of our time.
While you can get the schedule for almost any subway train system
in the world from the Web, folks in Atlanta probably have more
interest in the fact that local MARTA schedules, fare information
and parking information can be found at http://www.itsmarta
</P>
<P>
   .com/.
</P>
<P>
   Most particularly, we'd like something fun to do over the
weekend. And that's where the Web really shines.
</P>
<P>
   So, for today, let's let the world wait and take a look inside
how to find that type of local information using the World Wide
Web. We'll concentrate on Atlanta. But as we explore some of the
sites, we'll also spend a little time talking about how you can
adapt what we learn to your home city.
</P>
<P>
   One good place to start is with Yahoo!. Set your browser to
visit http://localevents.yahoo.com
</P>
<P>
   /events/metro/atlanta/index
</P>
<P>
   .html. (There are similar Yahoo! locations for other major
cities.)
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, this is a pretty clunky way to find out stuff
(although you can use the standard Yahoo! search method if you are
looking for a specific event or topic in Atlanta). I'll show you
what I mean by clunky. It's not bizarre to think you might be using
this Yahoo! feature to find something fun to do for the weekend.
You'd like to know what's available.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can click on your choice of ``Arts and
Entertainment,'' ``Industry Events,'' ``Music'' or ``Recreation and
Sports.'' So, you might start by clicking on ``Music.'' You'd then
be given a sub-menu for different types of music, and you'd have to
click on each sub-menu to find out what's cooking. Meantime, you
wouldn't find theater performances that way, so you'd need to go
through the same winnowing process by starting with ``Arts and
Entertainment'' to get to theater. By the time it got to be
Saturday night, you'd have a sore mouse finger. However, the
listings _ once you get to all of them _ seem fairly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take the same problem _ finding something to do for the
weekend _ to another site. You need to know, as you weigh the
opinion you'll read, that this site is owned by Cox Interactive
Media, which is owned by Cox Enterprises. Cox Enterprises also owns
The Atlanta-Journal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The site I'm talking about is Access Atlanta. The main site is
at http://www.accessatlanta
</P>
<P>
   .com but, to duplicate our search for weekend entertainment
we'll go to http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com
</P>
<P>
   /entertainment/calendars. You'll still find various
entertainment events divided in categories: ``Theater,'' ``Dance,''
``Visual Arts,'' ``Classical Music,'' and, among other things,
``Pop Music.'' But there's a shortcut here. Just click on the link
for ``Weekend's Best Bets'' and you'll get a selection of various
events planned for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be able to choose links for upcoming events _ if you
tend to plan far into the future _ as well as events outside
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's drop in over at Digitalcity Atlanta. (If you live in
another area and it's big enough, there may be a digital city for
you, too.) But we are headed for http://home.digitalcity.com
</P>
<P>
   /atlanta/events/, where the method of finding an event is pretty
nifty. Just use the drop-down menus to select a category, date and
the area (in the case of Atlanta you get two choices: ``Downtown''
or ``North and East'') and press the Find Events button. You can
set the categories for all, if you just want something to do and
don't care if it's a movie or ice skating or a museum exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, the search engine will return 50 or more
events. Then, you'll be able to click on each event listed to get
more detail.
</P>
<P>
   So, now you know how to find out what to do next weekend. Now
all you have to do is find the time and the money to do it.

 &HT;    Power Mac stands out in crowd, distinguished by minitower, speed
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the side, it looks like a pillowcase with
handles. This latest desktop computer from Apple continues the
company's renewed emphasis on design.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, this model is called simply (and boringly) the Power
Mac G3. Apple has abandoned, for now at least, giving jazzy new
names to every new model of the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But the Power Mac G3 is geeky in name only. It looks like no
other computer you've seen before, except for the Apple's runaway
hit, the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Like the iMac, the Power Mac G3's color scheme is iridescent
blue and white. The Power Mac, however, is a minitower and doesn't
include a built-in monitor like the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   And the Power Mac is the fastest Mac yet, offering processing
speeds up to 400 megahertz. There's also 1 megabyte of something
called backside cache, a chunk of memory designed to speed up the
processing power of the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   With the Power Mac, Apple has added a new design concept for
desktop computers. There are four handles atop the minitower, which
give this computer the pillowcase look from the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac continues other design changes begun with the iMac
last August.
</P>
<P>
   For one, there's no built-in floppy drive. You can, however,
easily add one in any of the Power Mac's five bays for internal
storage devices. Two of these slots also support Zip drives, CD-ROM
drives and DVD drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac is also designed to support USB, the new standard
already in use in PCs for connecting peripheral devices such as
mice and monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the iMac, though, the Power Mac is built for transition.
One slot supports the previous connection standard, so you can use
a current mouse, keyboard or monitor. The Power Mac does come with
the same USB iridescent blue mouse and keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac is also the first Apple computer to come equipped
with a new technology called FireWire. This is another peripheral
connection technology, and it vastly enhances the ability to
transfer video and audio files to your Mac. You'd use a FireWire
port, for example, to transfer to your Mac images from your
camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   The price of these latest Power Macs ranges between $1,600 and
$3,500, depending on the options you choose. Features such as
internal modems are optional.

 &HT;    Once a novelty, now big business
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Netwatchers are not necessarily Net geeks.
</P>
<P>
   What I know about the Windows 98 operating system you could put
into half of a very small thimble, and I will never understand why
``King's Quest VII'' crashes every time I'm ready to fight the evil
wizards.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a Web surfer from way back _ all the way back to 1994,
to be exact. I read an article about all these neat things you
could see on your computer if you had this gizmo called a
``browser.'' So I got myself one at the local software joint and
installed it on my dumpy little Compaq Presario 486. I ventured out
into the wilds of cyberspace all by myself, with no map, no search
engine and certainly no technical support.
</P>
<P>
   There really wasn't much to look at then, and with a 2,400 bps
modem, if you wanted to look at the cool sites of those days _
HotWired, Pathfinder or the Louve museum _ you needed time, and
plenty of it. My friend Janet called me up after I had sold her on
the virtues of ``that Internet thing'' to complain. ``In the time
it takes me to download Time magazine, I can sit down on my couch
and read Time magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? In those days, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling somewhat guilty, I felt compelled to help my friends and
fellow Web surfers get the most out of the Web. After all, it was
at my suggestion they were forking over $19.95 of their hard-earned
money each month to stare at their computers and wait for the magic
of the Web to appear before them. In my quest for Web knowledge, I
did the only thing I could think of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I got a subscription to Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines _ which was pretty much how you had to
read Wired in those days _ I found out that you could get better
computers with faster modems, and there were books that could help
you find Web sites to give you Tarot card readings, Emily
Dickinson's poetry and the contents of a Coke machine in some
building at Stanford University. Not that I had any need to know if
there was any Diet Coke left in some vending machine at Stanford
University, but it was kind of cool to be sitting on the other side
of the country gathering up this kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the days of wandering aimlessly through cyberspace are
gone. More and more users are logging on every day from home and
work. Portals such as Yahoo! and Excite promise to take you to
every Web site worth seeing, and the number of sites grows
exponentially every day.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more retailers, banks, and airlines pour onto the
Web, it's becoming more of a utility than an amusing little hobby.
Everyone wants a piece of your valuable online time and your
valuable off-line money. Web powerhouses like CNN and Amazon.com
would love it if you spent all your online time just visiting their
sites and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have spent more than my fair share of time at Amazon
_ the travel mug/thank you note last Christmas from Amazon's
marketing department was a real wake-up call for me and my credit
limit _ there are other things to do online that are useful and
just plain fun. To miss them is to miss the creativity and
innovation that made the Web worth looking at to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The Web of the 21st century is big business. Everyone from
Disney to Martha Stewart has their own Web page, and newcomers to
the Web are lost even before they start. Companies like Peapod now
will deliver groceries to your front door, and the cable and phone
companies are promising a future filled with ``always on'' Net
access that will eliminate busy signals and the endless downloads
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Web is going to change your life. You may
become a devotee of online shopping, hourly news updates from MSNBC
or sending e-mail to your friends and co-workers. Even if you never
log on, the Web isn't going to go away. You watch your kids bounce
from Web site to Web site from a nervous distance or look at Web
addresses constantly being flashed across your TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a novice Web surfer, the Web was filled with novice
Web surfers. People built Web pages with lists of sites because it
was fun, not to make money, go public, get into mergers and
acquisition or land on the covers of business magazines. In the
last six years the Web has become a business. As consumers we need
to know what's going on out there and how it's going to change how
we use the Web and how we fit it into our lives.
</P>
<P>
   While we try to figure it all out for you, there's lots to do in
the meantime. Why not see how the Coke machines are stocked in New
York and Denmark? (http://www.cc.columbia.edu/(tilde)cocacola/ and
http://
</P>
<P>
   amigos12.diku.dk/currentstatus.html, respectively).

 &HT;    PCs too cheap to pass up
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Decisions, decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Charlie Partana says in ``Prizzi's Honor'': Do I ice her?
Do I marry her?
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with computers. Now that the holiday dust has
settled, a question still hangs in the air: Should you trash that
vintage Pentium that's served you so well and buy a newer, faster
machine now that the prices have leveled out a little? Or are you
in it for better or for worse and need to upgrade?
</P>
<P>
   With all the new models on the market creating a glut of
hardware, there's never been a better time to upgrade. I just took
my P166 off life support by adding 48 MB of RAM, a U.S. Robotics
56k modem and a Matrox 8-gigabyte hard drive for $380. (It would
have been cheaper, but I had to pay more than I should have for EDO
RAM because only one store that I could locate had any.)
</P>
<P>
   The result is like getting a new machine _ with a customized OS
and software bundle _ that has a whole bunch of space and memory
and will do anything I need it to do: play the newest games, create
CPU-intensive graphics or use six programs at once.
</P>
<P>
   So, now I don't need to go buy a new machine anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But, I'm gonna get one anyway ... they're just too darn cheap to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a price from the ads on these very pages: A
400-MHz computer with all the trimmings for $650? Add another $200
for a 17-inch monitor, and you've got one heck of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is, the most inexpensive computers don't use Pentium
chips.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares?
</P>
<P>
   AMD's K6 series of chips benchmark as fast as or nearly as fast
as _ and in some cases faster than _ Pentiums do. Intel's own
Celeron chip is another good alternative to spending an extra
couple of hundred dollars to get the Pentium brand, and all three
flavors are more CPU power than most home users will ever need.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets better. AMD has a K7 at 500 MHz on the horizon,
and Intel is about to offer the Pentium III _ albeit a
controversial chip currently being boycotted by some in the Net
community. (But that's another column.)
</P>
<P>
   The point is that prices on K6s, Celerons and PIIs will probably
drop even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not saying Pentium isn't a good chip to buy _ not at
all. There's no denying that Pentium connotes reliability, well,
except for that little floating point unit screw-up a few years
back. But they are the team to beat on the semiconductor playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the K6 chips aren't worth considering, either.
In fact, big-name manufacturers _ like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and
others _ have been selling AMD's K6s for a while, and a hot rumor
around the 'Net is that Gateway 2000 is in talks with AMD about
using its chips in some Gateway systems.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule out Celeron, either. Initially, these Intel chips
were essentially Pentium IIs without a Level 2 cache created to
counter AMD's cheaper prices. New Celerons _ Celeron (A) _ however,
have an L2 cache and are equal to Pentium IIs running at 66-MHz bus
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, upgradeability is a factor. Chances are,
though, that by the time you're ready to trade in one of these
300-400 MHz uber-machines, you won't be able to use what's
available then anyway. Your best strategy these days is to approach
buying a new computer as if it were disposable and forget about
upgrading the chip and motherboard down the line. Need a machine
for e-mail and letter-writing? Get a 266-MHz K6-2 and a 15-inch
monitor for slightly more than $500. Need some real power for
graphics and gaming? Go for a 400-MHz Celeron (A) or the new,
speedier PC100 bus with a K6-2 chip and a 17-inch monitor for
around $750.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, you can't go wrong spending the extra money to
buy a Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   It's just about impossible to go wrong with any of these new
boxes, and the dogfight brewing between Intel and AMD can only make
it better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if I didn't know better, I'd say the buyer is in the
driver's seat these days.

 &HT;    Tips offered for speedier 'Net connections
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how fast your connection, the Internet can
move like molasses. It's one of the major frustrations holding back
the development of the 'Net as a commonplace utility.
</P>
<P>
   There are, though, ways to speed up your connection. Read about
them in the March issue of PC World.
</P>
<P>
   The article also compares the benefits of various new connection
technologies, such as the telephone company's digital subscriber
lines and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue of PC World also includes a list of what it
considers the top PCs. It offers several lists of 10.
</P>
<P>
   There's the top 10 desktop computers, the top 10 laptops and the
top 10 home PCs. For example, as the top home PC, the magazine
names Dell's Dimension XPS R450.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Well, at long last it's here. Maxis has finally released the
next version of its popular ``SimCity'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``SimCity 3000,'' the game offers better graphics, more
complexity and more control over your urban simulation. ``SimCity
3000'' was more than two years in the making. Maxis had originally
planned to give the game a 3-D perspective and let users view their
cities from street level. But that approach was abandoned midway
because it demanded more computer firepower than most home
computers could muster.
</P>
<P>
   For younger kids, there's a series of four new education games
released by Knowledge Adventure. The titles, part of the
``JumpStart'' series, are ``Reading for Second Graders,'' ``Learn
to Read,'' ``Math for Kindergartners'' and ``Math Mystery.'' These
games are designed to help kids master reading and math skills. The
games are all available for both Macs and PCs, if they have Windows
95 or Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Scuba diving enthusiasts can now read the popular magazine of
the sport, Skin Diver. The online version of the magazine offers
most of the same content as its printed counterpart. You'll also
find some games and the opportunity to buy scuba equipment and
trips online. This site is at http://www.skin-diver

 &HT;    Atlanta No. 5 city in Net use
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The City Too Busy To Hate apparently spends a lot of
its free time on the Internet. A study by Inteco, a Connecticut
market research firm, found metro Atlanta the fifth most wired
community in America.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of metro Atlanta adults regularly access the
Internet, according to the study. Oakland, Calif.; Orange County,
Calif.; Seattle; and Washington, D.C., placed first through fourth.
After Atlanta come Dallas, Houston, San Diego, Phoenix and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The company sampled 16,500 American households in December. The
study found about 55 percent of the adult U.S. population _ 108
million people _ had hopped on the Internet at least once in the
previous 30 days. The December numbers were up 38 percent from May
1998 and 71 percent from September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 study of Internet use, Atlanta placed seventh behind
San Jose, Calif., Boston, Denver, Dallas, New York and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who use the Internet, 76 million have access from home,
51 million from work, 22 million from a friend's or relative's
house, and 24 million use computers at a school, library or
community center. The bulk of Internet users, 77 percent, are
between 18 and 49 years of age, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   OFF-BRAND CAN BE OK
</P>
<P>
   We are, increasingly, a nation of billboards. Clothes with
company names are considered cooler than those without. FamilyPC
magazine, in its March 1999 issue, takes a look at the issue of
brand names as related to technology products. It attempts to
answer this question: When it comes to computers, is
label-consciousness anything more than simple vanity?
</P>
<P>
   The article looked at a Compaq PC and a computer from Comtrade.
Compaq is a well-known brand, Comtrade lesser known. The comparison
looked at comparably priced systems. Both were about $2,100.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq was considered far easier to set up and use. It comes
complete with a poster detailing the set-up procedures, and the
article gave the poster high marks. Compaq's system comes with
color-coded ports and cables, so matching cable and port is no
tougher than plugging a blue into a blue. The software that came
with the Compaq was rated better, and the service supporting the
computer and reliability of the system was rated higher. The
Comtrade machine got rave reviews for its core components, its
multimedia parts and its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that off-brand systems offer more
performance and better features than similarly priced name-brand
machines. But big-name machines offer more attention to detail and
polish. If you are someone who is comfortable with computers and
not afraid of risk, the no-name machines would be a safe buy. If
you're a PC novice, a more user-friendly name-brand system might be
the best option.
</P>
<P>
   No-name brands included in the article are Comtrade, http://
</P>
<P>
   comtrade.com; emachines, http://www.e4me.com; Gazelle computer,
www
</P>
<P>
   .gazelle-computer.com; iDOT.computers, http://www
</P>
<P>
   .idot.com; MidWest Micro, http://mwmicro.com; and Quantex,

   CUSTOMIZED TICKETMASTER
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster is trying to get into the Internet portal business.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket broker launched a customizable Web site that lets
users create profiles, at http://
</P>
<P>
   my.ticketmaster.com. The profiles, in turn, are used to provide
a listing of the concerts and sporting events that should appeal to
you.
</P>
<P>
   The new site lets you see the view you'd have from any seat in
75 different venues, in virtual reality 3-D images. The site also
offers event times, directions to the venue and information about
parking.
</P>
<P>
   The site works best with Intel Pentium II-class processors. A
400-megahertz processor is recommended, but a 200-MHz machine will
work as well.
</P>
<P>
   My Ticketmaster is part of the regular Ticketmaster site,
http://www
</P>
<P>
   .ticketmaster.com. The company said online ticket sales have
averaged more than $10 million per month the past 21 months.

 &HT;    Virtual birds, dating tips come courtesy of e-mail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a moment of abject stupidity, which is several
degrees dumber than my normal state of simple stupidity, I allowed
the whole world of public relations agents to access my e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, my mailbox is constantly stuffed with rubbish that
I never read past the first paragraph; at times the subject heading
is enough to prompt erasure.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often come gems of such surpassing brilliance that
I cannot but share them with you. The first came from an
all-purpose flack, or public relations agent, from whom I hear
several times weekly. Now, I did not make up what follows; I
haven't changed a word of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can have a personal computer valet,'' he writes. ``For
under $100, you can command an animated parrot with built-in speech
recognition to navigate PC programs, monitor stocks, call friends
and associates over the Internet via a built-in Internet phone,
issue meeting reminders, warn of unexpected events on the stock
market and report news and weather. It is called Prody. If you
don't have a best friend, this is the closest thing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can arrange a demo.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for me, you can't. I've had parrots. Parrots have large,
cruel beaks. They have voices, equaled only by those of a couple of
White House reporters I once knew, capable of cutting through a
quartet of jackhammers. I once observed a parrot clamber down from
its perch, work its way to the top of our breakfast table, sidle up
to my father's dinner plate and seize his hamburger steak. Dragged
that ground beef all the way back to the edge of the table and was
about to heave it over the side when Dad caught on.
</P>
<P>
   My computer gives me enough trouble now. I sure don't need it
coming on with a virtual parrot screeching, ``Prody wants a
megabyte!'' I don't have many friends, and I doubt I would keep
them by having my virtual parrot call them up at odd hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I want ornithological hysteria the next time my 401(k)
takes a torpedo amidships.
</P>
<P>
   The same day I was offered a parrot demo, I got a book
announcement. The book is entitled ``How To Juggle Women,'' and
that intrigued me, because even after a year on the Internet this
is a fetish I'd never discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, I misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is an essential guide for the seasoned dating man
who needs help organizing the women in his life,'' the announcement
said. ``Women are constantly grabbing your interest and attention.
Do you have to choose one over the other? Of course not! Stop
letting opportunities like these go to waste. Why not date them
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``You will learn time-saving techniques that will maximize your
availability, and allow you to spend time with several ladies a
day. The author details scheduling methods so you never have two
dates at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, women are certainly grabbing my interest and attention all
the time, and I could use some help organizing the women in my
life, chiefly my wife. My daughters and my granddaughters seem
pretty well organized.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the book will be of little use, since my dating
days ended 42 years ago this week, and I was scarcely what you'd
call seasoned. I manage to spend time with several ladies a day,
usually without making any of them mad, and without having to get
involved in tedious things like dating. They're friends, and as
long as I don't unleash virtual parrots upon them or buy books on
girl-juggling, they may remain so.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Sickly pilots a plague on labor movement
 &HT;    For release Feb. 17, 1999
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By HOWARD KLEINBERG
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As I sat down to write this, I intentionally placed my late
father's timeworn, quarter-sized green union button on the desk in
front of me, not only as a reminder of where I came from, but as a
notation of my personal lifelong support of the American labor
movement.
</P>
<P>
   I put the pin of Local 133 of the Club and Restaurant Employees
Union _ dad once had been a bartender _ so that I wouldn't go off
the deep end in what I had to say about the sick-out against
American Airlines and the paying public by the Allied Pilots
Association _ so arrogant that it initially ignored a federal
judge's demand that the pilots return to work.
</P>
<P>
   There is good argument that what the pilots were seeking, equal
pay for the Reno Airlines pilots just brought aboard by an American
Airlines buyout, was a legitimate labor-management issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the labor side handled it abysmally. It gave the public no
warning. The sick-out was not the result of a long, drawn-out
negotiation that failed. It just happened because the pilots wanted
their message to get across quickly.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, it was a lie. The pilots were not sick, just
circumventing the rightful course of labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Nevermind that it more than inconvenienced hundreds of thousands
of passengers and their families; the pilots's goal was to double
the pay of a scant few other pilots and to hell with whomever
suffered as a result.
</P>
<P>
   When a strike is imminent, the public has an opportunity to seek
other means. In the case of a package delivery strike, there was a
negotiation period where the public was alerted to send things
early, or by other means. The same is true of an airline strike.
When American Airlines pilots threatened to strike several years
ago over another matter, the public still had time to purchase
tickets on other airlines, or to take a train, bus or car.
</P>
<P>
   But not this time. Suddenly there was a sick-out. People were
trapped in the midst of their travels in Europe, in the Caribbean,
in the United States. Television feasted on pictures of stranded
travelers in airline terminals trying to get some sleep against
their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Weddings and funerals were missed, honeymoons shattered,
business trips canceled at the gate. That the management of
American Airlines made no significant attempt to address or correct
the reason why the pilots were dishonestly sick cannot go
unnoticed. But, what the pilots did was far more callous.
</P>
<P>
   There always has and will continue to be a need for organized
labor. Unfortunately, our premier view of that today is through six
figure salaried pilots and seven to eight figure salaried athletes
who walk off the job.
</P>
<P>
   Where we need to be looking is where there has been historic
abuse of the American worker struggling to pay his and her bills.
They are the people who work in assembly plants, mines, clothing
and shoe factories and the like. That's where the American labor
movement began and where it still has the biggest job to do.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, labor has been its own worst enemy in recent
decades. Between corruption and arrogance, it repositioned itself
from the heart of the American public to its hind quarter.
</P>
<P>
   This sick-out is an example of labor at its ugliest.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing wrong with meaningful debate between management
and labor. And, if they can't agree, a strike is warranted. And the
public gets to observe and contemplate its options.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots did not let this happen. The pilots got a sickness
that became a plaque on the traveling public.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't what my father's union button was all about.

 &HT;    How the cookie crumbles
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ People love cookies and milk. People hate cookies and
computers.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't have your ``Internet for Dummies'' handbook
nearby, a computer ``cookie'' is a file that Web sites install on
your computer's hard drive when you visit a site that offers
cookies. They are very small files, never more than 225 characters
or 4K of disk space. Not all sites send cookies to your computer,
but an increasing number do.
</P>
<P>
   Harmless though they might be, most Internet users have a
knee-jerk reaction to anyone or anything trying to gather
information about them. The notion that merely typing in a Web
address opens up the opportunity for companies to find out anything
at all about them is distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an advertiser might set a cookie on your computer
to track how many people have viewed an online advertisement. Web
sites also send cookies to monitor how many users might view a
particular page or section. The folks who send these cookies say
they do it to help determine which parts of their Web sites get the
most traffic so they can add or subtract content accordingly and to
keep users from looking at the same advertisements over and over
again.
</P>
<P>
   Cookies, for the most part, are harmless both to your computer
and your privacy. There's really no harm in sites such as ESPN
SportZone sending baseball-related ads to users browsing the
baseball section. In fact, some users may find the products and
services being offered to them useful.
</P>
<P>
   However, cookies can also be used to track your password, user
name, credit card numbers and any other information you have
provided via an online form. Sites like The New York Times, which
require user ID and passwords, store this information as a cookie
in your hard disk, so registered users won't have to keep filling
out forms every time they go to the site.
</P>
<P>
   Search engines use cookies to ``remember'' individual user
habits and deliver customized news and services targeted to them.
</P>
<P>
   Online vendors, such as Amazon.com, can read the user's cookie
and match it with a stored profile that would contain credit card
information, so the user won't have to enter the information each
time.
</P>
<P>
   Given what cookies do, it won't come as a surprise that Internet
advertisers love cookies _ all kinds and any kind. Cookies with
news, with entertainment, with sports, with search engines. If you
can put it on the Web and you can advertise there, you can bet
there's a marketing department somewhere making sure every Web ad
comes with cookies. Most cookies are active only during a single
Web surfing session and disappear after users log off.
</P>
<P>
   However, the sheer vastness of the Internet and the complexity
of home PCs make many Web users wary of cookies. There are concerns
that cookies can be used to lift personal information from your PC
or perhaps something more insidious. A special Web site called
Cookie Central (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .cookiecentral.com) explains the various uses and potential
misuses of cookies. Ironically, the site uses cookies itself to
deliver its own banner ads to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the concerns, the U.S. government says it likes cookies.
A report issued last March from the Energy Department's Computer
Incident Advisory Capability (CIAC) said, despite the fear and
loathing some users have, ``the hype about cookies has far
outweighed the actual hazards of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The popular concepts and rumors about what a cookie can do has
reached almost mystical proportions,'' the report stated. ``It is
not an executable program and cannot do anything to your machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The report helped quiet rumors that America Online planned to
use cookies to gather private information from its members' hard
drives.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing consultants such as DoubleClick
(http://www.doubleclick
</P>
<P>
   .com) use cookies to increase the efficiency of the placing of
advertisements on Web sites and deliver ads to the people most
likely to be interested in a particular company's products and
services.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick addresses the issue of cookies and Internet privacy
directly at its Web site. The company reassures all Web surfers
that any user information gleaned from cookies remains completely
anonymous. ``We do not sell or rent any information to third
parties,'' the company says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the information is anonymous, DoubleClick maintains, only
the sites themselves and advertisers could benefit from the
information the company gathers.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick believes cookies make the Web a better place. ``We
believe that cookies enhance the Web experience for the user by
limiting the repetitiveness of advertising and increasing the level
of relevant content on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   While DoubleClick might paint too rosy a picture of cookies,
there really isn't anything dangerous about them. There are ways
you can monitor what sites are sending you cookies and/or stop them
altogether, and you can read about them below.
</P>
<P>
   There are people who will abuse cookies _ unscrupulous Web sites
might take your information and sell it to offline marketers, but
as Electronic Frontier Foundation director Stanton McCandlish told
CNet last year, ``It's really difficulty to imagine a technology
that can't be abused.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT COOKIES DO ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Web site tracking: It's a way to help Web designers and
developers keep tabs on which areas of their sites are most
popular. It also provides more accurate accounts of how many people
have actually visited a Web site and what pages they viewed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Marketing: Cookies deliver targeted advertisements for
products consumers might want _ for example, advertising sporting
equipment to users who visit the sports area of a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3. Storing IDs: Cookies can store passwords and user IDs, so
subscribers to The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Slate
or any site that requires a user ID and password won't have to keep
filling out registration forms everytime the visit the site. Online
retailers like Amazon.com and others use cookies to streamline
their online ordering process, remembering what orders have been
placed, or items that have been selected but not yet purchased.
Users can return weeks later and find the items still in their
``online shopping baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Personalization: Even the most anti-cookie contingent agrees
this is one of the best uses of cookies. Microsoft and Netscape
browsers use cookies to create personal start pages. Users can come
to a large site such as CNN, MSNBC or Excite and select which areas
of the site they want to view and which areas they don't. The
cookie stores that information and uses it on the next visit.
</P>
<P>
   5. Target marketing: Cookies can be used to build a profile of
you _ where you surf, and what advertisements you click on. This
information is used to send ads to you that supposedly will be of
interest to you based on your Web surfing history.
</P>
<P>
   COOKIES DON'T ...
</P>
<P>
   1. Mine your PC and gather information about you from other
programs such as letters, spreadsheets or e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   2. Send information to any other sites you surf.
</P>
<P>
   3. Make changes to any information you've supplied previously.
</P>
<P>
   4. Damage your computer or your hard drive in any way.
</P>
<P>
   5. Taste good dunked in milk or purchased from a supermarket.

 &HT;    Cuff monitors average blood pressure

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Mark of Fitness Inc. wristwatch-style blood
pressure and pulse monitor can store data about two people and
sells for around $100 at selected health product and electronic
stores.
</P>
<P>
   To use the MF-72, as the unit is called, you strap it over your
wrist and push the start button. A cuff inflates, and the device
automatically measures your pulse and blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The reading is comfortable and takes less than a minute. And
because the unit is portable, a person needing to monitor his blood
pressure can keep it with him at all times. It runs on two AAA
batteries and comes shipped in a clamshell carrying case.
</P>
<P>
   The MF-72 holds records for two people and gives current
readings plus averages of the past seven readings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your blood pressure can be up at one reading just because you
were walking around,'' said Wayne Baker, sales manager for Mark of
Fitness. ``An average of seven readings gives your doctor a much
clearer picture of where you really are.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the MF-72 won an innovation award at the recent
International Consumer Electronics Show, the product is not yet
widely distributed. If you can't find it, call the company at (732)
842-7200 for information.

 &HT;    Tax software: They're not like putting an accountant in your PC,
but programs make unpleasant task easier
 &HT;    WITH GRAPHIC
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Back in the Dark Ages before home computers,
anyone preparing his income tax returns had to sit down with
pencil, paper and a calculator and shuffle through a box of records
for hours to get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Now that person can sit down in front of his computer screen and
accomplish the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   It will still take hours, and he'll have to shuffle through the
same box of records, but at least his return will look neater.
</P>
<P>
   A review of three tax preparation software products, two online
tax assistance services and the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer
assistance Web site showed basically that the pencil, paper and
calculator method aren't that bad after all.
</P>
<P>
   One rule seems to apply: If you don't have your records in order
and you can't figure out the meaning of the applicable tax
regulations, filling out your tax returns will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Dixon, public affairs officer for the Internal Revenue
Service office in Cincinnati, said tax software reduces the chance
of math errors. And if you file electronically _ more on that later
_ you'll get a quick acknowledgement that your return has been
received, and you'll get a quicker refund.
</P>
<P>
   But Dixon said, ``The best software can't help you if you don't
have good records. That's our No. 1 tip.''
</P>
<P>
   The software packages may help walk you through the process of
filling in a tax return, but they're generally only a bit more
helpful than the tax preparation books you can pick up for free at
the local post office or library.
</P>
<P>
   And while flipping back and forth through a booklet is fairly
easy, trying to navigate through an online help index can be
frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-preparation software takes care of all the adding,
subtracting and dividing. It also checks the charts to fill in the
blanks on how much tax you owe or what your standard deduction
would be.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it. The reason some people go to an accountant or a
professional tax preparer is that they hope the professional will
know some tricks to reduce their taxes. They don't want to break
the law, but they want to twist it a little to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The software packages are good about pointing out tax savings an
inexperienced private citizen might miss, but they seem to stick
very close to the rules and language found in official Internal
Revenue Service tax booklets.
</P>
<P>
   TAX SOFTWARE
</P>
<P>
   Most programs follow a similar pattern: The program flashes
interview questions across the computer screen, and the user types
answers into little boxes. The questions range from ``What's your
first name?'' to ``How much did you receive in rent from your
tenants in out-of-state rental property?''
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the questions, most programs offer one or more
``help'' options. Some have a list of frequently asked questions
related to the information the program is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the program might ask if you earned any tax-exempt
interest in the past year. The nearby help option explains what
types of interest are taxed and which are tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   A major shortcut is available if you have kept accurate,
up-to-date records on a computerized personal accounting program
such as Quicken. The software packages claim to be able to import
information directly from your financial records, greatly reducing
the time required to fill out the return.
</P>
<P>
   One annoying and time-consuming feature in tax-preparation
software is that users must type in everything on their W-2 forms.
Each W-2 has about 25 boxes, and the programs usually ask questions
about each box on each W-2.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional paper filing, you just copy numbers from the
W-2s and enter them on the tax forms, then put a copy of the W-2 in
the envelope when you mail the return.
</P>
<P>
   The software programs reviewed were all designed for individual
taxpayers and they all were fairly flexible. They easily handled
simple returns where the taxpayer took the standard deduction and
had no unusual sources of income.
</P>
<P>
   They also did fine with more complicated returns involving home
businesses and self-employment taxes.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the software did not do well was answer specific
questions that often come up during a typical tax-preparation
session.
</P>
<P>
   They have answers for frequently asked questions, of course, but
what if your question isn't that frequently asked? The help subject
indexes within the programs are often difficult to use.
</P>
<P>
   After you have answered all the questions in the federal tax
interview, the programs calculate your taxes and tell you how much
you owe or how big of a refund you should receive.
</P>
<P>
   Some programs offer the option of completing a state income tax
return. In most cases, you must pay extra for a separate program
capable of handling your state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The state tax return is completed much like the federal return;
the program interviews you, you type in answers and the program
plugs the answers into the forms.
</P>
<P>
   If you buy a tax-preparation software package now, it should be
useful well into the future. The packages are designed to be
updated by linking them to their manufacturers through the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   FILING
</P>
<P>
   The traditional way to file taxes is to fill out paper forms,
put them in an envelope along with W-2s and mail them to the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   All the tax software packages and online services we tested
allow filers to print out completed forms and send them to federal
and state tax authorities by mail.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, the IRS also has been accepting various
forms of electronic filing.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with the simplest returns can file their returns
directly with the Internal Revenue Service with the TeleFile
system. The taxpayer follows instructions and types tax information
using a telephone keypad, which leads to a quicker refund than
paper filing.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers with more complicated returns generally must pay a
third party such as a tax-preparation service to file their taxes
electronically. You can't log onto an IRS Web site and file your
taxes directly.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said the IRS uses third parties because it has certified
that its approved third-party providers know what they're doing and
won't send through a lot of improperly filed forms.
</P>
<P>
   But she also said security is a concern. The Internal Revenue
Service doesn't want an unlimited number of people tying into the
service's computers.
</P>
<P>
   And she said she doesn't know if the IRS will ever allow direct
electronic filings from individuals. ``I can't see that far into
the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of $10 to $15 are common for electronic filing. A few
online service providers also offer free electronic filing to
low-income filers.
</P>
<P>
   The methods for electronic filing are set by the software or
online service you choose, but they all promise a quicker refund
than filing by mail.
</P>
<P>
   PROGRAMS AND ONLINE TAX HELP
</P>
<P>
   _ MacIntax (Intuit Inc.): Intuit is the clear leader in the
tax-preparation software business with its MacIntax and TurboTax
products accounting for 73 percent of the market, according to
figures from the company. MacIntax is the basic version of Intuit's
tax software for use on Macintosh computers. The program is very
similar to TurboTax for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Data entry was quick and easy and users should have no trouble
navigating from one form to another. The more sophisticated
programs have more built-in help features, but MacIntax was more
than adequate for simple returns. It also can import information
from Quicken financial management programs. One drawback that
MacIntax shares with TurboTax is that it doesn't come with software
to complete state tax returns. That state software costs $27.95
through Intuit's online store. MacIntax has a suggested retail
price of $34.95, but you should be able to find it cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kiplinger TaxCut Deluxe Multimedia (Block Financial): Block
apparently is trying to cut into Intuit's market by offering
products very similar to TurboTax and MacIntax at reduced prices.
Unlike the Intuit products, for example, TaxCut downloaded an Ohio
income tax program from the Internet for free. The state form was
not very sophisticated, however, and required the user to check a
state tax booklet for several questions.
</P>
<P>
   TaxCut's language and graphics have a homey feel. Online help
items say things like ``Congress just loves to change tax laws, and
you can be sure that new rules that can save you money are built
into TaxCut.'' The software is simply organized under three
headings: prepare, review and file, and it's easy to navigate.
TaxCut has multimedia features such as little video movies in which
tax advisers pop up on the screen to explain new tax rules.
</P>
<P>
   TaxCut says it can import information from Quicken, Microsoft
Money and other management software. The tested version offered the
first year's electronic filing free after a mail-in rebate, and
fees for electronic filing were slightly less for TaxCut than for
Intuit products. Most stores carry the Deluxe version for about
$40. Basic versions and Macintosh versions are available.
</P>
<P>
   _ TurboTax Deluxe (Intuit): This product has all the bells and
whistles of TaxCut Deluxe Multimedia plus a few extras. In addition
to video tax advisers, TurboTax Deluxe has a built-in library of
tax books such as Money magazine's ``Income Tax Handbook.'' Turbo
Tax Deluxe also has a planner to help you plot tax strategy for the
current year. The program is clear and easy to use, but if you want
to complete a state income tax form, you have to buy a separate
program for $27.95. The suggested retail price for TurboTax Deluxe
is $49.95, including electronic filing, and you should be able to
find significant discounts on that price.
</P>
<P>
   _ TaxACT 98 Standard Edition (2nd Story Software Inc.): If you
just want the experience of filling in a simple tax return on your
computer, you can download TaxACT 98 Standard Edition from the
Internet for free. The software doesn't offer much help with
complicated tax situations, but if you already know which number
goes in which box, TaxACT works just fine. Log on at taxact.com and
follow the instructions to download the standard program. It took
about 15 minutes to download using a 56 bps modem. All the time the
free program was downloading and during its use, 2nd Story is
lobbying to sell you the more sophisticated TaxACT 98 Deluxe for
$9.95. The company also offers a state tax program for $12.95.
Electronic filing on the TaxAct site costs $7.95 per return.
</P>
<P>
   _ OneTax.com (Thomson Investor Network): This service at
onetax.com seems to be working out some bugs and is not recommended
at this time. It offers an attractive price _ federal and state
returns prepared and filed electronically for $9.95 _ but the
system is prone to problems. Three times while attempting to
prepare a return the reviewer was logged off the site. Also
OneTax.com delayed filing a federal return electronically several
times and failed completely to electronically file a state return.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Digital Daily (Internal Revenue Service): This is the main
online help site for the IRS, and it contains links to just about
everything you need to file your federal taxes. It has forms and
publications on most subjects that can be viewed online or
downloaded to your home computer.
</P>
<P>
   You can find the Digital Daily at www.irs.ustreas.gov, and one
page on the site claims to offer tax regulations in plain English.
Don't be surprised if their idea of plain English doesn't match
yours, however. You can't use this site to file your taxes
electronically, but from the home page you can navigate to the IRS
e-file page that links you to TaxACT and other online tax services,
including the online versions of TurboTax and Taxcut.

 &HT;    Don't replace that slow computer until you have to
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You'd think _ judging from the computers my friends
own _ that many people of my personal acquaintance are spending
their evenings designing nuclear submarines and figuring ways to
control the Hubble Space Telescope from home.
</P>
<P>
   It's created a weird sort of modern neurosis. I think of it as
PC envy. People who have relatively low-powered computers at home
spend a huge amount of time fretting they don't have a powerful
enough computer. After all, they're bombarded with ads and articles
that discuss the merits of having a super computer.
</P>
<P>
   This morning's e-mail brought me a note from a reader who uses
an old Mac Classic computer. She said she was really happy with it
and wondered if she should buy a new iMac.
</P>
<P>
   The answer isn't exactly what you might think. There's nothing
wrong with replacing an old computer, even one you're happy with,
because newer and more powerful computers do things faster (that's
convenient and less frustrating) and can run more-powerful programs
(some of the best new programs won't run on old machines).
</P>
<P>
   If you have plenty of money and want a new computer, then there
are good reasons for buying one. But if you are one of those people
who have to count pennies, and who have to make decisions between
buying a new computer and going to New Orleans on vacation, or
paying the mortgage, then don't feel blue or compelled to buy just
because you have this vague notion that you need more.
</P>
<P>
   Among my power-hungry friends, the most common uses for a home
computer (besides games, and we'll get to that by and by) are
e-mail, using the Web, writing old-fashioned paper letters and
running Quicken or some other money management program. It doesn't
take a super computer to do all that. And if the machine you have
at home now does it all for you, then you won't hurt yourself in
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes Husted's Rule of Computer Replacement: Unless you
have plenty of money to spare, only buy a new machine when the one
you own won't run a program you truly need to use, or when it runs
the program so slowly you just about can't stand it (put in
scientific terms).
</P>
<P>
   The benefit of following that rule is that you're taking
advantage of a computer world truth: The computers on sale next
month are always more powerful and cost less than the ones last
month. So, when you do buy, you'll get the very most bang for your
buck.
</P>
<P>
   OK. I said I would come back to the topic of games.
</P>
<P>
   If playing computer games is a big part of your computing life
(and it isn't necessarily a sin to actually have fun with that
expensive piece of hardware that sits ugly and beige on your desk
at home), then Husted's Rule still holds true. But you will find
the games you most want to play require enormous computing power.
And the demands from the games don't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   You'll soon find out that games push every component. That
designers _ stretching to get the most realistic video and the most
powerful sound _ write the games with rich folks in mind. You'll
find the latest video card is important to the hottest games and,
if you want to hear the crunching sound just right when the Alien
Creature From the Third Grade eats your hero, you'll need a hot
sound card and the latest in speakers.
</P>
<P>
   There is one small gleam of hope, however, that I can offer even
the game players in the crowd. In a calculated way, I stay two
generations behind on the games I play. That way, I save money
twice. I find games that are new to me in the bargain bin at the
software store, and I also postpone the day when I enrich the
credit card people by dropping big money on a new machine.

 &HT;    Web world also blankets local entertainment events
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sure, they call it the World Wide Web. And, yes
indeed, you can zip from Paris, France, to Paris, Ark. Click your
mouse button and you can visit almost any spot on the globe within
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes down to real life, most of us find that the
happenings in our neighborhood and city occupy most of our time.
While you can get the schedule for almost any subway train system
in the world from the Web, folks in Atlanta probably have more
interest in the fact that local MARTA schedules, fare information
and parking information can be found at http://www.itsmarta
</P>
<P>
   .com/.
</P>
<P>
   Most particularly, we'd like something fun to do over the
weekend. And that's where the Web really shines.
</P>
<P>
   So, for today, let's let the world wait and take a look inside
how to find that type of local information using the World Wide
Web. We'll concentrate on Atlanta. But as we explore some of the
sites, we'll also spend a little time talking about how you can
adapt what we learn to your home city.
</P>
<P>
   One good place to start is with Yahoo!. Set your browser to
visit http://localevents.yahoo.com
</P>
<P>
   /events/metro/atlanta/index
</P>
<P>
   .html. (There are similar Yahoo! locations for other major
cities.)
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, this is a pretty clunky way to find out stuff
(although you can use the standard Yahoo! search method if you are
looking for a specific event or topic in Atlanta). I'll show you
what I mean by clunky. It's not bizarre to think you might be using
this Yahoo! feature to find something fun to do for the weekend.
You'd like to know what's available.
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can click on your choice of ``Arts and
Entertainment,'' ``Industry Events,'' ``Music'' or ``Recreation and
Sports.'' So, you might start by clicking on ``Music.'' You'd then
be given a sub-menu for different types of music, and you'd have to
click on each sub-menu to find out what's cooking. Meantime, you
wouldn't find theater performances that way, so you'd need to go
through the same winnowing process by starting with ``Arts and
Entertainment'' to get to theater. By the time it got to be
Saturday night, you'd have a sore mouse finger. However, the
listings _ once you get to all of them _ seem fairly complete.
</P>
<P>
   Let's take the same problem _ finding something to do for the
weekend _ to another site. You need to know, as you weigh the
opinion you'll read, that this site is owned by Cox Interactive
Media, which is owned by Cox Enterprises. Cox Enterprises also owns
The Atlanta-Journal Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The site I'm talking about is Access Atlanta. The main site is
at http://www.accessatlanta
</P>
<P>
   .com but, to duplicate our search for weekend entertainment
we'll go to http://www
</P>
<P>
   .accessatlanta.com
</P>
<P>
   /entertainment/calendars. You'll still find various
entertainment events divided in categories: ``Theater,'' ``Dance,''
``Visual Arts,'' ``Classical Music,'' and, among other things,
``Pop Music.'' But there's a shortcut here. Just click on the link
for ``Weekend's Best Bets'' and you'll get a selection of various
events planned for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also be able to choose links for upcoming events _ if you
tend to plan far into the future _ as well as events outside
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's drop in over at Digitalcity Atlanta. (If you live in
another area and it's big enough, there may be a digital city for
you, too.) But we are headed for http://home.digitalcity.com
</P>
<P>
   /atlanta/events/, where the method of finding an event is pretty
nifty. Just use the drop-down menus to select a category, date and
the area (in the case of Atlanta you get two choices: ``Downtown''
or ``North and East'') and press the Find Events button. You can
set the categories for all, if you just want something to do and
don't care if it's a movie or ice skating or a museum exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   On a typical day, the search engine will return 50 or more
events. Then, you'll be able to click on each event listed to get
more detail.
</P>
<P>
   So, now you know how to find out what to do next weekend. Now
all you have to do is find the time and the money to do it.

 &HT;    Embracing our past
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alfred Texeira's parents were part African, part
Portuguese. Both he and his mother could ``pass'' for white. So
when Texeira was drafted into the Army during World War II, he
thought he'd try for a slot in an all-white unit.
</P>
<P>
   But when he was assigned to a post in the Jim Crow South, he
figured he needed to take a safer route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was afraid of being put up on an oak tree,'' he says. ``So I
switched over to black. It upset my mother because she thought I'd
have better opportunities in a white outfit.''
</P>
<P>
   One day as Marlo Smith listened to Texeira's war stories, and
noticed the astonishment on her 10-year-old son's face, she had an
epiphany. She began taking notes, then recording her grandfather's
musings on audiotape or video whenever he got into the mood to
reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   With her first surreptitious scribble, she joined the exploding
ranks of America's family historians, people who've become driven
to make sure stories of ordinary folks like her grandfather don't
die when they do.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired in part by Tom Brokaw's book, ``The Greatest
Generation,'' and a host of other best-selling personal memoirs _
such as ``Angela's Ashes,'' ``The Liars' Club'' and ``Having Our
Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years'' _ many people have
embarked on a quest to preserve their own family histories in a
user-friendly fashion.
</P>
<P>
   They are going beyond the more traditional, but
difficult-to-read genealogical charts in favor of self-published
books and audio- and videotapes they hope will bring their
ancestors to life after the old folks are all dead and gone. Smith
and like-minded others have become writers and moviemakers, even
though their books usually are printed in limited numbers and their
films will be seen only on their families' own TVs.
</P>
<P>
   Many are aging baby boomers _ only now trying to appreciate what
their parents and grandparents endured in the Great Depression and
World War II; many are younger, like Smith, who is 30.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure what's behind this ``outbreak of memoir
fever,'' as the American Association of Retired Persons puts it,
but it may be that families feel compelled to record their unique
histories as an antidote to the anonymity and lack of connectedness
in a crowded, mobile world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the enormous economic changes in the 19th and 20th
centuries, each generation is experiencing a different world, and
there's a lot of displacement,'' says Stephen A. Kowalewski, head
of anthropology at the University of Georgia. ``We move around a
lot, lose our sense of who we are. People seem to find that what
their parents and grandparents have to say is a particularly new
experience, a world we have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``I had a great aunt who died in her 90s, and her
children did one of these living histories. It was really
eye-opening about her way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Kopper, owner of Posterity Press in Bethesda, Md.,
publishes family histories. His take on the new interest in the
field: ``Our values and culture have become so neon that people are
looking for more real, more vital, more humane lives than our own.
People tend to candy-coat the past. These histories tell it like it
was. People perceive now that the real past isn't what we were
taught by TV and the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   Emily Wheeler, 52, began taping aunts, uncles and her parents to
find out about her grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told how my grandmother would take them out and wash
their hair in cold water. I learned the day my grandparents got
married, they got a horse and buggy as a wedding gift. My
grandfather went out and cut down a tree and made a rolling pin,
and I have it today, and it's 75 years old. And it's all on tape.''
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``I want my grandchildren to know where they came from
when they get my age and will tell their grandchildren. I don't
want these things forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Family histories have become such a hot topic that courses are
being taught in colleges and high schools, offering tips to
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Galex of Atlanta, co-owner of Roots &AMP; Wings Life Stories,
which produces family-history videos, teaches occasionally at Emory
University's program for elders on interviewing and recording
techniques. Martha Blow, an instructor at R.D. Head Elementary in
Lilburn, Ga., was recently named the school's teacher of the year,
in part because she requires pupils to interview their elders to
preserve history.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Wearn, 10, son of Mary and James Wearn, earned a 100 on an
assignment from Blow that required him to interview his
grandparents about the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was astonished to learn things like movies cost 25 cents,
popcorn a nickel, and what food they ate and games they played when
they were young,'' says his mother. ``It's very important because
times are changing so rapidly now, so much is lost along the way.
Our children's lives are so filled with video games and TV and
things that are transitory, and sometimes we lose sight of the
history that made us who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy was enthralled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised everything was so cheap,'' he says. ``They
told me they rode on trolleys, and I've never even seen one.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only are individuals compiling books, audiotapes and videos
to pass along to descendants, but the movement has spawned a
fast-growing cottage industry of entrepreneurs who will interview
relatives on tape and put together family history books. Scores
have joined the Association of Personal Historians, a group formed
in 1995, says APH President Bob Joyce of Santa Ana, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with a few and now have 120 members,'' he says.
``But our membership doesn't reflect the numbers involved. It's far
more. The market is just huge. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are hundreds of thousands of people doing this,
most on their own,'' he says. ``Most don't even know there's help
out there, and we can save them a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   The price for such help isn't always cheap, however. Personal
historians who interview relatives of clients charge a few hundred
dollars to $10,000 or more. And those who want books published or
elaborate video productions made can spend many times that much.
</P>
<P>
   Family historians aren't genealogists, says Joyce. ``What we try
to do is capture the real person in his or her own words. We don't
want to change the intent or the meaning. We are careful to try to
keep the voice, spirit, tone and personality of that human being,
so future generations will know them as a real person.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Flowers, a professional family historian and genealogist
with homes in Florida and metro Atlanta, charges $40 an hour for
her work. She says ``family history has become a major hobby,'' and
she is hired by people who ``don't have the patience or have run
into a brick wall they can't knock down.''
</P>
<P>
   She collected information on her own family by interviewing old
relatives, often on videotape, and found out that many older folks
talk about an ``Indian princess'' _ a euphemism used by whites for
``African-American'' _ in their ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father talked about living through the 1926 hurricane in
Miami, crawling out of the house as it collapsed around him, his
time in WWII on Iwo Jima. My mother talked about life on a farm
during the Depression with seven brothers and sisters, how her
father would measure their feet on newspaper and go to town for
shoes before school started.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stories, she adds, are hard to imagine for today, but
they're easier to believe when ancestors _ living or dead _ come to
life on a TV screen. ``I think that passing down the true story of
who my ancestors were, and what they had to say, is the greatest
gift I can leave for future generations,'' Flowers says.
</P>
<P>
   Kopper's Posterity Press prints family histories in varying
quantities. They can cost from ``the price of a used Honda,
$10,000, all the way up to a bloody Maserati,'' Kopper said. ``I
have done some in six figures. We do printings of 250 on up to
about 5,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Galex, a CNN reporter before starting her business in 1992, says
demand for her services has never been higher.
</P>
<P>
   Many people want a book and a video history, and some people are
asking for CD-ROMs. Her rates start at $600 and go up from there
for videos. Workshops aimed at teaching people how to do their own
cost about $75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sit people down and get the family stories. We produce the
family-history videos that weave in the stories of many
generations, with the photos and other images to help illustrate
the stories as they unfold, one generation to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Marlo Smith hopes to finish her book and videos in time for her
grandfather's 80th birthday around Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``His stories are so remarkable,'' she says. ``He tells it like
it was.''
</P>
<P>
   The memories Smith is recording, he says, aren't bitter ones,
just signs of the times.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back, I tried to change my discharge papers to say
I was white and not in the black transportation company I was in,''
he says. ``My mother was very prejudiced, and she didn't want me to
be called a Negro. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were white, you had a better chance; if you were black
or Negro or whatever, it was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Smith: ``This is important for the kids coming up to know
about.''

 &HT;    Power Mac stands out in crowd, distinguished by minitower, speed
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ From the side, it looks like a pillowcase with
handles. This latest desktop computer from Apple continues the
company's renewed emphasis on design.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, this model is called simply (and boringly) the Power
Mac G3. Apple has abandoned, for now at least, giving jazzy new
names to every new model of the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   But the Power Mac G3 is geeky in name only. It looks like no
other computer you've seen before, except for the Apple's runaway
hit, the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Like the iMac, the Power Mac G3's color scheme is iridescent
blue and white. The Power Mac, however, is a minitower and doesn't
include a built-in monitor like the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   And the Power Mac is the fastest Mac yet, offering processing
speeds up to 400 megahertz. There's also 1 megabyte of something
called backside cache, a chunk of memory designed to speed up the
processing power of the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   With the Power Mac, Apple has added a new design concept for
desktop computers. There are four handles atop the minitower, which
give this computer the pillowcase look from the side.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac continues other design changes begun with the iMac
last August.
</P>
<P>
   For one, there's no built-in floppy drive. You can, however,
easily add one in any of the Power Mac's five bays for internal
storage devices. Two of these slots also support Zip drives, CD-ROM
drives and DVD drives.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac is also designed to support USB, the new standard
already in use in PCs for connecting peripheral devices such as
mice and monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the iMac, though, the Power Mac is built for transition.
One slot supports the previous connection standard, so you can use
a current mouse, keyboard or monitor. The Power Mac does come with
the same USB iridescent blue mouse and keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Power Mac is also the first Apple computer to come equipped
with a new technology called FireWire. This is another peripheral
connection technology, and it vastly enhances the ability to
transfer video and audio files to your Mac. You'd use a FireWire
port, for example, to transfer to your Mac images from your
camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   The price of these latest Power Macs ranges between $1,600 and
$3,500, depending on the options you choose. Features such as
internal modems are optional.

 &HT;    Once a novelty, now big business
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Netwatchers are not necessarily Net geeks.
</P>
<P>
   What I know about the Windows 98 operating system you could put
into half of a very small thimble, and I will never understand why
``King's Quest VII'' crashes every time I'm ready to fight the evil
wizards.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a Web surfer from way back _ all the way back to 1994,
to be exact. I read an article about all these neat things you
could see on your computer if you had this gizmo called a
``browser.'' So I got myself one at the local software joint and
installed it on my dumpy little Compaq Presario 486. I ventured out
into the wilds of cyberspace all by myself, with no map, no search
engine and certainly no technical support.
</P>
<P>
   There really wasn't much to look at then, and with a 2,400 bps
modem, if you wanted to look at the cool sites of those days _
HotWired, Pathfinder or the Louve museum _ you needed time, and
plenty of it. My friend Janet called me up after I had sold her on
the virtues of ``that Internet thing'' to complain. ``In the time
it takes me to download Time magazine, I can sit down on my couch
and read Time magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? In those days, she was right.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling somewhat guilty, I felt compelled to help my friends and
fellow Web surfers get the most out of the Web. After all, it was
at my suggestion they were forking over $19.95 of their hard-earned
money each month to stare at their computers and wait for the magic
of the Web to appear before them. In my quest for Web knowledge, I
did the only thing I could think of at the time.
</P>
<P>
   I got a subscription to Wired magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Reading between the lines _ which was pretty much how you had to
read Wired in those days _ I found out that you could get better
computers with faster modems, and there were books that could help
you find Web sites to give you Tarot card readings, Emily
Dickinson's poetry and the contents of a Coke machine in some
building at Stanford University. Not that I had any need to know if
there was any Diet Coke left in some vending machine at Stanford
University, but it was kind of cool to be sitting on the other side
of the country gathering up this kind of information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the days of wandering aimlessly through cyberspace are
gone. More and more users are logging on every day from home and
work. Portals such as Yahoo! and Excite promise to take you to
every Web site worth seeing, and the number of sites grows
exponentially every day.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more retailers, banks, and airlines pour onto the
Web, it's becoming more of a utility than an amusing little hobby.
Everyone wants a piece of your valuable online time and your
valuable off-line money. Web powerhouses like CNN and Amazon.com
would love it if you spent all your online time just visiting their
sites and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Although I have spent more than my fair share of time at Amazon
_ the travel mug/thank you note last Christmas from Amazon's
marketing department was a real wake-up call for me and my credit
limit _ there are other things to do online that are useful and
just plain fun. To miss them is to miss the creativity and
innovation that made the Web worth looking at to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The Web of the 21st century is big business. Everyone from
Disney to Martha Stewart has their own Web page, and newcomers to
the Web are lost even before they start. Companies like Peapod now
will deliver groceries to your front door, and the cable and phone
companies are promising a future filled with ``always on'' Net
access that will eliminate busy signals and the endless downloads
of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, the Web is going to change your life. You may
become a devotee of online shopping, hourly news updates from MSNBC
or sending e-mail to your friends and co-workers. Even if you never
log on, the Web isn't going to go away. You watch your kids bounce
from Web site to Web site from a nervous distance or look at Web
addresses constantly being flashed across your TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a novice Web surfer, the Web was filled with novice
Web surfers. People built Web pages with lists of sites because it
was fun, not to make money, go public, get into mergers and
acquisition or land on the covers of business magazines. In the
last six years the Web has become a business. As consumers we need
to know what's going on out there and how it's going to change how
we use the Web and how we fit it into our lives.
</P>
<P>
   While we try to figure it all out for you, there's lots to do in
the meantime. Why not see how the Coke machines are stocked in New
York and Denmark? (http://www.cc.columbia.edu/(tilde)cocacola/ and
http://

<P>
   amigos12.diku.dk/currentstatus.html, respectively).

 &HT;    PCs too cheap to pass up
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Decisions, decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Charlie Partana says in ``Prizzi's Honor'': Do I ice her?
Do I marry her?
</P>
<P>
   And so it is with computers. Now that the holiday dust has
settled, a question still hangs in the air: Should you trash that
vintage Pentium that's served you so well and buy a newer, faster
machine now that the prices have leveled out a little? Or are you
in it for better or for worse and need to upgrade?
</P>
<P>
   With all the new models on the market creating a glut of
hardware, there's never been a better time to upgrade. I just took
my P166 off life support by adding 48 MB of RAM, a U.S. Robotics
56k modem and a Matrox 8-gigabyte hard drive for $380. (It would
have been cheaper, but I had to pay more than I should have for EDO
RAM because only one store that I could locate had any.)
</P>
<P>
   The result is like getting a new machine _ with a customized OS
and software bundle _ that has a whole bunch of space and memory
and will do anything I need it to do: play the newest games, create
CPU-intensive graphics or use six programs at once.
</P>
<P>
   So, now I don't need to go buy a new machine anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But, I'm gonna get one anyway ... they're just too darn cheap to
ignore.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for a price from the ads on these very pages: A
400-MHz computer with all the trimmings for $650? Add another $200
for a 17-inch monitor, and you've got one heck of a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is, the most inexpensive computers don't use Pentium
chips.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares?
</P>
<P>
   AMD's K6 series of chips benchmark as fast as or nearly as fast
as _ and in some cases faster than _ Pentiums do. Intel's own
Celeron chip is another good alternative to spending an extra
couple of hundred dollars to get the Pentium brand, and all three
flavors are more CPU power than most home users will ever need.
</P>
<P>
   Wait, it gets better. AMD has a K7 at 500 MHz on the horizon,
and Intel is about to offer the Pentium III _ albeit a
controversial chip currently being boycotted by some in the Net
community. (But that's another column.)
</P>
<P>
   The point is that prices on K6s, Celerons and PIIs will probably
drop even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not saying Pentium isn't a good chip to buy _ not at
all. There's no denying that Pentium connotes reliability, well,
except for that little floating point unit screw-up a few years
back. But they are the team to beat on the semiconductor playing
field.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the K6 chips aren't worth considering, either.
In fact, big-name manufacturers _ like Compaq, Hewlett-Packard and
others _ have been selling AMD's K6s for a while, and a hot rumor
around the 'Net is that Gateway 2000 is in talks with AMD about
using its chips in some Gateway systems.
</P>
<P>
   Don't rule out Celeron, either. Initially, these Intel chips
were essentially Pentium IIs without a Level 2 cache created to
counter AMD's cheaper prices. New Celerons _ Celeron (A) _ however,
have an L2 cache and are equal to Pentium IIs running at 66-MHz bus
speeds.
</P>
<P>
   For many people, upgradeability is a factor. Chances are,
though, that by the time you're ready to trade in one of these
300-400 MHz uber-machines, you won't be able to use what's
available then anyway. Your best strategy these days is to approach
buying a new computer as if it were disposable and forget about
upgrading the chip and motherboard down the line. Need a machine
for e-mail and letter-writing? Get a 266-MHz K6-2 and a 15-inch
monitor for slightly more than $500. Need some real power for
graphics and gaming? Go for a 400-MHz Celeron (A) or the new,
speedier PC100 bus with a K6-2 chip and a 17-inch monitor for
around $750.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, you can't go wrong spending the extra money to
buy a Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
   It's just about impossible to go wrong with any of these new
boxes, and the dogfight brewing between Intel and AMD can only make
it better.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, if I didn't know better, I'd say the buyer is in the
driver's seat these days.

 &HT;    Tips offered for speedier 'Net connections
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No matter how fast your connection, the Internet can
move like molasses. It's one of the major frustrations holding back
the development of the 'Net as a commonplace utility.
</P>
<P>
   There are, though, ways to speed up your connection. Read about
them in the March issue of PC World.
</P>
<P>
   The article also compares the benefits of various new connection
technologies, such as the telephone company's digital subscriber
lines and cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   The March issue of PC World also includes a list of what it
considers the top PCs. It offers several lists of 10.
</P>
<P>
   There's the top 10 desktop computers, the top 10 laptops and the
top 10 home PCs. For example, as the top home PC, the magazine
names Dell's Dimension XPS R450.
</P>
<P>
   ON CD-ROM
</P>
<P>
   Well, at long last it's here. Maxis has finally released the
next version of its popular ``SimCity'' game.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``SimCity 3000,'' the game offers better graphics, more
complexity and more control over your urban simulation. ``SimCity
3000'' was more than two years in the making. Maxis had originally
planned to give the game a 3-D perspective and let users view their
cities from street level. But that approach was abandoned midway
because it demanded more computer firepower than most home
computers could muster.
</P>
<P>
   For younger kids, there's a series of four new education games
released by Knowledge Adventure. The titles, part of the
``JumpStart'' series, are ``Reading for Second Graders,'' ``Learn
to Read,'' ``Math for Kindergartners'' and ``Math Mystery.'' These
games are designed to help kids master reading and math skills. The
games are all available for both Macs and PCs, if they have Windows
95 or Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   Scuba diving enthusiasts can now read the popular magazine of
the sport, Skin Diver. The online version of the magazine offers
most of the same content as its printed counterpart. You'll also
find some games and the opportunity to buy scuba equipment and
trips online. This site is at http://www.skin-diver

 &HT;    Atlanta No. 5 city in Net use
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The City Too Busy To Hate apparently spends a lot of
its free time on the Internet. A study by Inteco, a Connecticut
market research firm, found metro Atlanta the fifth most wired
community in America.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of metro Atlanta adults regularly access the
Internet, according to the study. Oakland, Calif.; Orange County,
Calif.; Seattle; and Washington, D.C., placed first through fourth.
After Atlanta come Dallas, Houston, San Diego, Phoenix and
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The company sampled 16,500 American households in December. The
study found about 55 percent of the adult U.S. population _ 108
million people _ had hopped on the Internet at least once in the
previous 30 days. The December numbers were up 38 percent from May
1998 and 71 percent from September 1997.

   In a 1996 study of Internet use, Atlanta placed seventh behind
San Jose, Calif., Boston, Denver, Dallas, New York and Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who use the Internet, 76 million have access from home,
51 million from work, 22 million from a friend's or relative's
house, and 24 million use computers at a school, library or
community center. The bulk of Internet users, 77 percent, are
between 18 and 49 years of age, according to the study.

   OFF-BRAND CAN BE OK
</P>
<P>
   We are, increasingly, a nation of billboards. Clothes with
company names are considered cooler than those without. FamilyPC
magazine, in its March 1999 issue, takes a look at the issue of
brand names as related to technology products. It attempts to
answer this question: When it comes to computers, is
label-consciousness anything more than simple vanity?
</P>
<P>
   The article looked at a Compaq PC and a computer from Comtrade.
Compaq is a well-known brand, Comtrade lesser known. The comparison
looked at comparably priced systems. Both were about $2,100.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq was considered far easier to set up and use. It comes
complete with a poster detailing the set-up procedures, and the
article gave the poster high marks. Compaq's system comes with
color-coded ports and cables, so matching cable and port is no
tougher than plugging a blue into a blue. The software that came
with the Compaq was rated better, and the service supporting the
computer and reliability of the system was rated higher. The
Comtrade machine got rave reviews for its core components, its
multimedia parts and its performance.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that off-brand systems offer more
performance and better features than similarly priced name-brand
machines. But big-name machines offer more attention to detail and
polish. If you are someone who is comfortable with computers and
not afraid of risk, the no-name machines would be a safe buy. If
you're a PC novice, a more user-friendly name-brand system might be
the best option.
</P>
<P>
   No-name brands included in the article are Comtrade, http://
</P>
<P>
   comtrade.com; emachines, http://www.e4me.com; Gazelle computer,

   CUSTOMIZED TICKETMASTER
</P>
<P>
   Ticketmaster is trying to get into the Internet portal business.
</P>
<P>
   The ticket broker launched a customizable Web site that lets
users create profiles, at http://
</P>
<P>
   my.ticketmaster.com. The profiles, in turn, are used to provide
a listing of the concerts and sporting events that should appeal to
you.
</P>
<P>
   The new site lets you see the view you'd have from any seat in
75 different venues, in virtual reality 3-D images. The site also
offers event times, directions to the venue and information about
parking.
</P>
<P>
   The site works best with Intel Pentium II-class processors. A
400-megahertz processor is recommended, but a 200-MHz machine will
work as well.
</P>
<P>
   My Ticketmaster is part of the regular Ticketmaster site,
http://www
</P>
<P>
   .ticketmaster.com. The company said online ticket sales have
averaged more than $10 million per month the past 21 months.

 &HT;    Virtual birds, dating tips come courtesy of e-mail
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a moment of abject stupidity, which is several
degrees dumber than my normal state of simple stupidity, I allowed
the whole world of public relations agents to access my e-mail
address.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, my mailbox is constantly stuffed with rubbish that
I never read past the first paragraph; at times the subject heading
is enough to prompt erasure.
</P>
<P>
   But every so often come gems of such surpassing brilliance that
I cannot but share them with you. The first came from an
all-purpose flack, or public relations agent, from whom I hear
several times weekly. Now, I did not make up what follows; I
haven't changed a word of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you can have a personal computer valet,'' he writes. ``For
under $100, you can command an animated parrot with built-in speech
recognition to navigate PC programs, monitor stocks, call friends
and associates over the Internet via a built-in Internet phone,
issue meeting reminders, warn of unexpected events on the stock
market and report news and weather. It is called Prody. If you
don't have a best friend, this is the closest thing to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can arrange a demo.''
</P>
<P>
   Not for me, you can't. I've had parrots. Parrots have large,
cruel beaks. They have voices, equaled only by those of a couple of
White House reporters I once knew, capable of cutting through a
quartet of jackhammers. I once observed a parrot clamber down from
its perch, work its way to the top of our breakfast table, sidle up
to my father's dinner plate and seize his hamburger steak. Dragged
that ground beef all the way back to the edge of the table and was
about to heave it over the side when Dad caught on.
</P>
<P>
   My computer gives me enough trouble now. I sure don't need it
coming on with a virtual parrot screeching, ``Prody wants a
megabyte!'' I don't have many friends, and I doubt I would keep
them by having my virtual parrot call them up at odd hours.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do I want ornithological hysteria the next time my 401(k)
takes a torpedo amidships.
</P>
<P>
   The same day I was offered a parrot demo, I got a book
announcement. The book is entitled ``How To Juggle Women,'' and
that intrigued me, because even after a year on the Internet this
is a fetish I'd never discovered.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, I misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This book is an essential guide for the seasoned dating man
who needs help organizing the women in his life,'' the announcement
said. ``Women are constantly grabbing your interest and attention.
Do you have to choose one over the other? Of course not! Stop
letting opportunities like these go to waste. Why not date them
all?
</P>
<P>
   ``You will learn time-saving techniques that will maximize your
availability, and allow you to spend time with several ladies a
day. The author details scheduling methods so you never have two
dates at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, women are certainly grabbing my interest and attention all
the time, and I could use some help organizing the women in my
life, chiefly my wife. My daughters and my granddaughters seem
pretty well organized.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the book will be of little use, since my dating
days ended 42 years ago this week, and I was scarcely what you'd
call seasoned. I manage to spend time with several ladies a day,
usually without making any of them mad, and without having to get
involved in tedious things like dating. They're friends, and as
long as I don't unleash virtual parrots upon them or buy books on
girl-juggling, they may remain so.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane S. Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: We have a visually impaired student at our
middle school for whom we would like to borrow a three-dimensional
model of both the male and female reproductive systems to aid with
her instruction during the Human Growth and Development course. Can
you help us find a source? _ Mary Beth Huba, librarian
</P>
<P>
   A: The best I could do is the HEALTH EDCO catalog from WRS
Group, which makes the models. Call (800) 299-3366 for a catalog.
The ones I did locate must stay on premises, but perhaps your
student could make a field trip.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My dishwasher is apparently turning my new stainless
tableware dark. This is Oneida stainless, not the cheap stuff. Any
suggestions? _Georgia Reed
</P>
<P>
   A: Stainless, not stain-proof. The discoloration could be caused
by any number of things _ tea, coffee, vinegar, salt, etc. Pitting
and spotting may also be caused by hard water. Oneida recommends a
stainless cleaner to keep the flatware looking its best. One note
of caution regarding dishwashers and stainless steel: Oneida
advises customers to avoid detergents containing lemon. For more
information call (800) 877-6667. Q: Could you help me find the
elusive owner of a business that owes me compensation? _M. Baker
</P>
<P>
   A: The secretary of state's office, corporate division, provides
such information at 463-5555 or via e-mail, at
corpinfo(at)sos.state.tx.us. You may obtain the company's
registered agent, directors, addresses, date of incorporation, etc.
You may not be given the owner's name but you will have the name of
the president _ often the owner.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our baby sitter went home to Venezuela for Christmas. There
has been some problem with her student visa and she can't return to
the states now. How does one go about becoming a sponsor for
someone to be a citizen? _S.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``There is no way for a nonrelative U.S. citizen to 'sponsor'
a foreign national for U.S. resident status or citizenship,'' says
Paul Parsons, an attorney board-certified in immigration and
nationality law. As part of the student visa application, a student
must convince a U.S. consular official that she can afford to study
in the United States without working unlawfully and that she
intends to return to the home country upon completion of the
studies. Reliance on U.S.-citizen friends for financial support
undermines both assertions.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news? ``Baby-sitting and other off-campus work is
normally unauthorized employment and a violation of student
status,'' says Parsons. Exceptions are made for changed
circumstances (currency devaluation, parent's loss of employment,
etc.). To seek U.S. citizenship, a foreign national must first
qualify for U.S. resident status and then wait five years to apply
through a process known as naturalization (only three years if
married to and residing with a U.S.-citizen spouse). Q: I'm
interested in learning how to draw like they do in Marvel-like
comic books. I have called comic book stores, commercial artists,
but none of them has what I'm looking for. _Zack Schenkkan
</P>
<P>
   A: Pick up a copy of ``Draw the Marvel Comics Super Heroes''
from Klutz Press _ that should give you a place to start. Local
classes are often given in the summer by cartoonists. Q: Why are
all the Subway sandwich shops that awful shade of yellow? Either
someone got ahold of some really cheap paint or they want you to
get out of there real fast. _Erin R.
</P>
<P>
   A: That yellow obviously works for Subway, which grew from Fred
DeLuca's one shop in Bridgeport, Conn., 30-plus years ago to nearly
13,600 worldwide now. In the QSR world (restaurant speak for
``quick service restaurant''), identification with the original is
the key to success. Hard to miss that yellow. Jim Huntley, local
Subway representative, says inspectors drop by to make sure each
franchise has not deviated from the prescribed decor. And yes, some
commercial designers admit colors are chosen to get the customer in
and out of fast food restaurants quickly. Q: What is the correct
Roman numeral for 1999? ESPN shows ``MCMXCIX,'' which is 1,000
followed by 100 less than 1,000, then 10 less than 100, then 1 less
than 10. What is wrong with ``MIM,'' which is 1,000 followed by 1
less than 1,000? _N. McConnell and K. Meyer
</P>
<P>
   A: MIM is acceptable today, according to Roger Osborn, professor
emeritus of mathematics at the University of Texas. Not always so.
In Julius Caesar's day, Roman numerals were strictly additive.
(Here's a primer for the novices: M &QC; 1,000, D &QC; 500, C &QC; 100, L &QC; 50,
X &QC; 10, V &QC; 5, I &QC; 1. Bonus: a bar over a Roman numeral multiplies it by
1,000.) So 1999 would have been correctly written MDCCCCLXXXXVIIII.
In the Middle Ages, convention allowed for the subtractive
principle, so nine could be written IX (one from 10) instead of
VIIII. Subtraction was permitted as long as numbers were within two
Roman numerals of each other _ i.e., you could subtract X (10) from
L (50) and C (100), but not from D (500). In the past 50 years or
so, subtracting any Roman numeral from another has been accepted.
``Only an absolute purist would disagree with MIM,'' notes Osborn.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who was Bluegrass Roy? As a youngster I used to tune in to a
powerful little five-watter station from Nashville ( I believe) and
listen to this country-western singer. _Jaim Barr
</P>
<P>
   A: Bluegrass Roy was born Edward Leroy Freeman, according to
Skip Ogden of iBluegrass Magazine. The singer started his radio
career in Kentucky and traveled wherever his sponsor, Hamlin Oil,
sent him. Hamlin was a medicinal oil. For information on iBluegrass
Magazine, check out www.ibluegrass.com or call (252) 243-8700. Q:
We have a great view of the University of Texas Tower and
especially enjoy seeing it bathed in orange. Is there a key to
understanding what excites the tower light person to make that
happen? _Ed Nichols
</P>
<P>
   A: The complete tower turns orange with the number 1 lighted
when a Longhorn team wins an NCAA championship and to mark
achievement as determined by the university president. Variations?
Completely orange tower: a Big 12 team championship, defeat of
Texas A&AMP;M in football, an NIT championship, commencement, March 2
and July 4. Tower shaft white, observation and column decks orange:
football victories other than A&AMP;M, Big 12 tournament victories in
basketball and baseball, other postseason tournament wins, and on
Easter, Memorial Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas. White tower,
alternately orange and white observation and column decks: ties for
an NCAA team title, Big 12 championship or football game. Does your
view include the Erwin Center? It's orange after basketball
victories.

   LANE-COLUMN _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ One
way for Congress to regain a few of the approval points it
squandered on the impeachment debacle would be to do something

 &HT;    Frequent fliers fume for fairness
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ One way for Congress to regain a few of
the approval points it squandered on the impeachment debacle would
be to do something about air travel. To talk to a frequent flier is
to open yourself to hair-raising tales of hardy souls braving
discomfort, dislocation and airline treatment that can border on
false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.) have taken
such action in proposing a Passenger Bill of Rights. I would give
up my aisle seat to them. The bill would force airlines to admit
when they overbook and give the real reasons they bumped you. It
would also make it easier and faster for passengers to get refunds
of tickets.
</P>
<P>
   These things are good as far as they go, but something more is
called for. We don't need a few more regulations. We need a
movement. We need a stirring document setting forth the basic
rights that Nature's God bestows on anyone with an airline ticket.
We need a real statement on passenger rights to which travelers can
rally as they storm the ticket counters and barricade themselves
behind vinyl chairs in terminal lounges.
</P>
<P>
   Something like this:
</P>
<P>
   The Passenger Bill of Rights
</P>
<P>
   Preamble: We, the airline passengers of North America, are not
animals, we are human beings. Most of us, at least. Many of us
don't want to be on your stupid ol' airplane, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   1. We have the right to the entire can of soda. Don't you try to
pour that Coke into three cups for three passengers. We demand the
cup and the rest of the can, too. With ice.
</P>
<P>
   2. We have the right to breathe air that is 20 percent oxygen.
Nothing less. Canaries in cages should be posted in conspicuous
locations so passengers can note when they keel over for lack of
breathable air.
</P>
<P>
   3. We have the right to remain silent. Don't even try to wake us
up before we land.
</P>
<P>
   4. We have the right to eat peanuts. Crackers and stale pretzels
are not valid substitutes. On long flights, mystery meat will be
provided for all carnivorous passengers.
</P>
<P>
   5. We have the right to confront ticket agents. Announcing
flight cancellations and then clearing out all employees is an
invitation to civil insurrection. Passengers are due a living,
breathing human face to yell at.
</P>
<P>
   6. We are three-dimensional beings with the right to take up
space. We may be taller than average, we may be wider than average,
we may even wear overcoats: it's not our fault. Roller coasters,
vintage spacecraft and many swing-sets have bigger seats than
today's airliners.
</P>
<P>
   7. Anyone under 6 must get a plastic pilot's-wings badge. Girls,
too. No exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   8. No airport hot dog should ever cost more than $5.00. Even
with chili on top.
</P>
<P>
   9. We have the right to bring on as many things as we can stuff
into one overhead compartment, no matter how hard we have to push
to get it all in. If the door closes, it's legal.
</P>
<P>
   10. We have the inalienable right to a decent cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   11. Detroit Airport will be razed and salt will be sown into the
soil where the terminal used to be. It is necessary as a warning to
others.
</P>
<P>
   12. We have the right to television-free sections in all
terminals, no matter what the contract with CNN says.
</P>
<P>
   13. Each terminal in a major metropolitan area shall have at
least one (1) dimly lit bar that will be open late, staffed by a
sympathetic bartender who speaks in a thick accent associated with
that airport's geographic region. On a bad trip, it might be our
only feeling having been somewhere away from home.
</P>
<P>
   14. We have the right to air-terminal phone booths with seats.
</P>
<P>
   15. Passengers stuck on the runway for long periods of time have
the right to receive mail and packages from home. International
humanitarian agencies have the right to inspect conditions.
</P>
<P>
   16. We have the right to see our suitcases again, or any parts
of them that might be handy.
</P>
<P>
   These are not outrageous requests, but throughout history,
revolutions have been founded on people's more basic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Things are getting ugly near the baggage-claim area. And even
extra peanuts may no longer quell the angry masses.

 &HT;    FIRST LADY AS CANDIDATE RAISES LEGAL ISSUES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, seriously considering a run
for the U.S. Senate in New York next year, will have to consult
more than public opinion polls. The first lady's first-of-its-kind
candidacy would raise novel legal questions for attorneys to sort
out.
</P>
<P>
   As she hits the campaign trail, would Mrs. Clinton take her
usual entourage of White House staff and Secret Service agents,
whose traveling expenses would be charged to taxpayers? If so,
would her campaign have to defray some of the costs?
</P>
<P>
   Could she shuttle to and from New York aboard her Air Force jet,
and from speech to speech in a motorcade of government cars? And
could she justify the public costs by adding non-partisan ``first
lady'' appearances to her campaign travels?
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mrs. Clinton is planning extensive travel on behalf of
the president's Social Security and Medicare proposals and to
promote historic preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be pretty much new territory,'' said Ian Stirton,
spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, which oversees
campaign election laws and financing. ``I imagine a lot of lawyers
will be working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has begun that work yet, according to the first lady's
press secretary Marsha Berry, who agreed that the legal research
would be needed if Mrs. Clinton decides to become a candidate. But
``none of that has happened,'' said Berry, because ``she's not
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is urging
the first lady to seek a Democratic seat being vacated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, spokeswoman Kerin Polla also acknowledged
the unanswered legal points. ``It's never been done before,'' she
said of having a first lady as candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a president running for re-election, the rules
are fairly well established, said the FEC's Stirton. The taxpayers
get the bill for the security, the limousines and the jet
designated Air Force One that always accompany the chief executive.
Political parties pay a small portion of the enormous costs of a
president's fund raising or political travels.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady's situation is less clear, since she holds no
constitutional position, Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other potential issues, the Clintons have built up an
extensive list of well-wishers and others on a White House computer
database. Could the first lady use that information to raise money
or build support for her Senate campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``If some of the cost was generated by taxpayer dollars, there
could be problems,'' Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the fact that Mrs. Clinton does not live in New York
is hardly a problem at all. The residency requirement for Senate
candidates in the state is so lenient that she need only establish
an address there by election day. In recent decades, New Yorkers
have elected two senators, Robert F. Kennedy and James Buckley, who
had very shallow roots in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Published news reports already have Mrs. Clinton's agents
scouring Manhattan's posh West Side for an apartment, amid denials
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has offered no hints on what her boss will do. ``Everybody
just needs to relax,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said Sunday on ABC-TV's
``This Week'' that Mrs. Clinton is ``going to talk to the people
who have been urging her to run, think about it. But I will tell

   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Sitting on a bamboo-slatted bench, widow
But Lin crumbled dried lumps of cooked rice in a basket and talked
about what she wants to happen to the Khmer Rouge leaders who
brutalized her country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we arrest them, we should cut off their heads,'' said the
52-year-old. ``In fact, if they asked me to do this, I am willing
to do it myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost six children from starvation and my husband and parents
were killed,'' she went on. ``I am still alone today. We cannot
forget that regime. No Cambodian people can forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an outburst seemed incongruous from this fragile-boned
woman in simple clothes and rubber sandals, a poor woman who saves
burned rice.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the Khmer Rouge fell from power, a day of
judging them approaches. But Lin hopes it will put her anger to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   A United Nations team of three legal experts is scheduled this
month to recommend to Secretary General Kofi Annan whether to start
action against the remaining Khmer Rouge leaders living openly in
Cambodia. Some form of international tribunal likely will be
proposed to hear evidence against the men who masterminded the
madness that left as many as two million Cambodians dead in less
than four years, from 1975 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all Cambodians, including the leaders of this wary
country, view the prospect of trials with the same longing as the
widow But Lin.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe that only justice can release the ghosts
shackling their country often fear justice well might bring new
dangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be cautious and consider how to avoid a civil war
before holding any trial,'' said Sau Sisovanna, a Cambodian
economics professor and government adviser, who sadly described
Cambodians as ``hostages to fear.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that 3,500 wiry guerrilla fighters finally abandoned
their Khmer Rouge jungle camps this month, switching allegiance and
uniforms to the Cambodian army, provided little relief from that
fear.
</P>
<P>
   These were believed to comprise the last sizable groups of
hard-line rebels holding out in jungle military bases. Cambodian
defense officials hailed their ``integration'' into the regular
army as the final dissolution of Khmer Rouge power.
</P>
<P>
   Yet photos of a ceremony in Anlong Veng, a rebel center in north
Cambodia, showed some fighters putting on their new army uniforms
over their old guerrilla fatigues.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambodia Daily quoted one ex-guerrilla as pronouncing in one
breath, ``The Khmer Rouge is dead,'' but in the next adding that he
would keep his old uniform ``just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rebel commanders among the defecting troops were not
convinced they would remain government adherents, admitting they
would be tempted to go back to the bush if their old Khmer Rouge
leaders called on them for support.
</P>
<P>
   The key leaders now are living openly in Pailin, a town on the
Thai border the government virtually ceded them as an enclave when
they began agreeing to lay down their weapons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   These are the men most likely to face any international
judgment, and some have made it clear they will not do so quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Senior leader Leng Sary, once the number three Khmer Rouge
commander, warned that any trial could have disturbing
consequences. His new political union in Pailin issued a statement
that ``in order to make our nation live in peace'' the courts
``should not try this or that person.''
</P>
<P>
   Khmer Rouge were ultra-Maoist communists, who emptied the cities
and forced Cambodians into groveling peasant lives. They killed
almost one-sixth of the population through execution and torture,
and left others to die from starvation, exhaustion and disease.
</P>
<P>
   The Khmer Rouge were ousted when Vietnamese troops swooped into
Cambodia in 1979, but thousands who were not killed or captured
continued fighting from jungle hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Most Cambodians interviewed believed the remaining Khmer Rouge
could not mount a large-scale civil war today, but feared they
could cause plenty of trouble in an unsettled, poverty-stricken
nation that can only pay its teachers the equivalent of (US)$20 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small troops cannot make war, but small troops with a will to
survive, to save their lives, could be a terrible source of
suffering for the country,'' said Ok Serei Sopheak, coordinator of
the Cambodian Center for Conflict Resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Cambodia's autocratic Prime Minister Hun Sen has tried to break
the back of Khmer Rouge power by luring leaders and fighters to
defect from their fighting units and peacefully rejoin society,
demanding no accounting from them for the bloody tyranny they
imposed.
</P>
<P>
   His policy of appeasing them finally drew protests at home and
abroad last December, when two of the last major Khmer Rouge
leaders left their jungle hideouts. The prime minister treated them
like visiting dignitaries and suggested the past should be
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   After a public outcry, Hun Sen has vacillated over whether and
how the Khmer Rouge should be tried. Even if there is an
international tribunal, Cambodian government accord will be crucial
to making it work.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe a trial is essential not only to reconcile the
past, but to assure the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture of violence is in the mentality of our people,''
said Thun Sary, 47, the president of a Cambodian human rights group
called Ad Hoc(CQ). ``Impunity is the precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes a trial of Khmer Rouge principals is necessary if
Cambodia ever hopes to rein in its rogue police and military who
still torture and kill, if it expects to end official corruption
and judicial partiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still feel, 'If we have the force, we can do
anything,''' he said. ``We need to do something about this case.''

<P>
   The End.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Well, OK. It's not the end.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate's acquittal of President Clinton on two articles
of impeachment voted by the House of Representatives means that
Clinton will not be removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   It does not mean, however, that we have heard the last of the
scandal that led to impeachment _ not by a long shot. The saga of
Monica and Bill is an industry, a self-sustaining media/political
phenomenon that has yet to run its course.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, independent counsel Ken Starr is still in
business. He reportedly believes that he has the authority to
indict Clinton before the president leaves office. A criminal
prosecution could keep the scandal fires burning until January 2001
_ and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   For another: Does anyone imagine that the many all-Monica
all-the-time TV programs will just turn off the lights and close up
shop? Is there any reason to suppose that anyone involved with the
scandal will resist the urge to write a book?
</P>
<P>
   Why, Monica Lewinsky's ex-friend Linda Tripp celebrated the end
of the impeachment trial by sitting down for an interview with The
New York Times and launching a tour of the TV talk-show circuit.
Tripp turned up Friday on ``Today.'' Next up: ``Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere that Linda goes, James Carville is sure to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today'''s Katie Couric asked Carville _ Clinton's star
defender and chief Starr antagonist _ if he would bury the hatchet
after the president's acquittal in the Senate. Carville said sure,
he'd be glad to bury the hatchet _ bury it in Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Figuratively speaking, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melrose Place'' might be on its way to the TV graveyard, but
the soap opera in Washington is going strong. Maybe Geraldo Rivera
will add Heather Locklear to his stable of sassy blond
commentators.
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed the scandal's latest episode, Clinton
prevailed by plenty in Friday's Senate vote. The first article of
impeachment prompted only 45 guilty votes as 10 Republicans joined
the Senate's 45 Democrats to give Clinton a walk on perjury
charges. On the second article, obstruction of justice, all 45
Democrats and five Republicans voted not guilty for a 50-50 tie
that deprived prosecutors of the simple majority they desperately
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The ``House managers,'' as the prosecutors were called, knew all
along that they would never drum up the 67 votes they needed for
conviction. But they could have claimed a moral victory if at least
51 senators had voted to remove the president.
</P>
<P>
   With the votes finally counted, some senators wanted to
``censure'' Clinton _ which means that even though they let him
keep the keys to the Oval Office, they wanted to adopt a formal
resolution expressing their disapproval of the president's behavior
during and after his fling with Lewinsky. Texas Sen. Phil Gramm
scuttled that effort by moving to table the censure proposal
``indefinitely'' _ which means ``forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gramm believes that censure is unconstitutional and a waste of
time. He has a point.
</P>
<P>
   The time to censure the president would have been late last year
when many members of the House _ Republicans as well as Democrats _
were eager to avoid impeachment proceedings. At that point, Clinton
probably would have signed on to a harshly worded rebuke, and all
concerned could have washed their hands of the whole deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton-haters in the House and their Clinton-hating
constituents back home wanted no part of censure. They wanted
impeachment _ and they had the votes to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't have the votes to do was convict Clinton and
remove him from office once the impeachment moved to the Senate for
trial. The president needed 34 votes to beat the rap; it was
obvious to anyone with half a brain that he had them.
</P>
<P>
   The trial was pointless. The outcome was predetermined.
</P>
<P>
   But the outcome was valid. Most Americans didn't want Clinton
removed from office, and he wasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's get back to the scandal.

CALIFORNIA'S HWY 1 BENDS, DOESN'T BREAK

<P>
   BIG SUR _ Tough little ribbon of asphalt, that Highway 1.
</P>
<P>
   Subjected to a savage beating by the torrential storms of last
winter, it barely flinched. The winding coastal route, though
exhibiting scars of abuse here and there, is as spectacular as ever
as it picks its way through canyons and along cliffsides on its way
north from San Luis Obispo to Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   And the fact that it is still standing _ still !ital!open!off! _
has to rank as something of a miracle in light of what the little
highway has been through.
</P>
<P>
   By this date last year, Highway 1 had been effectively closed
for business for two weeks, destined not to reopen until the end of
May. El Nino's fury _ and the slides of mud and debris it unleashed
_ had seen to that. There were numerous washouts along the route,
including some locations where vast stretches of roadway simply
plunged down hillsides toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   The community of Big Sur, for years a magnet for society's
escapees (both short term and long), was utterly stranded, its
residents forced to live on stored supplies, its businesses denied
their lifeblood of tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, a journey up Highway 1 was undertaken
last month with a degree of trepidation. Would there be rickety
suspension bridges thrown up by the Army Corps of Engineers? Would
there be boarded-up businesses in Big Sur and in the tiny
settlements of Gorda and Lucia to the south?
</P>
<P>
   The concern proved to be wholly unwarranted: The route was found
to be flourishing, perhaps because it has had so much practice
weathering natural disasters during its 62-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the 19th major closure we've had in the last 27
years,'' said Ken Wright, who settled in Big Sur nearly 30 years
ago after falling in love with the place while patrolling Highway 1
as a California Highway Patrol officer. ``The road is built on the
edge of a continent. The continent moves. There are fault lines.
Construction methods in the 1930s were not as wonderful as they are
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the frequency of natural havoc _ the gamut includes
fire, rain, earthquake, landslide, flood _ ``the people who choose
to live in this community know the potential of adversity facing
them,'' added Wright, who today owns the Glen Oaks Motel. ``And it
brings them together.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Big Sur was sorely tested by this last incident.
</P>
<P>
   The glib reaction from Los Angeles might be that the road
closures resulted in perilous shortages of psyllium husks, Spa
Therapy Dead Sea Mud &AMP; Mineral Care ginger-thyme bath gel and
replacement parts for ancient Volkswagen camper buses (unofficial
count over two days of travel between Cayucos and Carmel: 27
buses).
</P>
<P>
   But this was serious stuff. Several elderly residents had to be
evacuated in National Guard helicopters. Some schoolkids had to be
quartered in Carmel, away from their parents. Replacement supplies
were obtained only with interminable convoys that were escorted
through construction sites and along treacherous stretches of road.
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, for 16 solid weeks of winter, there was not a
single tourist dollar to be had.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody went through a tight squeeze, and I think
everybody is still scrambling,'' said Laura Moran, manager of
Deetjen's Big Sur Inn and president of the local Chamber of
Commerce. ``One of the things we were a little afraid of was that
the negative publicity was going to be out there and people would
change their plans, (that) even when the highway opened up, they
would say, `Forget it, we're not going there.' However, the people
came. Lots of people came.''
</P>
<P>
   They're still coming. The route experienced a boom summer in
1998 and thus far is experiencing a strong winter, according to
several local leaders. Moran said she knew of only one business
closure. And a survey of lodging establishments revealed that there
has been no compulsion to discount accommodations to spark tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers seem to be naturally lured to this coastal route. For
good reason: It has undergone little change in appearance during
its lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Disdaining the current interstate preference for plotting the
straightest distance between two points, this road instead follows
every contour of the terrain, tucking inland to negotiate a canyon
thick with Monterey cypress and redwood, then bending back to hug
the edge of a coastal precipice. Rising here, plunging there.
</P>
<P>
   The infrequent dwellings are positioned discreetly out of view,
just below the lip of a cliff, or high up the mountainside,
camouflaged in stands of trees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the obvious marketability of this scenery, the land has
remained sparsely settled. Blissfully so. The coastal vistas are
nearly identical to the ones encountered by the first travelers of
the road in the '30s.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, Highway 1 is aswarm with cars, but the drive might be
even more appealing in the quiet of winter, when the air is chilly
and damp and the Pacific Ocean particularly tempestuous, frothing
over the jagged rock gardens below.
</P>
<P>
   For the traveler from the Los Angeles area, perhaps the best way
to approach a short getaway along Highway 1 is to overnight in one
of the communities 200-plus miles north of L.A.: San Luis Obispo,
Morro Bay, Cayucos, Cambria. This allows an entire day to proceed
on to Big Sur or Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a drive that should ever be rushed.
</P>
<P>
   Many visitors seem to regard this journey as if they were aboard
a train, content to keep moving and take in the views from their
car windows.
</P>
<P>
   A preferable course is to drive it slowly, yielding often to the
northbound speed demons who forgot to leave their wristwatches at
home. It is also advisable to pull off the highway and park often,
even when there is not something specific to take in.
</P>
<P>
   On the trip last month, the rewards in such instances were
numerous. Sea lions assembled on a rocky beach below, sending up
such a cacophonous bark, you'd have thought the Alpo delivery had
been delayed to the kennel. A red-tailed hawk glided in the
updrafts just below the cliff edge. An otter floated on his back
and fussed with some shellfish morsel he'd plucked from the kelp.
Monarch butterflies created a bright-orange flurry as they took
flight in a grove of eucalyptus.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year, if you're really lucky, you might even catch
sight of a migrating whale offshore. (Binoculars should be at the
very top of your packing list.)
</P>
<P>
   There also is no shortage of opportunity to stretch the legs on
a short hiking trail. Partington Cove is an excellent example.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find it 1.8 miles north of the entrance to Julia Pfeiffer
Burns State Park. On the northwest corner of the highway bridge
over Partington Creek, a fire road descends the canyon to a rocky
beach below. At one point, a trail fork to the left crosses the
creek via footbridge and then traverses a 100-foot tunnel to a
sheltered cove, where entrepreneurs in the late-1880s loaded
redwood and tanbark into ships moored below. Remnants of the crane
they used still stand.
</P>
<P>
   The entire round-trip walk, including a side trip to the beach,
is less than a mile.
</P>
<P>
   But this drive is rewarding even for those not inclined to
wander. All that's needed to appreciate its unique beauty is to
pull over at one of the many turnouts along the road and simply
linger over the sights directly below or in either direction along
the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime travelers of Highway 1 will continue to delight in such
diversions, but the scenes of devastation and the ongoing repairs
to the road are likely to be jarring to the eye. There are
disfiguring scars on hillsides above the road, heaps of rubble
beneath it.
</P>
<P>
   And traffic lights. Honest. As it turns out, the highway's
bridges were ticketed for seismic retrofit in the wake of the Loma
Prieta earthquake of 1989, and the work, launched immediately after
the storm repairs of '98 were completed, has reduced the passage to
one lane at several spots.
</P>
<P>
   But given what Highway 1 endured last winter, it's probably
remarkable that the road is passable at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most widespread damage to Highway 1 since it was
opened in 1937,'' said Val Houdyshell, a Caltrans spokeswoman based
in San Luis Obispo. ``There were over 40 major damage sites and
many more smaller damage sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with El Nino's onslaught, the 1930s construction,
weakened by the years, didn't stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The sites of the worst trouble bear names right out of the
apocalypse: Hurricane Point, Double Gulch, the Bull Pen and the
aptly named Duck Pond. The details of the ravages are sobering:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; At the Duck Pond, 27 miles north of San Simeon, a hillside
saturated by rain broke loose and slid toward the ocean. The
massive slide extended 345 vertical feet and took out nearly 500
feet of highway.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; At the Bull Pen, 13{ miles south of Carmel, two 36-inch
culverts made of corrugated tin _ 1932 vintage _ became clogged
with hillside runoff, creating a 15-foot-deep lake on the east side
of the roadway. When Caltrans cleared the blockages, the force of
20,000 gallons of water ripped the culverts apart as if they were
soup cans. Some 10,000 cubic yards of road bed _ and a good chunk
of the southbound lane _ tumbled away in the gush.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Slightly farther south, at Hurricane Point, the road bed
also gave out in a mudslide. Twice during the repair operation,
subsequent slides tumbled into the construction site. Twice the
highway had to be rerouted, and it now lies 60 feet east of its
original course.
</P>
<P>
   By the time all the repair work was completed, $32 million had
been spent on the 70-mile damaged stretch, according to Houdyshell,
and the equivalent of 130,000 truckloads of dirt, rocks and debris
had been removed or shoved aside.
</P>
<P>
   Big Sur and the other stranded highway communities felt a severe
pinch with the loss of business to the road closures, and at least
one proprietor was squeezed right out.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Sunquest, who operated an American Indian art gallery at
the north end of Big Sur, spent a recent January afternoon loading
her inventory into cardboard boxes. Wiped out by the revenue losses
of '98, she said she is moving inland _ far inland, to northern New
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   After the road opened in May, she said, there was a drastic drop
in the number of day-trippers from the north traveling the highway.
``There was a perception that waits (at the seismic retrofit sites)
were long, when in reality they were not that long,'' Sunquest
said. ``Unfortunately, perception became reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunquest, her voice cracking with emotion, added, ``I'm the one
affected now, but I don't know how many others will be affected by
another hard winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, however, the winter has been delightfully mild,
business has been steady and strong, and the distressing memories
of the winter of '98 fade by the day.
</P>
<P>
   It undoubtedly helps that Big Sur pulled through its ordeal with
a tenacity and community spirit that has become well-honed.
</P>
<P>
   Sal Abaunza ran a San Francisco hotel before taking over as
general manager of Big Sur's upscale Ventana Inn last March. He got
a jolting introduction to the realities of life in the region:
Abaunza required a helicopter for his first day's commute, and he
met his neighbors over potluck dinners of emergency provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very awed by the community, how it rallied,'' Abaunza
said. ``It's close-knit. Having grown up in San Francisco, and
having seen this camaraderie ... it was like `The Waltons';
everyone knows everyone by their first name.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Sutton arrived in the area 25 years ago and scraped out a
living until he could find gainful employment _ first as a state
park ranger, later as a motel manager. He said, ``You can be
incredibly poor, really on the fringe, and not feel like you're
homeless. Nobody looks down on anybody. The community extends a
little farther here.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an element of the indomitable spirit of Big Sur, and
currently it seems to be shared by travelers on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   At Hurricane Point, where it looks as if the entire hillside
above the road were scraped clean and then spray-painted green by
an unseen hand, an older man pulled into a turnout, completely
ignored this desecration to the east and fixed his gaze on a vast
sweep of ocean and an imminent sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Much farther down the highway, at the site of the massive Duck
Pond slide, a couple was spotted near a giant pile of asphalt and
two Caltrans bulldozers. They, too, seemed oblivious to the
wasteland behind them as they peered down at the surf pounding the
rocks, and hugged.
</P>
<P>
   Ignore the unpleasant. Concentrate on the beauty. Weather the
worst.
</P>
<P>
   The highway, which has gotten a lot of practice at this, would
be proud.

   BIG SUR _ If Valentine's Day has gotten you in the mood for a
romantic escape _ and if cost is not a pressing issue at the moment
_ the posh Ventana Inn has a lodging option that might be difficult
to resist.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Sur House.
</P>
<P>
   Haven't heard of it before? Don't be embarrassed. That's by
design.
</P>
<P>
   You're not likely to find the Sur House while casually strolling
the 243 acres of Ventana's hillside resort on California's Central
Coast; no sign, no markers have been constructed to provide
direction to it. Neither will you locate it on the map that is
given to guests at check-in; this place is so exclusive it has been
left off the map.
</P>
<P>
   If you book it, you're shown the way to it, and thereafter it's
your own little secret.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a free-standing, two-story structure of rough cedar,
with polished knotty-pine floors. About 1,000 square feet. With a
fireplace in the open-beam living room, a full kitchen, and a king
bed in the loft bedroom. Its west-facing windows offer commanding
views of the Pacific Ocean. And on its very own redwood deck, there
is a hammock, chaise lounges for sunbathing ... and a swirling,
104-degree spa that would comfortably seat eight.
</P>
<P>
   Secluded? You can't imagine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have people who come here basically to disengage, to relax,
to rejuvenate,'' said Sal Abaunza, general manager of the Ventana
Inn. ``Two days will restore that. We're very sensitive to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort _ with its Japanese baths, clothing-optional sun
decks, four-star restaurant and brochures that strongly and
unrepentantly urge you to leave your kids at home _ has a
well-earned reputation for providing delicious tranquillity for
those who have been worn to a nub by their big-city jobs. But the
Sur House carries the concept to a lavish extreme.
</P>
<P>
   It might be advisable to clear some room under your credit-card
ceiling, though. The Sur House rents for $725 a night, compared
with $340 for a standard room at the Ventana.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what you get for that.
</P>
<P>
   After check-in, a bellman hops into a golf cart and asks you to
follow him in your car. After a while, he turns up a winding,
unmarked road and pulls to a stop at what appears to be a townhouse
in the woods. After showing you around _ the ready-to-light
firewood stack in the fireplace, the control for the jets in the
spa, the dimmer switches for just about every light in the place _
he takes off, and you're on your own. Delightfully so.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they'll bring breakfast to you in the morning, so you can
sip coffee and work on the standard Big Sur fare (granola, fruit,
plain yogurt, muffins) while the sun streams onto your deck. And if
you're not up to walking in the dark to the restaurant for dinner,
they'll send a golf cart to shuttle you.
</P>
<P>
   Words most commonly uttered in the Sur House: !ital!I could get
used to this.!off!
</P>
<P>
   Before long, you're mentally calculating what it would set you
back to lounge here for a week. Perhaps because it takes so little
time to feel settled in.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the deck, about a third of a cord of firewood is neatly
stacked, eagerly waiting to attack the damp coastal chill. Next to
the hearth, a bookcase holds a generous supply of Book of the Month
Club hardbacks, from romance novels to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and
James Jones.
</P>
<P>
   The interior decor is more rugged than rustic: overstuffed
couches, rattan chairs, casement windows, foot-square ceramic tiles
in buckskin hues.
</P>
<P>
   A vine, planted long ago at the corner of the house, has had its
tendrils trained to grow just beneath the upstairs windows, so that
when you look out on the ocean it is framed by a riot of
bright-green, waxy leaves. Even from the bathroom basins, the view
is breathtaking (which can be a bit perilous when you're brushing
your teeth).
</P>
<P>
   About the only drawback to the Sur House is its proximity to the
only road into the resort. A tall hedge shields you from prying
eyes, but the sound of vehicles climbing the mountain penetrates
this divider without much difficulty _ especially at about 7:45
a.m. when the resort employees come streaming onto the job.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not likely to be too great a nuisance, since the
eyelids tend to get heavy early in the evening in such environs.
</P>
<P>
   The place has the general feel of an exotic treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   On the final morning of a recent stay, when a deer wandered to
within 20 feet of the front gate, it became obvious the impression
is a universal one.

   LOS ANGELES _ Just how much do we love our pets? A doggone lot,
according to a handful of separate surveys. Here are some of the

</P>
<P>
   _ 28 percent of dog owners have dressed their dog in clothing;
47 percent of those owners say they dress Fido or Fluffy up for
Halloween or Christmas; 8 percent change their animals' clothing
with the seasons.
</P>
<P>
   _ 76 percent use a special voice to speak to their pets.
</P>
<P>

   _ Cats are the favorite pet, outnumbering dogs, 59.1 million to
52.9 million. Families also owned 12.6 million birds, 4 million
horses and an undetermined number of snakes, lizards and ``pocket
pets,'' which include gerbils, hamsters and guinea pigs, according
to the American Veterinary Medical Association.

   _ Marketing pet products is big business. In 1992, pet retailers
hawking everything from premium food to kitty litter, from dog

   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Opening day at Three Dog Bakery in Old Pasadena was a testament
to man's weakness for his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tasty treats are the product of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
operation that opened its 16th branch in Pasadena on Jan. 30 at the
One West Colorado pedestrian mall. And nearly 4,000 people and 800
dogs came the first day to sample the goodies, said co-owner Mark
Bodnar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shoulder-to-shoulder and haunch-to-haunch,'' Bodnar
joked. ``When we opened, Pasadena went to the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Dog Bakery _ founded in 1992 by Mark Beckloff, an
ex-accountant, and Dan Dye, a former copywriter _ specializes in
dog treats made from ingredients humans can enjoy, too. Seven years
later, the duo has licensed 15 stores across the country, and plans
to open another 10 in the next two months, including one March 6 in
West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are encouraged to bring their dogs in so they can pick
out their own treats and chow down right in the store. On the menu
at each Three Dog Bakery are treats like Boxer Brownies and Bulldog
Bars ($3 each) and Pup Tarts (50 cents). For $200, an owner can buy
his dog a specially made, sugarless birthday cake. Within a few
months, the bakeries will also offer $2 servings of pet ice cream
with a yogurt base.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it is healthful, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eating healthier,'' said Beckloff, ``and we think
it's a way to show their dogs that they care about their health,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Three Dog chefs are working on perfecting cat treats, but
... well, cats are more finicky about taste than dogs, Beckloff
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem Bob Ditchik is trying to solve at his Pet
Greetings firm, based in Westlake Village. The company makes
rawhide greeting cards _ available for $2 at many pet stores and
veterinarians' offices _ that dogs love to chew on, but he hasn't
been able to perfect a card that appeals to cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it, though,'' he said. ``People want to have
treats for all their animals. That's why people like our cards.
With a regular card, the owner reads it, but the dog gets nothing.
With our card, the dog gets to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal lover, Ditchik said his one regret is that constant
business travel keeps him from having a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty empty when you get home,'' he said. ``There's
something about a pet that brings a feeling that somebody's there
waiting for you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking care
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone will open a pet rental service that'll deliver a
pet of your choice to your home to greet you with loving kisses
when you return from a long trip. Sound far-fetched? Maybe. But if
pet lovers demand it, you know someone out there will one day offer
it.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew 20 years ago that the human obsession with pets would
spawn pet sitters? It didn't take long for the 2,800 licensed,
bonded sitters in the United States, Canada, England and a few
European countries to organize themselves into a group called Pet
Sitters International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your pet is your surrogate kid, so why wouldn't you hire a
professional to take care of it?'' said Kay Calzolari, spokeswoman
for the North Carolina-based organization. ``Used to be, if you
were away from home, you'd hire the kid down the street to feed the
dog, but that kid has grown up and turned pet-sitting into a
profitable business.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of pet owners hire sitters when they're away
from home, Calzolari said. That translates into 13.5 million home
visits a year, most at a rate of $12 to $15 a visit _ a $162
million to $202.5 million annual business.
</P>
<P>
   (Pet owners can avoid a pet sitter's bill for the day on June 25
by observing Take Your Dog to Work Day, sponsored by PSI.)
</P>
<P>
   And all this spending doesn't end when it's time to tell our
pets that final goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   When death comes, many people provide their pet one final bit of
pampering with a satin-lined coffin and burial at Los Angeles Pet
Memorial Park in Calabasas, Southern California's oldest pet
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1928, more than 40,000 pets have been buried on rolling
hills covered with animal sculptures, stuffed animals, pet toys,
flowers and colorful whirligigs. Those who lie there range from the
famous _ MGM's Leo the Lion, Hopalong Cassidy's horse and Rudolph
Valentino's Doberman _ to family dogs and cats, rabbits, snakes and
an occasional guinea pig. Burial costs range from $200 to thousands
of dollars for large animals or elaborate services.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Newth, an actress and cemetery board member, has buried
two of her dogs _ Alfie and Spooky _ in a plot that has room for
nearly a half-dozen more pets. Losing her dogs _ in particular,
Alfie, a 70-pound golden retriever/collie mix, who suffered from
lymphatic cancer _ has been one of the most devastating things in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was like ``losing anyone in your life that's important to
you. I felt the same as when my father died, but it's a different
kind of missing,'' said Newth. ``An animal is there for you 100
percent, shares in your sorrows and plays with you and depends on
you to take care of it. It's like a child that never grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people never really recover from a pet's death, said Encino
family therapist Zoe Sager, who leads pet grief support groups. (To
join, call (818) 754-1550.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With people that we lose, there are a lot of unresolved
issues, unresolved grief,'' Sager said. ``With a pet, we just seem
to love them so much unconditionally. Of all the relationships we
have, our relationship with a pet is probably one of the purest.
That's why we miss them so much when they're gone.'' &QL;

VETS DO MORE THAN EVER FOR AILING PETS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hunting dogs don't lie around doing nothing. And
Travis certainly fit that profile _ until a little more than a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 9{-year-old Hungarian Vizsla appeared in pain, but his
owners never would have guessed Travis had swallowed a pair of
nylon stockings and that the hosiery had lodged in his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Goodwein of Van Nuys rushed his dog to a 24-hour emergency
room that Sunday morning, worried, scared and willing to pay
whatever it took to make Travis healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, Goodwein would have had nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, serious medical treatment _ and even visits to
the doctor _ were pretty much just for humans. A cat or dog chewed
up in a fight might get a few stitches, but mostly pets simply
lived and then died.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the same miracles of modern medicine that cure humans
of cancer, let them live longer lives with heart or kidney disease,
or at least exit life relatively pain-free are available to pets.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to surveys, more than 10 percent of owners also
have tried massage therapy, and 9 percent have tried
holistic/homeopathic remedies for their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners are taking advantage of medical advances to keep
their four-footed friends alive and well, with the average family's
veterinary bills rising from $131 in 1991 to $186 in 1996,
according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency clinics generally are even pricier _ at least 30
percent more expensive than regular vets.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwein isn't much concerned with cost when it comes to his
pet: ``They'll send me the bill, and whatever it is, I'll pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in good company. According to the American Animal Hospital
Association, 38 percent of pet owners surveyed say they'll even go
into debt for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that people care more for their pets now,'' said
Dr. Garth Peterson, who's practiced for 30 years at McClave
Veterinary Hospital in Reseda. ``But they definitely love them, and
they want to do whatever they can for them, including treatments
that just used to be for humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fluffy and Fido can now benefit from everything from
anxiety-ending tranquilizers to cancer treatments, from new
heartworm remedies to kidney transplants, from a new doggy
Alzheimer's drug to limb-saving orthopedic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There's even pet CPR.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, nearly 2,000 pet owners have been
trained in animal first aid, including pet cardiopulmonary and
mouth-to-snout resuscitation, at Encino-based ABC Rescue's classes.
(To sign up for a class, call 818-780-7860.)
</P>
<P>
   The classes work, said ABC owner Craig Jones, who contracts with
the American Red Cross to offer the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases of people bringing their dogs and cats _
as well as lizards and chickens _ back from the brink of death,''
he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Need a specialist?
</P>
<P>
   Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals, is where
more than 5,000 families a year turn when their pets are diagnosed
with life-threatening cancers and other serious ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen doctors _ 13 of them specialists in neurology,
orthopedics, oncology, ophthalmology, radiology, cardiology and
nephrology (kidney disease) _ plus 65 nurses and technicians care
for cats and dogs in the 65-cage hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of care is expensive; a course of radiation treatments
for a pet with cancer can cost $3,500, and chemotherapy can run an
additional $2,000. Sometimes, there are miraculous cures _ dogs
brought in comatose from a brain tumor who scamper home happily
after surgery, cats with kidney disease who leave with a
transplanted organ, perky and purring again.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees, said VRA administrator Mark Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be just adding six months to an animal's life, and we
tell the owners that up front. But they're willing to spend the
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sad is that we have people who come in who can't pay,
and it's really upsetting because they'd really like to save their
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter pet medical insurance, one of the newer offerings in the
pet care market.
</P>
<P>
   As new ways are found to lengthen pets' lives, some pet owners
are investing in insurance that covers pacemakers and heart
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, bone replacement surgery and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Stephens is president and founder of Anaheim-based
Veterinary Pet Insurance. Opened in 1982, it's America's oldest and
largest pet insurance company, with more than 850,000 clients and
backed by more than 800 veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums run from $99 to $300 or so a year per pet but cover
medical procedures costing thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saving animals that mean a lot to their owners,''
Stephens said. ``People realize the love that a pet gives and want
to return that with good medical care. There's no reason anymore to
put a pet to sleep when the owner wants to use modern technology to
keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 2 percent of 1,252 respondents to an American Animal
Hospital Association 1998 pet owner survey said they have health
insurance for their pet, nearly two-thirds said they would spend
$1,000 or more to save their pet's life, whether it's a family pet
or a show animal.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, show-dog breeder Stephanie Archuleta &UR;  &LR; of Palmdale
took her 3-year-old prize-winning cocker spaniel, Mishka, in to
have his chronically swollen tonsils removed, an operation not
often performed on dogs. The surgery cost $85.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen tonsils don't ``affect Mishka's looks, but if he's not
feeling well, then the dog show is a no-go,'' she said. ``And he's
the love of my life. The money I'd spend on him is limitless. He
deserves that, and the reason is that he gives me 150 percent _ and
why should that not be returned?''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the pet scale, Geraldine Horvill recently
spent $600 for her 6-year-old Pomeranian, Foxy, to have her teeth
cleaned and X-rays taken of a gimpy back leg. Her vet told her
she's looking at a much bigger bill _ perhaps into the thousands of
dollars _ for surgery to correct Foxy's leg problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Reseda widow can ill afford a big vet bill but says she'll
spend whatever it takes to have her companion well again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very expensive, but I figure I have to,'' Horvill said.
``If you don't take care of 'em, you don't have 'em anymore. And
she's my pal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ER for animals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same rule that says you'll have a flat if there's no spare
tire in your trunk seems to decree that a pet will become sickest
after your veterinarian's office closes for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Without 24-hour emergency clinics _ the first one opened 1974 in
New York City _ pets must suffer, and their owners must worry,
until Monday morning when their regular vet's office opens.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time pet owners resort to an emergency clinic,
usually the animals already have been ill for a while, said Dr.
Daniel Grayson, manager of the Animal Critical Care and Veterinary
Specialty Center in Woodland Hills, where Travis was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's 3 in the morning, and it's an emergency,'' Grayson
said. ``Usually when an animal looks sick, it's pretty far along.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the center spent five hours in surgery with Travis,
pumping him full of antibiotics to fight infection. Travis made it
until Wednesday, when he slipped into a coma and died. Through
their grief, his owners are full of praise for the emergency room
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very compassionate _ with both Travis and us,''
Goodwein said, choking back tears. ``They did good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing pets die is the hardest thing about being an emergency
vet, said Grayson.
</P>
<P>
   And telling owners the sad news can be even harder, especially
today, when most people think of their pets not as animals, but as
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 5:30 in the morning; his wife had just left him, his
father had died six months ago, his mother was dying of cancer, and
now his dog was sick,'' Grayson said, recalling a young man with a
12-year-old dog who came to his clinic recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left her here, and she seemed fine,'' the vet said. ``All
of a sudden, she absolutely crashed, and we weren't able to bring
her back. That was about the hardest phone call I've ever had to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The brighter side of medical advancement for pets is that better
veterinary care, better diet and recent medical advances have all
combined to allow pets _ like humans _ to live longer than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   But that also means veterinarians who were trained to give
rabies shots and do minor surgery must learn to recognize
unfamiliar symptoms in geriatric animals, said Dr. Patrick Melese,
director of Veterinary Behavior Consultants in San Diego and one of
the few certified animal behavior specialists in California.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction
syndrome _ a canine ailment that in many ways mimics Alzheimer's
disease in humans _ all occur in dogs over 8 years old _ an
estimated 6.5 million in America, Melese said. And millions more
aging cats are susceptible to feline leukemia, feline AIDS and
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back 20 years ago, dogs used to die from being hit by a car.
They didn't live as long, and we didn't know as much,'' he said.
``Today, we can increase animals' life span, and we can keep them
healthier longer. People expect that of us. And they should.''

21 YEARS, 21 BEERS: HOW FOOLISH CAN YOU GET? (For use by NYTimes
News Service clients) 
By JACK Z. SMITH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On my 21st birthday, I did something I would never do now.
</P>
<P>
   I drank 21 beers.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I hadn't heard the term ``alcohol poisoning.'' I
didn't realize the danger in drinking so much. Fortunately, I drank
the beer over a long period, probably 10 hours or more, while
attending a college journalism conference.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I drink 21 beers? Perhaps to impress my peers with what
a macho, swinging guy I was. Perhaps to squelch my social
insecurities and fit in with other imbibing students. Perhaps to
see if I could drink that much.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it was incredibly stupid, as I realized the next
morning when a fierce hangover laid me low. I didn't comprehend how
lucky I was. Had I drunk a little harder and faster, I could have
been dead.
</P>
<P>
   These days, on the cusp of 50 and eagerly awaiting my AARP card,
I'm Mr. Moderation. Nine days out of 10, I have a single cold one
after I get home from another brutal day at the keyboard. A
drinking binge is now two beers.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't thought about that 21st birthday for years. But tragic
events of recent days dredged up memories.
</P>
<P>
   At Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station, an 18-year-old
student died from head injuries after falling three stories in a
school parking garage. Police said he had more than twice the legal
limit of alcohol in his system.
</P>
<P>
   At Southwest Texas State University in San Marcos,
administrators suspended 12 fraternities after out-of-control
drinking at weekend frat parties. One student, an 18-year-old
graduate of Fort Worth's Paschal High School, was hospitalized for
severe alcohol poisoning and ``almost died,'' said Jim Studer,
Southwest's vice president of student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A 21-year-old fraternity pledge was beaten to death at a frat
house in the wake of another party that included heavy drinking.
The prime murder suspect, a 21-year-old former Southwest student,
shortly thereafter committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the nation, binge drinking on college campuses is a
chronic problem, as documented in studies by the Harvard School of
Public Health. The consequences can be disastrous _ students
killing themselves or others in car wrecks, students engaging in
unprotected sex or becoming victims of date rape, or students
flunking school because drinking becomes a bigger priority than
hitting the books.
</P>
<P>
   How do you stop the problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the $64 million question,'' said Angie Taylor, director
of alcohol and drug education at Texas Christian University in Fort
Worth. ``If we knew the answer, everyone would be doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taylor and Southwest's Studer say colleges can reduce the
problem by various means. There can be tough punishment for
fraternities or other organizations that foster unbridled drinking;
education programs to inform students about alcohol's dangers; and
individual counseling for problem drinkers wanting help.
</P>
<P>
   Parents can help by setting ``some real clear expectations as to
what's acceptable and unacceptable behavior,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   For parents, being a good role model ``is more important than
anything,'' she said. If Dad gets smashed every weekend, he'll have
much less credibility in admonishing Junior not to drink
excessively at college.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has been dismayed to learn of some parents asking
resident assistants in dormitories where their newly enrolling son
or daughter can get fake IDs to buy booze.
</P>
<P>
   A major contributor to runaway student drinking is a ``cultural
perception'' that ``that's what you do when you're in college,''
Taylor said. ``We call that the `Animal House' mentality,'' she
said, in reference to the 1978 John Belushi comedy featuring
raucous frat boys.
</P>
<P>
   TCU is launching a new program that will utilize student
athletes to warn against heavy drinking and help counter the idea
that it's cool to get plastered.
</P>
<P>
   After the 18-year-old Aggie student fell to his death on Jan.
30, my oldest daughter, Amanda, a junior at A&AMP;M, reported on the
tragedy for the school newspaper. She has friends who drink but has
always personally shunned alcohol and seems acutely aware of its
perils.
</P>
<P>
   She turns 21 this year. I'm thankful that she's smarter than her
old man.

<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly two centuries have passed since
George Washington _ after being bled by would-be healers and
prophetically reviewing his will _ whispered `` 'tis well'' and
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved mansion beside the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the bicentennial year of Washington's death on Dec. 14,
1799, the keepers of his historic homestead and his legacy are
fearful that the Father of His Country is being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors to Washington's carefully maintained
plantation has stagnated, and many schoolchildren are shockingly
ignorant about the life and times of the Revolutionary War
commander and the nation's first president, said Michael Quinn,
programs director at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters don't even know the boyhood legend of young
George declaring ``I cannot tell a lie'' and admitting to chopping
down his father's favorite cherry tree, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask people if they've ever heard of George Washington and
the cherry tree and they say 'No','' marveled Quinn, recalling the
familiar but apocryphal tale.
</P>
<P>
   So, seeking to restore Washington to his traditional place of
``first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen,'' the directors of Mount Vernon have begun a $3 million
campaign to spread his story far and wide during the bicentennial
year of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The effort features new programs, a re-enactment of his funeral
at Mount Vernon and a traveling exhibit of 100 artifacts ranging
from his infamous false teeth (made of ivory, not wood) to a
miniature replica of his home. This ``Only in 1799'' collection
will be at the Atlanta History Center from Oct. 14, 1999, until
Jan. 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also have set up new Internet web sites
(www.gwashington1999.org and www.mountvernon.org) and contacted
communities across the country about staging their own
commemorations.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's bicentennial events officially opened on
Presidents Day (Washington's real 267th birthday is tomorrow) and
will continue into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create a nationwide buzz about George Washington,
Quinn explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Washington's death, there was a remarkable
outpouring of emotion throughout the new nation. President John
Adams _ Washington's successor _ issued a proclamation that every
American wear a black armband for 30 days and most of the citizens
willingly complied, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daughters of the American Revolution later did an historic
fashion study that showed most American women wore black mourning
dresses throughout the year of 1800, he said. Over 150 communities
staged their own funerals for this first national hero.
</P>
<P>
   The official funeral was held at Mount Vernon on Dec. 18, 1799.
From his deathbed, Washington had issued emphatic orders that he
not be entombed for at least three days. There was a widespread
fear of premature burial at the time. Washington also looked over
his last will and testament during the long day on his deathbed. He
died in the early evening of suffocation _ stricken by quinsy, an
abscess of the throat.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of her husband's final day at his bedside,
Martha Washington said ``all my trials are over'' after seeing his
life slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall follow soon,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   She died three years later and is entombed next to her husband
in the Washington family vault.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Dandridge Custis had been a widow when she married George
Washington in 1759. She had two children at the time but the couple
would have no offspring of their own. Mount Vernon was inherited by
Bushrod Washington, nephew of the first president, after Martha
Washington died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1853, Washington's heirs sold 550 surrounding acres, the home
and outbuildings, and the tomb of George Washington to the Mount
Vernon Ladies Association _ one of the nation's earliest historic
conservation groups. The national organization has maintained and
preserved the place with private money ever since. Authentically
restored to its original appearance, Mount Vernon is open to the
public every day and close to a million people visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   However, annual attendance peaked at 1.3 million visitors in the
1960s. Now Mount Vernon's directors are hoping the bicentennial
year activities will inspire greater interest and enthusiasm about
the master of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable controversy over maintaining historical
purity, Mount Vernon was air-conditioned last year. One result of
the new, high-tech climate control was that collectors and museums
across the country were no longer afraid to lend back artifacts
that had been taken from Mount Vernon over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington's home is now even more stocked with stuff that
was there when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following his death, the law required that an inventory be
taken,'' said curator King Laughlin. That room-by-room accounting
of objects ``provided a virtual snapshot'' of what was in Mount
Vernon at the time and where everything was placed. Thousands of
those artifacts are now displayed in their rightful setting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's library is now _ as it was then _ ``crammed full''
of books and chairs and maps and letters and a globe and 12
telescopes and ``a small arsenal,'' said Laughlin. Washington kept
seven rifles, several pistols, swords and ``a small cannon'' in the
room, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the cannon to fire friendly salutes at ships passing
by'' on the Potomac, Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge table in the main dining room is arranged with 20 place
settings of the Washingtons' favorite china and silverware. The
first First Couple entertained often. In the Blue Room, a parlor
Washington called ``the best room in my house,'' the family's
gaming tables are set up with their chess set and playing cards.
The first president was an enthusiastic gambler. Among the displays
are lottery tickets that he signed.
</P>
<P>
   The upstairs bedroom is like it was the day Washington died.
There are even dark stains on the rug. Nearly a third of
Washington's blood, believed to be diseased, was drained in his
physician's effort to save his life. Curators considered piping in
odors but decided that authenticity couldn't be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias Lear, Washington's friend and secretary, was at his
bedside for most of his final day. During the bicentennial year, a
new multi-media presentation entitled ``Washington No More'' and
based on Lear's detailed account of those dramatic hours will be
shown in a theater built in the historic greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be provided black armbands for a new ``Death and
Funeral Procession Tour'' that will follow the route of cavalry,
Masonic brethren, family and friends from the dining room where
mourners viewed the casket to the tomb where he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dec. 18, there will be a televised re-enactment of
the full funeral.
</P>
<P>
   During February, in observance of Black History Month, a daily
30-minute guided tour is focusing on the lives and contributions of
the slave who built and maintained the plantation home of the
Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mount Vernon Museum has been renovated and filled
with new artifacts, including furnishings from Washington's
presidential office in Philadelphia (the White House was not
finished until after he left office) and a carefully restored bust
of Washington cast in 1785 by French sculptor Jean-Antonine Houdon.
The terra-cruda(cq), or unfired clay, bust was made from a plaster
mask that Washington wore, and it is said by historians to be
supposed to be his best likeness.
</P>
<P>
   After layers of white paint were removed from the bust,
Washington ended up having a smaller nose and ears than had been
seen earlier, said Meg Craft, the curator restoring the bust.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's director James Rees hopes the bust and the rest
of the bicentennial campaign will help correct the ``travesty'' of
how little most people know about ``the man who led our country to
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one ``well-spoken adult'' visitor who asked a guide,
``Where's the mountain?'' The guide thought the visitor was
referring to the Blue Ridge Mountains but the tourist said, ``No,
the mountain with all of the presidents' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourist had confused Mount Vernon with South Dakota's Mount
Rushmore, Rees said.

<P>
   After considerable controversy over maintaining historical
purity, Mount Vernon was air-conditioned last year. One result of
the new, high-tech climate control was that collectors and museums
across the country were no longer afraid to lend back artifacts
that had been taken from Mount Vernon over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   So Washington's home is now even more stocked with stuff that
was there when he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Following his death, the law required that an inventory be
taken,'' said curator King Laughlin. That room-by-room accounting
of objects ``provided a virtual snapshot'' of what was in Mount
Vernon at the time and where everything was placed. Thousands of
those artifacts are now displayed in their rightful setting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's library is now _ as it was then _ ``crammed full''
of books and chairs and maps and letters and a globe and 12
telescopes and ``a small arsenal,'' said Laughlin. Washington kept
seven rifles, several pistols, swords and ``a small cannon'' in the
room, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used the cannon to fire friendly salutes at ships passing
by'' on the Potomac, Laughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The huge table in the main dining room is arranged with 20 place
settings of the Washingtons' favorite china and silverware. The
first First Couple entertained often. In the Blue Room, a parlor
Washington called ``the best room in my house,'' the family's
gaming tables are set up with their chess set and playing cards.
The first president was an enthusiastic gambler. Among the displays
are lottery tickets that he signed.
</P>
<P>
   The upstairs bedroom is like it was the day Washington died.
There are even dark stains on the rug. Nearly a third of
Washington's blood, believed to be diseased, was drained in his
physician's effort to save his life. Curators considered piping in
odors but decided that authenticity couldn't be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Tobias Lear, Washington's friend and secretary, was at his
bedside for most of his final day. During the bicentennial year, a
new multi-media presentation entitled ``Washington No More'' and
based on Lear's detailed account of those dramatic hours will be
shown in a theater built in the historic greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be provided black armbands for a new ``Death and
Funeral Procession Tour'' that will follow the route of cavalry,
Masonic brethren, family and friends from the dining room where
mourners viewed the casket to the tomb where he was laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dec. 18, there will be a televised re-enactment of
the full funeral.
</P>
<P>
   During February, in observance of Black History Month, a daily
30-minute guided tour is focusing on the lives and contributions of
the slave who built and maintained the plantation home of the
Washingtons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Mount Vernon Museum has been renovated and filled
with new artifacts, including furnishings from Washington's
presidential office in Philadelphia (the White House was not
finished until after he left office) and a carefully restored bust
of Washington cast in 1785 by French sculptor Jean-Antonine Houdon.
The terra-cruda(cq), or unfired clay, bust was made from a plaster
mask that Washington wore, and it is said by historians to be
supposed to be his best likeness.
</P>
<P>
   After layers of white paint were removed from the bust,
Washington ended up having a smaller nose and ears than had been
seen earlier, said Meg Craft, the curator restoring the bust.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's director James Rees hopes the bust and the rest
of the bicentennial campaign will help correct the ``travesty'' of
how little most people know about ``the man who led our country to
liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one ``well-spoken adult'' visitor who asked a guide,
``Where's the mountain?'' The guide thought the visitor was
referring to the Blue Ridge Mountains but the tourist said, ``No,
the mountain with all of the presidents' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   The tourist had confused Mount Vernon with South Dakota's Mount
Rushmore, Rees said.

<P>
   MOUNT VERNON, Va. _ Nearly two centuries have passed since
George Washington _ after being bled by would-be healers and
prophetically reviewing his will _ whispered `` 'tis well'' and
died in an upstairs bedroom of his beloved mansion beside the
Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the bicentennial year of Washington's death on Dec. 14,
1799, the keepers of his historic homestead and his legacy are
fearful that the Father of His Country is being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors to Washington's carefully maintained
plantation has stagnated, and many schoolchildren are shockingly
ignorant about the life and times of the Revolutionary War
commander and the nation's first president, said Michael Quinn,
programs director at Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
   Today's youngsters don't even know the boyhood legend of young
George declaring ``I cannot tell a lie'' and admitting to chopping
down his father's favorite cherry tree, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask people if they've ever heard of George Washington and
the cherry tree and they say 'No','' marveled Quinn, recalling the
familiar but apocryphal tale.
</P>
<P>
   So, seeking to restore Washington to his traditional place of
``first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his
countrymen,'' the directors of Mount Vernon have begun a $3 million
campaign to spread his story far and wide during the bicentennial
year of his death.
</P>
<P>
   The effort features new programs, a re-enactment of his funeral
at Mount Vernon and a traveling exhibit of 100 artifacts ranging
from his infamous false teeth (made of ivory, not wood) to a
miniature replica of his home. This ``Only in 1799'' collection
will be at the Atlanta History Center from Oct. 14, 1999, until
Jan. 6, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also have set up new Internet web sites
(www.gwashington1999.org and www.mountvernon.org) and contacted
communities across the country about staging their own
commemorations.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Vernon's bicentennial events officially opened on
Presidents Day (Washington's real 267th birthday is tomorrow) and
will continue into the new century.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to create a nationwide buzz about George Washington,
Quinn explained.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of Washington's death, there was a remarkable
outpouring of emotion throughout the new nation. President John
Adams _ Washington's successor _ issued a proclamation that every
American wear a black armband for 30 days and most of the citizens
willingly complied, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Daughters of the American Revolution later did an historic
fashion study that showed most American women wore black mourning
dresses throughout the year of 1800, he said. Over 150 communities
staged their own funerals for this first national hero.
</P>
<P>
   The official funeral was held at Mount Vernon on Dec. 18, 1799.
From his deathbed, Washington had issued emphatic orders that he
not be entombed for at least three days. There was a widespread
fear of premature burial at the time. Washington also looked over
his last will and testament during the long day on his deathbed. He
died in the early evening of suffocation _ stricken by quinsy, an
abscess of the throat.
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of her husband's final day at his bedside,
Martha Washington said ``all my trials are over'' after seeing his
life slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall follow soon,'' she predicted.
</P>
<P>
   She died three years later and is entombed next to her husband
in the Washington family vault.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Dandridge Custis had been a widow when she married George
Washington in 1759. She had two children at the time but the couple
would have no offspring of their own. Mount Vernon was inherited by
Bushrod Washington, nephew of the first president, after Martha
Washington died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1853, Washington's heirs sold 550 surrounding acres, the home
and outbuildings, and the tomb of George Washington to the Mount
Vernon Ladies Association _ one of the nation's earliest historic
conservation groups. The national organization has maintained and
preserved the place with private money ever since. Authentically
restored to its original appearance, Mount Vernon is open to the
public every day and close to a million people visit each year.
</P>
<P>
   However, annual attendance peaked at 1.3 million visitors in the
1960s. Now Mount Vernon's directors are hoping the bicentennial
year activities will inspire greater interest and enthusiasm about
the master of the manor.
</P>
<P>
   After considerable controversy over maintaining historical
purity, Mount Vernon was air-conditioned last year. One result of
the new, high-tech climate control was that collectors and museums
across the country were no longer afraid to lend back artifacts
that had been taken from Mount Vernon over the centuries.

VETS DO MORE THAN EVER FOR AILING PETS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hunting dogs don't lie around doing nothing. And
Travis certainly fit that profile _ until a little more than a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 9{-year-old Hungarian Vizsla appeared in pain, but his
owners never would have guessed Travis had swallowed a pair of
nylon stockings and that the hosiery had lodged in his intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Goodwein of Van Nuys rushed his dog to a 24-hour emergency
room that Sunday morning, worried, scared and willing to pay
whatever it took to make Travis healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   A few decades ago, Goodwein would have had nowhere to turn.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, serious medical treatment _ and even visits to
the doctor _ were pretty much just for humans. A cat or dog chewed
up in a fight might get a few stitches, but mostly pets simply
lived and then died.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the same miracles of modern medicine that cure humans
of cancer, let them live longer lives with heart or kidney disease,
or at least exit life relatively pain-free are available to pets.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to surveys, more than 10 percent of owners also
have tried massage therapy, and 9 percent have tried
holistic/homeopathic remedies for their dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Pet owners are taking advantage of medical advances to keep
their four-footed friends alive and well, with the average family's
veterinary bills rising from $131 in 1991 to $186 in 1996,
according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency clinics generally are even pricier _ at least 30
percent more expensive than regular vets.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwein isn't much concerned with cost when it comes to his
pet: ``They'll send me the bill, and whatever it is, I'll pay it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's in good company. According to the American Animal Hospital
Association, 38 percent of pet owners surveyed say they'll even go
into debt for their pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that people care more for their pets now,'' said
Dr. Garth Peterson, who's practiced for 30 years at McClave
Veterinary Hospital in Reseda. ``But they definitely love them, and
they want to do whatever they can for them, including treatments
that just used to be for humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Fluffy and Fido can now benefit from everything from
anxiety-ending tranquilizers to cancer treatments, from new
heartworm remedies to kidney transplants, from a new doggy
Alzheimer's drug to limb-saving orthopedic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   There's even pet CPR.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year and a half, nearly 2,000 pet owners have been
trained in animal first aid, including pet cardiopulmonary and
mouth-to-snout resuscitation, at Encino-based ABC Rescue's classes.
(To sign up for a class, call 818-780-7860.)
</P>
<P>
   The classes work, said ABC owner Craig Jones, who contracts with
the American Red Cross to offer the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been cases of people bringing their dogs and cats _
as well as lizards and chickens _ back from the brink of death,''
he said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Need a specialist?
</P>
<P>
   Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals, is where
more than 5,000 families a year turn when their pets are diagnosed
with life-threatening cancers and other serious ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen doctors _ 13 of them specialists in neurology,
orthopedics, oncology, ophthalmology, radiology, cardiology and
nephrology (kidney disease) _ plus 65 nurses and technicians care
for cats and dogs in the 65-cage hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of care is expensive; a course of radiation treatments
for a pet with cancer can cost $3,500, and chemotherapy can run an
additional $2,000. Sometimes, there are miraculous cures _ dogs
brought in comatose from a brain tumor who scamper home happily
after surgery, cats with kidney disease who leave with a
transplanted organ, perky and purring again.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees, said VRA administrator Mark Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be just adding six months to an animal's life, and we
tell the owners that up front. But they're willing to spend the
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's sad is that we have people who come in who can't pay,
and it's really upsetting because they'd really like to save their
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter pet medical insurance, one of the newer offerings in the
pet care market.
</P>
<P>
   As new ways are found to lengthen pets' lives, some pet owners
are investing in insurance that covers pacemakers and heart
surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, bone replacement surgery and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Stephens is president and founder of Anaheim-based
Veterinary Pet Insurance. Opened in 1982, it's America's oldest and
largest pet insurance company, with more than 850,000 clients and
backed by more than 800 veterinarians.
</P>
<P>
   Premiums run from $99 to $300 or so a year per pet but cover
medical procedures costing thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's saving animals that mean a lot to their owners,''
Stephens said. ``People realize the love that a pet gives and want
to return that with good medical care. There's no reason anymore to
put a pet to sleep when the owner wants to use modern technology to
keep it alive.''
</P>
<P>
   While only 2 percent of 1,252 respondents to an American Animal
Hospital Association 1998 pet owner survey said they have health
insurance for their pet, nearly two-thirds said they would spend
$1,000 or more to save their pet's life, whether it's a family pet
or a show animal.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS) &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, show-dog breeder Stephanie Archuleta &UR;  &LR; of Palmdale
took her 3-year-old prize-winning cocker spaniel, Mishka, in to
have his chronically swollen tonsils removed, an operation not
often performed on dogs. The surgery cost $85.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen tonsils don't ``affect Mishka's looks, but if he's not
feeling well, then the dog show is a no-go,'' she said. ``And he's
the love of my life. The money I'd spend on him is limitless. He
deserves that, and the reason is that he gives me 150 percent _ and
why should that not be returned?''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the pet scale, Geraldine Horvill recently
spent $600 for her 6-year-old Pomeranian, Foxy, to have her teeth
cleaned and X-rays taken of a gimpy back leg. Her vet told her
she's looking at a much bigger bill _ perhaps into the thousands of
dollars _ for surgery to correct Foxy's leg problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Reseda widow can ill afford a big vet bill but says she'll
spend whatever it takes to have her companion well again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very expensive, but I figure I have to,'' Horvill said.
``If you don't take care of 'em, you don't have 'em anymore. And
she's my pal.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ER for animals &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The same rule that says you'll have a flat if there's no spare
tire in your trunk seems to decree that a pet will become sickest
after your veterinarian's office closes for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Without 24-hour emergency clinics _ the first one opened 1974 in
New York City _ pets must suffer, and their owners must worry,
until Monday morning when their regular vet's office opens.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time pet owners resort to an emergency clinic,
usually the animals already have been ill for a while, said Dr.
Daniel Grayson, manager of the Animal Critical Care and Veterinary
Specialty Center in Woodland Hills, where Travis was treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, it's 3 in the morning, and it's an emergency,'' Grayson
said. ``Usually when an animal looks sick, it's pretty far along.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the case for Travis.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the center spent five hours in surgery with Travis,
pumping him full of antibiotics to fight infection. Travis made it
until Wednesday, when he slipped into a coma and died. Through
their grief, his owners are full of praise for the emergency room
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very compassionate _ with both Travis and us,''
Goodwein said, choking back tears. ``They did good work.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeing pets die is the hardest thing about being an emergency
vet, said Grayson.
</P>
<P>
   And telling owners the sad news can be even harder, especially
today, when most people think of their pets not as animals, but as
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was 5:30 in the morning; his wife had just left him, his
father had died six months ago, his mother was dying of cancer, and
now his dog was sick,'' Grayson said, recalling a young man with a
12-year-old dog who came to his clinic recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``He left her here, and she seemed fine,'' the vet said. ``All
of a sudden, she absolutely crashed, and we weren't able to bring
her back. That was about the hardest phone call I've ever had to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   The brighter side of medical advancement for pets is that better
veterinary care, better diet and recent medical advances have all
combined to allow pets _ like humans _ to live longer than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
   But that also means veterinarians who were trained to give
rabies shots and do minor surgery must learn to recognize
unfamiliar symptoms in geriatric animals, said Dr. Patrick Melese,
director of Veterinary Behavior Consultants in San Diego and one of
the few certified animal behavior specialists in California.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, heart disease, cancer and cognitive dysfunction
syndrome _ a canine ailment that in many ways mimics Alzheimer's
disease in humans _ all occur in dogs over 8 years old _ an
estimated 6.5 million in America, Melese said. And millions more
aging cats are susceptible to feline leukemia, feline AIDS and
kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back 20 years ago, dogs used to die from being hit by a car.
They didn't live as long, and we didn't know as much,'' he said.
``Today, we can increase animals' life span, and we can keep them
healthier longer. People expect that of us. And they should.''

laxative contained in a high-fiber premium cat food. Friskies

longer chewing, resulting in a tooth-cleaning effect. Hill's n/d
Diet for dogs and cats aids in the healing, immune-system

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I'd like to thank my information agent ...
</P>
<P>
   Just as in Hollywood, it's award season in the worlds of new
media, though unlike the movie biz, there's no clear must-get
honor.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to see what some folks think are the best sites
around, there are a couple of places to start. But first something
for the awards-show traditionalist. Last week, the ABC Internet
Group and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences launched
Oscar.com to track all the events leading up to the big show March
21.
</P>
<P>
   The site offers such goodies for movie buffs as a complete list
of nominees, synopses of nominated films, academy history, and
photo galleries of past winners, Oscar fashions and splashy
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and the academy also promise to add trivia games, a database
of past winners and nominees, a producer's journal of show
preparations and much more.
</P>
<P>
   The site also will carry a live Webcast of the Oscars on awards
night, though as the recent Victoria's Secret fashion show
demonstrated, it'll still be a while before you willingly choose
the Webcast over the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   And if Oscar just isn't enough for your awards-night jones, try
these Web award sites:
</P>
<P>
   You can start with the Webbies, which used to be sponsored by a
really fine little magazine called the Web. But the Web (the
magazine) had as much trouble devising a viable economic model as
any of the sites it wrote about. And without the insanely large
stock-market valuations keeping those sites afloat, it died an
untimely death.
</P>
<P>
   The Webbies live on, however, at www.webbyawards.com, thanks to
the good folks over at the International Academy of Digital Arts
and Sciences, which has already announced 110 nominees. The awards
will be handed out March 18 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Webbies, among the best art site nominees is one
by Amy Alexander, a film and video professor at the California
Institute for the Arts in Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's Multi-Cultural Recycler (at
shoko.calarts.edu/(tilde)alex/recycler.html) cuts and pastes
together instant collages based on images from the dozens of
Webcams that show everything from naked homebodies to the Hollywood
sign to coffeemakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cameras provide documentation, surveillance and a very
specific representation of the camera owners and their
surroundings,'' Alexander said. ``Ordinary people and places around
the world are instantly subject to becoming part of the mass
culture and are potentially also subject to cultural recycling.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, once you have the machine create a collage from the
images taken from randomly selected Webcams, the site is posted in
a gallery, where it, too, can be further recycled by the next
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   If the Webbies and Alexander's work aren't enough to elevate
your appreciation for the World Wide Web, the folks at Cool Site of
the Day (www.coolsiteoftheday.com) not only hand out daily
recognition categories, they also have an annual best-of contest.
</P>
<P>
   The Cool Sites staff pick the nominees, then Web denizens do the
actual final voting. Check 'em out at
http://www.coolsiteoftheday.com.
</P>
<P>
   In the video-gaming business, the Flights of Fantasy awards have
already gone out, spotlighting the best games on consoles such as
Sony PlayStation, Nintendo 64 and Sega Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   Konami's Metal Gear Solid was the biggest winner, pulling down
awards for game of the year, best adventure game, story development
and sound. Two of the game's creative talents, Hideo Kahima and
David Hayter, were honored for individual achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Other big awards included Capcom's Resident Evil 2 for best
action game; THQ's Rugrats Adventure for best children's game;
Namco's Tekken 3 for best fighting game; THQ's Devil Dice (a
personal favorite) for best puzzle game; Sega's Panzer Dragoon Saga
(the only Saturn title of recent note) as best role-playing game;
and EA Sports' Madden NFL 99 for best sports game.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo's Pokemon (which still consumes my children's attention
almost six months after its release) proved to be no pocket monster
on the Game Boy, getting honored for innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Nintendo also scored an award for game design for the great
Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, which otherwise was shut out
despite nine nominations, the most of any title. &QL;

important. But the audacity of the plan _ and what it bodes for the

   CAMBODIA-GENOCIDE _ PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Sitting on a
bamboo-slatted bench, widow But Lin crumbled dried lumps of cooked
rice in a basket and talked about what she wants to happen to the
Khmer Rouge leaders who brutalized her country. Twenty years after
the Khmer Rouge fell from power, a day of judging them approaches.
But Lin hopes it will put her anger to rest. A United Nations team
of three legal experts is scheduled this month to recommend to
Secretary General Kofi Annan whether to start action against the
remaining Khmer Rouge leaders living openly in Cambodia. Some form
of international tribunal likely will be proposed to hear evidence
against the men who masterminded the madness that left as many as
two million Cambodians dead in less than four years, from 1975 to
1979.

IN DEFENSE OF THE DEATH PENALTY 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Within the span of a few days, Pope John Paul II
pleaded for the life of a convicted killer and college students
uncovered evidence that a death row inmate may have been wrongly
sentenced _ and the legitimacy of the death penalty was in for
another political thumping.
</P>
<P>
   Here we go again.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate punishment has become a quietly accepted fact of
American life only in the past few years. The Supreme Court ruled
back in 1976 that it was constitutionally OK if applied fairly and
appropriately. Controversy over the issue was slow to recede even
though a majority of the public and most national politicians long
supported the concept.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have continued to fight capital punishment. They hold
candlelight vigils before scheduled executions, help death row
inmates file endless appeals, glamorize killers by selling
sympathetic books and raise their voices in moral outrage.
</P>
<P>
   But across the country the 38 states which permit the death
penalty have executed 500 convicted murderers in the past 23 years
with increasingly less public attention. Now, however, fresh
ammunition is reviving the old arguments about whether capital
punishment can ever be morally justified or administered in a way
that does not sometimes mistakenly kill innocent men.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to St. Louis last month, the Pope tried to
revive the issue with strong statements condemning the death
penalty. He also asked Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan to commute the
death sentence of Darrell Mease, who was due to die by lethal
injection in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The governor complied, although there was no question at trial
that Mease was guilty of hiding for three days to ambush a
69-year-old man, his wife and their paraplegic grandson. He shot
the three and then walked up to them to shoot each one again in the
face in what was described as the most cold-blooded killing ever to
take place in the region. His only defense was post-traumatic
stress from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The incident dramatized the pope's belief that the state has no
right to take any life, even that of someone who has brutally taken
the life of another. But his choice for salvation was not a
sympathetic one; the victims' families and friends, among others,
felt the killer deserved to die.
</P>
<P>
   But to the degree that the pope's example energizes Catholic
officials, we may see the church try to revive its flagging efforts
to get Catholics to fight the death penalty. (Polls show that lay
Catholics support capital punishment by a 2-to-1 margin, roughly
equal to that of Protestants.)
</P>
<P>
   A more immediate reaction was prompted by the discovery of
Northwestern University journalism students that Anthony Porter,
who was due to be executed for the 1982 shooting deaths of two
teenagers, may be innocent. The students found a Milwaukee man who
confessed to the murders for which Porter was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Death penalty opponents point out that such mistakes are more
common than we realize. In Chicago alone, 10 death row inmates have
been released since 1977 after the discovery of new exculpatory
evidence. The cry has gone up for a moratorium on executions and
drastic revisions in the way the sentence is imposed. Even Chicago
Mayor Richard Daley, who calls himself ``pro death,'' now supports
a temporary halt to executions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the possibility of error _ still relatively rare _ is not in
itself sufficient to justify abandoning the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously an execution, being uniquely irreversible, calls for
extra scrutiny. But a great nation cannot tremble before laws to
protect the safety of its citizens out of fear they may be applied
imperfectly. That would amount to tyranny of the few over the many.
</P>
<P>
   If found guilty, those three white Texas men who dragged a black
man to his death behind a pickup truck do not deserve a taxpayer
subsidy to loaf in a prison cell. Karla Faye Tucker, executed for
hacking two people to death with a pickax, didn't deserve it either
_ despite her belated conversion to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Justice requires the ultimate repayment in kind for the ultimate
evil of robbing another living, breathing human being of life.

PETS TREATED LIKE PART OF THE FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by LANG partners -- )  
 &HT;     By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Your boss was on a rampage today. The phone never
stopped ringing. Lunch was a candy bar from the vending machine.
And traffic crawled all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   But the minute you open the door, you know there'll be somebody
there to give you a big, wet smooch, listen to your problems and
offer as much cuddling as you can handle.
</P>
<P>
   And he's got a cold, wet nose and a wagging tail, too. Or maybe
a throaty purr and a way of curling around your legs that makes the
rest of the world recede for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us, beset by life's troubles and travails, our pets
are a haven, a refuge, a place of peace and solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that pets were called pets,'' said Bill
Schoolman, executive director of the American Pet Products
Manufacturers Association. ``Then they were `companion animals.'
Now, they're part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like our human children, we take their pictures, enroll
them in (obedience) schools, dress them in cute outfits. We buy
them the best food we can afford, hire doctors to soothe their
ailments. And, at the end of life's journey, we buy a cemetery plot
and headstone to memorialize them.
</P>
<P>
   To keep these furry, feathered or finned friends happy,
Americans shell out at least $27 billion annually. Is it all worth
it? You bet, say pet lovers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pets fill our lives with love,'' said psychotherapist
Sherry Gantman of Tarzana. ``And they teach us simplicity. It just
doesn't take that much to make a pet happy, and you recognize that
for yourself as well. They teach us how to love in the very
simplest way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 58.2 million households, or 58.9 percent of U.S. families,
include a pet. More than 112 million dogs, cats and other assorted
animals fill our lives, according to a 1997 survey of pet owners by
the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   A need for four-footed companionship isn't a modern trend;
people have owned pets for centuries. The first dogs, besides
providing companionship, helped early man track wild game and herd
sheep. Early domestic cats were regarded by the Egyptians as gods;
later, they were sought-after mouse-catchers on farms and ships.
</P>
<P>
   In today's society, animal experts say, pets may provide a
primal connection with nature at a time when people are growing
more isolated from each other. Many people are marrying and having
families later, or not at all, and for singles, pets can provide
something _ somebody _ to come home to. For empty-nesters whose
children are grown and on their own, pets can offer a chance to
nurture again. And for elderly people, pets can provide a reason to
get up in the morning, a reason to take a walk, to stay active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets are taking a much more important role in people's lives
than just being the family dog,'' said Mark Davis, administrator of
Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals. ``Pets fill
a void.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pet projects &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some of us, in fact, our pets are our best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as auto detailer Ron Costello of Woodland Hills _ owner of
two dogs, a cat, two tortoises and an iguana _ puts it, ``Your
dog'll never do you wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   How could you provide less than the best for such a friend? This
widespread affection for pets is a marketing analyst's dream.
</P>
<P>
   It's a $20 billion a year business for what the U.S. Census
Bureau says in 1992 totaled 87,000 pet retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   And the nationwide bill for veterinary care rose from $4.9
billion in 1991 to more than $7 billion in 1996, according to the
AVMA.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are willing spenders, you will find eager
entrepreneurs, and the pet industry has been joined by many. Among
them are purveyors of pet journals, pet greeting cards, pet
sitting, pet Web sites, pet day care, pet medical advice, pet
breeding and pet naming.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the most devoted _ or fanatical _ pet owners at pet
shows and entering pet contests such as the Friskies PetCare Co.'s
``Friskiest Cat in America'' photo contest or Purina Dog Chow's
``America's Most Incredible Dog'' contest. The rewards: a hefty
supply of food for the pet and up to $10,000 for its owner.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't find it in a specialty pet store or on the
Internet, surely one of the nation's pet super stores, each stocked
with more than 10,000 items, will have something to satisfy even
the most finicky four-legged friend.
</P>
<P>
   While animals around the house are nothing new, this expansion
of the pet retail market is a recent phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based PetSmart Inc. started in 1987 as a two-store
chain. Twelve years later, it's the No. 1 pet retailer in sales,
raking in $1.3 billion in the first 11 months of 1998 at 532 stores
in 45 U.S. states, Canada and England.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Petco, the No. 2 pet retailer, started with one
store in 1965 and now has 465 locations in 37 states that did
$188.6 million in sales in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want their companions to be happy,'' said Petco
spokesman Don Cowan. ``They pamper them. As a result, a lot of
money is being spent on pets.'' &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
Good enough for Fido? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Opening day at Three Dog Bakery in Old Pasadena was a testament
to man's weakness for his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tasty treats are the product of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
operation that opened its 16th branch in Pasadena on Jan. 30 at the
One West Colorado pedestrian mall. And nearly 4,000 people and 800
dogs came the first day to sample the goodies, said co-owner Mark
Bodnar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shoulder-to-shoulder and haunch-to-haunch,'' Bodnar
joked. ``When we opened, Pasadena went to the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Dog Bakery _ founded in 1992 by Mark Beckloff, an
ex-accountant, and Dan Dye, a former copywriter _ specializes in
dog treats made from ingredients humans can enjoy, too. Seven years
later, the duo has licensed 15 stores across the country, and plans
to open another 10 in the next two months, including one March 6 in
West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are encouraged to bring their dogs in so they can pick
out their own treats and chow down right in the store. On the menu
at each Three Dog Bakery are treats like Boxer Brownies and Bulldog
Bars ($3 each) and Pup Tarts (50 cents). For $200, an owner can buy
his dog a specially made, sugarless birthday cake. Within a few
months, the bakeries will also offer $2 servings of pet ice cream
with a yogurt base.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it is healthful, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eating healthier,'' said Beckloff, ``and we think
it's a way to show their dogs that they care about their health,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Three Dog chefs are working on perfecting cat treats, but
... well, cats are more finicky about taste than dogs, Beckloff
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem Bob Ditchik is trying to solve at his Pet
Greetings firm, based in Westlake Village. The company makes
rawhide greeting cards _ available for $2 at many pet stores and
veterinarians' offices _ that dogs love to chew on, but he hasn't
been able to perfect a card that appeals to cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it, though,'' he said. ``People want to have
treats for all their animals. That's why people like our cards.
With a regular card, the owner reads it, but the dog gets nothing.
With our card, the dog gets to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal lover, Ditchik said his one regret is that constant
business travel keeps him from having a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty empty when you get home,'' he said. ``There's
something about a pet that brings a feeling that somebody's there
waiting for you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking care
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone will open a pet rental service that'll deliver a
pet of your choice to your home to greet you with loving kisses
when you return from a long trip. Sound far-fetched? Maybe. But if
pet lovers demand it, you know someone out there will one day offer
it.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew 20 years ago that the human obsession with pets would
spawn pet sitters? It didn't take long for the 2,800 licensed,
bonded sitters in the United States, Canada, England and a few
European countries to organize themselves into a group called Pet
Sitters International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your pet is your surrogate kid, so why wouldn't you hire a
professional to take care of it?'' said Kay Calzolari, spokeswoman
for the North Carolina-based organization. ``Used to be, if you
were away from home, you'd hire the kid down the street to feed the
dog, but that kid has grown up and turned pet-sitting into a
profitable business.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of pet owners hire sitters when they're away
from home, Calzolari said. That translates into 13.5 million home
visits a year, most at a rate of $12 to $15 a visit _ a $162
million to $202.5 million annual business.
</P>
<P>
   (Pet owners can avoid a pet sitter's bill for the day on June 25
by observing Take Your Dog to Work Day, sponsored by PSI.)
</P>
<P>
   And all this spending doesn't end when it's time to tell our
pets that final goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   When death comes, many people provide their pet one final bit of
pampering with a satin-lined coffin and burial at Los Angeles Pet
Memorial Park in Calabasas, Southern California's oldest pet
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1928, more than 40,000 pets have been buried on rolling
hills covered with animal sculptures, stuffed animals, pet toys,
flowers and colorful whirligigs. Those who lie there range from the
famous _ MGM's Leo the Lion, Hopalong Cassidy's horse and Rudolph
Valentino's Doberman _ to family dogs and cats, rabbits, snakes and
an occasional guinea pig. Burial costs range from $200 to thousands
of dollars for large animals or elaborate services.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Newth, an actress and cemetery board member, has buried
two of her dogs _ Alfie and Spooky _ in a plot that has room for
nearly a half-dozen more pets. Losing her dogs _ in particular,
Alfie, a 70-pound golden retriever/collie mix, who suffered from
lymphatic cancer _ has been one of the most devastating things in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was like ``losing anyone in your life that's important to
you. I felt the same as when my father died, but it's a different
kind of missing,'' said Newth. ``An animal is there for you 100
percent, shares in your sorrows and plays with you and depends on
you to take care of it. It's like a child that never grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people never really recover from a pet's death, said Encino
family therapist Zoe Sager, who leads pet grief support groups. (To
join, call (818) 754-1550.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With people that we lose, there are a lot of unresolved
issues, unresolved grief,'' Sager said. ``With a pet, we just seem
to love them so much unconditionally. Of all the relationships we
have, our relationship with a pet is probably one of the purest.
That's why we miss them so much when they're gone.'' &QL;

 &HT;    FIRST LADY AS CANDIDATE RAISES LEGAL ISSUES
 &HT;    Eds: Adds 2nd graf with Clinton comment; other minor editing.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, seriously considering a run
for the U.S. Senate in New York next year, will have to consult
more than public opinion polls. The first lady's first-of-its-kind
candidacy would raise novel legal questions for attorneys to sort
out.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a race gained steam Monday when President Clinton
said, ``I think she would be terrific in the Senate ... but it's
her decision to make. I will support whatever decision she makes
enthusiastically.'' Clinton was speaking during a break in a
meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo in Merida, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If she hits the campaign trail, would Mrs. Clinton take her
usual entourage of White House staff and Secret Service agents,
whose traveling expenses would be charged to taxpayers? If so,
would her campaign have to defray some of the costs?
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mrs. Clinton is planning extensive travel on behalf of
the president's Social Security and Medicare proposals and to
promote historic preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Could she shuttle to and from New York aboard her Air Force jet,
and from speech to speech in a motorcade of government cars? And
could she justify the public costs by adding non-partisan ``first
lady'' appearances to her campaign travels?
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be pretty much new territory,'' said Ian Stirton,
spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, which oversees
campaign election laws and financing. ``I imagine a lot of lawyers
will be working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has begun that work yet, according to the first lady's
press secretary Marsha Berry, who agreed that the legal research
would be needed if Mrs. Clinton decides to become a candidate. But
``none of that has happened,'' said Berry, because ``she's not
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is urging
the first lady to seek a Democratic seat being vacated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, spokeswoman Kerin Polla also acknowledged
the unanswered legal points. ``It's never been done before,'' she
said of having a first lady as candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a president running for re-election, the rules
are fairly well established, said the FEC's Stirton. The taxpayers
get the bill for the security, the limousines and the jet
designated Air Force One that always accompany the chief executive.
Political parties pay a small portion of the enormous costs of a
president's fund raising or political travels.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady's situation is less clear, since she holds no
constitutional position, Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other potential issues, the Clintons have built up an
extensive list of well-wishers and others on a White House computer
database. Could the first lady use that information to raise money
or build support for her Senate campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``If some of the cost was generated by taxpayer dollars, there
could be problems,'' Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the fact that Mrs. Clinton does not live in New York
is hardly a problem at all. The residency requirement for Senate
candidates in the state is so lenient that she need only establish
an address there by election day. In recent decades, New Yorkers
have elected two senators, Robert F. Kennedy and James Buckley, who
had very shallow roots in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Published news reports already have Mrs. Clinton's agents
scouring Manhattan's posh West Side for an apartment, amid denials
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has offered no hints on what her boss will do. ``Everybody
just needs to relax,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said Sunday on ABC-TV's
``This Week'' that Mrs. Clinton is ``going to talk to the people
who have been urging her to run, think about it. But I will tell
you one thing: I think that if she does run, she will win.''

NEED NOT TO KNOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Feb. 21)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At that memorable moment last month when the State of the Union
message and impeachment trial converged, Sen. Arlen Specter was
heard to remark: ``This is schizophrenia at its highest.''
</P>
<P>
   Though alienists might be alienated by the common use of one of
their terms to mean ``split personality,'' the fact is that
 &UR; schizo &LR;  is Greek for ``split.'' In The Christian Science Monitor,
Francine Kiefer called that moment ``the ultimate example of Bill
Clinton's `split screen' presidency.'' What the senator and the
reporter were getting at was Clinton's ability to
 &UR; compartmentalize &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   As the president made a practice of appearing detached from his
pursuers, Maureen Dowd wrote in The New York Times, ``The White
House euphemistically calls it ` &UR; compartmentalizing &LR; ,' and The New
York Observer wrote about  &UR; compartmentalization chic &LR;  among boomers
juggling busy schedules.'' She then delivered the sort of ukase
that only certified pundits can issue: ``All this prattling about
 &UR; compartmentalization &LR;  has got to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I am quite able to set this word out of my mind as I
write this column, let me  &UR; prattle &LR;  awhile (from the Low German
 &UR; pratten &LR; , ``to pout,'' and then ``to prate, babble, talk idly'').
</P>
<P>
   The word, now a defining Clintonism, means ``the act of dividing
into separate sections'' and was coined in 1923 by the biologist
Julian S. Huxley in his ``Uniqueness of Man.'' He was comparing our
ability to think and act in a unified way with ``the much more
rigid  &UR; compartmentalization &LR;  of animal mind and behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   In the age of multiculturalism and interdisciplinarianism
(there's a new one), most of the nonscientific uses of the term
have been pejorative. But in the military, the word found a home:
``These scientists had worked for the Manhattan District,'' wrote
The New Yorker in 1946 about our early atomic research, ``and the
Army, temporarily abandoning its policy of ` &UR; compartmentalization &LR; 
of information,' had recently brought them together.''
</P>
<P>
   Espionage then took up the word and shortened it.
 &UR; Compartmented &LR;  meant having ``access limited to a `need to
know.''' If you're a spook and want to examine our satellite
photographs of Saddam Hussein's favorite seraglio, you need a
``Talent Keyhole'' clearance. But that's  &UR; compartmented &LR; ; if you've
got no need to know, it matters not how much talent you have. They
won't let you near the keyhole.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton years, the word in its long form became his
admirers' favorite description of his mind's ability to focus on
specific business no matter what the distraction. On ``Good Morning
America,'' when the former Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos told
ABC's Elizabeth Vargas that ``he always talks in the State of the
Union under strange circumstances,'' she picked up the jargon and
replied in awe, ``He has a remarkable ability to
 &UR; compartmentalize &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as usually happens, the word began to be used against him.
``This is the same president renowned for his ability to
 &UR; compartmentalize &LR; ,'' charged the impeachment manager Ed Bryant,
``... and pleads that he simply wasn't paying attention ... during
his own deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Another manager, Lindsey Graham, said, ``That's what this case
is about _ equivocation and  &UR; compartmentalizing &LR; .'' And asked about
the complexity of the arguments in the Senate trial, Sen. George
Voinovich of Ohio replied mischievously, ``As someone has said,
we'll just have to  &UR; compartmentalize &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This word that will enter the political lexicon under his name
is frequently used about him, but apparently not by him. It's
nowhere to be found out of his mouth on the White House Web site.
</P>
<P>
   If ever given the opportunity to ask Clinton a direct, personal
question, I would unhesitatingly put the hot one to him: ``Mr.
President, what would you call your ability to focus on the issues
of interest to the American people while scandalmongers wallow in
Monicagate?'' Or something to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   TCHOTCHKES
</P>
<P>
   You pay for good linguistic lawyering, you get it.
</P>
<P>
   In the Congressional Record for Feb. 4, 1999, following a
transcript of the testimony of Monica Lewinsky, there is a
corrective addendum from one of her attorneys, Plato Cacheris.
Among the spelling corrections like `` &UR; Seidman &LR;  should replace
`Sideman''' is this: `` &UR; tchotchke &LR;  should replace `chochki.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Cacheris partner who kept historians from slipping into
spelling error is Preston Burton, who reports: ``I used to date a
Jewish girl in college, and she knew how to spell  &UR; tchotchke &LR; . I
verified it in Webster's New World Dictionary.''
</P>
<P>
   There, indeed, the Yiddishism is so spelled, and defined as
``knickknack, collectible, trinket.'' Merriam-Webster's 10th
Collegiate agrees, adding the Polish etymology of  &UR; czaczko &LR; . Ms
Lewinsky used the word to describe ``a little box'' she gave the
president as a gift.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is in the Anglicized pronunciation. Although it is
 &UR; choch-kuh &LR;  in Yiddish, it is  &UR; choch-key &LR;  in English; Ms Lewinsky
gave it the proper English pronunciation, and the transcriber took
the spelling of the final vowel from that.
</P>
<P>
   I spell it  &UR; tchotchki &LR; . Do I need a lawyer?
</P>
<P>
   CANNOT CAN
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolee Westcott says she was canned from the Olive Garden
restaurant'' for calling a congressman a ``turncoat,'' according to
an Associated Press dispatch from Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Rados of Atlanta sent me that clip with an objection:
 &UR; canned &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   The slang term means ``discharged,'' or its synonym from the
shooting of a cannon, ``fired.'' Asked about this rather informal
usage, Norm Goldstein, editor of the AP Stylebook, writes: ``No, it
is surely not AP style to use  &UR; canned &LR;  for  &UR; fired &LR; . It's a slang
word we don't recommend in serious stories. (It was not used in
followup stories on the same incident.)''
</P>
<P>
   It's good to see the news agency upholding standards. And to
note that it is blazing the trail to drop the hyphen in
 &UR; follow-up &LR; .

 &HT;    FIRST LADY AS CANDIDATE RAISES LEGAL ISSUES
 &HT;    Eds: Adds 2nd graf with Clinton comment; other minor editing.
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, seriously considering a run
for the U.S. Senate in New York next year, will have to consult
more than public opinion polls. The first lady's first-of-its-kind
candidacy would raise novel legal questions for attorneys to sort
out.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a race gained steam Monday when President Clinton
said, ``I think she would be terrific in the Senate ... but it's
her decision to make. I will support whatever decision she makes
enthusiastically.'' Clinton was speaking during a break in a
meeting with President Ernesto Zedillo in Merida, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   If she hits the campaign trail, would Mrs. Clinton take her
usual entourage of White House staff and Secret Service agents,
whose traveling expenses would be charged to taxpayers? If so,
would her campaign have to defray some of the costs?
</P>
<P>
   Already, Mrs. Clinton is planning extensive travel on behalf of
the president's Social Security and Medicare proposals and to
promote historic preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Could she shuttle to and from New York aboard her Air Force jet,
and from speech to speech in a motorcade of government cars? And
could she justify the public costs by adding non-partisan ``first
lady'' appearances to her campaign travels?
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be pretty much new territory,'' said Ian Stirton,
spokesman for the Federal Election Commission, which oversees
campaign election laws and financing. ``I imagine a lot of lawyers
will be working on that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has begun that work yet, according to the first lady's
press secretary Marsha Berry, who agreed that the legal research
would be needed if Mrs. Clinton decides to become a candidate. But
``none of that has happened,'' said Berry, because ``she's not
there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is urging
the first lady to seek a Democratic seat being vacated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, spokeswoman Kerin Polla also acknowledged
the unanswered legal points. ``It's never been done before,'' she
said of having a first lady as candidate.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a president running for re-election, the rules
are fairly well established, said the FEC's Stirton. The taxpayers
get the bill for the security, the limousines and the jet
designated Air Force One that always accompany the chief executive.
Political parties pay a small portion of the enormous costs of a
president's fund raising or political travels.
</P>
<P>
   But the first lady's situation is less clear, since she holds no
constitutional position, Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other potential issues, the Clintons have built up an
extensive list of well-wishers and others on a White House computer
database. Could the first lady use that information to raise money
or build support for her Senate campaign?
</P>
<P>
   ``If some of the cost was generated by taxpayer dollars, there
could be problems,'' Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the fact that Mrs. Clinton does not live in New York
is hardly a problem at all. The residency requirement for Senate
candidates in the state is so lenient that she need only establish
an address there by election day. In recent decades, New Yorkers
have elected two senators, Robert F. Kennedy and James Buckley, who
had very shallow roots in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Published news reports already have Mrs. Clinton's agents
scouring Manhattan's posh West Side for an apartment, amid denials
from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has offered no hints on what her boss will do. ``Everybody
just needs to relax,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   White House chief of staff John Podesta said Sunday on ABC-TV's
``This Week'' that Mrs. Clinton is ``going to talk to the people
who have been urging her to run, think about it. But I will tell
you one thing: I think that if she does run, she will win.''

PETS TREATED LIKE PART OF THE FAMILY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Your boss was on a rampage today. The phone never
stopped ringing. Lunch was a candy bar from the vending machine.
And traffic crawled all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   But the minute you open the door, you know there'll be somebody
there to give you a big, wet smooch, listen to your problems and
offer as much cuddling as you can handle.
</P>
<P>
   And he's got a cold, wet nose and a wagging tail, too. Or maybe
a throaty purr and a way of curling around your legs that makes the
rest of the world recede for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   For many of us, beset by life's troubles and travails, our pets
are a haven, a refuge, a place of peace and solace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that pets were called pets,'' said Bill
Schoolman, executive director of the American Pet Products
Manufacturers Association. ``Then they were `companion animals.'
Now, they're part of the family.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like our human children, we take their pictures, enroll
them in (obedience) schools, dress them in cute outfits. We buy
them the best food we can afford, hire doctors to soothe their
ailments. And, at the end of life's journey, we buy a cemetery plot
and headstone to memorialize them.
</P>
<P>
   To keep these furry, feathered or finned friends happy,
Americans shell out at least $27 billion annually. Is it all worth
it? You bet, say pet lovers everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our pets fill our lives with love,'' said psychotherapist
Sherry Gantman of Tarzana. ``And they teach us simplicity. It just
doesn't take that much to make a pet happy, and you recognize that
for yourself as well. They teach us how to love in the very
simplest way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 58.2 million households, or 58.9 percent of U.S. families,
include a pet. More than 112 million dogs, cats and other assorted
animals fill our lives, according to a 1997 survey of pet owners by
the American Veterinary Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   A need for four-footed companionship isn't a modern trend;
people have owned pets for centuries. The first dogs, besides
providing companionship, helped early man track wild game and herd
sheep. Early domestic cats were regarded by the Egyptians as gods;
later, they were sought-after mouse-catchers on farms and ships.
</P>
<P>
   In today's society, animal experts say, pets may provide a
primal connection with nature at a time when people are growing
more isolated from each other. Many people are marrying and having
families later, or not at all, and for singles, pets can provide
something _ somebody _ to come home to. For empty-nesters whose
children are grown and on their own, pets can offer a chance to
nurture again. And for elderly people, pets can provide a reason to
get up in the morning, a reason to take a walk, to stay active.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pets are taking a much more important role in people's lives
than just being the family dog,'' said Mark Davis, administrator of
Veterinary Referral Associates in Gaithersburg, Md., sometimes
referred to as the Mayo Clinic of veterinary hospitals. ``Pets fill
a void.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Pet projects &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For some of us, in fact, our pets are our best friends.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as auto detailer Ron Costello of Woodland Hills _ owner of
two dogs, a cat, two tortoises and an iguana _ puts it, ``Your
dog'll never do you wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   How could you provide less than the best for such a friend? This
widespread affection for pets is a marketing analyst's dream.
</P>
<P>
   It's a $20 billion a year business for what the U.S. Census
Bureau says in 1992 totaled 87,000 pet retail stores.
</P>
<P>
   And the nationwide bill for veterinary care rose from $4.9
billion in 1991 to more than $7 billion in 1996, according to the
AVMA.
</P>
<P>
   Where there are willing spenders, you will find eager
entrepreneurs, and the pet industry has been joined by many. Among
them are purveyors of pet journals, pet greeting cards, pet
sitting, pet Web sites, pet day care, pet medical advice, pet
breeding and pet naming.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the most devoted _ or fanatical _ pet owners at pet
shows and entering pet contests such as the Friskies PetCare Co.'s
``Friskiest Cat in America'' photo contest or Purina Dog Chow's
``America's Most Incredible Dog'' contest. The rewards: a hefty
supply of food for the pet and up to $10,000 for its owner.
</P>
<P>
   And if you can't find it in a specialty pet store or on the
Internet, surely one of the nation's pet super stores, each stocked
with more than 10,000 items, will have something to satisfy even
the most finicky four-legged friend.
</P>
<P>
   While animals around the house are nothing new, this expansion
of the pet retail market is a recent phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix-based PetSmart Inc. started in 1987 as a two-store
chain. Twelve years later, it's the No. 1 pet retailer in sales,
raking in $1.3 billion in the first 11 months of 1998 at 532 stores
in 45 U.S. states, Canada and England.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego-based Petco, the No. 2 pet retailer, started with one
store in 1965 and now has 465 locations in 37 states that did
$188.6 million in sales in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want their companions to be happy,'' said Petco
spokesman Don Cowan. ``They pamper them. As a result, a lot of
money is being spent on pets.'' &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
Good enough for Fido? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Opening day at Three Dog Bakery in Old Pasadena was a testament
to man's weakness for his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Tasty treats are the product of the Kansas City, Mo.-based
operation that opened its 16th branch in Pasadena on Jan. 30 at the
One West Colorado pedestrian mall. And nearly 4,000 people and 800
dogs came the first day to sample the goodies, said co-owner Mark
Bodnar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shoulder-to-shoulder and haunch-to-haunch,'' Bodnar
joked. ``When we opened, Pasadena went to the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Dog Bakery _ founded in 1992 by Mark Beckloff, an
ex-accountant, and Dan Dye, a former copywriter _ specializes in
dog treats made from ingredients humans can enjoy, too. Seven years
later, the duo has licensed 15 stores across the country, and plans
to open another 10 in the next two months, including one March 6 in
West Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Owners are encouraged to bring their dogs in so they can pick
out their own treats and chow down right in the store. On the menu
at each Three Dog Bakery are treats like Boxer Brownies and Bulldog
Bars ($3 each) and Pup Tarts (50 cents). For $200, an owner can buy
his dog a specially made, sugarless birthday cake. Within a few
months, the bakeries will also offer $2 servings of pet ice cream
with a yogurt base.
</P>
<P>
   And all of it is healthful, of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are eating healthier,'' said Beckloff, ``and we think
it's a way to show their dogs that they care about their health,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The Three Dog chefs are working on perfecting cat treats, but
... well, cats are more finicky about taste than dogs, Beckloff
said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem Bob Ditchik is trying to solve at his Pet
Greetings firm, based in Westlake Village. The company makes
rawhide greeting cards _ available for $2 at many pet stores and
veterinarians' offices _ that dogs love to chew on, but he hasn't
been able to perfect a card that appeals to cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on it, though,'' he said. ``People want to have
treats for all their animals. That's why people like our cards.
With a regular card, the owner reads it, but the dog gets nothing.
With our card, the dog gets to eat it.''
</P>
<P>
   An animal lover, Ditchik said his one regret is that constant
business travel keeps him from having a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty empty when you get home,'' he said. ``There's
something about a pet that brings a feeling that somebody's there
waiting for you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking care
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someone will open a pet rental service that'll deliver a
pet of your choice to your home to greet you with loving kisses
when you return from a long trip. Sound far-fetched? Maybe. But if
pet lovers demand it, you know someone out there will one day offer
it.
</P>
<P>
   Who knew 20 years ago that the human obsession with pets would
spawn pet sitters? It didn't take long for the 2,800 licensed,
bonded sitters in the United States, Canada, England and a few
European countries to organize themselves into a group called Pet
Sitters International.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your pet is your surrogate kid, so why wouldn't you hire a
professional to take care of it?'' said Kay Calzolari, spokeswoman
for the North Carolina-based organization. ``Used to be, if you
were away from home, you'd hire the kid down the street to feed the
dog, but that kid has grown up and turned pet-sitting into a
profitable business.''
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of pet owners hire sitters when they're away
from home, Calzolari said. That translates into 13.5 million home
visits a year, most at a rate of $12 to $15 a visit _ a $162
million to $202.5 million annual business.
</P>
<P>
   (Pet owners can avoid a pet sitter's bill for the day on June 25
by observing Take Your Dog to Work Day, sponsored by PSI.)
</P>
<P>
   And all this spending doesn't end when it's time to tell our
pets that final goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   When death comes, many people provide their pet one final bit of
pampering with a satin-lined coffin and burial at Los Angeles Pet
Memorial Park in Calabasas, Southern California's oldest pet
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1928, more than 40,000 pets have been buried on rolling
hills covered with animal sculptures, stuffed animals, pet toys,
flowers and colorful whirligigs. Those who lie there range from the
famous _ MGM's Leo the Lion, Hopalong Cassidy's horse and Rudolph
Valentino's Doberman _ to family dogs and cats, rabbits, snakes and
an occasional guinea pig. Burial costs range from $200 to thousands
of dollars for large animals or elaborate services.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Newth, an actress and cemetery board member, has buried
two of her dogs _ Alfie and Spooky _ in a plot that has room for
nearly a half-dozen more pets. Losing her dogs _ in particular,
Alfie, a 70-pound golden retriever/collie mix, who suffered from
lymphatic cancer _ has been one of the most devastating things in
her life.
</P>
<P>
   It was like ``losing anyone in your life that's important to
you. I felt the same as when my father died, but it's a different
kind of missing,'' said Newth. ``An animal is there for you 100
percent, shares in your sorrows and plays with you and depends on
you to take care of it. It's like a child that never grows up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people never really recover from a pet's death, said Encino
family therapist Zoe Sager, who leads pet grief support groups. (To
join, call (818) 754-1550.)
</P>
<P>
   ``With people that we lose, there are a lot of unresolved
issues, unresolved grief,'' Sager said. ``With a pet, we just seem
to love them so much unconditionally. Of all the relationships we
have, our relationship with a pet is probably one of the purest.
That's why we miss them so much when they're gone.'' &QL;

NEW STUDY FINDS MIDDLE AGE IS PRIME OF LIFE

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Madison Avenue, childhood is carefree, adolescence equals
angst and middle age is synonymous with emotional upheaval _ and a
passion for sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers who study the unfolding course of human lives
have learned to distrust such popular stereotypes. The reality of
development across the life span, they find, is almost always more
complicated, less romantic and far more interesting than any
portrayal offered up by the world of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly this is true of the portrait of middle age emerging
from a 10-year study of nearly 8,000 Americans by the MacArthur
Foundation Research Network on Successful Midlife Development,
which released the first in a series of reports on its findings
today.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a time of turmoil, for most people the midlife
years appear to be a time of psychic equanimity, good health,
productive activity and community involvement, the MacArthur
researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, the sense we all have is that midlife is the best
place to be,'' said Dr. Orville Gilbert Brim, director of the
network, which is made up of researchers from many different
academic disciplines.
</P>
<P>
   The years between 35 and 65, and in particular the decades
between 40 and 60, are a time when people report increased feelings
of well-being and a greater sense of control over many parts of
their lives. A majority of participants in the MacArthur study said
they felt better about their lives than they did 10 years before.
</P>
<P>
   Finances and sex life were the areas over which people in the
study felt they had least control. Men in the study felt more in
control of their marriages than women, while women felt more in
control of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   And though the notion that most people undergo a ``midlife
crisis'' persists in the public mind, the study confirms the
finding of earlier research that midlife upheaval is the exception
rather than the rule: Only 23 percent of participants in the study
reported having a midlife crisis. And of that group, just a third
described the crisis as a time of personal turmoil brought about by
the realization that they were aging. The rest tied the crisis to
specific events in their lives, in some cases events that had
nothing to do with aging.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Margie E. Lachman, a professor of psychology at Brandeis
University and a member of the MacArthur network, said people who
did experience a midlife crisis appeared more likely to score high
on a scale of ``neuroticism'' and to have a higher level of
education.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the MacArthur project is the Midlife
Development in the United States, or Midus, survey, an in-depth
canvassing of 3,000 English-speaking adults from 25 to 75 years
old. The survey, conducted by telephone with follow-up mail
questionnaires, explored a variety of areas under the broad
headings of physical health, psychological well-being and social
responsibility, and was designed to explore why some people seem
more successful at achieving these in midlife than others.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5,000 subjects also completed the telephone interview
and mail questionnaire as part of 11 related studies. Results from
those studies will be released in future reports, Brim said.
</P>
<P>
   While other research has plumbed various aspects of midlife, the
strengths of the MacArthur project, the researchers said, are its
size and comprehensiveness, and the opportunity it affords
researchers to compare and correlate data from a large sample in
many different domains of life.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of physical health, the study found ``a strong
sense of optimism among people in midlife about their health and
the prospects for it in the future.'' More than 70 percent of those
surveyed described their health as excellent, though that number
dropped about 20 percent among older respondents when they were
asked how good they expected their health to be in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   And though survey participants were likely to underestimate
their risk of serious illnesses like cancer and heart disease, said
Dr. Paul Cleary, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical
School, who analyzed some of the survey's health data, more than 95
percent agreed that ``keeping healthy depends on things I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Back problems (22 percent), arthritis or rheumatism (21
percent), anxiety, depression or other emotional difficulties (21
percent), stomach trouble (20 percent) and high blood pressure or
hypertension (19 percent) were the most frequent complaints among
study participants from the ages of 35 to 64.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the study's most intriguing findings, Dr. Ronald C.
Kessler, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical
School, found in an analysis of the survey data that 18.8 percent
of respondents reported having attended a self-help group at some
point in their lives, up 67 percent from the 1970s, while 7.1
percent had attended a self-help group in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   The increase, Kessler said, probably reflected increasingly
restricted access to health care, and the desire of many Americans
to play an active role in their own treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is often cited as a difficult transition for women,
but the MacArthur study did not support this view. A majority of
postmenopausal women said they experienced ``only relief'' when
their menstrual periods stopped, while only 2 percent reported
feeling ``only regret.'' As for the physical stresses of menopause,
even among women in their 50s, the peak period for menopausal
symptoms, half of those surveyed reported having no hot flashes at
all; only 25 percent said they had hot flashes ``once a week or
more,'' and just 13 percent reported having them ``almost every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alice Rossi, professor emerita of sociology at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who analyzed the menopause
data, concluded, ``The Gail Sheehy image of the menopausal woman
with sweat running down her face is just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   A substantial number of survey respondents reported having made
accommodations in their work lives to care for children. Not
surprisingly, women were more likely than men to have cut back on
work hours or switched to more flexible jobs, while men were more
apt to report working longer hours to meet the cost of having
children.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high rate of divorce in the United States, a
majority of the middle-aged Americans in the MacArthur survey
reported that their marriages or relationships were stable and
relatively happy. Ninety percent agreed that it was ``not very
likely'' or ``not likely at all'' that their relationships would
eventually break up. More than half responded ``never'' when asked
how often during the past year they thought their relationship was
in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the researchers found that women in the survey were much
more likely than men to feel they shouldered the bulk of household
chores and child care. And men were more likely both to
overestimate their contribution and to underestimate how fairly
chores were divided.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking differences between men and women in
the MacArthur study appeared in their scores on the measure of
psychological well-being developed by Dr. Carol D. Ryff, director
of the Institute of Aging at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Both women and men, as they age, show gains in the areas of
personal autonomy and effective management of the surrounding
world, Dr. Ryff said, with women gaining in more dramatic
increments during the midlife years. In the areas of personal
growth and the quality of relationships with other people, however,
women demonstrate a clear advantage.

   Women, Dr. Ryff said, are at greater risk for depression than
men. ``But there are also important strengths in their
psychological profile,'' she said, a fact often overlooked by
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if the MacArthur study reveals midlife as a time of relative
well-being for both men and women, it also points out the risks of
old age. Both sexes, in the oldest age ranges, showed losses in
``personal growth,'' and in the sense that their lives had purpose,
with women evidencing a more dramatic plunge in ``purpose of life''
than men. The message for people in midlife, Dr. Ryff said, is to
``be mindful of what's ahead.''

   REYKJAVIK, Iceland _ This remote island is known around the
world for its eerily beautiful but spectacularly punishing
landscape, carved almost beyond reason from volcanoes and ice. It
is known for winters that are shrouded in darkness and summers that
are punch-drunk with light. It is known for the fish, particularly
cod and shrimp, that make up 75 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   But Iceland has another precious resource. It has a nearly
homogeneous population, whittled down over the years by natural
disaster and disease, carrying nearly the same genetic codes as the
Viking explorers who settled here more than 1,100 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such homogeneity is greatly prized by researchers, because it
means that genetic anomalies can be more easily identified in
studies of the origin of diseases. And now, in a brave new
experiment that is being closely watched around the world,
Iceland's 270,000 residents are poised to share the genealogical,
genetic and medical information that makes them who they are for
the goal of advancing science.
</P>
<P>
   But the audacity of the plan _ and what it bodes for the future
_ has provoked a bitter battle both within and outside of Iceland,
a country smaller than Kentucky that has suddenly found itself at
the forefront of a world debate over the ethics and uses of genetic
research.
</P>
<P>
   In December, after a fierce public discussion that raged for
months, Iceland's Parliament passed a law giving an Icelandic
biotechnology concern the right to develop a giant database
combining the health records, genealogical backgrounds, and DNA
profiles of every person in Iceland.
</P>
<P>
   The concern, Decode Genetics, which is to have exclusive rights
to market the database abroad for 12 years, says the information
will be used to answer a host of questions about the nature and
origins of hundreds of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan, including the Icelandic government and
many scientists, say it may produce a wealth of knowledge that is
too exciting to pass up. But opponents, including many prominent
researchers in Iceland and the United States, argue that it is a
terrifying example of how science can become so carried away by
dreams of glory and profits that it abandons good research practice
and runs roughshod over the rights of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see Iceland as a precedent for a new style of medical
research that will involve not just Icelanders, but people around
the world,'' said Hank Greely, a professor of law at Stanford
University, who studies the ethical, legal and social issues of
genetics, and who has deep reservations about how Decode intends to
collect and use its data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advances in the speed and cost of genetic analysis are about
to make it possible to collect huge amounts of clinical and genetic
data from hundreds of thousands of people and process it through
powerful computers. Iceland is the first example we've got of this
kind of large scale correlation of data, and I'd like it to be done
in a way that was ethically right.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Icelanders, however, resent the meddling of outsiders who
think they know what is good for Iceland, the world's oldest
democracy. ``People adopt a view from afar and think they
understand what's going on in a place that's culturally very
different from their own,'' said Gisli Palsson, director of the
Institute of Anthropology at the University of Iceland, who
supports the database. ``But there was a fierce debate for months,
with public participation, and one has to conclude that it has been
an informed and lengthy discussion, a democratic process.''
</P>
<P>
   Decode's project is simple and breath-takingly ambitious,
relying on a happy confluence of factors.
</P>
<P>
   First, Iceland comes close to having what is known as a closed
population, meaning that there has been little immigration to muddy
the genetic pool over the centuries. As the islanders' language has
remained virtually unchanged for 1,000 years, so has their genetic
makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Icelanders are walking around with a large segment of the
DNA that their ancestors had,'' said Kari Stefansson, Decode's
exuberant president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Stefansson, a former professor of neurology and pathology at the
Harvard Medical School, has a larger-than-life personality and
grand vision that have drawn almost as much attention as the work
his company is doing. ``When someone has a genetic disease here,''
Stefansson said, ``you can almost invariably trace it back to one
individual who brought the disease into the community.''
</P>
<P>
   The country also has a passion for genealogical record-keeping,
so much so that many residents can trace their family trees back
500 years or more. And it has a universal, state-financed
health-care system that since 1915 has kept comprehensive records
of every patient's medical history. All this information _ along
with the DNA samples of willing Icelanders _ is to be gathered
together in Decode's gigantic database.
</P>
<P>
   ``A homogeneous population with great genealogical and medical
records is the scarcest resource in human genetics today,'' said
Jeffrey Gulcher, Decode's vice president for research and
development. ``The notion that you can actually take a list of
patients and link them together with genealogy to begin a study is
one of the most powerful aspects of the work we're doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, when you look at people who've lived over the
age of 95 and ask how they are clustered together in the
population, it's amazing how you can see that longevity is passed
down from generation to generation. In Iceland, we have the
opportunity of looking at every single individual who lived to a
certain age. We know when they were born and when they died, and it
allows us to do, for the first time, a population-based study of
longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say they are alarmed at the prospect of
concentrating so much information in one place and worried that the
Icelandic people do not understand what they are getting themselves
into. It is not clear what the benefits of Decode's research will
actually be, they say, and it is very dangerous for a nation to
give so much of itself away when it is not sure of what it will get
in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not right to use a population as a commodity in this
way,'' said Jorunn Erla Eyjfjord, the head of molecular genetics at
the Icelandic Cancer Society. ``What they're doing probably won't
hurt me personally, or Iceland now, but I fear that we could be
used as a well-defined guinea pig population in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But Ragnheidur Haraldsdottir, deputy permanent secretary of
Iceland's Ministry of Health, said that the data base would prove
invaluable to Iceland. ``This will enable us to build up an
outstanding computerized health-care record system for every health
care institution in this country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a country that routinely loses scientists to foreign
institutions, the company has worked to reverse the brain-drain by
luring researchers back home.
</P>
<P>
   Debate over the plan, continuing among researchers in spite of
the new legislation, broadly focuses on three points: privacy,
consent and the still uneasy intersection between genetics and
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say they fear that it will be impossible for the
database to guarantee people's privacy, even with sophisticated
computer protections. They worry that sensitive information could
be traced back to people and used against them, in hiring, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure they will have a lot of safeguards, but it will be
relatively easy to break the codes when you have so much genetic
and genealogical and health information tied together,'' said Tomas
Zoega, chairman of the ethical council at the Icelandic Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Not likely, Stefansson says, asserting that the company will
``use every single method that exists in the world to maintain the
privacy of the database.'' That includes removing identifying
features like people's names, encrypting the data three separate
times, making it impossible to winnow information down to groups
smaller than 10 people, and limiting access to the database.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have also criticized Decode's plans to collect its
medical data from everyone who does not explicitly opt out of the
program. The ethical approach, they say, would be to use informed
consent, in which participants actively agree to take part in
specific studies, rather than ceding their records for whatever
purpose the researchers want.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's akin to treating people as objects rather than human
beings,'' said Jon Johannes Jonsson, an associate professor in the
department of biochemistry and molecular biology at the University
of Iceland Medical School. ``I flatly reject the notion that you
have to make concessions on patients' rights in order to do human
genetic research.''
</P>
<P>
   But Decode says that its research conforms to internationally
accepted ethical standards. And while the medical records are to be
gathered on the basis of presumed consent, the far more sensitive
genetic information _ DNA obtained through Icelanders' blood
samples _ will be gathered only with the explicit permission of the
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the opponents worry about how the other companies will
use the data they buy from Decode. ``Science has a lot at stake in
making sure that people don't feel cheated and embittered when they
take part in research,'' said Greely of Stanford. ``I worry that
there will be an episode which leaves the research subjects feeling
unhappy, mistreated, resentful and burned.''
</P>
<P>
   With a staff of 250 and $12 million in venture capital money,
mostly from the United States, Decode is already Iceland's biggest
biotechnology company, stirring fears from rivals that it will soak
up most of the country's research money and make it harder for them
to compete.
</P>
<P>
   While it waits for the government to grant a license for its
database this spring, Decode has already begun a host of genetic
studies that are seeking to identify the genes _ or combinations of
genes _ responsible for 20 diseases, including multiple sclerosis,
endometriosis, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease and
osteo-arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, it is using blood samples from more than 10,000
Icelandic volunteers, as well as the genealogical histories of
580,000 of the 750,000 or so Icelanders who have ever lived,
including everyone alive today. Its research is being supported by
the pharmaceutical company Hoffman-La Roche, which has agreed to
pay the company as much as $200 million over five years if Decode
can identify the genes for a list of 12 of those 20 diseases.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this agreement, Hoffman-La Roche has pledged to
provide free to Iceland any medicine it may develop from Decode's
work.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gulcher said, the company has begun to make progress
toward finding the genes associated with multiple sclerosis,
schizophrenia, arthritis, manic depression, and essential tremor, a
disease that causes involuntary shaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're doing is extending the age-old practice of
understanding familial risk factors to bring a greater precision to
health care,'' said Jonathan K.C. Knowles, the head of global
pharmaceutical research for Hoffman-La Roche. Saying that research
carried out by companies like Decode represents ``the paradigm
shift in medicine,'' Knowles added that by finding the genetic
underpinnings of various diseases, researchers could begin to
develop treatments for people who were not sick, but who had a
higher risk of falling ill.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen what will happen when Decode begins
collecting the medical data and blood samples, a process it hopes
to begin next fall. While Decode says that the overwhelming
majority of Icelandic doctors support its efforts, pointing to a
petition against the database that was signed by only a fifth of
the island's 700 physicians, the Icelandic Medical Association says
that opposition is much more widespread.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is determined to go forward. ``We feel that we
might be able to contribute something to the world,'' said Mrs.
Haraldsdottir. ``Some people would maintain that it would be
unethical not to try to use the unique resources that we have in
Iceland to try to improve the health of Icelanders, and hopefully
of others.''

INTIMACY: RELATIONSHIPS CAN'T BE BUILT ON SEX ALONE  
 (WITH INTIMACY-SIDE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG CARROLL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It is one of the great ironies of our culture.
Approximately 30 years after the sexual revolution in America, we
claim to be so enlightened about sex, yet we remain so ignorant
about intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Our national obsession with sex has resurfaced all over again in
the past few months with the Clinton-Lewinsky affair in full view.
For something we still find so difficult to talk about in private,
sex continues to receive very public preoccupation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton thing has raised awareness,'' says therapist
Marilyn Murray of Psychological Counseling Services in Scottsdale,
Ariz. ``People are re-evaluating what they thought about
sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, perhaps intimacy finally will receive sufficient
discourse. Murray says that a relationship's cord consists of four
strands of intimacy _ intellectual, emotional, spiritual and
physical _ and if any one of the strands is damaged, so, too, is
the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, this is more complex than we've been willing to admit
to ourselves. If sex is a sprint, then intimacy is a marathon for
which our society of instant gratification seems to have little
interest in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexuality is an incredibly complicated area,'' says Murray's
colleague, Ralph Earle, who estimates that the Psychological
Counseling Services practice he founded is ``more than 50 percent''
devoted to sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's possible for a couple to have good emotional intercourse
and not have a satisfying sex life, just as it's possible to have
lots of physical intercourse and not have a good relationship.
Those things have stayed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray, described by Earle as an ``emotional heart surgeon,''
conducts programs that have drawn intimacy-challenged clients to
the Valley from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``intensives,'' these typically require a couple's
participation in what amounts to a jump-start for a faltering
relationship for a full week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always start out by saying that as human beings, one of our
greatest desires is for intimacy,'' Murray says. ``We're made that
way. The physical part often comes along as a result of the other
three being very good. The lifelong successes are those who've
developed the other three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex alone usually doesn't do it. When we get any couple in
here, I almost never start at the physical. I say, `Tell me where
you are in these other three areas.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotional intimacy is the one we end up working the most on.
Often they're not sharing what they think or feel, even about the
average, everyday types of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The renowned sex therapists William Masters and Virginia Johnson
addressed this deeper level of love almost 25 years ago in their
book ``The Pleasure Bond: A New Look at Sexuality and
Commitment.'' &QL; 
GROW OR DIE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimacy must be nourished by a mutuality between a man and a
woman that may include, but must go beyond, the physical fact of
intercourse,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intimacy, like any other emotion, must either grow and become
deeper or it must wither and die.''
</P>
<P>
   Men and women often define intimacy quite differently, says
Earle, a former minister who trained with Masters and Johnson
before going into private practice in 1970. He is considered a
national expert on sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men usually use the word `intimacy' for `sex,' '' Earle says.
``Women will not use it that way. The problem is that a person may
think he is being intimate when he's not being intimate at all. It
happens in many, many situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to get a couple to define what would be satisfying in
(begin ital) emotional (end ital) intercourse. It can be tough to
get men to work through those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Murray has observed a shift in traditional roles in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a person who's more analytical, they'll be the
person who is less emotional _ male or female,'' she says. ``The
one who's more artistic, freer with emotion, that's the one who
wants and demands a lot more intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we see men saying `I'm the one who talks about feelings.'
That's kind of exciting, to see men step up to the plate and be
initiators.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Terri, an East Valley couple in their 40s, discovered
that they were in an unhealthy relationship shortly after they
married in 1991. &QL; 
BREAKING DOWN BARRIERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After three years of struggling for some semblance of intimacy,
they found themselves in one of Murray's intensives.
</P>
<P>
   When Murray first met Steve and Terri, she had them sized up
within minutes. Steve's difficult relationship with his mother and
his two previous marriages had convinced him that love equals pain.
</P>
<P>
   He was battle-weary, and it was obvious that his barriers were
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terri was trying to break down my walls, and I'm sitting there
throwing hand grenades at her,'' says Steve, who had a pattern of
verbally abusing his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to realize that this stuff wasn't about her, and I had
to quit trying to bring it into the relationship. I learned that,
yes, there are some people in life who've hurt me. But she's not
one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I looked at how she loved me, (I saw that) she loved me
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray and the Psychological Counseling Services staff also
worked with Terri, who had been married once before, on learning to
set boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   A classic pleaser, she always pursued Steve whenever he
retreated from her. Their come-here, go-away pas de deux was
maddening for both of them.
</P>
<P>
   Over time _ ``They needed a forklift for our file,'' Terri said,
joking _ the work done in therapy began to take hold. Steve
realized that it was safe to let Terri love him and that intimacy
was his responsibility as well as hers.
</P>
<P>
   But their marriage still wasn't good enough for the newly
emboldened Terri, who says the couple existed as roommates for so
long that she was about to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The abuse had stopped, but I had to say `I know we can do
better than this,' '' she recalls. ``The marriage was bland, it was
boring for both of us. We were stuck in a flat, boring,
not-terrible marriage _ like a lot of people.'' &QL; 
A WAKE-UP CALL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Terri's threat to leave Steve for good _ they had separated
before for a brief period _ was the wake-up call he needed to put
forth an extra effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I discovered this was what I wanted and that there was a
huge danger of losing it,'' he says, ``I began to get real serious
that something had to change.''
</P>
<P>
   What kept them going through the ordeal, they say, was the
belief of Murray and the other counselors that they truly loved
each other. Through it all, even the worst parts, the couple
managed to faithfully schedule their weekly date night, getting
away from their blended family of three children to spend time
together.
</P>
<P>
   Terri says she made the important discovery that intimacy must
work first on an individual level before it can have a chance in a
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was a single mom,'' she says, ``I was (begin ital)
doing (end ital) instead of (begin ital) being. (end ital) How can
you develop intimacy with another if you don't have time to spend
with yourself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to know yourself takes time. You need to create those
quiet spaces in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray says it's possible for our society to get intimacy right
if we want to.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope for healing is greater today than it's ever been,''
she insists, saying that advances in counseling have paralleled
those in medicine. ``The knowledge is there, but are people willing
to take advantage of it?''
</P>
<P>
   A good start might be a radical change in our orientation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the mystique of seeing sex as special or intimate has
been lost,'' Murray says. ``People take sex for granted, rather
than seeing it as something beautiful, designed to bring a couple
together in the deepest way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy sexual relationship starts in the mind. What have
you done to build a good, healthy relationship all the way around?
It's being sensitive and caring in all these other areas, that's
what ends up making sex good. Then it's making love instead of just
having sex.''
</P>
<P>
   What's holding us back, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are afraid to risk revealing ourselves,'' says
Terri, looking back on her own experience. ``We're so
self-protective. We've had all this exposure to sex, but we've also
been inundated with a type of psychology where we just protect
ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too afraid to say, `Here's who I really, truly am. This
is the pain I've been through. This is what I love. This is what I
think about when I'm alone.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody sells intimacy,'' Steve says. ``But everybody sells sex
_ we're inundated by it. Where do you see modeled a good intimate
relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Steve and Terri, it seems that we just did. &QL;

WHY I'M COMMITTED TO BEING CELIBATE  
 (SIDEBAR TO INTIMACY) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUG CARROLL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - I am a 42-year-old divorced man. I'm not having sex
with anyone, nor will I until I remarry. That's (begin ital) if
(end ital) I remarry.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, this means there's a chance I will not have sex for the
rest of my life.
</P>
<P>
   You probably think I'm strange, and you'd better believe I feel
that way sometimes. The celibate lifestyle I've chosen for myself
is a struggle, but obviously I'm convinced it's right for me or I
wouldn't be committed to it.
</P>
<P>
   And I certainly wouldn't be sharing it with 600,000 of my
closest friends, as I am here.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you care?
</P>
<P>
   You should if you've had trouble building true intimacy in
relationships. I'm talking about getting to know someone from the
inside out, soul to soul, no shortcuts. Isn't that what we all long
for _ someone with whom we connect on the deepest possible level?
</P>
<P>
   Sex often gets in the way of that, if we're telling ourselves
the truth. Sex can arrest the development of a relationship, giving
us a false sense of closeness to someone. Just because we're close
physically doesn't mean we're in even the same area code
emotionally or spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   In a mate, I want intimacy in (begin ital) all (end ital)
respects and won't settle for less. Can't have that? The bar's too
high? Fine, I'll stay single and celibate.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I know what you're thinking: ``This guy is a geek! He's
probably just a nerd who can't get a woman!''
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, I could be having sex. Women enjoy my company _ and
I enjoy theirs. In fact, knowing that I won't be having sex unless
I'm married again frees me to really get to know women as people,
not as mere objects of desire.
</P>
<P>
   Do women think this is weird? I'm sure some of them do. And I'm
equally sure some do not, agreeing that it's worth the wait. For
the right woman, this would be the best wedding gift I could give
her. If that sounds quaint, so be it.
</P>
<P>
   You see, it's not that sex isn't important to me. On the
contrary, it's important enough that I want to protect my heart and
the heart of someone special. Once this bridge is crossed in a
relationship, there's no turning back without considerable pain.
</P>
<P>
   I've learned some difficult lessons there; I'm sure many of us
have. It's our own fault if we don't apply what we've learned.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, how can I instruct my son, now 9, to abstain if I'm
not doing so myself? He will see right through me and would be
correct in calling me a hypocrite. If he is to become a man of
integrity, it must begin with me.
</P>
<P>
   Do I miss having sex? Are you nuts? Of course I do! How could
anyone (begin ital) not (end ital) miss such a profound expression
of human emotion? I do my best to channel that energy into other
areas. Daily exercise, for one, helps in easing the tension. So
does meditation. It's a challenge, and I won't pretend that it's
not.
</P>
<P>
   If you still think I'm strange, I understand. Clearly, this is a
road less traveled in our sex-saturated society.
</P>
<P>
   However, one of the best things I've discovered about midlife is
that I don't care so much anymore about what others may think. I'm
me _ and I like it. I'm through with apologizing for who I am.
</P>
<P>
   If your conscience is telling you to wait on sex, then its voice
is the only one you should listen to. It doesn't matter where
you've been; this is about where you're going.
</P>
<P>
   Now you know you're not going there alone. &QL;

MICROSOFT MADE THE DIFFERENCE FOR THE '98 S&AMP;P 500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: If you peruse Tuesday's stock tables regularly, you may
wonder how in the world the market's major indicators turned in
such magnificent performances last year.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the Dow Jones industrial average, which had a respectable
gain of 16.1 percent. This venerable group of 30 blue-chip stocks
is really too narrow a gauge to be a good proxy for the overall
market.
</P>
<P>
   The 26.7 percent surge by the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, on
the other hand, would seem a much better measure of how the market
fared. The same goes for the Nasdaq composite, which was up 39.6
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Given the impressive performance of the S&AMP;P 500 and Nasdaq
composite, the annual-return numbers in the right-hand column of
Tuesday's stock tables are a puzzlement. Those columns in recent
weeks reveal at least as many losers as winners, which might lead
casual observers to wonder how aggregate performances could have
been so strong given all the apparent individual weakness.
</P>
<P>
   A recent analysis by Dean Investment Associates sheds some light
on how misleading the S&AMP;P 500 performance was last year.
</P>
<P>
   Only slightly more than 56 percent of the S&AMP;P 500 stocks
recorded gains in share price last year. Many of the stocks that
were either flat or losers weren't dogs, either. They included such
corporate luminaries as Allstate, BankAmerica, Coca-Cola, Delta Air
Lines, Disney, DuPont, Gillette, Marriott, Merrill Lynch, 3M, J.P.
Morgan and Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Given the disappointing performance of these top-drawer
companies, the obvious question is how the S&AMP;P 500 managed an
increase that was far better than its average gains since the late
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, the Dean analysis explains, has to do with the way
the S&AMP;P 500 is weighted by market capitalization.
</P>
<P>
   Although the index itself rose 26.7 percent last year, the
average increase for an S&AMP;P 500 stock was only 10.9 percent. More
tellingly, the median stock was up only 4.3 percent. This means
half rose more and half rose less (or declined).
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the overall index's spectacular showing
goes to Microsoft. Its market value more than doubled, and the
resulting $170 billion gain more than covered the slippage of 165
S&AMP;P 500 stocks with market values of under $10 billion that
declined in value last year.
</P>
<P>
   Although a universe of 500 stocks implies a broad-based
measurement, just over 44 percent of the S&AMP;P's return last year was
accounted for by Microsoft, Wal-Mart, GE, Lucent, Cisco, IBM,
Intel, Dell, Pfizer and Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Without the value gains of those companies, which make up only 2
percent of the 500 components, Dean notes, the
capitalization-weighted return for the index is less than 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's the lesson here for investors? If you buy a mutual fund
structured to track the S&AMP;P 500, you're not as diversified as you
may imagine. Your index fund is, as a practical matter, excessively
dependent on the stock performance of a relatively small number of
giant companies. Those companies in recent years, fortunately, have
been going like gangbusters.
</P>
<P>
   If this trend peters out, however, many index fund investors
will discover they're a lot more vulnerable to stock market
downdrafts than they realized.

RIO GRANDE AREA IS HARD ON HUMANS, BUT FINE FOR FOWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH TEXAS _ At half past 5 o'clock, the sun still is an hour
from setting, but already, as shadows grow longer, there's a touch
of evening coolness in the air.
</P>
<P>
   In the basin of a dry pond, ringed close around by mesquite and
scrub, we come upon another transient camp with scattered papers,
the stubs of smokes, empty five-gallon plastic water jugs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande is just 100 straight-line miles to the south.
From the air, we're told, one actually can see paths beaten not by
the hooves of animals but by the feet of people pouring north
across the border in relentless waves, driven by need, drawn by
hope.
</P>
<P>
   Their way leads through this area we've been hunting. And the
hidden resting places _ of which we've run across a dozen or more,
all abandoned _ are squalid way stations on a journey that must
come, in many cases, to a desperate end.
</P>
<P>
   For a couple of quail hunters from the Middle West, the
experience in this harsh and prickly piece of country has been a
wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about everything here,'' said our host, John Howe, ``will
either stick you, scrape you, sting you or bite you.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's true, the first impression is mainly of dust and
thorns. Yet the variety and abundance of wildlife the land supports
is amazing.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon, when we came back from lunch and our
heat-of-midday break, we found that one of John's friends had taken
a feral pig, a great coal-black, bristly brute.
</P>
<P>
   Armadillos, faster afoot than you'd imagine from their shape,
scampered away to the side of the hunting car and disappeared
behind cactus clumps.
</P>
<P>
   Peccaries, the pig's native relative, could be seen ghosting
through the thickets ahead. In the bright sky turned a white-headed
hawklike bird that John called a Mexican eagle. Deer were
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   And such quail!
</P>
<P>
   By this day's end we'll have seen 14 coveys. In all, in one full
day and parts of two others, there'll have been 25 coveys. It's the
kind of hunting that in many regions is barely remembered.
</P>
<P>
   John's wife, Linda, has driven out from town to spend this last
hour with us.
</P>
<P>
   She and their friend Conley Juban ride together in Conley's
Jeep. John leads the way in his magnificent wheeled schooner, the
open hunting vehicle he himself designed and built for following
the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Low to the west, the sun paints red the undersides of the
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   ``One more covey,'' John says. ``Just one to end the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The light begins to fail. Then, at the very last, there's a dog
on point ahead, and another backing. We walk in behind them, and
the birds come up _ fine big covey of 15 or more.
</P>
<P>
   But the quail are only quick things half-seen, twisting through
mesquite branches in the blue of evening. And no one shoots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better dress our birds here in the field,'' John says.
</P>
<P>
   Unfastening a latch on the side of the vehicle, he lowers a
hinged panel to create a working table. In doing so, he reveals the
wheeled schooner's final miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've put the guns away, maybe somebody would care
for a refreshment. Bring the ice, Conley,'' John Howe says.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the hinged panel is a well-stocked bar.
</P>
<P>
   After Texas, quail hunting may never seem the same again.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ gun, Fern says.
</P>
<P>
   He never pulled a gun. Instead, he began sharpening the butcher
knife.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going after Nettie and Jake,'' Fern says, referring to
Nettie's beau. ``He was going to kill that S.O.B.''
</P>
<P>
   Fern, then 11, huddled with sister Norma, 13. They decided Norma
should go for help. She slipped out the kitchen door and called
police about 11 p.m. from a neighbor's house. Feigning calm, Fern
took Linda to a rocking chair and fed her milk from a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   When the police walked in with Norma, Oldham was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officers asked: ``What's going on here, Mr. Oldham?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he answered. ``I'm just sharpening a knife here for
the girls to use in the kitchen.''
</P>
<P>
   He sure could think fast on his feet, Ed says.
</P>
<P>
   The officers checked the kitchen cupboards and found them bare.
A former neighbor says Oldham took off running through the woods
behind the house. Fern doesn't remember that. She remembers that
they handcuffed her dad.
</P>
<P>
   The children rode in a police car to the juvenile detention
center, where each received fresh clothes.
</P>
<P>
   According to newspaper accounts, Oldham refused to answer police
questions the next morning. Police considered sending him to a
hospital for observation but instead released him to the custody of
two brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Losing her mother, and then being isolated from her family in an
orphanage, was especially hard on Fern, a mama's girl. She lived on
the second floor while Norma was housed on the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to visit back and forth,'' Fern said. ``The
only time we got to visit was if we saw each other out in the yard.
That just about killed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the knife incident, their father cared enough to visit
the children occasionally at their foster homes and orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   One year _ Fern thinks it was 1947 _ most of the family shared
Easter at an aunt and uncle's house. That's the last time Fern
remembers seeing Linda, who had a burn on her bottom from sitting
on a hot furnace grate.
</P>
<P>
   Ed's last memory of Linda is different. He is unsure of the
date. His father picked up him and his brother, Bud, at their
orphanage and took them to Linda's foster home. That's where Ed
remembers Linda crawling down stairs backward.
</P>
<P>
   The memories are so old, and Linda was so young, that neither
Fern nor Ed is certain of the color of her eyes or hair.
</P>
<P>
   One day Fern and Norma were taken from their orphanage to see
their caseworker. Her message was short: Linda had been adopted by
a well-to-do Kansas City area family.
</P>
<P>
   Fern remembers thinking: ``Gee, she's gone. We'll never find
her.''
</P>
<P>
   She believes Linda was between 2 and 3 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Their father opposed the adoption because he didn't want to lose
Linda, Fern says. He died at a Kansas City boarding house in 1953,
when he was 50. No one performed an autopsy, so the cause of death
was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Fern and Norma discussed finding Linda in the mid-1960s but
didn't know where to turn. Older sister Nettie opposed their
search. Fern is unsure why.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Fern enlisted help from her children and her
husband. They searched records, wrote the courts, drove through the
old neighborhood. But they turned up nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Ed called the family's former caseworker in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are calling to ask me any questions about Linda,'' she
said, ``I can't tell you anything, and I won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed told her, ``Have a good life,'' and hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Most early searching was wasted, Fern says, because they had
Linda's birth date and foster family name wrong.
</P>
<P>
   An aunt thought Linda had stayed with someone named Bybee, not
McBee. Not until Nettie died in 1995 did Fern find that photograph
with the correct name on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Even that avenue appears to be of little help.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Scott and Estaline McBee cared for Linda, first on Quincy
and later in Independence. A phone call to a McBee in the current
Kansas City phone book helped unravel the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Estaline McBee liked Linda so much she kept three pictures of
the baby until she died in 1987. One is a 5-by-7-inch enlargement
hand-tinted to show Linda with blue eyes and a pink smock. McBee's
youngest daughter discovered the pictures in a box of her mother's
belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked in with the photographs was a yellowed newspaper clipping
from Jan. 11, 1946. It shows the six Oldham children the morning
after they were taken from their father.
</P>
<P>
   So Estaline McBee, who kept many foster children over the years,
had known Linda's background.
</P>
<P>
   But if she knew who adopted Linda, she left no clues.
</P>
<P>
   After Nettie died three years ago, Fern discovered Linda's
original birth certificate in Nettie's possessions. At last they
had Linda's correct birth date: May 25, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   It was a key clue, says Fern, who already knew Linda was born at
General Hospital No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has helped, too, Ed says. Many people are searching
online for relatives, and some offered suggestions. One told Judith
to get a list of people born on Linda's birth date from the
Missouri Bureau of Vital Records.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state created a new birth certificate in Linda's
adopted name, that name _ not her original name _ appears on the
list.
</P>
<P>
   But which one of nearly 100 females is she?
</P>
<P>
   A way to find out is to eliminate girls whose birth names never
changed. It's simply a matter of cross-checking the list against
birth announcements published 54 years ago in Missouri newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Fern recently scoured newspapers on microfilm at the
Kansas City Public Library. In two hours they eliminated 14 names.
More than 80 remain.
</P>
<P>
   It will be easier if Linda is looking for them, too. One recent
clue provides Ed and Fern hope. It comes from Mary Grizzle, who
grew up across the street from the Oldhams and still lives in the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago _ perhaps in the 1970s or 1980s _ someone knocked
on Grizzle's door and asked about the Oldham family. She cannot
remember the person's name or whether a man, a woman or a couple
knocked.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Fern exchanged glances. They pushed Grizzle for more
details, but the memory was too faint.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was Linda.
</P>
<P>
   Their prayer is that Linda will read this article and respond.
</P>
<P>
   If not, they will keep searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to get desperate,'' Ed said. ``We feel as if
we do not have much time, and it seems that all doors are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   They realize Linda may be dead, may not know she is adopted or
may not care. Fern says her brother, Bud, is worried that Linda
won't want a reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she doesn't want to be involved with us, that's OK,'' Fern
said. ``We'll know she's OK, and we can live with that.''

   KINSLEY, Kan. _ until the snow blew.
</P>
<P>
   In good years, they made money. In bad years, it was nip and
tuck.
</P>
<P>
   Yet what they got they gave back to generations of people in the
form of vivid memories. Maybe it wasn't the circus that came to the
bigger towns. But in the backwater communities the carnival was
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we had this legacy all around us,'' Ploger said. ``And
about 10 years ago we starting putting it together.''
</P>
<P>
   People made donations of carnival items they'd squirreled away
over the years. Children and grandchildren of the Brodbeck family
pitched in, finding old stuff out in barns, stuff packed away in
attics. Donations came from all over _ swords from a sword
swallower, old carnival ``joints'' (booths), brasswork from rides,
even a scale from a guy who for 52 years made a comfortable living
guessing people's weight.
</P>
<P>
   Money was raised locally. Plus, Kinsley acquired a $60,000
community development grant from the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only one in the country,'' Ploger said of the
museum. ``We've heard of other groups who want to start museums,
but they just can't seem to get off the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley has never really had that problem. But then maybe it had
an edge because carnivals and circuses have one thing in common _ a
midway.
</P>
<P>
   And what's the sign here say, almost serendipitously? ``Midway
U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of fits. Even if here is ``out there.''

SOME FEAR NEW TALLGRASS PRAIRIE PRESERVE MAY WIND UP AS A CATTLE
RANCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MANSUR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Advocates of a tallgrass prairie park in Kansas
envisioned a vast expanse of waving grasses with elk, bison and
antelope. Now, some fear that what they will get is just another
cattle ranch.
</P>
<P>
   At least one prairie advocate is concerned that that's what is
in store for the new 10,894-acre National Tallgrass Prairie
Preserve in the Flint Hills of Chase County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan being proposed by the (National) Park Service would
obligate 9,000 to 10,000 acres to pasture management with cattle,''
Ron Klataske said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service last month released its preferred plan
for the park's operation. It took public comments on the plan in
special open houses last week in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Klataske, a longtime advocate of a national tallgrass park,
represents the Kansas Audubon Council and is on the 13-member
advisory committee set up by Congress to help plan the park's
management. To him, cattle grazing is more appropriate for private
land than for a tallgrass prairie preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tallgrass prairie national preserve, not a federal
grazing allotment,'' Klataske said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Miller, the park's superintendent, said Friday that he
thought the place would live up to its expectations as the nation's
outstanding example of a tallgrass preserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is going to expect the tallgrass, and there's going
to be areas very accessible where people can see it and get into
that tallgrass,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   The major influences on the tallgrass are grazing and fire,
Miller said. And there's little scientific data to prove that bison
are better for the health or diversity of a tallgrass ecosystem
than cattle, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only 70 percent to 80 percent of the preserve will be grazed by
cattle, Miller said. About 1,000 acres will be set aside for 25 to
30 bison. But that does not mean the park will be mostly about
cattle ranching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under this plan, the majority of the land would continue to be
grazed by cattle, but I think you need to look at cattle as a
grazer to manage the tallgrass prairie.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Pritchard of the National Park Trust, a nonprofit private
group established to purchase land for conservation, agrees with
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to manage this for the tallgrass prairie,''
Pritchard said. ``And tallgrass prairie and bison are not
necessarily synonymous.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the bison park. And it's not a cattle park. It's a
grass park, a tallgrass prairie park.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard said the planning included discussions with many
scientists who convinced him and the National Park Service that a
tallgrass ecosystem could be just as healthy grazed by cattle as by
native ungulates such as bison or elk.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are equal, Klataske asked, why not use bison as the
dominant grazers?
</P>
<P>
   ``If cattle were the same as bison, and livestock are the same
as wildlife, why wouldn't the National Park Service manage the
Yellowstone National Park with cattle, sheep and horses rather than
manage bison and elk and other wildlife that aren't as easily
managed?'' Klataske asked.
</P>
<P>
   Klataske suggested that cattle had been chosen because of
intense lobbying from the livestock industry and the restrictions
of a cattle-grazing lease that governs most of the park's land.
</P>
<P>
   The park is an unusual public-private arrangement in which the
National Park Trust will own all but 180 acres, a compromise worked
out in Congress to appease Kansas interests concerned about federal
ownership of the land, once operated as the Spring Hill or Z Bar
ranch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 the National Park Trust sold the cattle-grazing rights
to Ed Bass, a Texas millionaire, for 35 years as part of a lease
that was little- publicized.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost about $2 million to buy back the lease rights to
all of the property, Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard and Miller said that no one had exerted any political
pressure and that the planners were told not to consider the lease
as a barrier to any of their plans.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, there are practical reasons for not quickly
populating the park with many bison, Pritchard said. They take a
long time to socialize, and the park is probably too small for a
large herd of bison, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The way cattle are grazed on the land under the lease, Miller
said, will have to be altered to allow a more diverse prairie
ecosystem to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Miller stresses that much progress has been made in the last few
years, especially in light of the controversy over federal
ownership and other issues that dogged the park proposal for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hope people will look at this plan and see a lot of things
in it that they really support,'' Miller said. ``In order to do
this, we're going to need a lot of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be exciting to see this unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   To obtain a copy of the National Park Service's plan, contact
the agency in Cottonwood Falls at (316) 273-6034. Public comments
will be accepted until March 5.

KANSAS TOWN IS PERMANENT HOME FOR THE CARNIVAL, AND ALL ITS
TRADITIONS

   KINSLEY, Kan. _ For years, about the only thing that's ever
stirred folks to pause here on a seemingly endless trip across the
high plains is the big sign at the junction of U.S. 50, 56 and 183.
</P>
<P>
   One arrow points west, reading, ``San Francisco, 1561 miles,''
and another points opposite, advising, ``New York, 1561 miles.'' As
the sign says, Kinsley is ``Midway U.S.A,'' where travelers,
relieved to be this far, pose for a snapshot.
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley is also ``out there,'' halfway between Dodge City and
Hutchinson.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. In a couple of years, folks here predict that tour
buses will pull in with regularity and swarms will fill Main
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction? Simple.
</P>
<P>
   The carnival has come to town. Permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past couple of years, Kinsley has set itself up as the
country's carnival capital by establishing headquarters for the
National Foundation for Carnival Heritage and its Carnival Heritage
Museum, which occupies an abandoned downtown department store.
</P>
<P>
   And next to the museum is what for millions of youngsters in
tens of thousands of small towns was a consummation of their dreams
_ a merry-go-round.
</P>
<P>
   Remember? On a hot summer night, one end of prairie town would
literally come ablaze with light. That glow would illuminate
unimagined sights _ snake handlers and sword swallowers, games of
chance and shooting galleries, gravel-voiced barkers and even
scantily dressed women.
</P>
<P>
   The carnival became part of small-town America's mythology. For
a brief moment, a whistle stop, a tank town, a wide place in the
road was transformed. For a night a Ferris wheel, freaks and cotton
candy replaced the unrelieved sameness of rural America.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, evidence of what's ahead for Kinsley was easy to
spot _ 10,000 tourists showed up. The enthusiasts were people for
whom a brass (actually steel) ring, a hand-painted broadside or the
third-oldest Ferris wheel in the country are akin to heaven on
Earth. They came in cars, pickup trucks, motor homes and even a few
tour buses.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials say 1998 was just the beginning. In the next
couple of years the museum will expand into three other buildings
down the street so it can house its steadily growing collection of
carnival memorabilia. More old performers will be initiated into an
adjunct carnival Hall of Fame. And in November 2000, there'll be
the unveiling of Kinsley's piece de resistance _ a Heyn
double-decker carousel, built in Germany in 1900.
</P>
<P>
   John Ploger, a member of the museum board, said the Heyn would
be the only operating double-decker carousel with original overhead
panels in North America. There was another Heyn double-decker
without the panels, but Ploger said he understood it had been sold
and returned to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rarity of the Heyn should bring people out of the
woodwork,'' he said. ``We expect our yearly numbers to go to 50,000
or more.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the ancient carousel is in storage. It was brought to
the United States in the mid-1980s, its ornate wooden horses sold
off to collectors for cumulative million-plus dollars, and then was
rescued by Frank Trainer, a Floridian who couldn't bear seeing the
frame and innards of the old machine dumped in a landfill.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer overhauled the carousel's machinery, then sold it to
Kinsley for $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of horses is no problem. Providentially, Kinsley has in
its midst a nationally known carver of wooden carousel horses,
Bruce White, whose creations grace many Applebee's restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids ride merry-go-rounds,'' Ploger said. ``Kids don't care if
that horse moving them up or down is new or old. But then it really
doesn't matter. Bruce's horses are as good or better than the
originals.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley's journey to becoming a town celebrating carnivals has
taken some time. For decades, community leaders sought industry _
jobs, manufacturing, plants.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, said Dick Darling, a specialist in community
economic development for the Kansas State University Research and
Extension service, is that there aren't that many factories looking
to relocate, what few are likely to wouldn't choose rural Kansas
and, even if those obstacles were overcome, the recent good times
have all but guaranteed the absence of an adequate labor force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hodgeman County is northwest of Kinsley,'' Darling said. ``Its
unemployment rate is currently 1.4 percent. That means there are a
total of 14 people in that county looking for work. I doubt if any
employer would move a plant there. You get the idea.''
</P>
<P>
   With its pursuit of industry at a standstill, Kinsley looked
within. What was here?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there had been a big Indian fight near here. And there was
once a jim-dandy train robbery. Yet what people really remembered
was that Kinsley, of all places, had been the home of six carnivals
from the turn of the century until the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   It started about 1901, when Charlie Brodbeck traded some cows
for a small merry-go-round. Charlie noticed that folks coming to
where he had set up the contraption would ride a horse or come in a
horse-drawn wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'd get on a wooden horse. And pay a nickel to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The proverbial light bulb went on over Brodbeck's head. He, his
sons and the men who married into the family left their
hardscrabble farms for the carnival business.
</P>
<P>
   In all, that first merry-go-round birthed six carnival companies
that every spring would leave Kinsley and travel all over the
Midwest and the Rocky Mountains until the snow blew. MORE

SIBLINGS HAVE SEARCHED 50 YEARS FOR BABY SISTER

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ On a frosty night 53 years ago, a father's
drunken rage tore Ed Oldham's family apart.
</P>
<P>
   The father, an unemployed widower, stormed into the kitchen of
his home, grabbed a 10-inch butcher knife and began sharpening it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children Flee A Knife,'' blared a headline in The Kansas City
Times the next morning, Jan. 11, 1946.
</P>
<P>
   His six children _ ages 7 months to 16 years _ spent the night
locked in the juvenile detention center downtown. As wards of the
state, they later shuffled between foster homes and orphanages,
spending only rare moments together.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years the baby was gone _ separated from the Oldhams
under the secrecy of Missouri's adoption laws.
</P>
<P>
   Her name was Linda.
</P>
<P>
   For decades her siblings have ached to know what happened to
her. For decades they've searched for her.
</P>
<P>
   For decades they've come up empty.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Oldham, 59, is a rail-thin, 6-foot Texan who likes
cigarettes, cracking jokes and doing remodeling work for real
estate companies.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Judith, is a genealogy buff adept at researching
family history on the Internet. About a year ago Judith got the
idea that perhaps they could find Linda on the Internet, too.
</P>
<P>
   Judith added Linda's name to online adoption registries,
subscribed to an adoption e-mail list and created a Web page called
``Looking for Linda.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point she turned up a Missourian named Linda seeking her
birth family. For a few days Ed thought they had found his Linda.
But she had the wrong birthday.
</P>
<P>
   And so the search has gone. More dead ends than headway, more
disappointment than elation.
</P>
<P>
   Missouri's adoption records are closed _ especially tight to
inquiring siblings. The Oldhams' rented house in the 4300 block of
East 10th Street no longer exists. Neither does the neighborhood
police station. Memories have faded. People involved have moved,
married and died.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ed refuses to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Plano, Texas, resident flew to Kansas City to
rendezvous with Fern Cates, 64, an older sister who lives in
Syracuse, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference room at The Kansas City Star, they spread out
old family photographs, Linda's birth certificate, their mother's
death certificate and other clues collected over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Among their artifacts was a small, black-and-white photo,
slightly curled at the edges. It showed a woman in a short-sleeved
dress holding a round-faced infant in a bonnet. An afternoon sun
warmed their faces and stretched a shadow on cracked concrete
beneath them. A small, one-story house with a porch and two
chimneys stood in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Ed and Fern believe the woman was Linda's foster mother.
</P>
<P>
   Scribbled in pencil across the back of the picture were ``Linda
Joyce Oldham,'' a partial address on Quincy and the name ``McBee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go to that neighborhood,'' Ed said, tapping the
photograph. ``I want to see if I can find that house.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph C. Oldham painted houses, delivered coal, worked some for
Sheffield Steel and held various odd jobs. But at times he was
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Fern remembers her father as strict, mean and unaffectionate. If
he got mad at one of the children, he was mad at them all. He hid
whiskey and wine bottles in the house and ran a tab at a
neighborhood tavern.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Mary Belle Oldham, used a treadle-powered machine to
sew the family clothes: dresses from seed sacks and boys' pants
from used adult overalls.
</P>
<P>
   Any Christmas gifts usually came from the Salvation Army _ or
from an aunt who once gave Fern a doll.
</P>
<P>
   The house lacked electricity, running water and telephone
service. Old newspapers served as wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   The rats were awful. They bit everyone in the family except Fern
and her mother. One night Ed awoke crying after a rat gnawed his
left thumb. Another time his mother killed a rat in the bathtub. To
this day, rats terrify Fern.
</P>
<P>
   One late-summer day in 1945, Fern and the other children spotted
an ambulance at the house as they walked home from school. Their
mother was sick. The hospital sent her home in a taxi, but she got
sicker.
</P>
<P>
   The next day she had gallbladder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later she died of post-operative shock, two weeks short
of her 36th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Friday afternoon, Ed uncurled his long body from the
back of a car and stepped onto Quincy Drive in Kansas City. Fern
exited the other side and reached into the trunk for that photo of
a woman holding an infant.
</P>
<P>
   According to an old city directory, Estaline and Scott McBee
lived at 2223 Quincy Drive in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   No such address exists today _ only an empty lot. A mail carrier
on his rounds shook his head. He didn't know when the house was
torn down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a house next door looked suspiciously like the one in the
picture. Ed paced the street, searching for the right angle. Yes,
it had two chimneys. Yes, the front porch matched. But the angle
wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   Finally they found the right spot across the street, in a sloped
driveway. Someone took the picture here, Ed and Fern agreed.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor had lived on Quincy since 1948. No, he didn't
recognize the woman in the picture. He didn't recognize the name
McBee, either.
</P>
<P>
   Shivering, Ed and Fern retreated to the car, sure they had the
right street. But it was another dead end.
</P>
<P>
   After mother Oldham died in 1945, 16-year-old Nettie tended to
her five younger siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the family's living conditions, she plotted to
marry a neighbor and take in her brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Her father found out and stormed home. As usual, he had been
drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa, who had leaked Nettie's plans, huffed a mile to the
Oldham house and attempted to reason with the furious father. But
no words could soothe that anger. Grandpa gave up and hiked home.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers reported the next day that Oldham threatened to
shoot his children. He had brass knuckles in his pants pocket that
he tried to make them think was a gun, Fern says. MORE

IOWA ISN'T WORTH WHAT IT'LL DO TO A GOOD TEXAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some Iowa Republicans visited Austin last week to beg our Gov.
George W. Bush to enter their presidential caucuses next February.
</P>
<P>
   It's a trap, George. Don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Iowans probably didn't mention it, but one can be elected
president without winning the Iowa caucuses. Ronald Reagan did it,
and so did Bill Clinton. George W.'s dad won the Iowa caucuses, but
not in the year he made it to the White House. Later, the senior
George lost the caucuses but was elected president. Go figure.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another reason for George W. to stay away from
Iowa. Iowans are wonderfully tolerant and intelligent people, but
in their hearts they harbor a hearty dislike of Texas and all
things Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Sociologists can argue until the virtual cows come home about
why Iowans feel the way they do about Texas. But take it from a
former Iowa resident _ they do. The differences between the states
are stark.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa is Frost Belt; Texas is Sun Belt. Iowans consume energy;
Texans sell it. Iowa grows corn; Texas, wheat. Iowans love
government; Texans loathe it. Iowans sprinkle at baptisms; Texans
immerse. Iowans are modest; Texans boast. Texans love the Dallas
Cowboys; Iowans despised even the Landry/Staubach-era team. Iowa
fought for the Union; Texas flew the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in Iowa's caucuses, Texans must renounce their native
state and all its works and ways. Two who didn't, John Connally and
Phil Gramm, were sent packing from Iowa in wintry defeats every bit
as forlorn as Napoleon Bonaparte's retreat from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Although he looked and acted like a president, Big John lost the
1980 caucuses to Bush. The elder George camouflaged himself by (a)
not wearing cowboy boots and Stetson or speaking in a Texas twang,
(b) noting as his credentials his work in places like the United
Nations and China rather than in the Texas oilfields, and (c)
having never been a governor or senator from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Few Iowans were aware at the time that George the Elder actually
was a Houston resident. Bush shrewdly hung back as the candidate
from Somewhere East and let Connally, proudly wearing boots and
Stetson, be the designated Texan. Big John never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Iowa victory, Bush later lost the 1980 GOP
nomination to a former Des Moines resident, Ronald Reagan. The
Gipper intelligently sat out the caucuses that winter for the
warmth of Santa Barbara, Calif. The Reagan Revolution happened
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, the now-Vice President Bush returned to Iowa
and was stuffed by that dynamo campaigner, Bob Dole. The reason: In
1988, Bush was the only Texan in the race, and Dole made sure
Iowans knew it. Even so, George the Elder went on to get the
nomination and win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Phil Gramm bravely sallied north to Iowa. The Texan
said all the right things for Iowa ears. He was for the family
farm, corn-additive gasoline, price supports and eradication of the
corn borer. He praised small-town schools and kissed every pig he
could find.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm hung out for a while with Iowa football coach Hayden Fry,
an expatriate Texan. (More about Fry in a minute.) But Gramm, like
Connally, suffered a caucus rear-kicking.
</P>
<P>
   Fry must not have told Phil that when Hayden left Texas for Iowa
in 1979, the new coach spent two years in a serious funk of
unpopularity with a state that saw him as a relative of J.R. Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden got off to a bad start in Iowa when, in the nation's No.
1 pork-producing state, he called such animals by their Southern
name of ``hogs'' rather than the Iowa preference for ``pigs.''
Hayden drawled Texanisms like ``dance with the one that brung ya''
and ``scratch where it itches.'' Those lines had worked for Darrell
Royal, but in Iowa they prompted talk-show callers to snicker about
Fry's Texas accent.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden eventually promised to set aside his Texas ways. But not
until Fry took the Iowa Hawkeyes to the Rose Bowl did Iowans decide
that Hayden could be one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa's antipathy to Texas isn't a North-South thing. Jimmy
Carter of Georgia, who is as Southern as they come, won the Iowa
caucuses in 1976. But Carter was out of office then, and he
literally took up residence in Iowa for an entire year to persuade
Iowans that he was deserving of their votes.
</P>
<P>
   For most of 1975, Jimmy C. was everywhere in Iowa. He slept on
Iowans' couches. He appeared on local TV cooking shows. He went to
as many county fairs (Iowa has 99 of them) as he could schedule. He
got himself wedged in breaks in the noon livestock reports on
countless Iowa radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Robert Waller made anybody think of the Bridges of
Madison County as a scene for adultery, Jimmy was there. He lusted
only in his heart, and Iowans returned his affection.
</P>
<P>
   So the message to Governor Doubleyew from one who knows is this:
To win in Iowa, you must resign from the governorship of Texas
immediately and renounce your Texas heritage. Then spend 350 of the
next 365 days in Iowa. Leave your boots and Stetson home, and talk
like somebody from National Public Radio. Do that, and you might
have an outside chance of beating Gary Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Ask your dad: Is a victory in the Iowa caucuses really worth all
that?

`EVEN SEEMINGLY SMALL ERRORS FEED PUBLIC SKEPTICISM'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple of weeks ago I gave a quick overview of the findings of
the American Society of Newspaper Editors' study of newspaper
credibility. I promised that I would visit each of the study's six
major findings in separate columns during the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   We have long argued internally in the business that there is no
such thing as a minor error. Some errors get you in really deep
trouble and some don't, but all chip away at credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Most of you may not know whether I'm accurate if I'm writing
about nuclear physics _ some of you will, of course, because you
possess specific knowledge _ but you do know I've made a mistake
when I say that streets cross when they actually run parallel, or
when I use the wrong location for a well-known landmark.
</P>
<P>
   A reader who didn't leave his name made this point for me on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wish that the people who write articles would get
their geography right,'' he said, complaining that we were wrong in
identifying a city in which a store was closing. ``I sure wish your
people would check their geography before they write stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of you have had the unfortunate experience of showing up
for something only to find that the time or location in the
newspaper was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of this is our fault, because sometimes we are simply
passing on errors that other people made when they gave us the
information. But you don't really care who made the error or why.
And there's no reason you should.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what the ASNE study labeled as ``Major Finding No. 1'':
</P>
<P>
   ``The public sees too many factual errors and spelling or
grammar mistakes in newspapers. Even seemingly small errors feed
public skepticism about a newspaper's credibility. Each misspelled
word, bad apostrophe, garbled grammatical construction, weird
cutline and mislabeled map erodes public confidence in a
newspaper's ability to get anything right. One focus group even
laughed out loud when asked whether mistakes ever appeared in their
paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, readers don't care whether the reporter was
rushed, or that the staff was down three people, or if the copy
editor was too busy laying out pages to catch misuses of the common
language.''
</P>
<P>
   I want to say this nicely and not too defensively, but I deal
with many such complaints in letters and e-mails in which the
writer makes numerous spelling and grammar mistakes. And sometimes
you are simply wrong when you criticize our use of words.
</P>
<P>
   That only means that you hold us to a higher standard. Fine. So
be it.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that even though ``almost half of the public
believes that mistakes and errors occur in the rush to meet
deadlines, 27 percent attribute them to sloppiness, carelessness,
laziness or a lack of caring, and an additional 5 percent suggest
that the journalists just don't know any better.''
</P>
<P>
   That hurts. There are sloppy, careless, lazy and uncaring
journalists. (You can say that about any group of workers.) But
that has not been the general rule with the journalists I have
worked beside for more than three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Readers can be unforgiving, and for a very good reason: The
newspaper becomes personal to them. Many callers to my office begin
by telling me how long they have subscribed to the Star-Telegram,
establishing that they have a right to criticize the newspaper or
its performance.
</P>
<P>
   When I had a child at home, my wife and I used a little verbal
cue to indicate our level of distress. The indicator of a high
degree of dissatisfaction was whether the conversation referred to
``our child'' or ``your child.'' ``Our child'' had just won an
award in school. ``Your child'' just drew a picture on the wall
with finger paint.
</P>
<P>
   I find that same speech pattern in readers. If they are about to
praise us or indicate some minor dissatisfaction, they'll refer to
``the newspaper'' or sometimes ``my newspaper.'' If they are really
upset, it becomes ``your newspaper,'' and I settle in for a long
and sometimes not very pleasant discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The study said that 23 percent of adults say they find factual
errors in their daily paper at least once a week beyond
typographical and grammar errors. Of those, only 21 percent think
that mistakes are becoming more frequent, but 60 percent believe
that there are just as many errors as there always have been.
</P>
<P>
   As when dealing with children, honesty and directness are
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   The ASNE study found that 19 percent of readers say they always
see a correction when there has been a factual error; 40 percent
say they ``sometimes'' see one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's also clear that admitting mistakes and errors is not only
a wise practice, but a very desirable one among readers _ 63
percent said they `felt better' about the quality of the news
coverage they get when they see corrections,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   We correct errors on Page 2 of the newspaper, and it sometimes
is depressing to all of us to read that section.

`CENTRAL STATION' TAKES US ON AN HONEST JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After watching Sharon Stone very carefully re-create Gena
Rowlands' performance in the remake of ``Gloria'' _ or rather,
judging by its lackluster box office returns, after NOT watching
Stone attempt the role _ you may be in the mood for a more
emotionally honest film with a suspicious older woman taking in a
young boy.
</P>
<P>
   If that's the case, ``Central Station,'' with a moving
performance by Fernanda Montenegro in the lead, could be just what
you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro plays Dora, a former teacher who writes letters for
the unschooled, and she has set herself up at the central train
station in Rio de Janeiro. She's contemptuous of the banal
sentiments that the needy illiterates pass through her, which of
course sets her up for a comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   It comes in the form of Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira), a
10-year-old she has to take care of. Dora is asked by Josue's
mother to write a letter, and shortly after she does, the boy's
mother dies in an accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' takes a turn into a different kind of
picture when we learn that Dora's affection for Josue has a less
than altruistic motivation. He's not exactly winning her over; she
essentially wants to sell him off so she can get a TV. When her
scheme doesn't work out as she planned, she's again forced to care
for the boy, holding out so that she can deliver him to his father
(against whom his mother railed in her letter).
</P>
<P>
   Once Dora and Josue are on the road, and she has to depend on
the people whose easy sentiments she ridiculed, layers of her
crustiness dissolve and flake away in the country breezes. But it's
the determination that Montenegro shows as an actress that keeps
your attention.
</P>
<P>
   Director Walter Salles may move the movie into territory that's
too sweet, but at least he isn't being facile, either. Even though
we've all seen this story before, the simplicity that Montenegro
brings opens the windows and clears out some of the stale air. De
Oliveira's crankiness is enjoyable, too. He's not really an actor,
so he seems to be figuring out what to do as the camera is rolling.
</P>
<P>
   Many may be surprised that ``Central Station'' took the Golden
Globe for Best Foreign Film over ``Life Is Beautiful.'' But after
you take in the rich performance of Montenegro, you'll be convinced
that the Globe voters can occasionally be right.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, ``Central Station'' is filled with obvious ironies that
produce more sniffles than hay fever season. Incredibly, though,
the biggest one is unintentional; it's probably a story that Dora
would find laughable.

BARBIE FACES BIG 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday Feb. 17)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbie, the world's most famous anatomically incorrect doll,
turns 40 in March.
</P>
<P>
   While one might hope that Barbie would ease gracefully into
middle age _perhaps trade in the hot-pink Mustang for a nice,
sensible Volvo station wagon and start worrying less about her
makeup and more about her arthritis pains - Barbie, instead, seems
to be using her birthday as an excuse for a gigantic mid-life
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   While others her age might worry that their birthday cake will
set off the smoke alarm, Barbie is celebrating her 40th birthday by
getting a butterfly tattoo on her stomach and hanging out with a
new set of friends, including one who sports a nose ring.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barbie has never been your average woman, unless your
definition of an average woman is a clone of Dolly Parton and Olive
Oyl, she needs to think twice before she goes chasing after her
fading youth.
</P>
<P>
   The world is filled with sad, pathetic people who cannot accept
that they're not as young as they used to be. It is one thing for
Barbie to watch what she eats and exercise regularly; it is another
thing entirely for her to dye her hair purple and stick sharp
things through parts of her body that sharp things should never be
stuck through.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie's at a stage in her life when she should be making
appointments with her periodontist, not slam dancing at Offspring
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, one has to wonder how popular a sagging, wrinkling,
nearsighted doll would be with little girls, assuming there are
little girls out there who would rather play with Barbie dolls than
chat with each other over the Internet.)
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, but not certain, that Barbie would have aged
more gracefully if she had married and had kids instead of wasting
the best years of her life hanging around that loser Ken. Besides
having the vacant, light's-on-but-nobody's-home look of someone
who's been dropped on his head as a baby, Ken had no visible means
of support, leading everyone (except the bubble-headed Barbie) to
assume that he was a either a drug dealer, a pimp or a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   (Is it any coincidence that Ken bears a striking resemblance to
Dan Quayle? I don't think so.)
</P>
<P>
   Ken, of course, gave the impression that he was more interested
in looking at himself in the mirror than settling down with Barbie,
a rejection that may have lowered Barbie's self-esteem to the point
that she felt a need to get a butterfly tattooed on her stomach and
hang around with people with rings in their nose.
</P>
<P>
   If things had turned out differently for Barbie and she had had
kids (though not with Ken, God forbid), Barbie would have been much
too tired and/or stressed out to worry about a mid-life crisis,
much less have time for one. Instead of bemoaning her lost youth,
Barbie could drive her kids to soccer practice and help them with
their algebra homework. (This should be a real challenge for a doll
who got in hot water with teachers for uttering the message ``Math
is hard.'')
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tagging along with her slacker friends to rock
concerts, she could make frantic calls to the pediatrician at 4
o'clock in the morning because her daughter had a 104-degree fever.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no need to decorate her body with tattoos because
her kids would satisfy her artistic needs by writing on the walls
with laundry markers and grinding bubble gum into their hair.
</P>
<P>
   Barbie clearly has a lot of issues she needs to work out at this
stage in her life, but one thing she should be extremely happy
about is that she's just a doll.

THE DIFFULTIES THE CENSUS BUREAU ENCOUNTERS IN COUNTING NOSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CLAASSEN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   World War II showed the Census Bureau how hard it can be to
count each American.
</P>
<P>
   Needing every potential soldier, leaders of the Selective
Service System asked the Census Bureau in 1942 for the number of
young, single men in the country who were old enough to fight.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, Navy and other services prepared to handle the
millions of men counted during the 1940 Census. They were caught
off guard, however, when 15 percent more young black men showed up
to fight than the census knew existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time the Census Bureau really got a wakeup
call about how many people it was able to count,'' said Frank
Newton, spokesman for the agency's Dallas regional office.
</P>
<P>
   In black communities struggling with overt, institutional
discrimination in the 1940s, there was little incentive to
cooperate with a federal government that turned a blind eye to Jim
Crow laws.
</P>
<P>
   Other neighborhoods of racial or ethnic minorities were also
wary of census-takers. Some had to be watchful around government
workers _ sometimes census workers in particular _ in their home
countries. Others sensed only a tenuous connection to their new,
adopted country and its government.
</P>
<P>
   Although relations have improved and statistics for ethnic
groups are more accurate now, other communities in the United
States seem to have become as leery of the government as minority
communities were in the 1940s, Newton said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that wariness, apathy and other problems, the 1990
Census, according to the Census Bureau, was the first in more than
40 years to be less accurate than the previous one.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, only 65 percent of households returned their surveys,
down from 74 percent in 1970. Next year, that figure is expected to
drop to 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For local governments, uncounted people mean lost money.
According to the U.S. Conference of Mayors, each uncounted person
equals $1,230 in lost federal grants during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   To improve accuracy, the bureau's statisticians proposed a head
count with mathematical models, or ``statistical sampling,'' to
fill in for uncounted people. The National Academy of Sciences and
the American Statistical Association encouraged the change.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, the bureau has conducted post-census accuracy
checks through surveys and telephone polls.
</P>
<P>
   Those reviews suggested that post-census phone surveys were more
accurate than door-to-door interviews in accounting for the 2 to 5
percent of Americans who are hard to reach, said Barbara Bryant,
the census director under President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of the 1990 Census, we really realized we can't
count them all,'' Bryant said. ``We knew it would be the last
census where we tried to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau's plan, however, was too ambitious for congressional
Republicans and other critics.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Census was at first designed to count 90 percent of
Americans through surveys and in person, and use statistical
sampling for the remainder, which census statisticians considered
the most conservative approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans and some others said that sampling should only
be used for the 2 to 5 percent who can't be counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The methodology was unproven, and there would have been no
full-count number to fall back on, since they would have counted
only 90 percent the traditional way,'' said Chip Walker, spokesman
for the House Subcommittee on the Census.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Republicans, meanwhile, said that GOP members
merely feared a higher population count for young people with
modest incomes and minorities, who tend to vote for Democrats. So
far, however, demographic studies show only that statistical
sampling could cause Indiana to lose a seat in Congress and
Mississippi to gain one.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the challengers won a partial victory in the Supreme
Court. Federal law requires that population counts used to assign
seats in Congress for each state must be based on surveys and
in-person interviews, the justices ruled.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling left open the chance for a second official count
based on statistical sampling to steer federal grants and other
work. The White House and congressional Democrats are gearing up to
fight for that.
</P>
<P>
   During the next several months, congressional Democrats and
Republicans, who control funding for the census, are expected to
feud over the possibility for two official censuses. One Democratic
bill and two Republican bills are already on file.
</P>
<P>
   A two-headed census, however, could lead to more political
infighting.
</P>
<P>
   After the census calculated an adjusted 1990 figure through
statistical sampling, the state of Texas, the city of Los Angeles
and others filed suit to use the adjusted figures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a federal judge ruled that former Commerce Secretary
Rob Mosbacher had the authority to reject the adjusted figures. The
ruling focused on Mosbacher's authority and did not involve issues
of statistical accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-headed 2000 Census, legal fights over voting rights
are likely to erupt if states fail to use adjusted counts to draw
local political districts, said Brian Currey, a Los Angeles lawyer
who represented Texas, Los Angeles and others in their census suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enterprising lawyers out there who would say the
census has the numbers and the methodology is sound,'' Currey said.
``It would be an uphill fight, but that challenge would be made.''

<P>
   Dear Fellow Scientist:
</P>
<P>
   This letter has been around the world at least seven times. It
has been to many major conferences. Now it has come to you. It will
bring you good fortune. This is true even if you don't believe it.
But you must follow these instructions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Include in your next journal article the citations below;
</P>
<P>
   _ Remove the first citation from the list and add a citation to
your journal article at the bottom;
</P>
<P>
   _ Make 10 copies and send them to colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Within one year, you will be cited up to 10,000 times! This will
amaze your fellow faculty, assure your promotion and improve your
sex life. In addition, you will bring joy to many colleagues. Do
not break the reference loop, but send this letter on today.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. H. received this letter and within a year after passing it
on she was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Prof. M.
threw this letter away and was denied tenure. In Japan, Dr. I.
received this letter and put it aside. His article for Trans. on
nephrology was rejected. He found the letter and passed it on, and
his article was published that year in the New England Journal of
Medicine. In the Midwest, Prof. K. failed to pass on the letter,
and in a budget cutback his entire department was eliminated. This
could happen to you if you break the chain of citations.

   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ In 1965, Jesuit High School's boys basketball
team in New Orleans was 29-1 and being called the ``Team of the
Century.''
</P>
<P>
   But just across town, St. Augustine High School's team was 30-0.
No one talked about the Purple Knights' record, however, nor
whether the school would play Jesuit to see who really was the team
of the century.
</P>
<P>
   That's because even though both schools were run by the Catholic
Church and were located in the same city, Jesuit was all white, and
St. Augustine was all black. And in 1965, in New Orleans, white
high schools didn't play against black high schools.
</P>
<P>
   And that's where Father Joseph Verrett (Andre Braugher) enters

History Month.
</P>
<P>
   Kicked out of the Baltimore parish where he'd been working, the
black priest returns to his hometown to teach at St. Augustine
under a white mentor, Father Robert Grant (played by Rip Torn).
</P>
<P>
   Soon Verrett is pressed into service as the basketball team's
coach, clashes with its star (played by Sean Squire) and with Grant
and inspires the team to challenge the Jesuit players to an
informal game.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, the resulting match is decided with a last-second
shot, of course, and you can guess how it turns out. But in
reality, the St. Augustine team walloped Jesuit by 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was (a blowout), but drama being what drama is ...''
acknowledged a laughing Harold Sylvester, who wrote the script and
starred in the original game. He went on to be the first black
athlete at Tulane University before becoming an actor and
screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   The film's script takes other dramatic license, such as
Verrett's role as a coach and his squabbles with Grant, but
otherwise is a relatively faithful telling of a Tale of Two
Basketball Teams and their city in a time of transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South, I think, is a wonderful place,'' said Sylvester.
``But it certainly was a bit behind the times. (The game) was just
the beginning of us coming to terms with the fact that sometimes
things aren't always the way that people tell you they are, which
was the value for me in doing this story.''
</P>
<P>
   But the story struggled to get made. It was first optioned by
Disney back in 1992, and later Denzel Washington was slated to star
in and direct it. Writer-director John Sayles took a crack at
rewriting the screenplay for film, as did others.
</P>
<P>
   But then the project ended up in the limbo of turnaround for a
time before its executive producers, Quincy Jones and Magic
Johnson, persuaded TNT to make it for television.
</P>
<P>
   They stuck with a pared-down script that was closer to
Sylvester's original and brought in Steve James as director. James
is best-known for the brilliant 1994 documentary ``Hoop Dreams,''
which followed the lives of two Chicago youths trying to escape the
inner city through their basketball skills.
</P>
<P>
   James said he was willing to do another basketball film because
``sports in general can be a great backdrop to deal with most
anything dramatically; it's inherently dramatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Hoop Dreams,'' where he and his team shot more than 250
hours of footage over three years in the boys' lives, ``Passing
Glory'' involved different challenges, James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a good documentary, you have to get complete access to
really show what happens as it happens,'' James said. ``In
``Passing Glory,'' the challenge is to re-create something with the
same kind of nuance, detail and truth as the actual event.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers basketball star, said he
was attracted to the tale because ``it's a story I lived. I went
through this myself, and I think a lot of people will relate to it.
And it's a true story that helped stop segregation. This historic
game helped change the way we think in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, Johnson said the story isn't just about black vs. white.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't cheer for the black team, you don't cheer for the
white team; you cheer for all that both teams overcame to play as
athletes,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he was attracted to the project because the truth
behind it startled him, despite his own many years as a jazz
musician traipsing across the Jim Crow South.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back to being on the road with Lionel Hampton in the
early '50s, when it was seriously rough, traveling on band buses
and no hotels to stay in,'' Jones said. ``You couldn't eat in the
restaurants. We had to have white drivers so we could eat on the
road, or (we'd) starve to death.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, when Jones' band played in Las Vegas with
Count Basie's band, host Frank Sinatra told bodyguards, ``If
anybody looks at the band funny, break their legs. Relating to
that, and not understanding (what was still going on in New
Orleans) ... I was so surprised. And I immediately got sucked into
what the story was about.''
</P>
<P>
   It also sucked in Braugher, who was looking for new dramatic
challenges after leaving his much-lauded role as Detective Frank
Pembleton on ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful material, very heartwarming,'' said Braugher.
``It has a very interesting message about preparing yourself to
exploit the things that happen to you. These kids are at a breaking
point. To me, it's a message that's most powerful: Finally, the
losers believe in themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Braugher also was attracted to the moral ambiguities in what
literally could have been a black-and-white film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always turned off by films where the heroes are too good
and the villains are too evil,'' Braugher said. ``Especially when
you're doing historical pieces, there's a tendency to artificially
enoble or drag down the participants. But if there's any message
about history, it must be that it is nuanced and complex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Passing Glory'' is indeed nuanced. Most characters have at
least a few flaws, and some of the more interesting byplay comes
between Squire's character and a junkie older brother, and between
the Jesuit team's star and his racist father.
</P>
<P>
   Braugher said the junkie brother is emblematic of what happened
for many black youths who turned to drugs and alcohol because they
felt they had no future.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing, in part because the game that Sylvester and
others played did far more than just settle who was better at
shooting a ball through a round rim of metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of weight on our shoulders because we knew
that, regardless, we had something to prove _ and not only about
basketball,'' Sylvester said. ``Because if we couldn't measure it
in terms of basketball, then how in the hell are we going to
measure it in terms of poetry and philosophy and math? We just had
no idea where we stood in the world order.''

WHEN STRESS ENTERS THE GERM EQUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)

<P>
   A patient I'll call Mario sat down opposite me with the look
that meant we were about to have a fight. During our three-year
acquaintance we have had many _ mostly split decisions, which is
why we are still on the friendliest of terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't do any blood tests today,'' he said. ``I've been too
stressed out. I know my immune system is way down.'' He stopped and
glared at me.
</P>
<P>
   Mario thinks that I don't put much stock in the stress theory of
disease, at least the way it shakes out in the average examining
room, where stress is seldom triggered by an earthquake or
holocaust but is usually a smaller-scale affair. Mario thinks that
I have cast my lot entirely in with the competing germ theory,
ascribing his past health problems to several debilitating
HIV-related infections and his current good health to a handful of
strong medications. Mario thinks that I pooh-pooh the importance of
his innumerable relaxation techniques in keeping him whole. And he
knows that the last time stress loomed I made him do his blood
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But what Mario doesn't know is that any thoughtful adherent of
the germ theory of disease can only be impressed with how
remarkably little it sometimes winds up actually explaining about
infectious diseases. Not infection in the laboratory, among
carefully selected populations of cells and animals, but infectious
disease out here in the wild, where stressed-out humans often
respond to germs in a way that defies the germ theory's simple
axioms.
</P>
<P>
   The unfolding story of the bacteria associated with peptic ulcer
disease is a prime example. For much of this century ulcers were
considered to be a paradigm of stress-induced disease, clear
evidence of mental anguish turning physical. Then in the early
1980s a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori was found to be
associated with most ulcers, and the science swung around. Ulcers
were only an infection after all. Psychology dropped out of the
picture; relaxation was out for ulcer treatment, and antibiotics
were in.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely, the question of what causes ulcers remains almost
as murky as ever. Many people carry H. pylori from childhood on,
but more than 80 percent never get ulcers. Between 10 percent and
30 percent of ulcer patients never carry the bacteria. Meanwhile,
scientific studies that convincingly associate ulcers with
psychological stress remain to be dealt with. The German blitz of
London in World War II and the 1995 Kobe earthquake in Japan both
precipitated local outbreaks of ulcer disease. Studies have shown
that ulcers heal more slowly in anxious people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reports of the death of ulcer psychosomatics have been greatly
exaggerated,'' experts concluded in the Journal of the American
Medical Association last month.
</P>
<P>
   A remarkably similar ambiguity already exists for many other
infections: Germs both explain them and do not. Scientists still
puzzle over why some people exposed to a cold virus get sick, while
many others do not. Among the factors that seem to produce colds:
long-term psychological stress, like losing a job. Among the
factors that seem to protect against them: the social support of
many friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Before Robert Koch discovered the tubercle bacillus in 1882,
theories ascribed tuberculosis to everything from stress to genes
to bad air. The bacillus seemed to void them all, but only
temporarily: For every 100 people exposed to the tubercle bacillus
and infected by it, it turned out that only 10 got sick. Scientists
have spent most of this century trying to make sense of why that is
so; genes, luck or stress.
</P>
<P>
   A nascent germ theory of heart disease is now making headlines.
Traces of an organism called Chlamydia pneumoniae have been found
in the sludge within diseased coronary arteries; when rabbits and
even some humans with heart disease are treated with antibiotics
active against chlamydia, their heart disease appears to improve.
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery of a heart germ is unlikely to resolve the
many mysteries of heart disease, or erase the strong evidence that
stress, depression and personality type appear to be cardiac risk
factors, just like cigarette smoking and blood lipids. Heart
medications may come to include antibiotics some day, but the
endless jostling of the psychosomatic and the orthodox theories of
disease will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Acolyte of the germ theory that I am, I almost bet Mario $20
last month that the stresses of a new job were not somehow going to
inactivate his medications and give his infections the upper hand.
Fortunately, I restrained myself. The blood tests I made him take
came back completely out of whack. I was not looking forward to
seeing him again and admitting defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But Mario, stressed no more after passing probation at his job,
synthesized it all a few weeks later with elegant simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you I was stressed,'' he said. He paused. ``I was
really stressed.'' He paused again. ``I was kind of too stressed to
take my medicines for a while.'' He smiled sheepishly. It was
another split decision.

<P>
   More often than not over the last million years, the earth has
been locked in the deep cold of ice ages. In the frigid depths of
the most recent of these glaciations, which lasted about 100,000
years and ended about 10,000 years ago, great sheets of ice buried
much of Europe and North America, including New York, Chicago and
everything to the north. In its expansion phase, the ice sometimes
advanced so fast that it bulldozed forests in its path.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts believe the ice will come again, as surely as the
earth turns on its axis and revolves around the sun. It will crush
cities, freeze great stretches of northern lands and suck up so
much of the world's water that global sea levels will drop by
hundreds of feet.
</P>
<P>
   In some spots, the Northeast Coast will be as much as 100 miles
east of where it is now, as it was during the last glaciation.
People will survive just as they did then, but the warm,
salubrious, all-too-brief interval in which civilization flowered
will be over.
</P>
<P>
   The question is: When?
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, scientists who study past glaciations for clues
to the future thought the present warm period was nearing its end.
Though global warming from the emission of heat-trapping greenhouse
gases might complicate the situation, they believed that an uneven
slide into a new glaciation could begin at almost any time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now most people have dropped that view,'' said Dr. Lloyd
Burckle, a paleo-oceanographer at Columbia University's
Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who is an expert on ancient
climates. New evidence has led scientists to believe that the
present warm period could last another 10,000 to 20,000 years, or
even longer.
</P>
<P>
   They say the new evidence, in the form of chemical tracers of
past climates contained in deep-ocean sediments, suggests that
previous warm periods lasted longer than had been thought. In
particular, a warm interval some 400,000 years ago appears to have
endured for 30,000 years or more. Scientists call it Stage 11,
after its designation in the standard record of
glacial-interglacial cycles discovered through study of the
deep-sea sediment tracers.
</P>
<P>
   In some critical aspects, Stage 11 appears to have more in
common with today's interglacial, denoted as Stage 1 and known as
the Holocene period, than do other warm periods of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Hodell, a paleooceanographer at the University of
Florida, who has produced some of the new evidence on Stage 11,
said, ``If Stage 11 is a good analog and lasted 30,000 years, we
might expect that the present interglacial will continue for
another 20,000 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence also suggests that the most recent warm period
before the Holocene began about 130,000 years ago and lasted some
20,000 years, twice as long as had been thought _ and twice as long
as the Holocene has endured so far.
</P>
<P>
   That interglacial, sometimes called the Eemian period, appears
to have had two distinct phases. One, roughly the first 12,000
years, was warm and stable. The second half of the period saw a
gradual growth of ice sheets in the North Atlantic region _ but the
climate of the region apparently stayed warm for another 8,000
years or so before descending fitfully into a new glaciation.
</P>
<P>
   The evident lag between the growth of ice sheets and their
impact on climate is an indication that even if the earth's overall
climate stays warm for another 10,000 to 20,000 years, there may
still be severe weather changes. For instance, the intensity of
storms in the temperate zones is determined by the contrast in
temperature between clashing warm and cold air masses.
</P>
<P>
   In the latter part of the last interglacial, some scientists
theorize, the juxtaposition of cold, growing ice sheets with a
still-warm ocean could have produced monster storms.
</P>
<P>
   How the climate behaved in the earlier warm intervals is one of
many mysteries that today plague and fascinate those who study the
ice ages. The conundrum is complicated all the more by the
potential impact of humans' burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil
and natural gas, which produces the heat-trapping atmospheric gas
carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   According to a calculation by Dr. James F. Kasting of
Pennsylvania State University, an expert on geochemical processes
and ancient climate, fossil fuels would be used up in about 800
years at present rates of burning. If that happened, he said, there
would be 4 to 8 times as much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere as
in pre-industrial times, and it would raise the earth's average
surface temperature by 8 to 27 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like we would completely break the
glacial-interglacial cycle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That much warming would probably melt all or most of the ice on
earth, raising sea level to heights unknown in the last 65 million
years or so and wiping out most of today's coastal zones, where
about half of humanity lives. It would probably make the tropics
uninhabitable and return the world's climate to conditions that
prevailed in the era of the dinosaurs, when crocodiles lived in the
Arctic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe we'd ever be that stupid,'' said Dr.
Wallace S. Broecker, a geochemist at Lamont-Doherty. On the other
hand, there has so far been little progress in reducing the use of
fossil fuels. The peak of whatever global warming might eventually
result would come well before the end of the Holocene if, as
scientists now suspect, it still has thousands of years yet to run.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant view among scientists is that if greenhouse gas
emissions are not reduced, the average global temperature will rise
by 2 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, with a best estimate of 3.5 degrees,
over the next century _ and that further warming would take place
after that if emissions continued. By comparison, the average
temperature has risen by 5 to 9 degrees since the depths of the
last glaciation some 20,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists believe the current glacial-interglacial cycle
was set in motion more than 2.5 million years ago by the gradual
closing of the isthmus of Panama, which re-routed oceanic currents
that carry water _ and heat _ around the globe. Others say the
cause was the rise about then of the Himalayas, resulting in a
realignment of atmospheric circulation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the changes had vast repercussions. Until about a
million years ago, the alternating glacial and interglacial cycles
were of roughly even duration. Since then, the glacial cycles have
dominated.
</P>
<P>
   The reigning theory about what sets the timing of the
glacial-interglacial oscillations says it involves periodic changes
in the earth's orbit and its position relative to the sun. In one
type of periodic change, the angle of tilt in the earth's axis
varies over periods of about 41,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   In another, the magnitude of a wobble in the earth's rotation
about that axis (much like that of a spinning top as it slows down)
changes over periods of 19,000 and 23,000 years. In a third cycle,
the shape of the earth's orbit varies, from more circular to more
elliptical, over a period of 100,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the overlapping effect of the three orbital cycles
alters the angles and distances from which sunlight strikes the far
northern latitudes of the earth. When less sunlight falls there,
less snow melts in summer and over time is compressed to form
growing continental ice sheets. When more sunlight falls, the ice
melts back.
</P>
<P>
   This elegant theory has been confirmed, in its adherents' view,
by studies of the relative abundance of different forms of oxygen
preserved in the fossilized shells of tiny marine animals called
foraminifera, or forams, in deep-sea sediments around the world.
</P>
<P>
   From the foram record, scientists worked out a timetable of the
waning and waxing of ice sheets. They found that it neatly matched
the timetable calculated by astronomers on the basis of the earth's
orbital cycles.
</P>
<P>
   Later evidence, however, has suggested that the coming and going
of the ice is sometimes out of phase with the global or regional
climate. That is, it might remain warm for some time even as ice
sheets grow, as in the Eemian period.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Kukla of Lamont-Doherty, Dr. Jerry McManus of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Woods Hole, Mass., and
others have documented this lag by studying ocean sediments in the
North Atlantic. They looked for concentrations of gravelly debris
dropped by melting sea ice and fossils of a species of foram that
is sensitive to sea-surface temperature.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that after the Eemian interglacial had
lasted some 12,000 years, a warm climate persisted in the North
Atlantic region for about another 8,000 years, even as the ice
concentrations continued to grow. Kukla says that in the last half
of the last interglacial, the ice probably built up gradually in
volume, but not necessarily in area, while the ocean and the
continental temperate zones remained warm. Then the cold moved
south, probably in a series of pulses.
</P>
<P>
   McManus says the North Atlantic region may have stayed warm for
so long because great ocean currents that transport heat into the
region remained strong. When the currents weakened, possibly
because their salt content was diluted at a critical juncture by
fresh water from melting icebergs, a global glaciation began. It
lasted some 100,000 years, ending about 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the Holocene behaves like the last interglacial, Kukla and
McManus say, then the next onset of the cold associated with an ice
age lies thousands of years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of experts are beginning to believe that the length
of the Stage 11 interglacial may be a better predictor of how long
the Holocene will last. As Hodell explains, the shape of the
earth's orbit in Stage 11 was more circular then and is similarly
so today. The planet's spinning-top wobble was also less pronounced
then and is so now.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the two cycles are allowing less solar radiation to
reach far northern latitudes in the summer, meaning that less ice
is melting each year as a result of the sun's direct action than
melted 9,000 years ago: The die is cast for the next glaciation,
but according to the new thinking, the world will stay warm for
about 10,000 to 20,000 more years.
</P>
<P>
   Much more must be learned before scientists can be confident of
what happened in Stage 11, and what that might portend for
humanity. Was it warm enough then to melt the ice caps, as some
scientists believe? How did the climate vary over the 20 or 30
millenniums that Stage 11 apparently lasted? Firm answers will come
only with difficulty, if then.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was a nice neat story,'' says McManus, ``we'd have known
it a long time ago and would have moved on to something else.''

BICYCLE BUILT FOR BRUTAL SOUTH POLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ill., Wis., Calif.)   (af)  
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If you want to bicycle to work, finding a good bike
for your commute is hardly a problem. But if you work in Antarctica
and the commute is around the South Pole, things get a little
trickier.
</P>
<P>
   Bicycle manufacturers, catering to the sport of extreme biking,
make rugged two-wheelers for traveling along mountain trails,
through snowy hills or across desert flats. However, not one of
these machines is up to conditions found at the pole, where in
winter temperatures average minus 76 degrees Fahrenheit, the sun
never rises and drifting snow piles up several feet.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, working with
researchers and technicians who stay at the South Pole, hope to
change this with a new type of bicycle designed for Antarctic
conditions. If all goes as planned, one or two of the cycles will
go to the pole this year for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The program is part of a collaboration among several technical
schools and the Center for Astrophysical Research in Antarctica
(CARA), a consortium of universities that build and operate
telescopes at the South Pole. Working with a $575,000 grant from
the National Science Foundation, CARA is trying to use the
students' classroom work and technical skills to improve quality of
life at the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want something functional at the end because we are trying
to create a more aesthetically pleasing and productive work
environment at the South Pole,'' said Randall H. Landsberg, CARA's
education coordinator at the University of Chicago, ``But it's also
a great experience for the students.''
</P>
<P>
   The students in Pittsburgh, and others at Gateway Technical
Institute in Elkhorn, Wis., and Triton College in Rivergrove, Ill.,
are engaged in projects including planning interior space in new
buildings at the pole and designing a portable enclosure for
researchers in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Butler, assistant director of the design school at
the Art Institute of Pittsburgh, said students earning associate
and technical degrees there are enthusiastic about problem-based
learning. ``It fosters a relationship between science and art and
design,'' he said, ``The projects come from discussions with people
who have worked at the South Pole and the students get the
satisfaction of coming up with solutions that make people's lives
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The school launched its first project with CARA five years ago
when students set out to improve the cold-weather gear researchers
wore. One invented a two-piece glove that kept researchers' hands
warm while working with small objects by allowing them to
temporarily pull back a heavy, outer mitten to expose a hand
covered in an inner glove.
</P>
<P>
   The bicycle project has proved even more challenging.
Researchers have taken bikes to the pole for more than a decade,
but success has been limited. The cycles, usually mountain bikes
with 2.5-inch-wide tires, work during the summer. But riders say
that during the winter, extreme cold and drifting snow, a granular
variety with the consistency of sand, render the bikes useless.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places that are not well traveled, the tires sink into the
snow and you're stuck,'' said John Kovac, a biker and University of
Chicago graduate student. ``Also, bikes there often end up with
their brakes and gearshifts disabled because plastic parts crack
and cables snap because of the cold.''
</P>

   CARA's observatories at the South Pole are about three-quarters
of a mile from the main station and living quarters, isolated in an
area called the Dark Sector to keep light pollution and stray
electromagnetic radiation from polluting their observations.
Workers usually walk to and from the observatories several times a
day. Carrying equipment, a person makes the trek at about 3 miles
an hour, experts said, and a bike could triple that speed.
</P>
<P>
   Under industrial design instructors Bill Farrell and Paul
Jordan, students have worked on the project for 18 months. The
initial proposal was for a pedal-powered vehicle in a plastic
shell, but the design was discarded as too complicated.
</P>
<P>
   The current design is built around aluminum mountain bike frames
donated by Hanebrink Bicycles of Big Bear Lake, Calif. Using these
as models, Farrell said students also are making lighter, carbon
fiber frames. They have added adjustable handlebars and seat poles
with quick-release switches that can be operated with a gloved
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Students designed wide metal pedals with toothed edges to
accommodate insulated boots and have decided on a single-speed,
rear-gear drive for simplicity. The group discarded the idea of
using an old-style coaster brake operated from the pedals and will
use an all-metal disc brake on the rear wheel controlled by a lever
on the handlebar.
</P>
<P>
   The test bikes will try three wheel and tire designs, all about
20-inches in diameter with a tread section about 7-inches wide. One
wheel has vulcanized rubber tires while another has an aluminum
frame with a stainless steel mesh making up the tire portion. The
third is a hollow, polycarbonate resin wheel molded in two pieces
that are fused together at the center, a design so buoyant that it
helps the bike ``float'' above the snow, its creators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of planning and now it's time to build the
hardware and test it at the South Pole,'' Farrell said, ``By the
end of the year, we'll know what works. And if it doesn't, we'll
change it until it does.''

MACBILL: AN AMERICAN TRAGICOMEDY IN THREE ACTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PUNCH SHAW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new political drama, ``The Senate Impeachment Proceedings,''
opened recently in the nation's capital to great fanfare and
anticipation. But not only did this turgid and sordid melodrama
fail to live up to its hype _ it established a new low in the
annals of American theater.
</P>
<P>
   This show had the warmth and kindness of ``Who's Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?''; the wit of ``Long Day's Journey into Night'';
and the intelligence of ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum.'' You have to wonder why this production was even done,
given the largely negative reaction to an earlier (and cruder)
version that was staged late last year in the House Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of this extremely lengthy political soap opera dealt
with a president caught in the endgame of a sexual and legal
scandal. The action (and never was a word more inappropriate)
played out over three acts, with each one somehow managing to be
even more tedious and distasteful than the last.
</P>
<P>
   Act I, ``The Impeachment Vote,'' featured a number of
overwrought performances by actors portraying members of Congress,
who for the purposes of this drama were divided into two rival
bands, much like the Sharks and the Jets in ``West Side Story.'' (I
forget the names of the respective gangs.)
</P>
<P>
   What little dramatic potential the act had was completely robbed
by the shrill chatterings of a kind of Greek chorus composed of
players identified only by their initials (ABC, CBS, NBC, C-SPAN,
ESPN, WWF, etc.) who interrupted throughout the play to tell us
what had happened and what would happen next. Indeed, once this
annoying chorus made it clear that the lawmakers intended to remain
loyal to their gangs on every vote, without regard to law,
conscious or reason, the work as a whole collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Act II, ``Testimony and Trial,'' promised to breathe new life
into the piece by playing the sex card that had been prominent in
the 1998 version of the show. But even some contrived multimedia _
for no reason at all, the players were seen on videotape instead of
live on the stage _ could not add any sizzle to this disappointing
act.
</P>
<P>
   Although the characters in the House version had been clever
enough to stay focused on sex by repeatedly reminding us that
``it's not about sex,'' the grandfatherly types created for the
Senate version were far too polite to raise the subject at all.
</P>
<P>
   The final act, ``The Debate,'' was the most perplexing of all.
The entire act took place behind a closed curtain! The chorus
assured us that the players were earnestly acting away behind the
curtain, but the audience was not allowed to see them! We were
never told why, but I suspect it might have been the work of a
shadowy group of underlords called the Managers, who came out of
nowhere and somehow took control of the play early in the second
act without explanation.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen some strange avant-garde theater before, but not even
Samuel Beckett or Eugene Ionesco would have tried anything this
stupid. When the hysterical chorus finally let us know it was over,
the whole experience added a meaning to the term ``anticlimax.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the performances, there was hardly a credible acting job
in the bunch. Bill Clinton, as the president, was only sporadically
convincing in his role. The actors playing the
too-numerous-to-mention lawmakers (there must have been hundreds of
those clowns!) came across as more believable _ if only because we
assume that real politicians would also be boring.
</P>
<P>
   The only interesting performance in the entire drama, in fact,
was delivered by newcomer Monica Lewinsky, who did a fine job in
the piece's ingenue role. Although never seen in the House Theater
version, her character had triggered the action by confessing to
indelicacies with the married chief executive that would have made
a hooker blush.

UNDATED: made a hooker blush. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the character finally made her long-anticipated appearance
in the second act, Lewinsky delivered one of the show's few
surprises by portraying her as composed and complex. The script, to
this point, had painted her as either a predatory slut or an abused
victim. Rather than settle the debate, Lewinsky's subtle
performance cast the issue in a new shade of exquisitely tailored
gray. Unlike the rest of this enormous cast, you expect that we may
be seeing Lewinsky again.
</P>
<P>
   Other roles, though, were just terribly miscast. The president's
lawyer, for example, was played by David Kendall, a caricature of a
whiny, grimly sincere, Ivy League mouthpiece. How could they have
cast this inexperienced nobody in such a pivotal role when Johnnie
Cochran was available?
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, this funeral dirge could have used a little comic
relief. Cochran stomping around the Senate chambers raving, ``If
the dress doesn't fit, you must acquit!'' might have given the play
the jolt it so desperately needed.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting was flat and, in many cases, unflattering. The set
design and costuming were more suited to the production of yawns
than drama. And never has the lack of music and special effects
been more keenly felt.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the work failed on the issue of credibility.
Fiction is one thing, but this piece of fantasy would have us
believe that, first, a married president would risk everything for
a sordid liaison with a White House intern barely out of her teens;
and, second, that the government's response to this would be to
spend tens of millions of our tax dollars to deal with the mess so
that everybody in government could look bad, not just the
president. Come on.
</P>
<P>
   What a relief it is that no revivals of this work are expected.
I have never seen a performance in which both the audience and the
players seemed so universally disgusted with every aspect of the
work at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The only comfort to be found during this endlessly long drama
was this thought: At least it was only a play. Punch Shaw
contributes theater reviews and other arts pieces to the
``Star-Telegram'' and does not pay much attention to politics. We
didn't have the heart to tell him.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE PLAYERS
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde: This grandfatherly House manager made several strong
and powerful speeches during the presentation.
</P>
<P>
   William Rehnquist: The Supreme Court justice portrayed the judge
with the stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewsinky: ``That woman, Miss Lewinsky'' made a surprise
videotape appearance late in the saga.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr: The independent counsel offered the threat of
action late in the drama.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton: Our Lady MacBeth says, ``Out, out, damn
(vast right-wing conspiracy) plot.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The Peachees
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has its Oscars. Broadway has its Tonys. So shouldn't
the players in the impeachment drama also have an award? Here are
the Peachees.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest and Best Hair: Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison
</P>
<P>
   Best Monica-on-''Friends''-Update Hair: Monica Lewinsky
</P>
<P>
   Best Costume: Supreme Court Justice Rehnquist, portraying That
Guy Who Swears In the Senate, had yellow strips added to judicial
robes after seeing such a costume in a Gilbert and Sullivan
production.
</P>
<P>
   Best Comic Line: ``That depends on what your definition of `is'
is.'' President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Worst Blown Line: Again, President Clinton. Early on, he shakes
his finger at the audience and declares, ``I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,'' when clearly the script
must have read just the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Best Imitation of a Backwoods Preacher with a Grudge: Sen. Stom
Thurmond
</P>
<P>
   Worst Make-up or Worst Lighting?: In her video deposition,
Monica Lewinsky's upper lip was not the same color as her lower
lip.
</P>
<P>
   Special ``Revenge of the Nerds'' Award: Kenneth Starr
</P>
<P>
   Best No-Show: Rep. Newt Gingrich
</P>
<P>
   Best Imitation of Your Grandfather: Rep. Henry Hyde
</P>
<P>
   Best Live Commentary: The spectator in the Senate gallery who
shouted out, ``God almighty, take the vote and get it over with!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   A year ago, when Dr. Rita Colwell was sworn in as the director
of the National Science Foundation, new ground in science and
politics was broken. Dr. Colwell, a microbiologist now 64 years
old, became the first woman and the first biological scientist to
head the federal agency, whose $3.6 billion budget provides
financing for basic non-medical research in science and
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Before accepting the foundation post, Dr. Colwell was president
of the University of Maryland's Biotechnology Institute and one of
the world's major experts on cholera.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke during a break in a recent meeting of American
Association for the Advancement of Science in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)You went to Purdue University during the early
1950s, the time when the ideology that held that women were best
off as housewives and mothers was burning strongest. What was it
like to be a woman with scientific ambitions during that era?(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. It felt peculiar wanting to be a scientist when everyone
around me majored in home economics. On the other hand, I had
encouraging teachers. For instance, at Purdue, I took a course with
a bacteriologist named Dorothy Powelson. A woman bacteriologist in
those days was unbelievably rare. Her approach was, ``Look under
the microscope and what do you see?'' She got me hooked.
</P>
<P>
   My goal, originally, was to go to medical school. But in the
last semester of my senior year, I met this handsome 6-foot-2
physical chemistry graduate student, Jack Colwell, and after one
date, we decided to get married. The marriage, incidentally, has
lasted for 40-plus years. So I think it was a good decision. But
once I made it, medical school was out.
</P>
<P>
   So I began looking for a bacteriology fellowship. I went to the
chairman of the department of bacteriology and told him of my new
plans. ``We don't waste fellowships on women,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The day was saved by my adviser, Dr. Alan Burdick, a geneticist,
and he said, ``OK, their loss is our gain. Would you like a
fellowship to study genetics?'' This was the foundation of my
molecular biology career.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Did you encounter much prejudice during those
years.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, yes. In 1961, my husband was awarded a fellowship in
Canada. When I applied for one, too, the Canadian National Research
Council rejected me because of their ``anti-nepotism'' rule, which
precluded offering fellowships to husbands and wives. Eventually, I
obtained some funds from the National Science Foundation and was
offered laboratory space in Ottawa. The University of Washington,
where I'd received my doctorate, then appointed me a research
assistant professor and granted me a leave of absence. So in this
complicated way, I was able to be with my husband and still do my
research.
</P>
<P>
   You were always, always, going against the norm, the dogma. And
that does wear on a person after a while.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is the path still full of obstacles?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. They are there, sometimes. Especially when you're heading
organizations that used to be run by men. The academic world is
still a closed circle. I try to work around that.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, sometimes at meetings, a woman will suggest
something and there's no response afterward. Then, a male colleague
says exactly what you said and they say, ``By God, that's a good
thing to do!'' I've learned to seed the conversation quietly with
my ideas and then, they get adopted. You don't get the credit, but
if you're concerned about credit, nothing gets done.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)About your area of research _ cholera. Why was your
discovery _ that the cholera bacterium exists in a dormant stage in
most of the world's water _ a benchmark in the control of the
disease?(end italic)
</P>
<P>
   A. Because before our findings were published, the medical
community always believed cholera was transmitted person to person,
that it had a human host or reservoir. We showed it exists in the
environment, on plankton, and in a dormant stage between epidemics.
The implication of that is that when the plankton populations bloom
in the spring and again in the fall in countries like Bangladesh,
the bacterial numbers go way up _ along with the increase in
numbers in plankton. So if the water that is used directly for
drinking has large numbers of cholera bacteria in it, there may
then be enough bacteria present to cause the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)One idea you've come up with for cholera control in
Bangladesh is getting people to filter their drinking water by
pouring it through layers of sari cloth. How did such a simple
notion come to you?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I thought if one could remove the zooplankton _ the copepod
on the zoo plankton serve as host to the cholera bacteria in
drinking water _ we could go a long way toward curbing the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that sophisticated water filters were too
expensive for Bangladesh, one of the least wealthy countries on
earth. So the thought was, ``What could be used as a filter that
exists in everyday life?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was cloth, sari cloth, which even the poorest of the
poor have.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Has your method gained acceptance?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Where people use it, yes. Recently, I was in Bangladesh with
a crew from Maryland Public Television and we went to a village
where we asked a woman if she'd gather water for drinking.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   She did that and she could see plankton and various larval
stages swimming about the unfiltered water. ``The cause of cholera
is on the particles in the water,'' I explained. We then showed her
how to use the sari cloth as a filter. The filtered water wasn't
crystal clear, but it was clearer than the unfiltered water. There
was nothing swimming in it.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the cameraman wanted a shot of her going again to
collect water and drinking it, and she said, no _ she wasn't going
to ever drink unstrained water anymore.
</P>
<P>
   That woman ``got it,'' in a minute!
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Let's talk about some of the areas of research the
National Science Foundation supports. Do you think now that the
Cold War is over that the United States should be financing more
research in Antarctica?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh, absolutely. The things we can learn about atmospherics
science, physics, astronomy _ are done extraordinarily well at the
South Pole. It's the least contaminated area in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Do you have an opinion about human embryo
research?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I agree with Harold Varmus, the head of the National
Institutes of Health, who said that human stem cell research is
very important. It's an opportunity for us to learn how human cells
differentiate and the potential is so great for developing a
capacity for producing organs. I think the value to humanity, plus
the wonderful information it can bring about life and development
is so very, very important. I do think it's very fundamental.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Vice President Gore recently announced a $366
million a year information technology research initiative that the
NSF will be heavily involved in and that will finance new computer
hardware and software research. Why can't the computer industry,
which is doing quite well, finance this sort of thing itself?(end
italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Because the basic software research requires this kind of
investment. You need it in order to keep America at the cutting
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Let me just give you a vignette. I recently visited Seattle and
the computer science department at the University of Washington and
I met incredibly bright young people who were soaring like eagles
with their research. Afterward, I went to Microsoft and again met
some incredibly bright people. But it was like watching eagles
soaring within the aviary. They were netted-in because they had a
product-driven challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The United States as a nation, has got to be at the forefront of
this technology. The competition is keen from other countries. When
they put up a new university in China, the first structure they
build is the computer sciences building. Our military, our medical
institutions, need to go that next step for those new kinds of
languages that will link up a thousand processors for the kinds of
research we need to do.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)On a different subject, do you think physicists make
great husbands?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. (Laughs) I think, yes. I know that anecdotes don't make
statistics, but I was once on a panel for the National Institutes
of Health and there were four prominent women there speaking.
Afterward, we had lunch together, and it turned out that each one
of us was married to a physicist.
</P>
<P>
   We concluded that physicists have interesting work, a wide range
of interests and are not overly concerned about their masculinity.
Now obviously, you will find physicists who have none of these
characteristics. But in general, we all felt this was so.
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So your advice to a bright woman looking for an
appropriate man is: Go to a physics convention?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not quite sure it's that simple. What I think you have to
do is find someone who is interested in you as a partner, not as a
domestic. My husband is the most gentle and supportive soul I've
met in this life. We've been married a long time and it's been a
powerful partnership. He's been a superb father and much involved
with our two daughters. Both of them are scientists, by the way.

SOME ITALIAN FILM CRITICS HAVE VERY CATHOLIC TASTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ ``This is a comedy that offers absolutely nothing new and
is typical of a certain genre of American cinema that seeks to make
audiences laugh by mocking everything, from simple
misunderstandings (disguises, lies, identity switches) to jokes
that are heavier and in questionable taste (the handicapped.)''
</P>
<P>
   But this Italian review of the hit comedy ``Something About
Mary'' does offer something new: it is an online assessment by the
Roman Catholic Church. And it is not all negative. ``The film is
not mean, offensive or blasphemous,'' the review said, though it
dismissed the movie nonetheless as ``superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet movie review site, at
http://www.chiesacattolica.it./acec, is prepared by a film
commission of the Italian Bishops Conference and went online at the
beginning of the year. It is a glaring example of how the church
has changed its attitude toward the dominant cultural medium of the
age.
</P>
<P>
   That shift became evident in 1996, when the Vatican marked the
100th anniversary of film by issuing its own list of the 45 best
movies of the century. There were films with spiritual themes, like
``Gandhi'' and ``Ben-Hur,'' but also ``Citizen Kane,'' ``The Wizard
of Oz,'' ``The Bicycle Thief'' and ``La Strada.'' Since then
Catholic bishops around the world have weighed in with their own
assessments of contemporary cinema, with some intriguing cultural
differences.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Office of Film and Broadcasting of the
National Conference of Catholic Bishops introduced a more limited
movie review Web site two years ago. There are only two reviewers,
both laymen, and their site only discusses a handful of current
films (Web address: http://www.nccbuscc.org/movies/index.htm).
</P>
<P>
   The Italian bishops' Web site carries reviews of most current
films as well as movies dating back to 1991. By next year it plans
to have its entire archive on the Internet. In cinephiliac Europe,
moreover, the Catholic Church takes an unusually nuanced and
broad-minded approach to its reviews. ``We watch everything, even
R-rated films,'' said the Rev. Dario Vigano, a professor of ethics
at the Catholic University of Milan who sits on the church's
32-member film review board. ``We don't watch X-rated films, but
you can't really call those movies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We exist to give moral, not aesthetic, opinions,'' Vigano
added. ``If you look at our reviews of the soft-porn films of Tinto
Brass,'' a well-known Italian director, ``you will see why we
reject them. They aren't embarrassing to watch. After all, we are
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   The church long ago gave up the practice of blackballing films.
In 1934 Italian bishops began regularly vetting new releases to
guide church-run parish theaters, but there are only 600 of those
left in Italy. Nowadays, with families deluged by movies in
theaters, on cable and on videocasette, the church seeks to promote
those that uphold moral values.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the American church's version has four basic ratings,
from A-1 (``general patronage'') to O (``morally offensive''), the
Italian ratings range from ``acceptable'' to ``unacceptable,'' with
a broad palette of gradations, including ``dubious'' and
``fatuous.'' The bishops add a second and sometimes third
description after a slash to further assist viewers. ``Something
About Mary,'' for example, was rated ``inconsistent/vulgar.''
</P>
<P>
   A recently released Italian sex farce, ``Paparazzi,'' was rated
``futile.'' Massimo Giraldi, a layman who is chief reviewer at the
church's National Commission of Film Evaluation, explained that
while the movie was sexually explicit and thoroughly offensive, his
committee deemed it ``too stupid'' to merit a rating of
unacceptable. ``That would give the film too much importance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the church's online reviews are succinct
and prosaic, not unlike a Siskel and Ebert snippet; in Italy they
tend to be more in sync with the French journal Cahiers du Cinema,
with considered esthetic judgments, acid commentary on American
culture and erudite film references. Scenes from ``The Truman
Show,'' for example, are likened to moments in Fritz Lang's
``Metropolis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Joe Black,'' in which Brad Pitt plays the force of death,
recently opened in Italy and won a ``questionable/ambiguous''
rating, but the review focused on its intellectual flaws. ``The
life-death relationship moves within the usual pseudo-religious and
pseudo-philosophical systems that get lost in New Age trends,'' the
review said. ``It confirms a certain confusion that American
culture cannot shake when it deals with issues tied to the
supernatural.''

   Such assessments are a far cry from the rigid and terse
condemnations the Roman Catholic Church once issued in Europe and
the United States. In 1934 the American bishops instituted the
Legion of Decency, which lobbied Hollywood studios steadily, and
often successfully, to tailor movies to their own moral standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, where Catholicism was the state religion until 1984,
the church had an even closer relationship with the film industry.
Some of the first movies made in Europe at the turn of the century
were accounts of the life of Jesus; in Italy these were shown only
in churches. The Vatican banned church screenings after directors
began turning to secular topics, and instead allowed bishops to set
up parish theaters. There were some 6,000 church-run cinemas, half
of all the movie theaters in Italy, until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   To guide those theaters, Italian bishops started a journal of
their own reviews in 1934, Segnalazioni Cinematografiche, covering
even the most obscure movies; bound hardcover volumes are still
coveted by film buffs. ``Those old reviews are an important
reference point,'' said Serge Toubiana, editor in chief of Cahiers
du Cinema. ``They saw everything.''
</P>
<P>
   The church reviews gave a thumbs down to ``Dames,'' a 1934
musical starring Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, because it ``mocked
efforts to impose moral standards on show business.'' The same year
the church declared ``It Happened One Night,'' starring Clark Gable
and Claudette Colbert, ``wholesome'' but recommended that certain
scenes be omitted for young audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The church does not ban films, mainly because it has no
authority in Italy to approve what goes into commercial theaters.
But it does speak out against films it considers insulting, from
Fellini's 1960 classic ``La Dolce Vita,'' which mocked bourgeois
families loyal to the church, to Martin Scorsese's 1987 film ``The
Last Temptation of Christ,'' deemed too racy to be reverent.
</P>
<P>
   Pope John Paul II, a former theater actor and playwright, is not
much of a film enthusiast and does not watch television. But he
recently attended a Vatican screening of ``Life Is Beautiful,'' the
Italian comedy by Roberto Benigni that is set in the Holocaust and
has been nominated for seven Academy Awards. The animated film
``The Prince of Egypt'' was also shown recently at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Vigano, who attends international film festivals, said that
``Life Is Beautiful'' (``recommendable/poetic'') and ``The Truman
Show'' (``recommendable/difficult/good for debate'') were among his
favorites last year. He added that he was thrilled by the seven
Oscar nominations for the Benigni film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The panorama of Italian cinema is so flat, we welcome
Benigni,'' he said. ``His success confirms all the hopes of our
commission.''

<P>
   In the summer of 1996, a supervisor at a soft-drink factory in
Ghana, West Africa, angered some of the men working under him, and
during the fight that followed, lye was thrown in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, his vision would be declared an irreparable loss, and
doctors would not attempt treatment.
</P>
<P>
   His corneas, the windows over the pupil, had turned thick, white
and opaque. The globe of each eye had lost its fluid and deflated
like a limp balloon to less than half size. And the man's eyelids
had fused together.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, after the pioneering work of Dr. Relya
Zivojnovic in Belgium, surgery has brought back sight to people
with more and more extreme injuries. And now, according to a report
in last month's issue of Archives of Ophthalmology, the man from
Ghana has had vision restored to 20/60 in his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is tremendously interesting,'' said Dr. Halal Lewis,
director of the Eye Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. ``It
suggests that maybe some eyes that we thought would continue to
deteriorate can be saved, at least temporarily.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a loss of pressure inside the eye has occurred, the eye
usually deteriorates steadily into complete collapse. But in the
case of the man from Ghana, that has not happened, though his
doctors are not sure why. And by using an artificial cornea, Dr.
Claes Dohlman at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary was able
to restore vision to the patient's eye.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John D. Gottsch, of the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns
Hopkins Medical Center, noted: ``Eyes in as bad shape as this are
generally written off as hopeless. But this work by Dr. Dohlman is
very encouraging; it may teach us that even eyes like these have
the potential to see again.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Ghanaian man, Dohlman believed that enough of
the eye was still working _ the retina was intact and the glands
that make fluid in the eye were not completely lost _ that a
transplant might work. He used a clear plastic cornea to replace
the injured one. Because of the extensive tissue damage, he first
had to sew a patch of healthy eye tissue to the plastic cornea, and
then he transplanted both together onto the man's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The operation occurred in 1997, and the man's eye has retained
good vision for more than a year. It is not yet clear whether his
good vision will continue or deteriorate again over time.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known how many cases of injury leading ultimately to
complete collapse of the eye occur in the United States, but
researchers say the number is in the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   And they say that the case of the man from Ghana suggests that
some people now counted as untreatable may be able to have vision
restored for a time.

AT LIFE'S END, PATIENTS WANT THEIR WISHES TO BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the insightful and poignant drama, ``Wit,'' now
playing off-Broadway to wide acclaim, the protagonist _ a woman
professor with advanced ovarian cancer that spreads despite
aggressive medical treatment _ brings to light many of the issues
that still make dying an unduly painful experience for far too many
people in Western society. The woman writhes with intractable pain
because her doctor fails to order the patient-controlled analgesia
suggested by the oncology nurse. And when she finally takes her
last breath, a team races in with machines ready to revive her even
though her chart clearly states that she does not want to be
resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
   Dying is rarely easy. It is not easy for the person whose end is
near or for family members and friends who love the one who is
dying. It is made no easier when death is unduly prolonged by
life-sustaining medical instruments, when the patient is suffering
from severe pain or other intolerable symptoms, when family members
are forced to make difficult medical decisions without guidance
from the dying person and when the people closest to the dying
person cannot talk openly with the patient about what is happening
and bring their relationships to meaningful closure.
</P>
<P>
   Though in recent decades both families and physicians have begun
to discuss the subject of death and dying more openly, there still
appear to be wide gaps between what patients want for their last
days and what doctors and other health professionals think they
want.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last month in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, three Toronto experts on aging and dying
reviewed what patients consider to be appropriate care for the end
of life. The team, headed by Dr. Peter A. Singer, a general
internist and ethicist at the University of Toronto, analyzed the
findings of three studies of patients with life-threatening
disorders: 48 patients on dialysis, 40 patients infected with the
virus that causes AIDS and 38 residents in a long-term care
facility. They purposely did not include cancer patients because
most of what is known about end-of-life care has come from previous
studies of people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted results that could apply across the board to a broad
spectrum of illnesses and that would include the views of people
who are still relatively healthy,'' Dr. Singer said in an
interview. He and his colleagues, Dr. Douglas K. Martin and Dr.
Merrijoy Kelner, concluded that most of the quality-of-care
guidelines that have been promulgated by health professionals in
recent years are either too vague or too specific to be of much
help to patients and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns of patients and their families should be central
to what we do because they are at the center of the dying
experience,'' Dr. Singer said. Based on patient interviews, the
Toronto team formulated five concepts that they said could go a
long way toward improving the quality of care at the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest importance to patients, the team found, is avoiding
pointless prolongation of life.
</P>
<P>
   Patients said they feared ``lingering'' and ``being kept alive''
by machines after they could no longer enjoy life. Many were
terrified of becoming a ``vegetable'' or living in a coma. As one
patient put it, ``If it ever comes down to being put on a
life-support system, I wouldn't go for it unless there's a chance
that I would come around and be normal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients were adamant about wanting to retain control of their
end-of-life care decisions while they were capable of doing so, and
they wanted the proxy of their choice to retain control if they
were no longer able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But by control, patients did not mean ``micromanaging every
treatment decision as if they were ordering take-out food,'' Dr.
Singer said. ``Rather, they want a sense of control, to know that
their views will be respected and followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients interviewed wanted to spare their loved ones of any
serious burdens related to their dying, including having to provide
physical care and having to make decisions about life-sustaining
treatment without guidance from the patient. As one of those
interviewed put it, ``I don't want them making the decisions for me
without knowing how I would decide the same thing. They don't have
to say, `Well, what would he do in this situation?' if it's already
written down.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients also wanted their loved ones to be fully involved
with them in talking about their dying. They said that such
communication strengthened their relationships, even though at
times it required overcoming resistance _ their own and others' _
to deal with such an uncomfortable subject.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, patients wanted to be assured of receiving adequate
treatment for pain and other symptoms, like vomiting, diarrhea and
breathlessness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many studies have praised the value of patient-controlled
analgesia both for patients and for the health professionals who
care for them. It allows patients to give themselves pain
medication before pain becomes unbearable and far more difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Singer suggests that you pull together family members and
talk about how each would like to be treated at the end life. Then
there is no indecision or guilt when a son has to order
discontinuation of a feeding tube for a mother dying of
Alzheimer's, or when a wife says no life support for a spouse with
terminal cancer and in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A living will is not just a piece of paper that you fill out
with your doctor or lawyer,'' Dr. Singer said. ``It's really about
facing your death in the context of your family and working with
the family to relieve them of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is also important if you become a patient in a
medical facility to make your views about end-of-life care known to
the doctors and nurses and to make sure those views are properly
recorded on your chart. If the patient cannot communicate at the
time of hospitalization, family members should inform the staff of
the patient's previously expressed views, especially if these were
recorded in a living will or health care proxy.
</P>
<P>
   As for relief of pain and other debilitating but controllable
symptoms, patients or their families must insist upon it. There is
nothing worse than uncontrolled pain to turn the end of life into
an intolerable nightmare for patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses, too, must participate in improving
end-of-life care by paying as much attention to the needs and
desires of patients as they do to treating illnesses. In ``Wit,''
the doctor has to keep reminding himself that his patient is a
human being with a mind and feelings, not just a rampaging cancer
he is trying desperately _ and unsuccessfully _ to control.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Singer noted, ``For most people, death is not a beautiful
experience. But it ought not to be a terrible one either. By
focusing on issues that are important to patients, most terrible
deaths can be avoided.''

CRUSADE AGAINST PESTICIDES COSTS COMPANY LOTS, BUT ACTIVIST MORE

   This is the story of Mark O'Connor, a Texas environmental
activist whose little-known crusade against a company for arsenic
contamination in Bryan-College Station mirrors the high-profile
story of Jan Schlichtmann, played by John Travolta in the current
hit movie ``A Civil Action.'' O'Connor's story, though, is the tale
of a brilliant but deeply disillusioned man who spent much of his
adult life wasting his talent, drowning himself in alcohol and
drugs. His whistle-blowing work paved the road to his redemption,
led to the closure of the pesticide plant Elf Atochem and initiated
one of the largest environmental settlements in state history. For
O'Connor, it was a solitary fight, one that for the most part paid
him nothing and tore apart his family life. This story was
constructed after examining legal documents and hundreds of
newspaper stories, talking to O'Connor's friends and family and
examining more than 300 E-mails and personal documents that
belonged to Mark O'Connor, who died of a heart attack five months
ago at age 41.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   PROLOGUE
</P>
<P>
   BRYAN, Texas _ The cold rain came down hard, as it had for
weeks. Mark O'Connor walked along the fence line of the Elf Atochem
herbicides/pesticides plant, in search of arsenic. Actually, he was
looking for a pile of dirt, one contaminated with deadly inorganic
arsenic. He stamped out his cigarette and put his chin to his chest
to keep his glasses dry.
</P>
<P>
   His mood was dour. It wasn't the winter storms that he cussed.
He loved rainwater; it was pure. Rain was not the problem. People
were the problem. He had spent the past few days vehemently arguing
with Elf Atochem managers, the same higher-ups who six months
earlier had asked Mark's hazardous-waste cleanup company to help
the plant dispose of its arsenic-contaminated waste water. A
relationship with Elf Atochem could have led to a long-term
contract worth millions. But he couldn't keep quiet. The pesticide
plant's carelessness in disposing of its hazardous waste threatened
the surrounding lakes and soil.
</P>
<P>
   Mark's anger had peaked a few nights earlier, when he was
working past midnight at the plant, filtering and disposing of
chemically tainted rainwater. He stumbled across a scene that
horrified him: a plant worker dumping contaminated water into a
waterstream, through a pipe drilled into the dike. The stream ran
to ``No-Name Lake,'' which turned into a creek, which poured into
Finfeather Lake, which ran through the city of Bryan to Bryan
Municipal Lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you doing?'' Mark asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pumping water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I can,'' he said. ``Supervisor said I'm supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he said, Mark thought. ``I'm supposed to.'' He's
supposed to what, poison the water? Thinking about it now, marching
along the fence line in his search for arsenic-contaminated dirt,
Mark became angry again. The managers hadn't flinched when I told
them that story, he thought. Said it was no big deal, they'd take
care of it. It was obvious to him they didn't care. That was even
clearer when he talked to the plant workers and shared his rage.
Many of them rolled their eyes or chuckled, as if what he talked
about was standard operating procedure. ``If you think that's
bad,'' one said, ``you should see the pile.''
</P>
<P>
   So the pile was where Mark headed. When he reached it, he was at
the property's edge, staring at a heap of arsenic-contaminated dirt
that had been dug up and deposited near the shoreline of Finfeather
Lake to make room for Elf Atochem's newly paved parking lot. It was
large, about 5,000 cubic yards' worth of bulldozed earth. It was
uncovered. If it was severely arsenic-contaminated, Mark thought,
this was bad. Rain and wind could cause the arsenic to ``leach''
into the nearby lake and land, despite the fence surrounding it. At
least the gate was secure; he counted three padlocks. There were
spirals of razor wire atop the tall fence. Mark walked the fence
line clear back behind the pile, off the road, toward the lake.
Mark was shocked at what he found: The fence ended. It did not
connect. It was three-sided.
</P>
<P>
   As he neared the pile of dirt that day in January 1991, he had
no way of knowing that it was fully 1 percent arsenic _ enough to
``kill an elephant,'' as his father would later say. He did not
foresee that this mound of earth would eventually cost Elf Atochem
$2.5 million, a bargain compared with the hundreds of millions the
company would eventually be committed to paying in fines and
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   As well, Mark had no idea that this discovery and others like it
would consume him for the rest of the decade, giving his life
purpose and a sense of redemption, even as they ripped apart his
family. He did not know how his crusade against environmental
complacency and injustice would rouse his friends, anger powerful
corporations and give hope to a handful of families whose children
were born with fatal diseases.
</P>
<P>
   There was no way he or anyone else could understand how the
victories and ultimate tragedy that would befall Mark O'Connor
would nevertheless sow seeds of hope for people he did not know and
for the son he would eventually inspire.
</P>
<P>
   All Mark O'Connor knew then was that he spotted tricycle tire
tracks in the soil. He was not sure whether the tracks had any
connection to the children's plastic toy pail someone had left atop
the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rod O'Connor set his tray down on one of the long picnic
tables inside the Tony DeMaria Bar B Q restaurant in Waco in
Central Texas. It was November 1998, and the environmental
chemistry classes he taught at Baylor University were preparing for
Thanksgiving break.
</P>
<P>
   It was warm out, more than 70 degrees, but Dr. Rod said he
wanted hot barbecue, never mind the weather. He was retirement age,
64, like most of the customers in Tony's. Unlike most, he was
white.
</P>
<P>
   He surveyed the poor-side barbecue dive as he dipped one of four
thick slices of white bread into the gravy/drippings that came with
his skin-on chicken. ``I worked at a place like this in high
school,'' he said, smiling. ``There was a poster on the wall that
said, `The Lord does not subtract from your three score and ten the
days you spent fishing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rod hadn't been fishing in a long time. He and his son,
Mark, used to cast often _ fishing in Montana, Missouri-style, none
of that over-romanticized fly-fishing stuff. They hiked in Arizona,
walked the plains of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   That was before their relationship changed, before the teen-age
Mark embraced fully the hippie vibe of the '70s. Mark still carried
a slide rule _ he was an excellent student _ but his increasing use
of drugs and alcohol began to affect his desire to excel. He grew
his hair long. He fought often with his father.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rod didn't understand. Rod O'Connor was born in a small
Missouri town. Growing up, he had done as his father, a school
superintendent, had told him to do. ``I was a goody two-shoes,''
Dr. Rod says. When he and his wife saw ``Rebel Without a Cause'' in
1955, he says, he ``never did figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   When the offer came to teach at Texas A&AMP;M in 1973, Dr. Rod was
happy to move from Spokane, Wash. He thought that perhaps the
conservative nature of the Bible Belt would help straighten Mark
out. Any town surrounded by places like Snook and Madisonville, as
Bryan-College Station is, must be a good influence.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The lake had a strong, unpleasant odor, even in 1973. The Texas
Water Quality Board found that Lake Finfeather and the lake it fed,
Bryan Municipal Lake, contained levels of arsenic 50 times higher
than the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency allowed. A few years
earlier, the state had blamed Pennwalt Corp.'s herbicide/pesticide
plant _ later Elf Atochem _ that sat adjacent to Finfeather, and
ordered the plant to clean up the mess. But Pennwalt's treatment of
the lake proved hazardous as well: The chemical added to disperse
the arsenic instead made it collect on the lake's floor.
</P>
<P>
   No one was surprised, then, in 1973 when a Bryan-College Station
lawyer filed suit against Pennwalt in the 85th State District
Court, asking that the company stop discharging dangerous chemicals
into the water and that it be made responsible for its cleanup. It
was estimated then that there were between 300,000 and 700,000
pounds of arsenic-contaminated sludge at the lakes' bases.
</P>
<P>
   That so much contaminant could collect in a freshwater lake was
understandable, given the plant site's history. In 1940, the Bryan
company Cotton Poisons began producing calcium arsenate, used since
the turn of the century to kill pests on cotton crops.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental health concerns during this time were almost
nonexistent. There were pictures taken by the plant of workers
covered in white arsenic powder; piles of calcium arsenate would be
left outside to dry so they could be ground into powder and sold.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, the company was bought by Pennsylvania Salt
Manufacturing Co. (eventually known as Pennwalt Corp.), which later
also manufactured arsenic acid-based cotton desiccants used to
defoliate cotton. (The arsenic dried the cotton, which made it
easier to pick.)
</P>
<P>
   For the next few decades, the company would continue producing
arsenic-based materials. Pennwalt would later acknowledge that the
sins of these decades undoubtedly contributed to the problem that
came to be known locally as ``Lake Arsenic.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1975, Texas regulators were convinced that waste water from
Pennwalt had seeped into the lake and caused the environmental
hazard. A plant official told a group of concerned citizens that
the company would work to clean up the lake, but that ``as long as
arsenic is in demand, we will keep making it.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   One year later, the lawsuit against the company ended in a
consent judgment: Pennwalt would drain Lake Finfeather and remove
the arsenic-contaminated sediment. Although it agreed to fix the
problem, Pennwalt did not admit any wrongdoing. ``In this kind of
judgment,'' an attorney fighting Pennwalt said after the decision,
``we don't expect a defendant to admit that he is guilty as hell.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Mark O'Connor was well on his way to drunkenness most nights in
1987, often bringing a 12-pack of Miller Lite to comfort him
through his dreary job as a technical vice president/gopher for his
dad's company, Texas Romec.
</P>
<P>
   Mark had undergone a steady slide into depression and
drug-induced escape since his arrival in Bryan. His SAT scores
allowed him to skip his senior year of high school and get admitted
early to Texas A&AMP;M, but Mark was chafed by the school's
``ultraconservative, stodgy mindset.'' As he would later write in
E-mails to friends:
</P>
<P>
   ``I still remember the looks and comments I got as a 17-year-old
freshman with hair down to my (rear) in 1974 _ right around the
time the Corps was rabidly resisting integration of women into
their ranks.''
</P>
<P>
   He was equally disillusioned with the faculty, believing they
were more concerned with grant money and corporate-funded research
than teaching and new ideas:
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent my summers doing construction work and soon decided
that many of the men shoveling beside me in ditches seemed far
wiser than most of my professors at A&AMP;M. ... After a year and a
half, I ... chose to embark on the noble mission of being an honest
working man. I had also started developing the unfortunate habit of
trying to hide from myself, my dissatisfactions and my increasingly
cynical view of the world with beer and drugs. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked job after job: ditch-digger, telephone lineman,
oilfield, construction, electrician, cable lineman. ... By the time
I reached 30, I discovered that I had obtained no real skills and
that the drinking and drugging had reached the point to where I was
practically unemployable anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The only semi-steady work he could find was with his father, Dr.
Rod, who had co-founded Texas Romec in 1980 while still teaching.
Texas Romec developed new technologies for toxic waste treatments,
specifically to filter and purify waste water at oilfield sites.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Mark built the company's signature piece of equipment:
a patented reverse-osmosis filtration system inside an 18-wheeler
for use in oilfields and other hazardous-water cleanup sites. The
job offered some travel, and an opportunity to bond with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Money troubles forced them to sell the patent on the
reverse-osmosis system. But by the mid- to late-'80s, the company
had discovered an unlikely source of income: flea combs. Mark and
Dr. Rod had designed combs that contained flea medicine, so pets
could be treated by combing them. It became Texas Romec's chief
source of income by 1987. But it didn't make Mark enjoy work any
more.
</P>
<P>
   Then Mark fell in love. Her name was Shannon, a high school
student hired by his dad, a pretty blond girl who talked into the
night about his dreams and overlooked his addictions. She moved in
with Mark, her older man, the flea-comb-magnate-turned-dreamer with
bad credit.
</P>
<P>
   When, in 1989, they had a son, Kyle, Mark left his last Miller
Lite can, half-consumed, in the parking lot of his first Alcoholics
Anonymous meeting. The program took. Mark and Shannon reveled in
his new-found sobriety, going to AA dances, to the beach, camping.
With Mark's drug-induced haze gone, he and Dr. Rod tried to
re-establish communication by writing poetry to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there were still problems to overcome. Mark slept during
the day and stayed up at night, as he'd conditioned his body, which
wasn't conducive to the typical family life Shannon wanted. But for
now, it seemed as if the clouds were parting. And it stayed that
way, until Mark's obsession with Elf Atochem.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, 1989, a Bryan Utilities transformer blew. The power
outage lasted three hours. Included in the buildings that went
powerless was Elf Atochem, which had merged one month earlier with
Pennwalt to form the new company.
</P>
<P>
   For those three hours, there was a scrubber system shutdown. The
scrubbers are like filters that catch hazardous materials in the
air that are produced during the acid-manufacturing process. There
was no catching now. Billows of yellow-orange acid fumes containing
nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide filled the plant.
</P>
<P>
   As was standard procedure by this time, the employees of the
plant with the new $10 billion French-owned parent company ran from
the building as fast as they could.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The weed never made him this high, Mark thought as he unlocked a
door at the Elf Atochem plant in January 1991, shortly after his
discovery of the arsenic-loaded dirt pile. ``Breaking and
entering'' was such a nasty, bureaucratic term, he thought.
Besides, he had his own set of keys. He preferred to call it
``trespassing for a higher cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark took pictures of the things he would later claim proved Elf
Atochem's unsafe practices. He photographed open drums of
chemicals, leaky tanks, flooded areas. He photographed the dirt
pile, which now comically had a mostly torn tarp draped over it.
The photographs would eventually prove critical in getting
regulatory agencies to take notice of the problems.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Dr. Rod called his patent attorney, the only
one he knew well. ``I told him that we were in a quandary. We
wanted to finish the job initially, but we knew they were breaking
the law. He told me that we had better call it in, or we'd be
culpable.'' Dr. Rod made a call to the Texas Air Control Board and
Texas Water Commission. (These would later become the Texas Natural
Resource Conservation Commission, or TNRCC.) They asked Mark and
Dr. Rod to write down everything they had heard or seen.
</P>
<P>
   They had heard a lot, because Mark's inquiry didn't stop with
picture-taking. During the next several months, he would play
investigative reporter, quizzing the workers and anyone with
knowledge of the plant's operations. There were many horrific
stories, several of which would be documented by the local media
and government agencies, including:
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``disastrous spill'' in 1982 of 1,000 to 1,500 pounds of
arsenic trioxide, which created an arsenic dust cloud that sent the
plant workers fleeing into the streets, warning others to get away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Numerous ``boilovers,'' such as one reported in 1988 when a
``reactor'' vat of arsenic trioxide overflowed during the
manufacturing process, again causing a mass exodus. During a
boilover, nitric oxide fumes and arsenic smokes were released
through the smokestacks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air and soil samplings that showed high levels of arsenic in
the air, dust and soil in a two-mile area surrounding the plant.
There were also stories about what seemed an unusual number of
babies born with partially formed brains who died shortly after
birth.
</P>
<P>
   _ A reaction of methyl parathion and cement caused a 55-gallon
drum to rupture and catch fire, which in turn inflamed adjacent
drums, sending smoke throughout the building. Afterward, a fire
department test noted levels of hydrogen sulfide in excess of 1
percent inside the building, a potentially hazardous level.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employee allegations that someone was jamming the alarms so
that they would not sound if such accidents occurred.
</P>
<P>
   To Mark's chagrin, the company's problems were well-known to the
agencies _ for example, a dust sampling taken by the Texas Air
Control Board in a day-care center near the plant in 1988 contained
arsenic levels at 1,900 parts per million. The average level in the
United States was about 5 parts per million. Mark was dumbfounded.
Governmental agencies had fined and monitored the plant, but to
Mark it wasn't enough. He wanted to know, ``Why hadn't more been
done?''
</P>
<P>
   For the next few years, Mark continued to gather as much
information as possible. Elf Atochem became his life. His only
income was from Texas Romec; the help he gave regulators and law
firms paid him little or nothing. He worked with the regulatory
agencies and helped law enforcement groups gather information in
hopes of prompting criminal charges against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   But the time spent working against Elf Atochem did not help
Mark's personal life. As Shannon put it, ``It seemed like I woke up
one day, and all THIS was happening.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Mark spent much of his time investigating the plant's
operations. He wandered up and down the railroad tracks that
bordered the plant to the east, looking for any sign of
improprieties. He walked the fence line on the west side as well,
standing on the hood of his truck, taking pictures with Kodak
disposable cameras, enduring the jeers of the workers who spotted
him.
</P>
<P>
   Home life became chaotic. Mark kept scores of legal note pads
scattered about, each one scribbled and doodled on; hundreds of
newspaper clippings littered the house. Phone bills regularly ran
from $400 to $600 because of the calls Mark made to activists,
writers, agencies, officials and aggrieved parties throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The strong hint of danger was always present. Clicking sounds
and strange noises led Mark and Shannon to believe that their phone
was tapped. Shannon would come home and find FBI agents or Texas
Rangers at her table, talking to Mark. The agencies suggested that
Mark get a remote-ignition switch for his truck, just in case,
which he never did. Mark bought Shannon a snub-nosed .38-caliber
handgun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't normal,'' Shannon would say later. ``It was not
the way I wanted to live. The danger somewhat intrigued him, but I
hated the whole situation. He was the best father he knew how to
be, but he wasn't always there to begin with. Then this came along.
He had time for everybody but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the work clearly paid off for him in one respect: In
December 1992, after months of wrangling over Elf Atochem's ground
water and lake cleanup efforts, the company and the Texas Water
Commission agreed on an $11 million payout, the largest
environmental settlement to that point in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Included was $2.5 million for environmental violations _
including the now-famous dirt pile _ and $6.6 million to buy out or
compensate affected property owners. This was in addition to the
$14 million the company estimated it would have to spend to clean
up the plant site. All told, it was estimated the company would pay
$26 million.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The company told the Houston Chronicle that it didn't want to go
to court with the commission, which had estimated that Elf Atochem
had allowed 4,000 gallons of arsenic-laced ground water daily to
seep into the nearby creek and lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Mark felt his first twinge of vindication. It was an important
triumph, Mark believed, but he hoped for more than a monetary
punishment. By summer 1993, he thought that would come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed Texas Environmental Task Force executed search
warrants at the Bryan plant and Atochem North America's corporate
offices in Pennsylvania. They were hoping to find evidence of
criminal negligence in the company's handling of the Bryan plant.
</P>
<P>
   They found little that was useful. Months later, a high-level
company executive, on condition of anonymity, would tell the
Bryan-College Station Eagle, ``These files were cleaned not only
this spring, but several times the last year or so. The
(incriminating) information is not here anymore _ gone.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   After the first year of investigating Elf Atochem, Mark and Dr.
Rod were convinced that, although the contaminated ground water and
its seepage into the lakes were important, the real hazard was
airborne chemicals carried from the plant to the surrounding
neighborhoods. It didn't take long for Mark to test that theory.
</P>
<P>
   Three law firms had descended upon the town, signing up
residents to class-action and property lawsuits against Elf
Atochem. To prove the hazardous levels of arsenic in the
surrounding area, Mark was overseeing testing for various lawyers
and firms.
</P>
<P>
   There was no problem in finding arsenic. On ceiling fans, in
doorways, on air-conditioning units _ the dust had arsenic levels
ranging from 80 to 2,000 parts per million, when 5 parts per
million was average. But the company argued that such findings in
no way implicated it. Arsenic can be found in rat poison. It could
have been blown there by various means.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rod and Mark provided the way to overcome that argument. A
few years earlier, the Texas Air Control Board had conducted a test
of the dust in the air being emitted from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The key was not the arsenic in the air samples, but the other
chemicals for which it tested: zinc and manganese, which were also
used in the plant's product manufacturing. Because the ratio of
arsenic to zinc to manganese in the houses matched the ratio found
in the plant's dust emissions, it was a fingerprint, one that
pointed toward Elf Atochem.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Cynthia and Neal Coates moved to a house six-tenths of
a mile from the Elf Atochem plant. In 1992, their son, Samuel, was
born with a partially formed brain, a small portion of which
protruded from the back of his head. As with most anencephalic
babies, he struggled to breathe and to suckle for most of his short
life.
</P>
<P>
   The Coateses knew Samuel was dying one night in October, the
same night they attended the home birth of Neal's sister's child.
While his sister labored, Neal and Cynthia took turns holding
Samuel, taking pictures, telling him he was loved. The baby cousin
arrived at 11:30 p.m. Samuel died three hours later. He had lived
one day short of two months.
</P>
<P>
   Initial newspaper reports said Samuel was the first anencephalic
child born in the area in eight years. But Mark found others in his
door-to-door searching, poorer families who weren't counted,
stories later verified by the law firms. Each case was more
painful, more touching, than the last. Mark found that many studies
linked arsenic contamination and neural-tube birth defects, such as
anencephaly and spina bifida.
</P>
<P>
   Mark wanted to be sure these cases weren't lost in the large
class-action lawsuits that were brewing. Firms had come in and
signed up homeowners for lawsuits, but Mark wasn't convinced they
were passionate enough to do what was right by the 12 families who
had 13 children with such defects, all of whom lived near the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   With Mark's help, these families got their big gun: famed
Houston attorney Joe Jamail, who had helped Pennzoil win one of the
largest civil settlements in history in a contract dispute with
Texaco.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Jamail walked into a meeting with the lawyers
for Elf Atochem and several other chemical companies now involved
in the suit. He carefully laid out 13 graphic pictures of
anencephalic babies, showing their deformities to everyone in the
room. As one version of the story goes, he then addressed the
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today and today only,'' Jamail said, ``one hundred thirty
million dollars to settle. Otherwise, the parents get on the stand
and tell their stories.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers settled, although Elf Atochem did not admit guilt.
Newspaper reports put the figure at ``more than $100 million.'' Elf
Atochem's lawyers dispute this, but cite confidentiality portions
of the agreement in declining to detail the actual amount.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   There was no reaction at the Elf Atochem plant to the news. The
company had been closed for more than a year; Elf Atochem shuttered
its Bryan operations in October 1993 because, it said, the
operations were no longer profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the company settled a class-action suit for $55
million. The settlement ensured that no additional similar claims
could be made against the company, no matter what health problems
residents developed in the future. Mark felt this amount wasn't
enough. Concerned that more arsenic-caused illnesses would show up
years from now, he led a successful effort to appeal the case _
including going to the Texas A&AMP;M library to learn how to write a
brief himself, which he submitted on behalf of contesting
litigants. The settlement is currently before the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it weren't for Mark,'' says the Sierra Club's Neil Carman,
``I think it (the plant) would still be running.'' All that is left
behind at the Elf Atochem site now are ground-water treatment
facilities to continue the plant's cleanup of contaminated ground
water and soil.
</P>
<P>
   The day the plant closed, Mark allowed himself a small moment of
satisfaction. Although he felt bad for the 30 or so workers who
lost their jobs, he knew the larger wrong had been righted, at
least partially. I've finally done good, he thought. His life had
been given purpose, importance. The water was turning pure. It
tasted good.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Shannon left Mark in 1996. The separation came as a shock to
Mark. Although the split was relatively amicable _ they would share
time with Kyle equally _ Mark still didn't understand what he'd
done wrong. He told himself and Shannon that by helping the
community, he was helping his family.
</P>
<P>
   To help deal with the pain, Mark wrote often of his travails to
an E-mail list known as ``Bobwahred,'' composed of journalists,
lawyers and others of like interests. He usually signed his notes
or E-mails as a variation of ``Rainman'': a person who turned water
pure as rain.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote of his ongoing battles in East Texas that occupied him
through the latter '90s: He was now fighting chicken-processing
plants, searching for mercury dumps, doing various investigations
for lawyers in other suits. But his role as environmental watchdog
became increasingly difficult. As he wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these fights, especially the inexcusable resistance
offered by the environmental regulatory agencies, wear on me. I
know ... about the loss of hope, the meaninglessness of trying to
change a system that can't be changed. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. I'll get up tomorrow morning, put on my pants
and try to get by one more day. If I'm accomplishing nothing else,
at least I didn't cop out today, at least I tried, and as fruitless
as it may all end up, it is that that I choose to try to pass on to
my son _ Rain.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Mark was huffing. It was mid-September 1998, a Thursday evening,
two years after the separation, eight years after he first set foot
on Elf Atochem grounds, and he was the assistant coach for Kyle's
soccer team. He was running up and down the field, playing goalie.
He was thin, looked to be in good shape, had only turned 41. But a
lifetime of Benson &AMP; Hedges didn't help his on-field stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Mark had much to be excited about. His relationship with Shannon
was very amicable. His 9-year-old son was healthy and doing well in
school. Work was good, too. Mark had spent the year as an
investigator for an environmental law firm in East Texas, rounding
up information on another hazardous waste site near Caddo Lake.
</P>
<P>
   His personal life was ... well, he finally had prospects of
having a personal life. He had recently hit it off with a young
woman, and the next night would be their first official date.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon told him he looked pale. ``I don't feel well,'' he said.
``I need to eat.'' Mark and Kyle returned to his house. Mark put
Kyle to bed between 9 and 9:30 p.m. He kissed him good night.
</P>
<P>
   Between 10 and 10:30 p.m., Dr. Rod called with good news: A new
job was calling them to southern Asia, to clean up
arsenic-contaminated drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Mark hung up and lay down on the couch. The television was on.
He still didn't feel right. Tired. Maybe he should just crash on
the couch. He often slept there, anyway. Time for adventures
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, Mark had E-mailed friends about the purest
water he'd ever sipped. His words seemed a fitting dream:
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   ``Y'all talkin' about smells and light and corn bread ... brings
back so many memories of visiting my maternal grandparents in
Gordonville, Missouri, population 99 back then ... Pappo and
Grandma Mienie. They had no plumbing, just an outside cistern with
a hand pump on it so every time I stumble into a filthy Exxon
station restroom in Buffalo or Dime Box I'm reminded once again of
their old outhouse. Every night Grandma Mienie would go out and
fill a huge kettle at the pump and put it on the coal-burning stove
to heat up and make us a bath in a big old tin tub. In the winter
the house was heated with coal stoves and in the summer you
languished in the heat and humidity, listening to the cacophony of
crickets and cicadas until you could finally fall asleep. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold those times close to my heart because I know I'll never
see anything remotely like that again. I've never tasted water so
damn good as what came out of that cistern. The smells of that old
house, the utter satisfaction of just sitting in that porch swing
with an old man smoking a pipe and not saying a word while he
listened to his ballgame, the sky lit up with fireflies, the clinks
and clanks coming from the kitchen at sun-up as Grandma Mienie
stoked the stoves and got some scrambled eggs going for everyone. I
honest to God could live like that if I can ever figure out a way
to get back there _ Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Mark's alarm went off in his bedroom and woke Kyle up.
Sleepy-eyed, he turned the alarm off and saw his dad in the living
room, on the couch, hands on his chest. The television was still
on. Kyle went to the kitchen and started a pot of coffee for his
dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad, get up.''
</P>
<P>
   He walked over to the couch and pushed his dad. He felt cold.
Kyle put a blanket over him. Kyle checked his breathing. He
immediately ran to the phone. He called his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom,'' he said calmly, ``something's not right. Daddy's not
breathing. I think he's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Shannon burst through the door. Peaceful as he
looked, Shannon could tell immediately that Mark was dead. She
found Kyle crying in a fetal position in his bedroom. She picked
him up and took him to a neighbor's house, ran back and called 911.
Shannon thought of Kyle, and she asked that the ambulance please
not turn on its siren.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   EPILOGUE
</P>
<P>
   No one would have guessed that Mark O'Connor would die of a
heart attack at age 41 _ or that he would die a hero, or that his
funeral would be packed with people from all over the state.
</P>
<P>
   He struggled with demons his whole life, with stubbornness and
disillusionment. Yet it was these traits that gave him the strength
to battle through the environmental crusades that defined his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, he could thank his parents for his zealous outlook,
even though he had trouble communicating with them until late in
his life. As Mark wrote: ``I was raised to know right from wrong
... I was taught that the guy in the white hat always wins, good
triumphs over evil and justice in my country was sure, swift and
true.'' He wrote these words sarcastically, but it's obvious he
never stopped believing that such was the way life should be.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their troubles communicating, Dr. Rod takes pride in how
Mark finally squared his life with his passions. ``Mark and I could
talk about technical stuff, but not about the stuff that was
hurting him or me. But his work and writings helped close any old
wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the inheritance he leaves for the son who admired him.
Shannon tells about the time years ago when she went into the
garage and saw that Kyle had erected an elaborate system of hoses,
pipes, buckets and valves. He was playing Dad, making water run
from bucket to bucket. Like Mark O'Connor, she says, Kyle will make
waters pure.

PRODUCTIVE SLEEPING  
 RECALCULATING RADON  
 WATCHING TERMITES EAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mich.)   (af)  
 By HENRY FOUNTAIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever had too much to do and too little time to do
it knows the feeling: So much more could be accomplished if there
were some way to be asleep and awake at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Birds have figured out a way to do just that. They can sleep
with one eye open and with one half of the brain awake. The
phenomenon, known as unihemispheric slow-wave sleep, is thought to
allow a snoozing bird to detect an approaching predator _ literally
keeping an eye out for the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, researchers at Indiana State University have shown that
birds can increase the amount of time they spend in unihemispheric
sleep if there is a greater risk from predators. It is the first
evidence, the scientists say, of an animal's controlling sleep and
wakefulness in different parts of the brain at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who reported on their study in a recent issue
of Nature, worked with mallard ducks in groups of four, lined up in
a row. The birds on the outside in each group _ more exposed to any
potential predator _ spent more than twice the amount of time in
unihemispheric sleep than those in the center.
</P>
<P>
   And during such sleep, the outside birds kept their outside eye
open more than 85 percent of the time. Birds in the center, though,
showed no preference for which eye they kept open. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   Home buyers are usually warned about the dangers of radon, a
naturally occurring radioactive gas that can build up inside a
tightly sealed home.
</P>
<P>
   Alpha particle radiation as the gas decays can damage the DNA in
lung tissue, potentially causing cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But the extent of the threat is a subject of some debate.
Because the level of radon in homes is low, estimates of the hazard
have been made by extrapolating from studies of uranium miners, who
are exposed to much higher levels of the gas. But a new study,
detailed in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,
shows that such extrapolation may overestimate the hazard in homes.
</P>
<P>
   In high-level exposure, as in a mine, a single cell of lung
tissue is hit by many alpha particles. But in a low-level
situation, a cell is only very rarely hit by more than one
particle. The problem for researchers has been to determine the
cancer-causing effect of one-particle bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, researchers from Columbia University used a
device called a charged-particle microbeam, which is capable of
irradiating individual cell nuclei with a specific number of alpha
particles. By irradiating thousands of lung-tissue cells from mice
with exactly one particle each, the researchers determined that the
frequency of DNA damage was quite low. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of high-fiber diets, the termite takes the cake,
eating all wood all the time. It might be expected that digesting
all that fiber would produce large amounts of methane gas. (Other
creatures that eat a lot of fiber _ notably cows _ are big
producers of methane, as anyone who has spent time on a dairy farm
can attest.)
</P>
<P>
   But many species of termites produce less methane than expected,
and in a recent study in the journal Science, researchers from
Michigan State University explained why. The researchers showed
that a type of bacteria known as spirochetes in the guts of some
termites catalyzed the production of acetate, rather than methane,
as all that fiber was digested.
</P>
<P>
   The acetate became a major energy source for the insects. (The
same could not be said for the methane gas produced by a cow.)
</P>
<P>
   The researchers suggested that learning more about how termites
digest their food could help improve nutrition for cows and other
animals that did not eat as efficiently. Such research could also
help cut down on the production of methane, which is a significant
contributor to the greenhouse effect.

GROWTH POTENTIAL

 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Will I grow up to be short like my mother or tall
like my father?(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Your adult height will probably be somewhere in between.
</P>
<P>
   Some rough estimates can be made based on the growth patterns of
many children, said Dr. W. Ted Brown, a doctor and geneticist at
the Institute for Basic Research on Staten Island, N.Y. These
methods assume that there is no disease or hormonal problem to
hinder your genetic potential.
</P>
<P>
   Because height at the age of 3 is approximately 60 percent of
adult height for girls and 55 percent of adult height for boys, two
times your height as a 2-year-old would be roughly your adult
height.
</P>
<P>
   Another rule of thumb uses your parents' heights. Add them,
divide by two, then add three inches for a boy or subtract three
inches for a girl. The result is said to be correct within two
inches about 95 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, however, doctors would refer to standard growth
charts, Brown said. Your current height and age would give an
indication of where you fall relative to the average for children
of your age. Because people tend to stay in the same tenth of all
boys or girls of a given age, you can estimate your eventual
height.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays of the gaps, or epiphyses, between the ends of your bones
do not predict eventual height but could determine if there is a
condition that would prevent further growth. As you grow, the gaps
shrink. When you complete puberty, the bones are fused, and no more
growth takes place.

IN FORECASTING THEIR EMOTIONS, MOST PEOPLE FLUNK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa., N.J., Calif.)   (The Science Times)

<P>
   Everyone is a forecaster, says Daniel Gilbert, a psychologist at
Harvard University, trafficking not in the day-to-day weather, but
in individual emotional barometers.
</P>
<P>
   And in making decisions, any decisions, people rely on their
individual forecasts to determine how their choices will make them
feel in the future, and then use those forecasts to guide their
choices.
</P>
<P>
   But, like some weather forecasts, it appears those predictions
are often wrong, according to an array of data from a small but
growing field of psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a recent scientific paper in The Journal of
Personality and Social Psychology, Gilbert wrote: ``Imagine that
one morning your telephone rings and you find yourself talking to
the king of Sweden, who informs you in surprisingly good English
that you have been selected as this year's recipient of a Nobel
Prize. How would you feel and how long would you feel that way?''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he continued: ``Now imagine that the telephone call is
from your college president, who regrets to inform you (in
surprisingly good English) that the Board of Regents has dissolved
your department, revoked your appointment and stored your books in
little cardboard boxes in the hallway. How would you feel and how
long would you feel that way?''
</P>
<P>
   In the second instance, Gilbert wrote, ``Losing one's livelihood
has all the hallmarks of a major catastrophe, and most people would
expect this news to have an enduring negative impact on their
emotional lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``Such expectations are often important and often
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert studied more than 100 college professors before and
after they found out whether they had achieved tenure. He found
that the educators expected to be quite happy if chosen, and quite
unhappy if not. But those predictions were wrong. Those who got
tenure were happy, but not as happy as they themselves had
predicted. And those who were denied tenure did not become very
unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a long list of such experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery winners, for example, were interviewed several times
after they won big jackpots (averaging almost $500,000). While
people expected to feel considerably happier for a long time, the
winners, after a very brief euphoria, in fact found their level of
happiness settling quickly back to average.
</P>
<P>
   Students, asked whether they would be happier going to school in
California or in a colder climate, predicted they would be happier
in California, both because of the climate, and overall. In fact,
students were equally happy in different parts of the country,
despite the climate.
</P>
<P>
   And people who were tested for Huntington's disease or HIV
infection expected to be devastated if the news was bad, but most
often they were not; in fact, those who remained most anxious were
those who decided not to be tested or, in the case of testing for
Huntington's, were not to be told their test results.
</P>
<P>
   People are aware that they are bad at some predictions. George
Loewenstein of the Center for the Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences at Carnegie Mellon University offered some well-known
examples of the results of poor forecasting: ``Besides marrying too
young, there is shopping for groceries on an empty stomach;
professions of love during moments of lust; believing you can `eat
just one chip.'''
</P>
<P>
   There is a pattern to the way people get predictions wrong, and
understanding the pattern may be useful, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   For example, people are most often right when they describe what
makes them feel good or bad, but are often wrong when asked to
predict how strongly they will feel that way, and how long the
feeling will last.
</P>
<P>
   The problem comes with the nature of feelings, caused by strong
chemical events in the brain that occur after an experience. The
feeling itself quickly dies, as the mind shifts attention and the
surge of chemicals subsides. When the event is recalled later, the
rush of the feeling recurs, but to a lesser degree.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert points out that this is not just the gradual lessening
of vividness, but that the mind has a number of active processes
that alter the memory and blunt the feeling on purpose. Beginning
almost immediately, we obscure the irritating or humiliating in the
same way an oyster covers a grain of sand with a layer of smooth
pearl.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that even severe life events have a negative
impact on people's sense of well-being and satisfaction for no more
than three months, after which their feelings at least go back to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people are reasonably happy most of the time, and most
events do little to change that for long,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   He quotes Sir Thomas Browne, a 17th-century writer, who said:
``I am the happiest man alive. I have that in me that can convert
poverty into riches, adversity into prosperity, and I am more
invulnerable than Achilles; fortune hath not one place to hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert said that whatever that thing was that Browne claimed to
have, ``most ordinary people seem to have it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In science, literature and folklore,'' Gilbert said, ``people
are famous for making the best of bad situations, remembering their
successes and overlooking their excesses, trumpeting their triumphs
and excusing their mistakes. Psychologists from Freud to Festinger
have described the artful methods by which the human mind ignores,
augments, transforms and rearranges information in its unending
battle'' against the bad feelings produced by the world and things
in it.
</P>
<P>
   One primary reason people do not get predictions right about
their own future feelings and tastes is that people forget these
powers, this ``immune system'' that blunts bad feeling and helps
them adjust.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments, the researchers found that when people tried to
predict future feelings, they most often failed to take into
account their capacity to discount bad events. But as soon as the
bad events occurred, they made full use of those powers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In one example, students were given personality ratings by two
methods _ a rating by computerized test and a rating by a panel of
qualified and experienced psychologists. They said they expected
that they would feel equally bad if given the lowest rating by
either method. But when the scores came in, within seconds, those
given the lowest rating by computer felt better and commented on
the unreliability of the computer method.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kahneman of Princeton University said that different
areas of scholarship, and economics in particular, built their
descriptions of behavior on the assumptions that people were both
rational in making choices and were able to predict how they would
feel in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious import of the new research came when people
were asked to predict their future states and to make decisions
based on those predictions _ in giving informed consent to become
part of medical experiments, or in signing directives about what
medical treatment they might want near death.
</P>

   Peter Ditto, a psychologist at the University of California at
Irvine who has studied the matter, pointed out that people changed
their minds about these issues. In his studies, he said, ``Even
people who say they `definitely want' or `definitely don't want'
treatment often change their wishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also noted that in trying to devise treatment
for criminals, research of the past made the mistake of assuming
that criminals' choices to commit crimes were rational. In fact,
Loewenstein reported, a large part of criminal decision-making was
emotional and criminals were unable to predict that effectively
ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   When ordinary students were asked how likely they were to commit
certain sexual acts, their predictions changed radically if they
were sexually aroused prior to having the questions asked. Their
own sexual aggressiveness changed and when sexually aroused the
students ``were more likely to imagine that they would behave in a
sexually forceful manner on a date.'' What is more, the students
did not expect this difference to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Kahneman of Princeton pointed out that new findings across the
field challenged the economic theories on which government and
commercial policies were made. If people do not really predict what
is good even for themselves, then it becomes important to measure
the consequences of social and political decisions, to measure how
much a policy improves citizens' well-being.
</P>
<P>
   He first wrote about the utility of doubting one's own
predictive powers about eight years ago, he said, after having
learned what he called the ``squeaking door'' lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, my wife and I moved, and we quarreled about
bedroom curtains,'' Kahneman said in a telephone interview. She had
curtains that he thought were ``truly dreadful.'' (They were brown
with vertical stripes.)
</P>
<P>
   The fight escalated as each became more entrenched, until
finally it became a question of who would yield and why. He knew he
did not like the curtains, but he asked himself if he would always
feel that way. ``Would they remain forever like a squeaking door
that you never get used to?'' he said. ``I decided that if I would
always dislike them, I shouldn't yield. But if I could get used to
them, I should probably yield.''
</P>
<P>
   He did yield, and discovered later that not only had he become
used to the curtains, but he had actually come to like them. They
had the opposite experience buying a house, he said, when they had
to decide whether to pay much more for a water view. If they got
used to it and ended up paying little attention, it was not worth
the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never gotten used to it,'' he said. ``The pleasure we
get from the view is unending. It was worth it.''

 &HT;    Periodicals on the newstand this week
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a cover story on Bill Clinton's successful dodging of the
impeachment bullet, Newsweek ($3.50) sets the stage with this blunt
summation: ``Born with brute stamina and lacking the gene that
produces embarassment in the human soul, Clinton had once again
outlasted his enemies.'' Newsweek also offers excerpts from
Lawrence Schiller's 621-page investigation into the JonBenet Ramsey
murder, ``Perfect Murder _ Perfect Town.'' Though Schiller doesn't
reach a strong conclusion, he implicates the family, saying that
only someone familiar with the house could have been responsible.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Writer's block: Joseph Mitchell turned in his last story for
the New Yorker ($3.95), a piece called ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' in
1964. Though he kept showing up for work, Mitchell didn't publish
another article between then and his death in 1996. Mitchell's
32-year dry spell became something of a legend at the magazine (he
was caricatured in Jay McInerny's ``Bright Lights, Big City'') but
writer Mark Singer insists in the current issue of the New Yorker
that it was the excellence of his pre-1964 writing that really made
Mitchell heroic, and an equal of such colleagues as A.J. Liebling.
Singer revisits the ghostly Mitchell, as actor and director Stanley
Tucci plans a new movie based on Mitchell's last story.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Loser: In his novel ``Bob the Gambler,'' Mississippi novelist
Frederick Barthelme wrote convincingly of an average Joe who stakes
his life on a turn of the cards and loses. Now Barthelme and his
brother Steve are charged with conspiring with a blackjack dealer
to rig games at a Mississippi casino. People ($2.99) updates this
instance of life imitating art. Attorney Boyce Holleman notes that
in 1996 the Barthelmes lost more than $150,000, and that if they
were cheating, they weren't very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't blink: Dossier ($3.95) reports on 29 junior
movers-and-shakers in Atlanta business and the arts, blurbing a
``new breed'' of record producers, club owners, PR entrepreneurs
and internet mini-moguls to watch. ``Soon-to-be supermodel'' Kate
Thompson shares the cover with consultant Marc Adler and gallery
owner Pui Panich.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More people to watch: There's no cross-over between Dossier's
list and a (shorter) list of 20 ``intriguing'' people from Atlanta
($3.50). ``Intriguing,'' we suppose, is a term that lets Patsy
Ramsey (mother of the murdered JonBenet) into the list. Atlanta
also profiles humorist Lewis Grizzard, and demonstrates that the
former Atlanta Constitution sportswriter and columnist can still
raise hackles and generate chuckles five years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The green blazer: Created in 1931 by golfer Bobby Jones and
Wall Street stockbroker Clifford Roberts, the Augusta National golf
club has become sacred ground, but at the beginning of the
Depression, its success was hardly assured. When the first Masters
was held in 1934, the club couldn't afford to pay any of the
winners until a handful of members chipped in for the $5,000 purse.
In Vanity Fair ($3.95), David Owen tells of the parlous economic
climate that forced the owners to try raising cattle and turkeys on
the fairways to help generate income, and of the fortuitous
partnership of Jones and Roberts that brought the Augusta National
into existence. The story is excerpted from ``The Making of the
Masters: Clifford Roberts, August National and Golf's Most
Prestigious Tournament'' by David Owen.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bottled passion: Though it wasn't a heartfelt paean to a dead
love, Amanda Poor, a 13-year-old from Ipswich, Mass., sent out a
real-life message in a bottle in 1996, essentially saying ``Hi!''
Life ($3.99) reports that Amanda was answered years later by a boy
from the Azores, a string of islands near Portugal, 2,286 miles
from Ipswich. If you want to visit the real beach house used in
Kevin Costner's movie ``Message in a Bottle,'' check out Coastal
Living ($3.95) for a pictorial on the Bath, Maine beach house
renovated for the film.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't call her Mrs. Babyface: Tracey Edmonds, president and
CEO of the $5 million Edmonds Entertainment Group, has a hand in
the music, management and movie businesses, and also happens to be
married to Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds, co-creator of LaFace
Records. Essence ($2.75) features the 32-year-old exec who met her
future husband when she auditioned for a part in his video, ``Whip
Appeal.''

 &HT;    Herrera's new line is all about brown
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The question style-conscious women will be asking
when it's time to update their fall/winter wardrobes is ``How
now?''
</P>
<P>
   And the answer, from Carolina Herrera's standpoint, is ``Brown
cow.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown leather jackets, pants, blouses, skirts and gloves served
as the catalysts for the cold weather collection Herrera unveiled
Monday under the Tent at Bryant Park. Herrera's supple, shiny,
form-fitting leather pieces were rendered in mouthwatering shades
of butterscotch, chocolate and (eggplanty) auburgine.
</P>
<P>
   Since brown's already been noted as a dominant factor in the
collections showing this week, Herrera's brown-out came as no
surprise. What did raise eyebrows along the runway, however, was
how bold and clever she was to insist that, yes, brown and pale
blue or pink or red or magenta can go together.
</P>
<P>
   As always, Herrera's designs were for the mature woman blessed
with a youthful spirit. Her collection looked ladylike and fun to
wear and included her signature A-line silhouettes.
</P>
<P>
   Jackets were cut close to the torso and stopped just below the
hip or fell all the way to the ankles. Most tops (pullovers in
leather, silk, mink and woolens) featured cowl or ``portrait''
necklines and were short-sleeved or sleeveless to emphasize the
elbow-length gloves. Both the skirts and the pants rode low on the
hips, with zippers hidden discreetly on the sides or in back. The
skirts were hemmed below the knee, and the pants flared from the
knee down.
</P>
<P>
   Besides leather, Herrera's collection was rooted in other such
luxury fabrics as double-faced cashmere, mink, moire silk and
mohair. For evening, she showed halter top-feathered skirt
combinations and color-blocked satin gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera's collection was free of that premillennial mind-set
that so many other designers are fostering. She exudes an
infectious ``Let them eat cake'' attitude. Clothiers at every price
level would do well to latch on to Herrera's leather look and milk
it for all it's worth.
</P>

   Coming Wednesday: Nicole Miller, Mark Eisen and Badgley Mischka.

 &HT;    `Niggardly' describes something `stingy' can't
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On National Public Radio's ``Morning Edition''
recently a free-lance writer named Cecilie Berry offered her two
cents' worth in the flap over a bureaucrat shamed by his
vocabulary. I didn't hear it, but a friend insisted that I call for
a transcript. It was more proof, she said with amusement, that
Americans are committed to the lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I wouldn't know Cecilie Berry from Chuck Berry, only that
``Morning Edition'' host Bob Edwards identified her as ``a
free-lance writer who lives in Montclair, N.J.'' As tag lines go,
that doesn't bring much heft to the table. But then, no one knew
who the unfortunate David Howard was either.
</P>
<P>
   Howard, you'll recall, was the aide to Washington Mayor Anthony
Williams, who injudiciously spoke of having to be ``niggardly''
with the district's budget. The word had no sooner left his lips,
hitting the streets not with a clunk but a tremendous clatter, than
he was on the apology stand. You'd have thought the man, in the
midst of a talk about a budget, had uttered the N-word.
</P>
<P>
   How that would fit into the context of revenue projections ought
have seemed puzzling, but no one pondered it for long. It sounded
close enough, and within 24 hours Howard had dutifully resigned. He
offered his head because other people had nothing in theirs.
</P>
<P>
   It's beside the point that the mayor accepted the resignation
and then changed his mind after someone provided him the benefit of
a dictionary. Howard was acquitted on the first count _ racism _
but not on the second. If he had not used the N-word, he
unquestionably had used a big word, and damn him for it.
</P>
<P>
   As Cecilie Berry told ``Morning Edition's'' audience, ``I would
not have chastised Howard for racism, but I would have accused him
of grandiloquence, pedantry and being a pain in the butt, not a
crime against humanity, surely, but the more common misdemeanor of
putting on airs.''
</P>
<P>
   Why don't we add to that charge the more serious one of being an
``elitist''? Then we can put the man in stocks and display him on
Dupont Circle for all to see, an example of what happens when you
risk rising above the lowest common denominator.
</P>
<P>
   We're not going to allow it in this society. On one level, we
embrace vulgarity everywhere (remember when the Braves went to the
National League playoffs against the Dodgers and vendors were
hawking T-shirts that said ``LA Sucks''?). On another, we nod
solemn assent at the pretentious and pseudoscientific
(``paradigm,'' ``parameters.'')
</P>
<P>
   We even let the sportswriters limber up their tired
vocabularies. It's not enough that an athlete has torn a ligament.
They let us know if it is, perchance, the anterior cruciate
ligament.
</P>
<P>
   But a hapless budget official uses a legitimate word that
predates Chaucer and we're all over him. Bailiff Berry, trying hard
to be charming, told of her own teenage fling with big words and of
what a snob she used to be. In her case, she never quite learned
what they meant. Somewhere she came upon ``hoi polloi,'' and ``for
months anything that wasn't interesting to me was strictly for the
hoi polloi.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be pedantic or a pain in Berry's backside, but if she
knew what it meant she'd have known that ``hoi'' was Greek for
``the.'' So it was redundant, and a bit ignorant, to speak of ``the
hoi polloi.''
</P>
<P>
   With any word, the question is not its size but its rightness.
Does it express our meaning precisely, and how does it play upon
the ear? Does it have zip or force? (Does it have euphony? There's
another two-bit word Berry can add to her collection.)
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, ``niggardly'' is closer to what Howard meant than
``stingy'' or ``miserly,'' alternatives Berry would have preferred.
Even among synonyms there are shadings of difference. The American
Heritage Dictionary tells us that ``stingy'' implies ``an
inclination toward meanness of spirit,'' and ``miserly'' a greedy
``hoarding of wealth for its own sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard meant something else, and in his mind the word for it was
``niggardly.'' If it was unfamiliar to some, well, let them learn
something. They need to. It was not a pretentious word, but
neither, perhaps, was it the most precise word. As a synonym for
stinginess, it implies a grudging pettiness in spending.
</P>
<P>
   What Howard meant was frugality in the extreme, and there is a
word for that, too. The word is parsimonious. But in the
know-nothing culture that would be showing off, and the Cecilie
Berrys would be giving us their two pennies' worth. Pinch 'em,
Cecilie, and you'll know what it means.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I last went skiing in 1985, when I took a two-week break from
researching my first book and rented a chalet in the Swiss Alps. I
could afford it because the dollar was strong. Bottles of Dom
Perignon cost $18, which is why I cannot honestly say I remember
the skiing.
</P>
<P>
   But I do recall using two skis, one on each foot. Since then,
snowboarding has come into vogue, a sport that not only
exhilarates, but also reveals the wisdom of buying stock in a
trauma center near a ski resort.
</P>
<P>
   Because snowboarding looked like fun _ and because I have no
dependents _ I decided to try it. I was given plenty of cautionary
advice, most of it along the lines of ``get used to falling down,''
and suggestions on how best to limit my first-day injuries.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Big Bear Mountain Resort, a three-hour drive east of
Los Angeles at an elevation of about 7,000 feet, and hired a
private instructor for three hours at $60 an hour and rented boots
and a board for $30. The lift ticket cost another $30.
</P>
<P>
   I wore long underwear and flannel-lined blue jeans under ski
pants, for padding as well as warmth. Special snowboarding pants
are a good idea, though, because they are both insulated and
padded, and will take the pounding, which traditional ski pants may
not. I also wore wrist braces and the kind of braces rollerbladers
wear to prevent broken bones.
</P>
<P>
   My instructor, a jovial ex-Angelino named Eric Floyd,
acknowledged that the braces were a good idea. Eric was wearing a
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   When you rent the equipment, or buy it, you will be asked
whether you are ``regular'' or ``goofy foot,'' which is snowboard
lingo for how you stand on the board. The snowboard position is
akin to that of surfing or skateboarding: Your feet are shoulder
width apart; your lead foot points slightly forward, while your
rear foot is perpendicular to the board. ``Regular'' means your
left foot is in front, and ``goofy foot'' means your right foot
leads. Your weight goes over your leading leg, and your knees are
slightly bent.
</P>
<P>
   An instructor, I learned, will give you encouragement, but keep
you from attempting the impossible. Eric started me off with a
lecture on the value of positive thinking and self-realization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think you'll fall,'' he said, ``you will.''
</P>
<P>
   I ignored this because I live in Southern California, where
lectures on self-realization are only slightly less ubiquitous than
cosmetic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on flat ground, where I fell only occasionally, we
moved one small step at a time. Eric showed me the correct stance,
then had me lock my front foot into the binding, keeping my rear
foot free. I practiced sliding the board back and forth on the
snow, then pushing it like a skateboard, which is the way one gets
around when not going downhill. Eric had me slide with my back foot
on the board, but not locked in, then with the foot locked in, and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   When I was comfortable, we went to the bunny slope, a three- or
four-degree incline, which seemed plenty steep once I got going.
Eric told me to ski down the slope without attempting to turn, and
after a couple of times I was able to cover 30 yards or so before
falling.
</P>
<P>
   After learning how to go forward, you learn how to brake or
turn. The latter is accomplished by turning your body slightly and
leaning in the direction you want to go. Theoretically, this will
bring the board up on its edge, which is what makes it turn. A left
turn, for example, is made by leaning back on your heels and onto
the heel edge of the board. The right turn is made by leaning
forward on your toes and the toe edge of the board. As in ice
skating and conventional skiing, braking is accomplished by turning
abruptly and letting your edge bring you to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   Both turning and braking require finding the balance point _
that point at which you are just balanced on the edge rather than
continuing blissfully ahead, or, of course, falling. If you go
beyond your balance point, you will ``catch an edge,'' and the
snowboard pivots upward and vigorously slams you face down or rear
first into the snow.
</P>
<P>
   Snowboarding, regrettably, has no equivalent of conventional
skiing's snow plow. Until you find your balance point and learn to
turn and brake correctly _ which is what takes three days unless
you are blessed with freakish physical coordination _ you will
spend the intervening time being repeatedly body slammed. Large
doses of Advil and a bath of Epsom salts helped me return to
partial functioning within a week.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, I graduated _ unwillingly but at Eric's
insistence _ from the bunny slope to the beginner slope. This
required taking a chairlift, which is wonderfully relaxing once you
master getting on and getting off without falling. From the vantage
of the chairlift, beginner snow board slopes look like alpine
battlefields: bodies scattered everywhere, some of them moving
slowly, and some motionless, the latter, I would learn, being
content to remain prostrate while their pain subsided.
</P>
<P>
   On the beginner slope, my first few runs proceeded roughly like
this: ski for 10 yards, and try to turn. Fall. Get up. Fall. Rest.
Try to get up. Fall. Ski for 10 yards, and try to turn. Fall. Ski
straight, gather speed, panic, and fall.
</P>
<P>
   By my fourth or fifth run, I started to get the hang of it,
finally implementing the secret of snow-boarding success: leaning
my rear knee into my front knee. This kept my weight over my front
leg, where it needed to be. I still could not turn, but was able to
go downhill for 100 breath-taking yards at a clip until an imminent
collision with another skier _ or the lift line, or a tree _
brought the run to an abrupt end.
</P>
<P>
   Falling is a surprisingly efficient method of braking, although
not necessarily the best. And then, much to my surprise, positive
thinking made a difference. When I talked myself into relaxing and
assumed I could snowboard without falling, I could. Learning to
relax is crucial to success.
</P>
<P>
   The truly frightening aspect of snowboarding _ more than the
constant pain _ is its addictive nature. After five or six runs, I
was hooked and having fun. When I made it down the hill, I was
eager to get back on the lift and try again. I stopped only because
I had to get back to Los Angeles before rush hour, snow was falling
heavily, and, as far as I could tell, my knee and ankle ligaments
were still connected. I was quitting while ahead, but planning to
return in two weeks _ provided I regained sensation in my left arm
by then.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Ski Areas Association, only six
resorts in the United States do not accommodate snowboarders. For
specifics, check the organization's Web site at www.snowblast.com.

   &UR; A PLAN TO MOVE THE NEW YEAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One very inconvenient problem about New Year's 2000 is that New
Year's Eve falls on a Friday night, and New Year's Day, a holiday,
falls on Saturday. So how will anyone know, or begin to deal with,
all the business problems likely to arise when computers
malfunction and all sorts of services are interrupted?
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of this dilemma, Representatives  &UR; John Linder &LR; , R-Ga.,
and  &UR; David Dreier &LR; , R-San Dimas, have introduced House Joint
Resolution 14: ``In order to provide the public and technology
professionals with an additional day, prior to the start of the
workweek, to begin repairs on failed computer systems ... the New
Year's Day holiday ..shall be deemed to occur on January 3, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, when to wear one's party hat will be the subject of
future legislation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRITICS DECRY KAZAN OSCAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc Committee Against Silence is hoping that hundreds of
protesters will show up at the Oscars on March 21 to demonstrate
against director &UR; Elia Kazan &LR; 's lifetime achievement Oscar. Kazan,
89, has been a Hollywood pariah since the '50s, when he named names
to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Kazan, who took out
ads in Variety and the New York Times urging others to name names,
too, is considered responsible for many studios' blacklists.
</P>
<P>
   Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president  &UR; Karl &LR; 
 &UR; Malden &LR;  nominated Kazan for the award, saying, ``There's no place
for politics in any art form.'' Among those who share his views &LR; 
are  &UR; Charlton Heston &LR;  and  &UR; Nora Ephron &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But other members of the Hollywood community are less forgiving.
 &UR; Rod Steiger &LR; , who found out about Kazan's naming names just as

   &UR; A PLAN TO MOVE THE NEW YEAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One very inconvenient problem about New Year's 2000 is that New
Year's Eve falls on a Friday night, and New Year's Day, a holiday,
falls on Saturday. So how will anyone know, or begin to deal with,
all the business problems likely to arise when computers
malfunction and all sorts of services are interrupted?
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of this dilemma, Representatives  &UR; John Linder &LR; , R-Ga.,
and  &UR; David Dreier &LR; , R-San Dimas, have introduced House Joint
Resolution 14: ``In order to provide the public and technology
professionals with an additional day, prior to the start of the
workweek, to begin repairs on failed computer systems ... the New
Year's Day holiday ..shall be deemed to occur on January 3, 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, when to wear one's party hat will be the subject of
future legislation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CRITICS DECRY KAZAN OSCAR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc Committee Against Silence is hoping that hundreds of
protesters will show up at the Oscars on March 21 to demonstrate
against director &UR; Elia Kazan &LR; 's lifetime achievement Oscar. Kazan,
89, has been a Hollywood pariah since the '50s, when he named names
to the House Un-American Activities Committee. Kazan, who took out
ads in Variety and the New York Times urging others to name names,
too, is considered responsible for many studios' blacklists.
</P>
<P>
   Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president  &UR; Karl &LR; 
 &UR; Malden &LR;  nominated Kazan for the award, saying, ``There's no place
for politics in any art form.'' Among those who share his views &LR; 
are  &UR; Charlton Heston &LR;  and  &UR; Nora Ephron &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But other members of the Hollywood community are less forgiving.
 &UR; Rod Steiger &LR; , who found out about Kazan's naming names just as
``On the Waterfront'' finished shooting, said, ``It was like I
found my father was sleeping with my sister. The passing of time
can do nothing to ease the pain of those who suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Director  &UR; Stanley Donen &LR; , who won last year's lifetime
achievement award, told the New York Post that Kazan deserves
applause for ``some wonderful pictures. ... But his activities, as
a person, were deplorable. That just comes down to who he is, and

CLINTON SAYS FIRST LADY WOULD MAKE A `TERRIFIC' N.Y. SENATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton, publicly commenting for the
first time about the possibility that his wife might seek the
Senate seat from New York in 2000, said Monday: ``I think she would
be terrific in the Senate but that's a decision that she'll have to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is considering whether to seek
the seat that will open up with the retirement of Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, according to White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added: ``I will support whatever decision she makes,
enthusiastically.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that Mrs. Clinton has not had ``anything like
adequate time'' to talk with Democrats in New York, adding: ``I
don't think it had ever occurred to her before a lot of people
started calling and asking her to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, asked about Mrs.
Clinton's possible Senate bid, replied: ``I think Mrs. Clinton is a
fantastic human being and anybody who knows her knows that she
would be a great public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Moynihan said New York could use some of Mrs.
Clinton's ``magnificent, young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She'd be welcome and she'd win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About all Mrs. Clinton has said about running for the Senate in
2000 is that she hasn't had time to think about it _ and she said
that through a spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters during his summit meeting here with
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, Clinton replied to question
about his wife's possible political career and said: ``It's her
decision to make. I will support whatever decision she makes
enthusiastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of other opportunities for public service that
will be out there. She and I both would like to continue to be
useful in public affairs when we leave office. But it's a decision
she'll have to make. She'd be great if she did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is expected to visit New York City in early March
for a women's leadership forum and her comments will be watched
closely for any clue about her intentions.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is a possible Republican
candidate for the Moynihan seat.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, the temperature fell to a record minimum of
25 degrees at Myrtle Beach, S.C., as clear skies and light winds
promoted unusually chilly conditions over the Southeast. Another
cool start will occur across the region Tuesday, though abundant
sunshine will cause temperatures to rapidly rebound into the 60s
and lower 70s by midafternoon. Ample sunshine will also cover the
Middle Atlantic states and Northeast, with slightly above normal
temperatures expected.
</P>
<P>
   Areas of snow will accompany low pressure crossing the upper
Middle West Tuesday. Several inches of snow are possible from
northern Minnesota to the northern peninsula of Michigan where air
moistening in transit over Lake Superior could enhance snowfall
accumulations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers will occur farther south as a cold front
attendant to the low lifts humid air positioned over the Ohio and
Tennessee Valleys. Isolated thunderstorms may erupt later Tuesday
afternoon as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain will batter much of northern California Tuesday as a
steady stream of moist air arrives from the Pacific Ocean. As the
damp air is lifted and cooled by the interior mountains, very heavy
snow will blanket the Sierras above 6,000 feet where total snowfall
may exceed 40 inches by Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, scattered showers and mountain snow will affect
western Washington and Oregon. Wet weather will spread into the
interior West later Tuesday, reaching western Montana and Wyoming
by late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: European Blizzard
</P>
<P>
   Heavy snow and frigid winds have battered eastern Europe over
the past several days. Protracted and extreme wintry weather has
been a consequence of a low pressure system at high altitudes that
stalled over Hungary, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Ukraine, Poland
and other neighboring countries. The cold upper-level storm has
become separated from the steering winds of the jet stream,
accounting for its lethargy. Moreover, a sprawling high pressure
system centered over Siberia's Arctic coast continues to block the
path of the upper-level low, allowing wintry weather to persist.

U.S. AND MEXICO MAP CLOSER COOPERATION TO COMBAT DRUG TRAFFICKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton and Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo tried to ease nagging U.S.-Mexican irritations Monday with
an agreement setting benchmarks to measure the nations' campaigns
against narcotics trafficking and consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, wrapping up a 23-hour summit in this one-time center of
Mayan civilization, headed back to Washington late Monday vowing to
work with the Republican Congress in the aftermath of the
impeachment struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he was heartened that four Republican members
of Congress had joined 20 Democrats to take part in meetings here
with members of the Mexican parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a time for reconciliation and renewal,''
Clinton said during a photo session. ``I think what we have to do
is to serve the American people. And if we keep that in mind, I
think everything will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-Mexico accord on drug cooperation set a yardstick to
enable the two countries to measure progress and identify areas
that need further effort.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the 16 measures will enable the two
countries to ``ensure a greater degree of accountability and
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said winning the drug war ``won't
happen overnight,'' but added that Mexico and the United States can
do it over time.
</P>
<P>
   Some 70 percent of the illegal narcotics in the United States _
mostly cocaine, heroine and marijuana _ are either cultivated in
Mexico or transit across Mexico to reach the United States where
Americans consume an estimated $57 billion worth of illegal drugs
each year.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmarks incorporated the priorities of both countries.
The United States won Mexico's agreement to accept specific
yardsticks for eradication, extradition of drug traffickers, asset
forfeiture, money laundering, control of precursor chemicals and
efforts to stem corruption within law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico won U.S. agreement to yardsticks measuring progress in
efforts to stem consumption, boost interdiction, train Mexican
agencies and provide technical assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The 91-page accord stipulates actions, a baseline, a target and
measurement criteria.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement comes two weeks before the Clinton
administration's expected decision to certify to Congress that
Mexico is cooperating with joint counternarcotics efforts. Congress
requires annual certification by the administration. Mexico has
never failed to achieve that status under three American presidents
over 12 years, despite congressional criticism that Mexico should
be doing much more.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's cooperation has ``clearly improved'' under Zedillo's
leadership, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in remarks to Merida business leaders after signing the
agreements with Zedillo, noted the change in atmosphere from an era
when the nations' leaders could not even touch upon the subject
``without falling into an unwinnable argument about who is to
blame.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declared: ``That has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk candidly about this now because we have started to
talk the same language _ the language of parents who love their
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo told the same audience: Mexicans are ``convinced and
determined to keep up the fight against drugs until we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo declared ``total war'' against narcotics on Feb. 4 with
a $400 million blueprint to purchase ships, aircraft, radar, X-ray
equipment and other equipment to help combat narcotics production
and trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican authorities often express resentment at the annual U.S.
review of Mexico's anti-drug campaign, criticizing the effort as an
infringement on Mexican sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Zedillo also announced agreements designed to
protect crossborder undercover operations by law enforcement
agencies and to stem law enforcement violence against Mexicans
trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border without documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said U.S. border protection must be enforced ``with
justice, fairness and sensitivity.''

   CAMBODIA-GENOCIDE _ PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ Sitting on a

rice in a basket and talked about what she wants to happen to the
Khmer Rouge leaders who brutalized her country. Twenty years after
the Khmer Rouge fell from power, a day of judging them approaches.
But Lin hopes it will put her anger to rest. A United Nations team
of three legal experts is scheduled this month to recommend to
Secretary General Kofi Annan whether to start action against the
remaining Khmer Rouge leaders living openly in Cambodia. Some form
of international tribunal likely will be proposed to hear evidence
against the men who masterminded the madness that left as many as
two million Cambodians dead in less than four years, from 1975 to
1979.

   That upright posture so dear to mothers and governesses may
contribute to women's high rate of injuries to the anterior
cruciate ligaments (ACLs) that crisscross the knee and help keep it
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Three-dimensional motion analysis of 20 recreational athletes
found that women run and perform some other athletic movements in a
much less crouched position than men, causing the quadricep muscles
in the fronts of the thighs to generate a great deal of power. In
an awkward movement, like landing on uneven ground, the highly
activated quadriceps have enough force to pull the tibia, or shin
bone, forward and tear the ACL, said Dr. William Garrett Jr.,
chairman of the department of orthopedic surgery at the University
of North Carolina School of Medicine and an author of a study
presented recently to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   In pivoting movements, videotaped for the study, women crouched
less than men at the moment of impact with the ground. Similar
differences were found for forward and sideways running, movements
that are common in soccer and basketball. At the college level, ACL
injuries are two to three times more common among women than men in
soccer and three to four times more common in basketball, according
to the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are studying the biomechanics that explain why women
crouch less, said Dr. Letha Griffin, a team physician for Georgia
State University. ``Possibly it feels more natural because women
have a lower center or gravity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett said women can be retrained to bend more and thus
protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Torn ACLs are often repaired by grafting tendons from elsewhere
in the body. ``The graft acts like a scaffold on which new
connective tissue grows,'' Dr. Griffin said.

   PRO &AMP; CON: Debating the Pap Smears Intervals
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do all postmenopausal women need a cervical Pap smear every
year?
</P>
<P>
   _ ALISHA BERGER
</P>
<P>
   Telling all postmenopausal women that they do not need a Pap
smear every year could be a dangerous recommendation. One problem
is that a recommendation to decrease the frequency of Pap smears
has been construed as a recommendation to decrease the frequency of
visits to the doctor for routine examinations, including a pelvic
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Also, though the Pap smear is not perfect, it is the best cancer
detector available. Since its introduction, there has been about a
70 percent reduction in the mortality rate. Sixty-two percent of
women who die of cervical cancer in the United States either have
never had a Pap smear or have not had one in five years.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, in postmenopausal women, the site at which most of
the cervical cancers arise is usually where they cannot be readily
seen. If a woman has a history of sexually transmitted diseases,
multiple sex partners or smoking, she may need them more
frequently.
</P>
<P>
   _ DR. JONATHAN BEREK, professor and vice chairman, department of
obstetrics and gynecology, University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Postmenopausal women who have never been sexually active, have
never had abnormal yearly Pap smears or have had normal Pap smears
in the last three consecutive years are candidates to have Pap
smears less frequently. The practice, however, does not apply to
women who have not had regular screening in the past or those who
have had biopsy-confirmed high-grade precancerous changes.
</P>
<P>
   Cervical cancer and its precursors are strongly associated with
the sexual transmission of viral infections. In the absence of
sexual activity, heredity and other life habits are rarely, if
ever, associated with cervical cancer by themselves. The
development of cervical cancer can be traced through its
precancerous stages by regular Pap smear screening.
</P>
<P>
   If a woman has a normal cumulative Pap smear history prior to
menopause, her risk of acquiring new precancerous lesions is
probably sufficiently low to allow screening at longer intervals.

   AT RISK: A Deadly Game, and How to Kill It
</P>
<P>
   Car surfing is a dangerous game that participants play by
standing on moving vehicles and pretending to surf or by hooking
onto the backs of cars, trucks or buses while rollerblading,
skateboarding or sliding on ice. While not all that common, it can
be very deadly, according to a report in this month's issue of the
Annals of Emergency Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The report, written by doctors in the departments of emergency
medicine, trauma services and surgery education at Iowa Methodist
Medical Center in Des Moines, was prompted by a small but alarming
rise in car-surfing injuries. The doctors cited five cases treated
by emergency room doctors at the medical center in 1996 and 1997;
three were fatal.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no national statistics for car-surfing injuries,
a search of newspaper articles in the United States undertaken by
the researchers found a total of 29 cases since 1989, involving 20
young men and nine young women with 15 of the cases reported as
fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typically 14- to 20-year-olds who are at the greatest
risk of injury,'' said Dr. Timothy Peterson, medical director of
the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services with the Iowa Department
of Public Health and lead author of the report. ``They have just
gotten their licenses and along with their friends they're going to
go out there and have a good time even if it kills them. Sometimes
it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopping the dangerous car surfing involves education and
enforcement, Peterson said. ``In some states, car surfing is a
crime, and if a driver allows someone to stand on the car and that
person falls off, then the driver is held accountable,'' he said.

   PATTERNS: Sleepless Nights, Dangerous Mornings
</P>
<P>
   The usual penalty for a bad night's sleep is feeling tired and
irritable, but Italian researchers believe sleep deprivation may
also lead to heart attacks and strokes the next morning, according
to a recent article in the American Journal of Hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring 20 men and 16 women, all mild to moderate
hypertensive patients who had never been treated, Dr. Paola Lusardi
of the University of Pavia found blood pressures and heart rates
were higher on mornings after the patients were deprived of sleep
than when patients slept undisturbed from 11 p.m. to 7 a.m. All
were administrative workers at the university and nonsmokers with
no major sleep complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Data suggest that lack of sleep in hypertensive patients may
increase sympathetic nervous system activity during the night and
the following morning, leading to increased blood pressure and
heart rate. This effect might represent an increased risk for both
organ damage and acute cardiovascular diseases, Dr. Lusardi and her
colleagues reported.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians have noted that heart attacks and strokes occur more
frequently from early morning to noon, but this study suggests
there may be a medical penalty for sleepless nights, said Dr.
Michael Weber, president of the American Society of Hypertension.
</P>
<P>
   Among hypertensive patients, sleepless nights may be part of a
cycle of stress, but it is a cycle that can be broken, Weber said.
``One thing we can control is sleep,'' he said, suggesting that
patients discuss their sleep patterns with their physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Some people may require as little as four or five hours of sleep
a night instead of the eight-hours norm in the Italian study, but
anything under four hours would be considered sleep deprivation,
Weber said.

`DENIM DEFENSE' REIGNITES DEBATE ON ITALY'S RAPE LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ After 20 years of intense political and social debate,
Italy amended its antiquated rape laws three years ago, toughening
the punishment for sexual assault and reclassifying it from a moral
offense to a criminal felony. That long-awaited change was widely
viewed not just as a feminist victory, but a sign that Italian
society had overcome old biases and deeply entrenched cultural
taboos.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the ``denim defense,'' or what Italian lawmakers are
calling the ``jeans alibi'' _ a court ruling that suggested that a
woman cannot be raped if she is wearing jeans because, the ruling
contended, they are impossible to remove unless she helps. That
decision _ and the country's reaction to it _ has reopened an angry
debate about rape and about how judges view sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   A group of female lawmakers are on an open-ended ``jeans
strike.'' They say they will wear jeans to Parliament until the
decision is changed. In a kind of media deja vu, Italian
newspapers, television and radio talk shows are holding impassioned
discussions on a subject that many believed was resolved years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The issue moved into the public spotlight last week, when the
third division of the Supreme Court of Appeals in Rome released the
text of a November ruling that overturned a 34-month sentence for
rape in southern Italy. Among other things, the court stated that
``jeans cannot be removed easily and certainly it is impossible to
pull them off if the victim is fighting against her attacker with
all her force.''
</P>
<P>
   That was but one of several arguments that led the court to
order a new trial for the defendant. But the point about jeans set
off an explosive reaction. Alessandra Mussolini, a conservative
member of Parliament and the granddaughter of Benito Mussolini,
along with female lawmakers from other political parties, donned
jeans and held a protest inside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruling continues to dominate public discussion, and
mockery. In Rome and in Naples over the weekend, shop owners began
waggishly marketing ``anti-rape jeans'' as St. Valentine's Day
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   In the case on which the court ruled, an 18-year-old woman
brought an accusation of rape in 1992 against her 45-year-old
driving instructor in the small town of Muro Lucano, 60 miles from
Naples. She said that during a driving lesson, he drove her to an
isolated spot, forced her to get out, and raped her. He contended
that they had consensual sex in the car.
</P>
<P>
   He was tried and convicted of a lesser charge, indecent exposure
in a public place. She appealed, and he was convicted on all
charges. But the appeals court threw out that conviction and
ordered a new trial, which has yet to be scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mussolini helped draft the 1996 law that replaced ones
written in the fascist era in the 1930s, under her grandfather's
rule, which viewed rape as a ``crime of honor'' against the
victim's family. Among other things, under the old laws a defendant
could avoid punishment by aggreeing to marry the victim or proving
that she had many other sexual experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mussolini said she was ``outraged'' by the recent ruling.
``That decision seemed like it came from 50 years ago,'' she said.
``The judges obviously have no sensitivity to the psychology of
rape _ no understanding of how victims think or how real life
works.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Politicians of all parties and virtually all of Italy's
columnists and television commentators have echoed her indignation.
</P>
<P>
   Aldo Rizzo, who wrote the ruling and is one of the five judges
who made it, said he was shocked by the reaction, which he said
misunderstood the court's intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, saying that a woman can't be raped if she wears
jeans is stupid, it's ridiculous, it's cretinous,'' Rizzo said
angrily. ``That's not what our ruling meant _ we merely found that
the appeals court had not provided sufficient evidence to uphold
the sentence. There were holes in their argument and it was our
duty to point out the inconsistencies.''
</P>
<P>
   One inconsistency the judges noted was the fact that the
afternoon of the rape, the victim returned to the driving school
for a driving theory lesson. But there were other arguments raised
by the court that proved just as inflammatory as the jeans.
</P>
<P>
   The court said, ``It should be noted that it is instinctive,
especially for a young woman, to oppose with all her strength the
person who wants to rape her. And it is illogical to say that a
young woman would passively submit to a rape, which is a grave
violence, for fear of undergoing other hypothetical and no more
serious offenses to her physical safety.''
</P>
<P>
   That reasoning, which infuriated most Italians, did not surprise
Simonetta Sotjiu. She is one of ten female judges who serve on the
supreme court, which is dominated by its 410 male judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is solidly in the hands of men,'' she told the
newspaper La Repubblica. ``Many of them think in a way that is
completely detached from reality.''

   BRYAN, Texas _ This is the story of Mark O'Connor, a Texas
environmental activist whose little-known crusade against a company
for arsenic contamination in Bryan-College Station mirrors the
high-profile story of Jan Schlichtmann, played by John Travolta in
the current hit movie ``A Civil Action.'' O'Connor's story, though,
is the tale of a brilliant but deeply disillusioned man who spent
much of his adult life wasting his talent, drowning himself in
alcohol and drugs. His whistle-blowing work paved the road to his

SURVIVING FIRES, CRASHES AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are art end of review)  
 (af)  
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For viewers who don't have enough to worry about, ``Nova''
delivers a heavy dose of disaster Tuesday night and Wednesday, four
hours' worth of mankind's propensity for perishing in fires, car
accidents, plane crashes and ship sinkings.
</P>
<P>
   Documented by dire descriptions of the consequences of bad luck
and bad judgment, ``Escape! Because Accidents Happen'' is leavened
by attention to counterattacks against menaces down the decades.
</P>
<P>
   The cautionary mini-series begins Tuesday night with fire,
citing such famous examples as the one that destroyed three-fifths
of metropolitan London in 1666; the fire in that city at the Kings
Cross station, which killed 31 people in 1987; the 1911 blaze at
the Triangle Shirtwaist factory in New York, in which 146 people
died, and the 1942 Cocoanut Grove nightclub fire in Boston, which
killed 492 merrymakers.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes of confusion and pain, suffocation and suffering
leave no doubt of fire's power to kill and kill fast: ``You either
burn to death alive inside of an inferno,'' a Triangle historian
says, ``or you make an effort to jump to safety out of the
window.'' But jumping out the garment-factory window meant a fall
of eight or nine stories.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hour is given to the lessons learned down through
the centuries and the techniques for fighting back, like water
pumps and hoses, computer systems for alarms, automatic sprinklers
and helmets that enable their wearers to see through the darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Having emerged unscathed from all that, you can look forward in
Tuesday night's second hour to car accidents, which we are reminded
have taken the lives of more Americans in the last century than all
the country's wars. The good news here includes safety glass, seat
belts and air cushions.
</P>
<P>
   But the real breakthrough awaits taking the human being,
responsible for 90 percent of traffic deaths, out of the driver's
seat. If substituting computers to create an automated highway
system smacks of Big Brother, well, take your choice.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night brings perils in the air and on the sea, with
the emphasis on getting out alive. But what with collisions on the
road and skyscraper blazes filling my anxiety quota, I must leave
it to the higher powers doing the driving up there and out there to
do further worrying for me. &QL;

 &HT;    Mardi Gras a perfect opportunity for Purple Knights, others to
shine
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Orleans _ In the city where music is second only to food in
the hearts of locals, playing in the band is so cool, kids grow up
dreaming of which instrument they will play. The coolest time to be
in a band is during the Mardi Gras parade season, which winds up
today, and no band gets more cheers of recognition and admiration
than the St. Augustine Purple Knights, better known as the ``St.
Aug Marching 100.''
</P>
<P>
   The boys from this private, mostly-black Catholic school don't
just walk the parade routes; they strut, their knees practically
knocking into their purple and gold lame chests. They swing their
elbows so high you'd think their arms were going to go clear behind
their heads like whirligigs. And they play so loud and so well,
even the tourists take notice and clap.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best in the land,'' said Keith Anthony Linyear as
he stood on St. Charles Avenue Friday night, watching his son stomp
by in his purple-plumed gladiator's helmet, blowing on a trumpet in
the Krewe D'Etat parade. ``They've got a lot of tradition, and the
others just don't match up.''
</P>
<P>
   Linyear's younger son, Lawrence, 11, looked very serious as St.
Aug went by. ``I want to be in St. Aug because they always get to
march first,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Augustine will be the first band to march when Rex, the king
of Carnival, rolls down St. Charles Avenue this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first black band to march with Rex, in 1967,''
said Edwin Hampton, who has been St. Augustine's band director for
46 of the school's 47 years. ``That was a complete break for us,
and we made history.''
</P>
<P>
   When they finish marching in Rex today, the Marching 100 will
have been in eight parades in the last two weeks, logging between
50 and 80 miles of high-stepping, horn-blowing, cymbal-tossing hard
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get huge blisters on your feet,'' said Ollie Stewart, a
ninth grader at St. Aug. The students, in grades 8 through 12,
train for weeks just to build up enough stamina to make it through
the season, Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the riders in the floats, who are high above the crowd
and tethered to posts to keep from falling, band members march,
sometimes for five or six hours, straight through millions of
drunken, lunging, grabbing people. The kids say they've had beer
and beads thrown down their tubas. The drum majors say women, some
bare-chested, hurl themselves at them as they lead the band.
Meanwhile, a central element of St. Augustine is discipline. The
boys are not allowed to talk or even look at revelers along the
parade route. They make guarding Buckingham Palace look easy.
</P>
<P>
   And they march rain or shine. This year, the weather has been
almost perfect, but last year they marched through deluges and in
high winds. On the longest parade, they did that for 12 miles.
</P>
<P>
   But Brett Harrington, a 10th grader and tuba player, says it's
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in it for the music, and the girls,'' he said while
getting ready for an afternoon practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth grader Christopher Gaines added: ``Watch, at 4 p.m., the
girls will show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, at 3:48 p.m., five girls from a nearby school
appeared at the edge of the parking lot where the Purple Knights
were marching back and forth and making so much noise that car
alarms in the neighborhood were going off. The girls smiled and
waved; one twirled batons to get attention. The St. Aug band has
been in three movies; they've played for six presidents and have
been in three Super Bowls, Hampton said.
</P>
<P>
   Percy Marchand, a senior and one of two St. Aug drum majors,
said kids here dream of being in the St. Aug band like kids
elsewhere dream of being quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you look forward to when you are a little
child,'' he said. ``You see them marching on Mardi Gras and you
say, `That's what I want someday.' ``

INTIMACY (Phoenix) - It's ironic that 30 years after the sexual
revolution in America, we know so much more about sex yet so little
about true intimacy. Why is that? And how do we get there from
here? Ralph Earle and Marilyn Murry of Psychological Counseling

issues. They and some of their patients offer perspective on why
we've got so far to go. By DOUG CARROLL. Story moved in the ``L''

 &QL; 
INTIMACY-SIDE (Phoenix) - For some people, the best way to grow a
relationship is to have clear sexual boundaries. They have made the
choice of celibacy. It's not especially easy for them, but they

walking, but it's nothing, really. Not when you've got thousands of
miles to go. And Dorris Haddock does. The New Hampshire resident is
walking across the country, from Pasadena, Calif., to Washington

`LA TRAVIATA' NEEDS TO TURN UP THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ No control-freak Hollywood director ever has been
more obsessively precise in picking a leading lady than Giuseppe
Verdi. And in the case of ``La Traviata,'' the composer's
behind-the-scenes plotting to get the tragic heroine of his dreams
was practically Hitchcockian.
</P>
<P>
   The lady in question, Verdi spelled out in frequent letters to
his sponsors, should be a first-rate prima donna with ``looks, soul
and a good stage presence.'' Not the toughest bill of goods, you'd
think, but Verdi apparently found a lady of the, ah, proper
proportions only in two or three top sopranos of his day.
</P>
<P>
   Southern California native Carol Vaness has all those qualities
in abundance and, as she displayed with last season's ``Il
Trovatore,'' the knack of finding a solid emotional core in the
most overripe of roles.
</P>
<P>
   Those credentials, on paper, make her a smart choice for L.A.
Opera's production of ``La Traviata,'' which arrived here Sunday by
way of the Washington Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here, Vaness registers as too wholesome and demure, too
angelic, too altogether respectable for the business of playing a
woman gone astray. The lukewarm chemistry between her and tenor
Greg Fedderly keeps the story's political and psychological demons
at bay so that, despite Marta Domingo's inspired direction and the
Valentine's Day opening performance, this is a strangely unromantic
production of Verdi's heart-thumping perennial.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more matronly and modest than seems fitting in an
unflattering black wig, Vaness brings a sweet-natured,
self-sacrificing nobility to Violetta Valery, Verdi's willful
Parisian ``courtesan'' whose ``decadent'' involvement with a naive
young boy-toy brings down the wrath of the holier-than-thous.
</P>
<P>
   Vaness communicates a kind of anguished purity, the inner
torment of a closet saint who's been damned to eternal sensuality.
She even gives Violetta's defiant declaration of ``Sempre libera''
(``Give me freedom'') a despairing tone, as if she were aware that
her upcoming life of hedonistic pleasure with Alfredo (Fedderly) is
going to cost her reputation and her life.
</P>
<P>
   What's absent from the lovers' duets, and from the orchestra
under Gabriele Ferro's bright conducting, is an undertow of fatal
attraction. Though Fedderly's youthful brashness is convincing,
when partnered with Vaness he seems more like a doting momma's boy
than a defiant suitor. Consequently, the story's dangerous
eroticism never bubbles to the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Structurally, of course, ``La Traviata'' is a triangle, and it's
left to another company regular, baritone Jorma Hynninen, to
provide an effective masculine counterpoint as Alfredo's sadly
reproving father Germont. Hynninen's beautifully delivered pleas to
the wayward lovers are by far the production's most stirring
moments.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo and designer Giovanni Agostinucci make their biggest
statement about 19th-century sexual hypocrisy _ and it's a doozy _
in their decision to turn Flora's mansion (where the fateful Act 2,
Scene 2 party takes place) into a red-satin-walled bordello. It's a
thoughtful wink at Verdi's inference that bourgeois marriage is
itself a licensed form of prostitution. But the conceit is slightly
undercut by the stagy foreplay on view in the second-floor salons.
</P>
<P>
   Domingo delivers a final psychological thrust when the dying
Violetta launches into her delirium, and we see the scythe of a
passing Grim Reaper outside with the carnival revelers _ a clever
effect in a production that, ultimately, is a good deal more
arousing visually than vocally. &QL;

 &HT;    Alltel workers vote to nix union involvement
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Workers have voted to cast off union representation
for employees at Alltel in Georgia, the second-largest phone
company in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, although not effective until confirmed by federal
officials, would sever the relationship between about 470 Alltel
employees and the Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The group, which includes a range of workers from customer
service representatives to technicians, voted 248 to 146 to end its
representation by the union, said John Comparin, Alltel vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Those workers have been working without a contract while CWA
negotiated with the Little Rock-based company. Once the union is
decertified, the company can break off those talks, said John
Comparin, Alltel vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The vote may serve as a caution for the unions that still
represent thousands of employees at Alltel, a $5 billion-a-year
company offering phone and wireless service in more than 14 states.
However, Camparin said the company had mounted no campaign to rid
itself of the union in Georgia. ``This was the employees' decision
and Alltel appreciates the confidence that employees have shown in
the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials were unavailable for comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Alltel has about 2,000 Georgia employees, including 1,200 in
metro Atlanta. Of the company's 14,000 employees, about 1,560 are
represented by either the Communications Workers of America or the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, according to
Alltel.

 &HT;    Shell makes the move to natural gas service
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In what could be a trendsetting move for the petroleum
industry, Shell Oil Co. is moving from the gas pump to the gas
meter, beginning in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Shell and the rest of the oil patch may be reeling from a
collapse in crude oil prices that has made a gallon of Coca-Cola
twice as expensive as a gallon of gasoline. But the U.S. operating
company for the Royal Dutch/Shell Group reports positive results
from marketing natural gas in Georgia after four months.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Raymond, president of Shell Energy Services, said the sales
model and infrastructure established for Georgia will be carried
over to other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could not afford to do this business just for the state of
Georgia,'' Raymond said. ``We see this as a national business. As
states restructure, we'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell last week was certified to market both natural gas and
electricity in Pennsylvania. Raymond added that New York, New
Jersey, Michigan, Ohio and Texas ``are all on our radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
   Shell is rolling out its Georgia marketing effort with limited
local on-the-ground presence.
</P>
<P>
   The nerve center is a suite of offices in downtown Houston, one
block from the pink granite corporate headquarters at One Shell
Plaza. The call center for natural gas sales and customer service
is at a Syracuse, N.Y., telemarketing company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's one full-time employee in Georgia, sales manager
Timothy Sheehan, works out an office in his northwest Atlanta home.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be in Atlanta, or the United States for that
matter,'' Raymond said. ``The more economically we can run the
business, the lower costs and savings there will be for
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Georgia's deregulation law, Atlanta Gas Light Co. will
continue to be responsible for delivering gas to homes and
businesses, reading meters and repairing leaks.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina-based SCANA Energy, the early market leader, and
Georgia Natural Gas Services, AGL's marketing affiliate, boast
strong local presences.
</P>
<P>
   But Raymond said Shell's assets include its brand recognition,
longtime experience with energy and attention to customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Shell's yellow pectin symbol is one of the world's best-known
logos, right up there with Coke and the Olympic rings. More than 12
million Americans fill up each year at Shell's 9,300 service
stations, including 350 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Shell Energy can also count on the parent company's huge natural
gas reserves, wholesale gas and electricity trading operation, and
interstate pipeline company.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Ram/Powell, Shell's $1 billion offshore oil and
natural gas platform 125 miles southeast of New Orleans in the Gulf
of Mexico, produces enough natural gas to meet the needs of AGL's
customers. Ram/Powell is just one of 11 deep-water offshore
platforms operated by Shell in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the more than 8 billion cubic feet of gas traded
daily by Shell's Coral Energy subsidiary, one of the top U.S.
wholesale gas trading operations. That's enough for 34 million
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Shell purchases supplies from its affiliates at market rates
with no discounts. But executives say the market gained from their
``seamless'' proximity to Coral Energy is invaluable. Shell Energy
's offices are next door to Coral's 24-hour-a-day energy
commodities trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can walk across the hall and they won't feel we are spying
on them,'' said Phyllis Borque, Shell Energy's vice
president/operations.
</P>
<P>
   Energy marketing is small potatoes in the grand scheme of the
97-year-old global Shell enterprise, with headquarters in London
and The Hague in the Netherlands. But it may be one of the few
bright spots in an industry that is reeling from a collapse of oil
prices to $12-a-barrel lows not seen since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   To cope, mergers have been announced to join British Petroleum
PLC and Amoco Corp., and Exxon Corp. and Mobil Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which last week announced $3.6 billion
in fourth-quarter losses, is selling a large chunk of its chemical
businesses, forming a marketing alliance with Texaco and
eliminating thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Texaco and Amoco have announced plans to get into energy
marketing but bypassed Georgia, and Raymond said he has seen ``no
evidence of their participation'' around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet the other oil companies are watching very carefully
what happens to Shell here,'' said Walter M. Higgins, chief
executive officer of AGL Resources Inc., parent of Atlanta Gas
Light Co., which has been a major Shell wholesale customer for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, which had steered clear of utility businesses because of
the regulation that has always come with them, started Shell Energy
Services a year ago to take advantage of the start of deregulation
of the nation's $300 billion-a-year utility industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in London know about it. It is very important in terms
of where the Shell group is going on a global basis,'' said Walter
van de Vijver, president of Shell Exploration &AMP; Production Co.,
which oversees the marketing venture. He said Shell would not have
gotten into the business unless it was clear it could generate $100
million in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play it right, it can be a very profitable business,''
van de Vijver said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell declines to release Georgia sales figures, but says
customer sales are exceeding expectations after four months. The
company offers a pricing plan that features guaranteed rates for
one year. Danato Eassey, Houston-based energy industry analyst at
Merrill Lynch Global Securities, said Shell should be able to
realize a ``tremendous economy of scale'' by entering utility
retail energy sales. But, he said, Shell may have to wait as the
industry is deregulated at a ``glacial pace.'' Shell's commercial
customers in Georgia include McDonalds, Kroger supermarkets, the
Cobb County schools system and endorsements from the Georgia
Textile Manufacturers Association and Building Owners and Managers
of Atlanta. The company is also making a push for residential
customers.
</P>
<P>
   To profitably market both gas and electricity, Shell will need
to add electricity generation, van de Vijver said.
</P>
<P>
   Shell has looked at power plants being sold off by deregulating
electric utilities and may build its own natural gas-fired power
plants but has no interest in acquiring a regulated utility,
executives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is changing, and if you don't adjust, you're not
going to be there,'' said van de Vijver.

 &HT;    Albert returning to national stage
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since returning to broadcasting last fall, Marv Albert
has been embraced warmly by his longtime following in New York. In
April, Albert will discover whether the rest of the country will
greet his return to the booth with open arms, after he pleaded
guilty last year to a misdemeanor assault charge.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Sports signed Albert to a multiyear contract Monday,
starting on April 2 with the first of six regular-season NBA
telecasts on TNT or TBS. Albert also will call games for Turner
during the playoffs, though that number will depend on his
obligations to Madison Square Garden Network and local Knicks
radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to be back doing television on the NBA on a
national basis,'' Albert said. ``I've been saying all along I have
to take it step by step, and this is a big step.''
</P>
<P>
   Executive producer Mike Pearl said Turner had been monitoring
Albert's progress closely, both legally and personally, for six
months. But serious talks about a contract did not begin until the
past month.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the NBA, Pearl confirmed that Albert also will
work on boxing, the Goodwill Games and ``other new programming,''
the latter a veiled reference to the new pro football league being
formed by Turner and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Marv is among the top play-by-play announcers in the
business,'' Pearl said. ``His name has been cleared by the court,
and he has been taking care of his personal life. Any time
something happens, whether it's good or bad, you can't put a time
frame on when something runs its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``But on the production side, where it is a shortened season,
this is the right time for us. We only do two nights a week in
March, because of the NCAA Tournament, so we'll get Marv on in
April, which will give him the opportunity to get used to our
system in time for the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The exposure in April will also give viewers time to get used to
the idea of seeing Albert in time for the playoffs. Given the
negative publicity about Albert's court case, there are concerns
about the reception he will receive nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I didn't think there will be some negative
reaction somewhere about it,'' Pearl said. ``But it is our belief
most of the reaction will be positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Albert might have some apprehension about the feedback
he'll get from fans outside of New York, for the moment, he's just
glad to be a national announcer again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the darkest hours, I had no idea what would unfold in my
life,'' Albert said. ``I hope to reclaim my (broadcasting)
reputation. But that's beyond my control, and that's not for me to
make a judgment on. I hope the work will speak for itself. I've had
a great relationship with the fans, and I hope it stays that way.''

<P>
   They were serious men, prosperous and pinstriped, and they
derided ``the politics of class warfare'' as they conducted a job
interview with the young governor from Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   It was steak dinner in a private room of the ``21'' Club in June
1991, and the top Democratic executives on Wall Street were
gathered at a round table to hold one of a series of meetings with
presidential aspirants in what an organizer called ``an elegant
cattle show.'' They were questioning a man with a meager salary but
a silver tongue, and this was another show in which Gov. Bill
Clinton charmed his way to a blue ribbon by impressing the
executives with his willingness to embrace free trade and free
markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was discussed was the need for the Democratic Party to
have a new and much more forward-looking economic policy,'' Roger
Altman, a leading investment banker and an organizer of the
evening, recalled recently. ``The Democratic Party needed to move
into a new economic world.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides describe that evening as an important step in the business
education of Clinton, who came to repeat and amplify the themes _
especially the need to move away from protectionism and push for
more open markets in Asia and all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the time that Clinton first met Robert Rubin, then
the head of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., and although the initial encounter
was cool the two men eventually forged a close partnership that has
left an enormous imprint on the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Rubin, who became his Treasury secretary in 1995,
took the American passion for free trade and carried it further to
press for freer movement of capital. Along the way they pushed
harder to win opportunities for American banks, brokerages and
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   This drive for free movement of capital as well as goods was one
factor in the long American-led boom in financial markets around
the globe. Yet, in retrospect, Washington's policies also fostered
vulnerabilities that are an underlying cause of the economic crisis
that began in Thailand in July 1997, rippled through Asia and
Russia, and is now shaking Brazil and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Countries like Thailand and Russia and Brazil are in trouble
today largely for internal reasons, including poor banking
practices and speculation that soared out of control. But some
economists also say that if those countries had weak foundations,
it is partly because Washington helped supply the blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   They argue that the Clinton administration pushed too hard for
financial liberalization and freer capital flows, allowing foreign
money to stream into these countries and local money to move out.
In many cases, foreign countries were happy to open up in this way
because they thought it was the best road to economic development,
but a wealth of evidence had shown that over-hasty liberalization
can lead to banking chaos and financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Even some former administration officials acknowledge that they
went too far. Mickey Kantor, the former trade representative and
commerce secretary, now says that the United States was
insufficiently aware of the kind of chaos that financial
liberalization could provoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a legitimate criticism to say that we should have
been more nuanced, more foresighted that this could happen,'' he
said. Speaking of the risks of financial liberalization without
modern banking and legal systems, he compared them to ``building a
skyscraper with no foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration always talked about
financial liberalization as the best thing for other countries, it
is also clear that it pushed for free capital flows in part because
this was what its supporters in the banking industry wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our financial services industry wanted into these markets,''
said Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former chairman of Clinton's Council
of Economic Advisers and later head of the National Economic
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyson says she disagreed to some extent with the push and
was concerned about ``a tendency to do this as a blanket approach,
regardless of the size of a country or the development of a
country.'' Free capital flows, she worried, could overwhelm small
countries or those with weak banking and legal systems, leading to
a ``run on a country.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that American officials are primarily to
blame for the crisis. Responsibility can be assigned all around:
not only to Washington policymakers, but also to the officials and
bankers in emerging-market countries who created the mess; to
Western bankers and investors who blindly handed them money; to
Western officials who hailed free capital flows and neglected to
make them safer; to Western scholars and journalists who wrote
paeans to emerging markets and the ``Asian Century'' _ and to the
people who planned an empty city named Muang Thong Thani.

 &HT;    Fall fashion notes from New York
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In her program notes, Donna Karan said the
fall/winter DKNY styles for men and women were, ``designed for the
person who breaks the mold and creates their own.'' That's one way
of describing them. Another way might be: they're clothes for
people who can't quit cocooning; still another description might
be: styles for people who'd rather wear their blankies to work.
</P>
<P>
   In her runway show on Monday, Karan applied names like, ``cotton
slip cover over white duvet coat,'' and ``blanket,'' to outerwear
pieces that were either puffy and quilted or slouchy and knitted.
Cotton t-shirts paired with fluffed-up denim pants were said to be
made of ``cotton sheeting''.
</P>
<P>
   With their zippered, Velcro and magnetic closures, the
cream-colored cold-weather looks from DKNY are undeniably
futuristic. In one sense, they looked like clothes for
intergalactic Beddouins. In another, they smacked of a future spent
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Rowley: Out of all the liquor company tie-ins saturating
Fashion Week, the one Cynthia Rowley forged with a new booze maker
in order to stage her show at Grand Central Station seemed the most
fitting. But design several decisions by Rowley _ like her choice
of colors, materials and models _ simply served to befuddle
audience members.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the new spud juice (MOR vodka), Rowley's slouchy pants,
ill-fitting sweaters and poof-shouldered dresses hinted at lapses
in taste. Rowley's models appeared wearing the stupidest shoes
shown on any runway, so far. And, once again, Rowley _ who took a
bow in a maternity smock _ also took a step further from the
``pretty'' clothes that earned her her rising-star status.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girbaud: The song-and-dance spectacle Francois Girbaud
staged was themed, ``Learning to Fly.'' And the statement Girbaud
made on the cover of his program notes, translated from French was,
``I have no interest in he who walks.''
</P>
<P>
   Viewed from a pedestrian perspective on style, Girbaud's
cold-weather clothes would look oddly futuristic. . .jiggy-wear for
the Jetsons. But Girbaud insists that retractable leggings,
convertible coveralls, rubber suits and wearable desks are what
interesting people need now. Too cutting-edge for the masses? Most
definitely. But consider Girbaud's double-side bag designs, which
drape the shoulders like vests and extend to arm's length for easy
access. They can put a 77-year-old man into space, so why didn't
anyone think of making bags that practical before?

UNDATED: Thong Thani. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HIGH-RISE GHOST TOWN
</P>
<P>
   Muang Thong Thani rises up above barren fields on the edge of
Bangkok, Thailand. It is a dazzling complex of two dozen huge
gray-white buildings soaring nearly 30 stories high, and surrounded
by streets lined with shops, town houses and detached homes. Walk
closer and it feels eerie, for it is a ghost city.
</P>
<P>
   Along one street of 100 houses, the windows are mere holes in
the walls, and yards have weeds that grow as high as a person.
</P>
<P>
   Muang Thong Thani was built during Thailand's boom as a product
of free capital flows and financial liberalization. It was the
great dream of Anant Kanjanapas.
</P>
<P>
   One of 11 children born to an ethnic Chinese business tycoon in
Thailand, Anant grew up with the wealth that his family had
acquired through developing property and selling watches in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The family's Bangkok Land company began acquiring parcels of
property near the airport, and they broke ground in 1990 on a
megaproject to build a privately owned satellite city for Bangkok.
Muang Thong Thani was to have a population of 700,000, bigger than
Boston's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all intentions to develop Muang Thong Thani as a city,
a complete city run by private-sector people,'' Anant said. ``It
was not a stroke of genius. It was logic.''
</P>
<P>
   The project was greeted enthusiastically, as all proposals were
in the early 1990s, and Bangkok Land issued shares on the Thai
Stock Exchange in 1992 to raise money. Its shares were hot, picked
up by J. Mark Mobius, the emerging-markets guru, and by funds like
the Thai International Fund and the Thai Euro Fund, which between
them bought more than 1 million shares of Bangkok Land.
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, the state pension fund bought shares in both the
Thai International Fund and the Thai Euro Fund, and that made Mary
Jo Paoni, a secretary in Cantrall, Ill., a roundabout owner of a
tiny part of Bangkok Land and Muang Thong Thani. Mrs. Paoni knew
nothing of this, of course, and disapproves of the giddy investment
sprees in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things are tough,'' she said, ``you don't start spending
like a drunken sailor. There are some people who take risks, but
not us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bangkok Land also borrowed $2.4 billion from banks domestic and
foreign. In that sense, some minute fraction of Mrs. Paoni's money
might also have been channeled to the company as loans. Her money
market account at A.G. Edwards went to buy commercial paper of
major banks, and her pension fund also held stock in Bangkok Bank,
which lent to Bangkok Land _ an illustration of the way in which
globalization now gives just about everybody some tiny financial
stake in everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   CASH CONTROLS EASED
</P>
<P>
   Free movement of capital is nothing new, for it was the norm
during most of Western history. At the beginning of this century,
anyone could move money across borders without difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   The Great Depression changed all that. Governments moved to
control capital so as to avoid what they saw as the chaos of
capital rushing out of countries and triggering financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that most countries of the world (including the
United States in the 1960s) limited the right of companies and
citizens to buy foreign securities or invest overseas. People were
often allowed to buy only small amounts of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as memories of the Depression faded, the tide shifted
again in the 1970s and '80's. Starting in the United States and
Europe, it became fashionable to let money move freely, and the
Reagan administration began to push for free capital flows in other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our task is to knock down barriers to trade and foreign
investment and the free movement of capital,'' Ronald Reagan
declared in 1985. George Bush described his Latin America program,
the Enterprise for Americas Initiative, as a commitment to ``free
markets and to the free flow of capital, central to achieving
economic growth and lasting prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration inherited that agenda and amplified
it. Previous administrations had pushed for financial
liberalization principally in Japan, but under Clinton it became a
worldwide effort directed at all kinds of countries, even smaller
ones much less able to absorb it than Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed full steam ahead on all areas of liberalization,
including financial,'' recalled Jeffrey Garten, a former senior
Commerce Department official who is now dean of the Yale School of
Management. ``I never went on a trip when my brief didn't include
either advice or congratulations on liberalization.''
</P>
<P>
   This push for financial liberalization reflected Clinton's
growing enthusiasm for markets and his desire to make the economy a
centerpiece of his foreign policy. He created the National Economic
Council as a counterpart to the National Security Council, and
asked Rubin to be its first head. More broadly, this push was part
of a global ideological shift in favor of free markets, as well as
an increasing enthusiasm among developing countries themselves for
lifting restrictions on the flow of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were convinced we were moving with the stream,'' Garten
said, ``and that our job was to make the stream move faster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street was delighted that the broad trade agenda now
included financial services,'' he added.

UNDATED: he added. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Garten said he could not recall hearing any doubts expressed
about the policy, either within the administration or among
officials overseas. Referring to Rubin, Kantor, and former Commerce
Secretary Ron Brown, Garten said: ``There wasn't a fiber in those
three bodies _ or in mine _ that didn't want to press as a matter
of policy for more open markets wherever you could make it
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to see in retrospect that we probably pushed too
far, too fast,'' he said, adding: ``In retrospect, we overshot, and
in retrospect there was a certain degree of arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   The push for financial liberalization was directed at Asia in
particular, largely because it was seen as a potential gold mine
for American banks and brokerages. Neither Clinton nor Rubin had
much experience in Asia _ Clinton as governor had led trade
delegations to promote Arkansas chickens and rice, and Rubin had
done business in Japan for Goldman Sachs. But Clinton as president
has worked hard to strengthen American ties with Asia, as well as
his own.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to press Asia to ease its barriers to American
goods and financial services, helping Fidelity sell mutual funds,
Citibank sell checking accounts, and American International Group
sell insurance. Clinton's links to Asia caused embarrassment after
they led to the campaign finance scandals of 1996, but
fundamentally they reflected an appetite for business opportunities
in Asian countries that had changed, as Clinton once put it, ``from
dominoes to dynamos.''
</P>
<P>
   His Cabinet approved a ``big emerging markets'' plan to identify
10 rising economic powers and push relentlessly to win business for
American companies there. Under Brown, the Commerce Department even
built what it called a war room, where computers tracked big
contracts, and everyone from the CIA to ambassadors to the
president himself was called upon to help land deals.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes could be huge. Japan had been the first target of
pressure for financial liberalization, even under the Reagan
administration, and these days it is finally engaged in what it
calls a ``big bang'' opening of its capital markets. The upshot is
that American institutions are swarming into Tokyo and finally have
a chance to manage a portion of the $10 trillion in Japanese
personal savings. And when a big Japanese brokerage, Yamaichi
Securities, collapsed 15 months ago, Merrill Lynch took over many
of the branches _ an acquisition that would have been unthinkable
just a few years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   REAL ESTATE VISIONARY
</P>
<P>
   Freer flow of money pumped up the Thai economy, and with the
help of foreign cash Anant began to realize his dream. Muang Thong
Thani gradually emerged from the surrounding fields, with its
skyscrapers focused on a business district called Bond Street.
</P>
<P>
   Anant, who is expert at playing official connections, was able
to coax the government into approving a convenient expressway exit,
which made the area very accessible. He also managed to persuade
the Thai Defense Department to move its headquarters and staff
residences to Muang Thong Thani.
</P>
<P>
   Critics cried foul, but Anant denies wrongdoing. During a
90-minute interview he was edgy, and at one point he seemed about
to stalk out of the room. But then he calmed down and continued his
spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense to do this,'' he said. ``But you need a lot of
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is that since the crash, Muang Thong Thani has
everything but inhabitants. Bond Street is a mile-and-a-quarter
strip of modern, window-lined buildings, but aside from a handful
of colorful storefronts _ a bank, a restaurant, a pharmacy and a
few others _ they are empty.
</P>
<P>
   In the pharmacy at 11 Bond Street, Pornsawan Rakthanyakarn is
fighting the ghostliness. A big Thai woman with a bouffant hair
style, a brown flowered print dress and a diamond ring as large as
her knuckle, she sits by the cash register, waiting for customers
to come in and buy her Vaseline Intensive Care Lotion and Pond's
Cream.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pornsawan, a jeweler who hit it rich during Thailand's
boom, heard about Muang Thong Thani on the grapevine. She inquired
from the official sales agent and was told demand was so strong
that she would have to pay a $27,000 surcharge per parcel of land.
</P>
<P>
   That convinced her, and she ended up paying nearly $500,000 for
a house and for the building that includes her shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset with the salespeople here who cheated me,'' she said
morosely. And she is trying to adjust. Originally, she had planned
to open a jewelry store, but when the economy crashed her son
suggested that a pharmacy might bring more business. And she tries
to raise money in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to buy my diamond ring?'' she asked hopefully.
She held it out and suggested, ``Five million baht?'' That is about
$137,000, more than a typical visitor might be expected to have on
hand, but Mrs. Pornsawan pressed her case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very good price!'' she exclaimed.

   THE 2 AT TREASURY
</P>
<P>
   The command center for free markets is the third floor of the
U.S. Treasury, where Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence Summers, share
a suite facing the Washington Monument. Rubin presides in a
spacious office decorated with modern art and family photos _ just
about all he sees of his family on weekdays, since his wife works
in New York and he joins her each weekend.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the suite is Summers' office, covered with
photos of his son and twin daughters, and equipped with a small
refrigerator stuffed with Diet Cokes. The two men are the closest
of partners, and when Rubin is puzzled about something, he
sometimes wanders over in his stocking feet to consult with
Summers.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, Treasury has tended to stake out free-market
positions, but Rubin stepped up the pace even further, for he
showed an intuitive tilt toward the market based on his three
decades as an investment banker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob comes from this very Wall Street view,'' said a senior
administration official. ``He reflects that experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the Clinton administration, Rubin and Summers won
increasing influence because of their skill at marrying
international finance and foreign policy. Summers had been a
prominent economics professor at Harvard, and Rubin had made a
fortune on Wall Street, enabling him to take off on vacations with
a fly-fishing rod that, as an aide joked, ``probably costs more
than your house.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Rubin and Summers were not forcing financial
liberalization down unwilling throats. Rather, Washington was
leading more than pushing. The United States pressed for capital
liberalization, recalled a former top Thai official, but he added
that it was like pushing on an open door.
</P>
<P>
   Within the administration, there were occasional arguments about
the virtues of free capital flows. Academic economists like Ms.
Tyson and Joseph Stiglitz, former chairman of the Council of
Economic Advisers, sometimes argued that Treasury was too dogmatic
in insisting upon free flows.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1995, the National Economic Council called an
interagency meeting in the ornate, high-ceilinged rooms of the Old
Executive Office Building, next to the White House. Negotiations
were under way with Chile over a free-trade agreement, and the
topic of the meeting was whether as a condition of the deal the
United States should force Chile to drop an innovative system that
amounts to a tax on short-term capital inflows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Treasury came in and said that Chile's controls had to
go,'' recalled one participant, saying others had argued that ``a
sensible set of capital controls'' was reasonable for small nations
that could be devastated by a sudden outflow of money.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was dropped, because a free-trade agreement with Chile
was never reached. But these days, Rubin and Summers say that the
issue never rose to their level, and that if it had they would not
have insisted that Chile give up its system. Still, there is
considerable evidence that top Clinton administration officials
were involved in some efforts to seek freer capital flows, as when
they pressed South Korea to liberalize its financial system.
</P>
<P>
   After interagency discussions, the administration dangled an
attractive bait: if Korea gave in, it would be allowed to join the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To enter the OECD,'' recalled a senior official of the
organization, ``the Koreans agreed to liberalize faster than they
had originally planned. They were concerned that if they went too
fast, a number of their financial institutions would be unable to
adapt.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on them is reflected in an internal three-page
Treasury Department memorandum dated June 20, 1996. The memo lays
out Treasury's negotiating position, listing ``priority areas where
Treasury is seeking further liberalization.''
</P>
<P>
   These included letting foreigners buy domestic Korean bonds;
letting Korean companies borrow abroad both short term and long
term; and letting foreigners buy Korean stocks more easily. Such
steps would help Korean companies gain more access to foreign loans
and investment, but they would also make Korea more vulnerable to
precisely the kind of panicky outflow of capital that unfolded at
the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, for all Washington's insistence that it emphasized
building financial oversight, nowhere in the memo's three pages is
there a hint that South Korea should improve its bank regulation or
legal institutions, or take similar steps. Rather, the goal is
clearly to use the OECD as a way of prying open Korean markets _ in
part to win business for American banks and brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   ``These areas are all of interest to the U.S. financial services
community,'' the memo reads.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Korea opened up the wrong way: it kept restrictions
on long-term investments like buying Korean companies, but it
dropped those on short-term money like bank loans, which could be
pulled out quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in April 1997, Rubin headed a meeting in which finance
ministers of the seven leading industrialized countries issued a
statement ``promoting freedom of capital flows'' and urging that
the International Monetary Fund charter be amended so that it could
lead the charge for capital account liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   Some Treasury officials now portray the effort to amend the
charter as a fund initiative that they were not directly involved
in, and indeed Britain was an early public backer of the idea. But
a senior Treasury official acknowledges that the idea originated
with American officials based in the fund who report to Treasury,
and who consulted on the idea with members of the administration.
Indeed, in a speech delivered in March 1998, eight months after the
crisis began, Summers reaffirmed his support of capital
liberalization, although he cautioned that it could be phased in.

   The records of the monetary fund _ which was in many ways an
instrument of American policy _ also show that it was urging some
countries in this direction already. In July 1996, the fund's
executive board praised Indonesia's ``open capital account'' and, a
few months later, ``welcomed the recent acceleration of capital

   Rubin argues today that it is flatly wrong to suggest that the
Clinton administration was pushing for free capital flows while
neglecting efforts to build modern financial and legal systems. As
for time spent pressing for capital account liberalization, he
said, ``I bet I haven't spent three hours during the four years
I've been here.'' He then ticked off the days and weeks he had
worked to strengthen banks, regulatory oversight, and legal systems
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reducing capital controls was undoubtedly an objective of some
of the things the administration did,'' Rubin said. ``But I never
would have recollected it as a priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said the attempt to revise the monetary fund charter
to promote capital liberalization was no longer a priority, and he
hinted that this reflected changing views.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you go along,'' he said, ``you adjust your position to
reflect your experience.''
</P>
<P>
   MONEY FLOODS ASIA
</P>
<P>
   A flood of capital poured into emerging markets in the early and
mid-1990s, including $93 billion in 1996 alone into just five
countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, South Korea and
Thailand. Then there was a net outflow of $12 billion from those
five countries in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This turnabout, which was most evident in short-term loans,
amounted to a financial hurricane, one that would harm any country
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So while economists welcome free capital flows in principle,
extensive scholarly work had clearly established the importance of
``sequencing'' _ meaning that countries should liberalize capital
flows only after building up bank supervision and a legal
infrastructure. A French scholar, Charles Wyplosz, of the Graduate
Institute of International Studies in Geneva, concludes in an
academic paper that ``financial market liberalization is the best
predictor of currency crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Summers himself had emphasized the need for caution in financial
deregulation in 1993, when he was still chief economist at the
World Bank. He noted in a paper then that poor countries usually
have ``only quite limited bank supervision,'' adding: ``As is true
for nuclear power plants, free entry is not sensible in banking.''
</P>
<P>
   That scholarly emphasis on caution was drowned out in the rush
to open financial markets. And one intrinsic problem was that while
developing countries had a strong vested interest in opening up to
foreign capital, to let money come in, they saw little benefit in
building modern banking and legal institutions. Indeed, in some
cases, top officials and their friends had a major stake in
maintaining financial systems in which what counted above all was
political connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial liberalization was undertaken in countries that
didn't have the infrastructure to support it,'' reflected Ricki
Helfer, a leading international bank regulator and former
chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ``That was one of
the principal causes of the Asian crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Given their backgrounds, Rubin and Summers were more aware of
the risks than most others, and they did urge better regulation of
international banking. For instance, at the 1995 meeting of the
seven leading industrialized nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, an
American-led initiative called for improved financial regulation
and data reporting for industrialized nations and eventually others
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these steps to improve banking oversight were modest and
proceeded slowly, while liberalization hurtled along. American
officials pressed for oversight, but they continued to press
harder, and certainly more effectively, for liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   A former senior Treasury official ruefully recalls arguments
with Stiglitz, then in the White House as an adviser. Stiglitz was
warning about the need for slower pacing of financial
liberalization abroad, but nobody listened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I viewed `pace' as an excuse by countries to keep their
markets closed,'' the Treasury official said.
</P>
<P>
   W. Bowman Cutter, who served as Rubin's deputy at the National
Economic Council, said that all of the policymakers understood the
risks and that in speeches ``every one of them gave the
qualifications _ that before you opened your markets to free flows
of capital, you need to have the institutional strength to deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that,'' he added, ``I think that we all missed the
true importance and the difficulties created by the enormous growth
of the amount of free cash floating around the world. In the
speeches, we said the right things. but it was a question of where
was the emphasis and where was the force.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, liberalization frequently takes place without any
improvement in bank supervision, and it is often accompanied by a
rise in shady dealings. In 1996, Thailand's justice minister
accused his fellow Cabinet members of taking $90 million in bribes
in exchange for handing out banking licenses. And when the Bangkok
Bank of Commerce, Thailand's ninth-largest bank, collapsed in 1996
it turned out that 47 percent of its assets were bad loans, many of
them to associates of the bank's president.
</P>
<P>
   Still, cronyism and corruption, while aggravating factors, were
not necessary to trigger a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple fact,'' said James Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank, ``is that very sophisticated banks loaned to Indonesian
companies, without any real knowledge of their financial condition,
based on name, based on competition. So you have to say to
yourself, would it have made any difference if they had known?
Well, maybe, but they did go nuts.''

<P>
   TURNING POINT IN '95
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, governments did two things that would set up the
emerging markets for trouble. What appeared to be a brilliant
bailout of Mexico, led by Rubin and Summers, convinced investors
that some countries were too strategically important to be allowed
to fail. And then, when finance ministers from the Group of 7
industrialized countries gathered in Washington on April 24, 1995,
they agreed to try to push up the value of the dollar against the
Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   The accord worked. The dollar rose smartly against the yen,
easing the risk of a global crisis at that time.
</P>
<P>
   But the pact also caused the rise of currencies like the Thai
baht and the South Korean won, which were informally pegged to the
dollar. Thailand and South Korea had already lost some
competitiveness when China devalued its currency in 1994, and now
they were tugged upward along with the dollar so that their exports
became more expensive and even less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that goods made there had more trouble competing
abroad. Thai exports were stagnant in 1996 after having soared 23
percent in 1995, and the Thai current account deficit (a broad
measure of the balance of trade) rose to 8 percent of gross
national product in 1996, up from 2 percent in the late 1980s.
Foreign currency reserves began to drain away to pay for the
deficits, and the seeds of the crisis were sown.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the focus on free capital flows and the risks
created by the waves of capital hurtling around the globe, many
economists conclude that the primary causes of the crisis were the
deep structural problems within countries. The same capital flows
that devastated Thailand left Taiwan and Singapore with only mild
damage, and the reason was mainly that they had managed their
economies better than Thailand did.
</P>
<P>
   One common vulnerability in many of the hardest-hit countries
was that like Japan in the late 1980s, they had enjoyed speculative
bubbles fueled by cheap credit.
</P>
<P>
   The giddiness ended up creating havoc with the banking systems,
for it resulted in what might be called the three excesses: excess
borrowing, excess investment, and excess capacity (meaning
factories and equipment that are kept idle because of
lower-than-expected demand).
</P>
<P>
   These excesses were so widespread that their effects can be seen
not just in the capital cities, but even in remote places like the
Indonesian town of Mojokerto.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet, a rickshaw driver who lives with his wife and three
children on the edge of Mojokerto, always used to pay cash for
purchases. But about five years ago, banks and finance companies
began to pioneer a credit system even for the poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   So Salamet and his wife, Yuti, bought furniture on installments.
They paid for their son Dwi's school uniform on installments as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Salamet used to rent his rickshaw, a dilapidated contraption
that looks like a love seat being pushed by a bicycle. But as the
neighborhood prospered, Salamet dreamed of moving up in the world.
He borrowed from the bank and bought a banged-up secondhand
rickshaw with a red seat, promising to pay the equivalent of $4 a
month for 14 months. He thought he would be able to earn the
monthly payment in just a few days on his rickshaw, and so it
seemed the perfect investment.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he bought in at the peak of the rickshaw
bubble.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the area had about 100 rickshaws, and each of the
drivers could earn about twice as much as a farm worker. But the
advent of rickshaw financing, coupled with the general enthusiasm
for moving up in the world, led to an explosion of rickshaws. Now
there are 300.
</P>
<P>
   ``These days, there are more rickshaws than the area can
support,'' grumbled Rutiati, a 37-year-old woman who is a rickshaw
agent, arranging financing for Salamet and others in the
neighborhood. ``There are more rickshaws than passengers.''
</P>
<P>
   Salamet and Mrs. Yuti (who like many Indonesians use only one
name) have a plan to overcome the family's difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure I'll start a little shop in front of our house
here,'' Mrs. Yuti explained, beaming. ``It seems it's a good way to
make money on the side. And if we're hungry, we can always eat the
shop's food.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the neighborhood is also suffering from a
shop boom. Banks in Mojokerto began lending to households wanting
to open stores in their living rooms, and all the cheap credit and
optimism in Mojokerto led to the same problem locally as around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The number of shops in the neighborhood soared to 20, from 3.
The banks in Mojokerto are scrambling to recover the loans they
made to stores, but it seems the banks miscalculated when they
assumed that the groceries would remain as collateral. Borrowers
have taken the collateral and eaten it.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: There is one member of our staff who is
lazy, selfish and absolutely refuses to help anyone out. This
slacker does not show his true colors when the boss is around. In
front of him, he's a gem. I have talked with my boss about him, in
a casual manner, but he does not want to take any action at this
time. How can we get our boss to understand? T.E.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: There are a number of ways to deal with a co-worker who
is a gemstone in front of the boss and a gallstone when he is not
around.
</P>
<P>
   Your boss's reluctance to act at this point is probably a
reflection of the ``casual manner'' in which you originally
approached him. When people are approached casually, they tend to
respond in kind.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, one way to help your boss understand what is truly going
on in your department is for you and some of your fellow employees
to meet with him and seriously discuss the situation. Your
objective should not be for him to sanction or discipline your
slacking co-worker. Rather, you should ask your boss if there is a
way for him to spend more time in your department.
</P>
<P>
   With increased visibility by the boss, your slacking co-worker
is more likely to spend more time trying to act like a gem.
However, unless he truly changes his ways, your boss is likely to
see that this gem is counterfeit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We have a weekly meeting that should take less than an hour.
It often stretches through the afternoon because of interruptions.
Our boss leaves frequently for cigarette breaks, bathroom breaks
and phone calls _ personal or business. The rest of us waste time
until he returns. I am growing increasingly resentful of these
meetings, as they often put me behind in my work. What can I do?
C.P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rather than having a meeting that is being interrupted by
breaks, your situation sounds like breaks that are being
interrupted by a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually a double-edged problem. If your boss is aware
that the breaks and interruptions are disruptive and dissatisfying,
but he still persists in taking them, that is a bad sign. And, if
he is not aware that they are disruptive and dissatisfying, that
sign is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   You and some of your fellow attendees should discuss the
situation with him. Let him see that the current meeting format is
wasting time and generating unrest, and then present some
suggestions to correct this.
</P>
<P>
   You can suggest that the attendees be given a draft agenda ahead
of the meeting, along with an opportunity to submit additional
topics. Within the meetings, there should be specific times
allocated to each scheduled topic, with time set aside toward the
end for further discussion and questions if necessary. Barring
emergencies, there should be a formal and finite time for breaks
and phone calls in meetings that are an hour or longer. This type
of approach can help set the stage for meetings that solve
problems, rather than create them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My manager called me at my desk and asked me to tell him what
one of my fellow employees was doing at that moment. I looked over
and saw her working. My manager asked me to keep an eye on her and
call him if she leaves early. I don't like spying, but I don't want
to refuse a directive. What should I do? A.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: It sounds like your manager is missing a few of the key
essentials for effective management, particularly in such areas as
building trust, respect, teamwork, motivation, loyalty and
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who truly knows what to do in this situation is
you. Some might say that this is a one-time event where your
manager needed help, you provided it, and that is the end of the
story. However, you may feel that one time is too many, or perhaps
this is the beginning of a trend.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, and that point may be now, you are going to need
to talk openly and honestly to your manager about this. Tell him
that you want to help him when possible, but watching other
employees is extremely upsetting and you would prefer not to do it.
You can tell him that, as a manager, he is in the best position to
determine whether one of your co-workers is working and whether
that person is actually leaving, taking a break or going elsewhere
for purely business reasons. You have a full and demanding job as
it is, and, in order to do it well, you should let your manager
know that you want to focus on it rather than on any of your
co-workers.

   ASIA FOLLOWS JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Japan was exporting its bubble to Asia. Japan had
gone through one of the most dazzling stock and real estate manias
in history. At the peak, in 1990, the land underneath the Imperial
Palace in downtown Tokyo was said to be worth as much as all of
California.
</P>
<P>
   Then prices steadily tumbled, leading to an $8 trillion decline
in financial assets and to Japan's continuing troubles today. This
recession meant that Japanese banks had few good lending
opportunities at home, and so they began lending elsewhere in Asia
_ and since yen interest rates were extremely low, the loans were
alluring to borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the ``carry trade,'' which was initially highly
profitable but ultimately catastrophic. It took many forms, but
typically financial institutions would borrow yen at 2 percent
interest rates, convert the proceeds into Thai baht, and reap the
differential: baht deposit rates were about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Japanese manufacturing companies also began building
factories all over Asia. Between 1986 and 1996, Japanese private
investment in Asia added industrial potential equivalent to three
Frances.
</P>
<P>
   All this was in many ways wonderful for Asia, resulting in an
investment boom and low interest rates. But the deluge of cheap
loans and foreign investment resulted, not surprisingly, in a huge
increase in capacity to make everything from steel to paper to
cars. The world now has the ability to manufacture 60 million cars
a year, even though there is demand for about 44 million.
</P>
<P>
   A few alarm bells went off. Citicorp has a Windows on Risk
committee, a group of senior executives who meet regularly to
discuss problems that may erupt in the future, and in May 1996 the
committee invited Paul Krugman, an economist at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, to a conference room in Citicorp Tower to
give his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krugman said he thought the Asian model was running out of
steam,'' recalled William Rhodes, vice chairman of Citicorp. ``He
told us that after 10 years of unsurpassed growth, the boom in Asia
was over, and the area was going to face some major adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was the person who triggered the concern for us,''
Rhodes said. ``We started to adjust our exposure accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes was particularly sensitive to credit risks, because in
the early and mid-1980s, he was the point man for the Western
banking system in dealing with the Latin American debt crisis. A
fluent Spanish speaker, Rhodes had worked in Latin America and had
seen the conventional wisdom about the region's prospects suddenly
transformed almost overnight in August 1982, when Mexico missed a
debt payment and the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   It was because of those memories that American banks were
generally more careful in the 1990s in Asia than they had been in
the 1970s in Latin America. American banks were comparatively
cautious about their borrowers in places like Bangkok and Moscow,
while European banks developed a reputation for being willing to
lend to just about anybody with a business card.
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNING BLAME
</P>
<P>
   So what were the causes of the crisis?
</P>
<P>
   There are two main camps in the academic battleground. One, led
by Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, argues that the crisis was
essentially a panic, in which investors rushed for the exits
because everybody else was rushing for the exits. The other,
initially led by Krugman of MIT, argues that the hardest-hit
countries had fundamental weaknesses that sealed their fates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is general agreement that there were both
structural problems and a panic, even if there is a critical
dispute about their relative importance. The most common view is
that several key factors worked together to set the stage:
</P>
<P>
   The countries had severe internal vulnerabilities. These
included weak banking and legal systems, overvalued currencies, and
mountains of short-term loans in dollars and other foreign
currencies. And investors delivered the coup de grace, panicking
and frantically pulling their money, so that currencies plummeted
and capital dried up in these countries.
</P>
<P>
   The banking system was frail because of several built-in flaws.

UNDATED: built-in flaws. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, Asian companies borrowed too much from banks. In the
United States, companies tend to raise money on the stock and bond
markets, and only 22 percent of corporate debt is held by banks.
But in Asia, 80 percent of corporate borrowing is from banks, much
of it in short-term loans.
</P>
<P>
   Second, companies borrowed for the short term but invested in
long-term projects like hotel construction. This was risky because
if the banks did not renew the loans and instead asked for
repayment, the money would be sunk in half-completed buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Third, companies and banks borrowed in dollars and yen even
though the returns would be in baht and other local currencies.
This seemed safe as long as Thailand maintained its currency peg of
25 baht to the dollar. But if it devalued to 50 baht (which had
seemed inconceivable but eventually happened), borrowers were
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose a developer borrowed $1 million, converted it to 25
million baht, and began to construct a hotel with an expected value
of 40 million baht. When the crisis hit, the hotel's value fell to
only 15 million baht, but the devaluation meant that the developer
had to pay back 50 million baht. In country after country, these
kinds of calculations spelled bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Asian banks often lent money on the basis of
connections or government instruction, without much credit
analysis. In South Korea, by some estimates, half of bank lending
was made at the direction of government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, even before the crisis hit in July 1997, nonperforming
loans (those that borrowers are not repaying) made up 15 percent or
more of total loans in Indonesia, South Korea, Thailand and
Malaysia. That compares with just under 1 percent in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   This financial scaffolding was fragile enough, but then it was
forced higher and higher because of speculation that inflated land
and stock prices in most of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Asia in the early 1990s, property prices soared into the
stratosphere, such that in 1994 a parking space in Hong Kong sold
for $517,000. Scholars have long noted a dangerous spiral whereby
inflated property prices became inflated collateral for inflated
loans, which further inflate property prices and start the cycle
along again, until the whole edifice collapses.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, according to one ranking, the three most expensive
rental locations for retail stores were 57th Street in New York,
Causeway Bay in Hong Kong, and GUM department store in Moscow. The
crisis has sent prices plummeting in Hong Kong and Moscow, as New
York remains unfazed, the costliest retailing location in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In an economy that is all speculative froth, even the stupidest
investments tend to pay off initially, so the result was a lot of
foolish investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors wanted to hear a good story to buy your shares,''
recalled Vichit Surapongchai, president of Radanasin Bank in
Thailand. ``It was like the tail wagging the dog. Because you
wanted your shares to make a lot of money, you tried to think of
what projects you should invest in. There was less viability of
projects to start with.''
</P>
<P>
   The intellectual trend has changed in every way since the crisis
began. Emerging markets are now seen as risks, not opportunities.
And the ethos that drove the wave of investment in small countries
_ the triumphalism of free markets for capital as well as for goods
_ has abated. It is fashionable to talk about the dangers of
unregulated free capital flows and the need for caution in opening
them up. One result is that although the U.S. economy is so far
unscathed, American credibility is not.
</P>
<P>
   As Seichi Kondo, a senior Japanese Foreign Ministry official,
puts it, ``Washington wasn't the major source of the crisis, but it
added considerably to the worsening of the situation. If they
haven't learned lessons, if they still think it was Asian values
that prolonged the crisis, then I have to blame Americans. But I
think the United States has learned a lot from the crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' he added pointedly, ``the learning cost has been
very expensive for Asian countries.''

CONVERSION TO EURO POSES CHALLENGE TO COIN-MACHINE INDUSTRY

 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VICENZA, Italy _ Luca Adriani is of two minds about the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Adriani, 32, is chief executive of Coges SRL, which manufactures
vending machines. Now that the euro _ the common currency for 11
European nations _ has made its debut in electronic transactions,
orders for his machines are swelling, he says, in preparation for
January 2002, when euro coins and bills will be introduced.
</P>
<P>
   But his company, based outside this city in northern Italy, also
operates vending machines, supplying them to businesses that offer
snacks and coffee to employees. So he expects the cost of replacing
the coin boxes, as well as the loss of revenue while the machines
are being converted, to put a sizable dent in that business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm laughing on one side of my face, and crying on the
other,'' Adriani said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, mixed emotions are found throughout the European vending
industry, which makes and operates coin-operated machines
dispensing everything from soda to cigarettes, candy to condoms. In
the next three years, companies that operate vending machines will
have to spend heavily to rejigger them to accept euro coins. The
swelling demand will be a boon for equipment manufacturers at
first.
</P>
<P>
   But the rush to convert also means that many machines will be
out of commission for long periods, in limbo between currencies.
And come 2002, there are sure to be frustrated customers with
marks, lire, francs and the like still jingling in their pockets
who are unable to use the new euro machines. (The 11 national
currencies are legal tender until July 2002.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for us is: When do you convert your machines?''
said Norbert Monssen, spokesman for the organization that
represents the German vending machine industry. ``If you do it too
early, your customers don't have the coins and go elsewhere. It's a
problem unique to vending.'' Stores, he noted, can and must accept
two currencies during the six-month transition period; vending
machines and other coin-operated devices are exempt but still must
be retrofitted to accept the new coins at some point.
</P>
<P>
   And as the investment budgets of vending machine operators are
stretched thin, some equipment manufacturers are apprehensive about
a sharp falloff in sales once the new coins arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll peak in the next two years, and investments will be
considerable,'' said Rainer Puchalski, sales manager at NRI
National Rejectors Inc. near Hamburg, Germany, a leading maker of
coin processing equipment and a unit of Crane Co. of Stamford,
Conn. ``But once that's done, we expect some holding back.''
</P>
<P>
   The euro (worth about $1.13) came into use on Jan. 4 in Italy,
Germany, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg,
Austria, Finland, Spain and Portugal. For now, however, it is a
cashless currency, used by banks and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of euro notes and coins was delayed for three
years to afford Europe's new Central Bank and mints the time to
produce the money needed. Europeans now carry roughly 70 billion
coins in their pockets that can be used for 3.8 million vending
machines and several million more coin-operated devices like
telephones and subway ticket machines. In Germany, home to 2.5
million vending machines, more than $6 billion worth of coins,
weighing more than 86,000 tons, circulate.
</P>
<P>
   The task of changing all that money into euros is ``both a
threat and an opportunity,'' said Catherine Piana, secretary
general of the European Vending Association in Brussels, which
represents the industry.
</P>
<P>
   For one, few euro coins are available to vending machine
manufacturers. Industry officials say they must have samples of the
coins because the microchips in older model coin-recognition
devices, like those often used in vending machines, must learn the
characteristics of new coins by having them repeatedly inserted
into their slots; newer models are programmed by transferring the
information from a laptop. The recognition devices typically judge
the genuineness of coins by examining magnetic fields to determine
alloys and optical sensors to check looks.
</P>
<P>
   National Rejectors has already sent specialists to mints in
France, Germany and Belgium to test equipment on the new euro
coins. Puchalski said he hoped to have samples in the company's own
laboratories by the summer, ``though no one's given it to us in
writing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar complaints about the availability of samples greeted the
introduction of a redesigned $20 bill in the United States in
September. Vending machine manufacturers say that they have had to
scramble to refit their machines.
</P>
<P>
   European industry officials also worry whether there will be
sufficient coins available in 2002 and whether the amounts will be
properly apportioned in terms of what denominations are most in
demand by vending machine customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some skeptical companies are promoting cashless systems that use
smart cards or programmable keys to activate vending machines,
convinced that coin shortages will occur, and thus present
opportunities for introducing new technology.
</P>
<P>
   Adriani of Coges, for example, can plug a plastic key into a
coffee machine and a digital display tells him how much credit
remains on its programmable microchip before he orders two
espressos. His company, which has big markets in Germany, France
and Spain in addition to Italy, is pushing such cashless payment
systems because he is convinced that Europe will never have
sufficient coins ready on time. In Germany and Italy, Europe's
largest markets, cashless systems are additionally attractive, he
said, because about 95 percent of food and beverage vending
machines are on private premises, like company cafeterias, where
smart cards or other electronic purses are easily distributable,
compared with only about 26 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy alone has to mint 7.6 billion coins by 2002, or 10
million coins a day,'' said Adriani, whose company has annual sales
of $60 million, as he sipped his espresso. ``But our mint has a
capacity of 2 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have already adopted cashless systems. Alois
Dallmayr, the Munich-based coffee distributor, says it expects 70
percent of its vending machines to be cashless after the euro
comes.
</P>
<P>
   Adriani and others are also concerned about the uniform quality
required of coins for vending machines. Euro coins are planned in
eight denominations: 0.01, 0.02, 0.05, 0.10, 0.20 and 0.50 euros,
and 1 and 2 euro coins. While European leaders have set the size,
color, weight and metal alloys to be used for each, the coins will
be minted at 15 locations in the 11 euro countries. ``The main
concern is constancy and uniformity in the materials and the
alloys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, that may not be a problem, since national mints will
supply the coins for national territories. But there may be trouble
after summer 2002, when Europeans return home from summer holidays
with pockets full of euros from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, simply getting the coins into circulation and
disposing of the old national coins poses immense logistical and
security problems. In some countries, like Italy, officials are
considering using the army to transport and guard the money. ``It's
an epochal event,'' Adriani said. ``There's no precedent.''
</P>
<P>
   Europe's retailing association, Eurocommerce, predicts that
under the best of circumstances the switch to euro cash in 2002
will cost European retailers 1.3 percent of their annual revenues,
or about $17 billion, said Ceu Pereira, an association spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many European retailers are urging a shortening of
the period of dual currency use from the six months now planned.
Some even argue for a ``big bang'' _ an overnight switch from 11
currencies to the euro. A drawn-out conversion, they argue, means
duplicate cash registers and price tags in stores.
</P>
<P>
   But the vending industry rejects the proposal. Shortages of
technical personnel will mean idling machines for long periods, and
hence lost revenue, they say. As it is, armies of mechanics will
have to fan out to coffee shops, train stations and restrooms. On
older model vending machines, coin boxes will have to be taken to
workshops, a task that will require months. ``At our meetings,
there's panic,'' acknowledged Lucio Pinetti, director general of
the Italian Vending Association in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   His group predicts that conversion of Italy's 517,000 food and
beverage machines will cost almost $150 million, or 10 percent of
annual revenues. In Germany, food and drink vendors, whose revenues
total $2 billion, fear losses of up to $8 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the vending industry consists of mom-and-pop operations
with an average of five employees, according to the European
Vending Association. But huge multinationals like Coca-Cola Co.,
which has thousands of vending machines throughout Europe, are also
affected. ``It works if you have sufficient lead time,'' said
Shelagh Kerr, a spokeswoman in Brussels for Coca-Cola in Europe.
``It's not cheap, but it's doable.''

 &HT;    USOC requests more time for Atlanta report; other cities claim
no breach of rules

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta's response to an International Olympic
Committee investigation into improprieties by IOC members in
dealings with candidate host cities has been delayed despite the
local bid team's assurances that it has ``nothing to report.''
</P>
<P>
   Several other bid groups asked to supply information to the IOC
about any improper actions by members during visits also say they
have little or nothing to report, according to an Associated Press
survey of cities.
</P>
<P>
   That answer raises questions about the ultimate effectiveness of
the IOC's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   David D'Alessandro, president of John Hancock insurance, an IOC
sponsor, observed in a published column over the weekend: ``This is
like sending a letter to the proverbial fox in the hen house,
asking, `Would you mind telling us how many chickens you have
eaten?' Then, if the fox sends back a polite note, `None, thank
you,' you issue a public statement exonerating the fox.
Incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the deadline for bid groups to deliver their reports
to the IOC headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. Atlanta's report
has been stalled by the U.S. Olympic Committee's preoccupation with
the Salt Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Since many bid groups have dissolved, the IOC sent inquiries to
the national Olympic committees representing all Olympic bidders
from 1996 through 2006.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Payne, president of Atlanta's bid team, has faxed a brief
response to USOC president Bill Hybl indicating that he has no
evidence of corruption by any IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   ``ACOG has advised us they have nothing to report,'' USOC
spokesman Mike Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the USOC has asked the IOC for an extension until March
1 to provide a formal response on behalf of Atlanta. Moran said the
USOC was obligated to provide an official response to the IOC and
could not just forward Atlanta's comments on to Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a few comments we provided that really don't
amount to a whole lot,'' Atlanta bid spokesman Lee Echols
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Moran said the USOC, based in Colorado Springs, Colo., is
``exhausting all our resources'' gathering information for its own
investigation, led by former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, into bribery allegations in Salt Lake. The USOC's report
is due to be released March 1. The USOC is further bogged down with
subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department, which also is looking
into the Salt Lake City bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been able to respond to (the IOC's request on
Atlanta),'' Moran said.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake ethics board released a report last week detailing
how IOC members received more than $1 million in cash, scholarships
for their families, medical treatment and other favors during the
city's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake report implicated 24 IOC members _ about one-fifth
of the total roster _ for receiving improper or questionable
benefits. The report cited 10 names that were not included in the
list of 14 implicated earlier during the IOC's internal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities will paint a contrasting picture to the IOC's,
according to the Associated Press survey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Berlin (2000 Games): ``It's been investigated and it's all on
the table. We didn't see any rules being broken,'' said Heiner
Henze, general secretary of the Germany Olympic committee.
</P>
<P>
   _ St. Petersburg, Russia (2004): Neither the Russian Olympic
committee nor the St. Petersburg bidding committee will submit a
report. ``We have sent no letter, since there was nothing to
report,'' said Alexander Ratner, Russian Olympic committee
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rome (2004): Italian IOC member Mario Pescante said there
would be no submission. ``I don't think we have sent a letter, nor
are we sending one,'' Pescante said. ``We don't have anything to
report.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Athens (1996 and 2004): Lambis Nikolaou, president of the
Greek Olympic committee, said there was no ``problem with any
member of the IOC for Athens 1996 or 2004. We have no evidence of
wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   In England, an official with Manchester (1996 and 2000) and
Birmingham (1992) said its report was confidential.
</P>
<P>
   As for Cape Town (2004), ``We were not involved in offering any
inducement for votes,'' said Chris Ball, who led the South African
city's bid. He declined to give details of his report to the IOC.
``I have to be discreet,'' he said. ``It's an IOC matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Nagano (1998 Winter Games) have said that nine IOC
members exceeded the limits, while Toronto (1996) previously cited
improper activities by some members.
</P>
<P>
   Like Atlanta, Ostersund, Sweden (2002 Winter Games) has
requested more time to respond.

 &HT;    Bruce Chen: The fifth dimension
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The newest soon-to-be member of the Atlanta Braves
starting rotation was flying high when his opportunity knocked.
About 30,000 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen was on his way back to Atlanta from his home in
Panama on Nov. 10 when a flight attendant handed him a Panamanian
newspaper. He opened to the sports section to find a picture of
himself beside one of Denny Neagle accompanying a report that
Neagle had been traded to the Reds in a five-player deal. The
caption under Chen's photo said the 21-year-old left-handed pitcher
had a great opportunity to break in as the Braves' fifth starter.
</P>
<P>
   So did he let out a yelp? A scream? Did he high-five the nearest
person?
</P>
<P>
   No, the reaction was more like a little grin, then serious
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think, `You're going to be the fifth starter,' ''
Chen said. ``I was like, `Oh, there's an opportunity. I'll have to
earn it. I'll have to work hard in the offseason to have the chance
to do it. I'm not going to take anything for granted. If I'm not
going to be the fifth starter, it's not because I'm out of shape.'
''
</P>
<P>
   That type of thought process is one of the reasons the Braves
feel comfortable inserting Chen into a rotation that includes Greg
Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz and Kevin Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't hurt that Chen has good pitches _
fastball, curveball, change-up _ good control and had a successful
debut in the major leagues last season. After getting called up in
September, Chen went 2-0 with a 3.98 ERA in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see Chen continue what he did last year,''
manager Bobby Cox said. ``He doesn't have to do anything different.
. . . He's a very young kid, but he's very polished for his years
of experience. He's a very bright kid. He's a fast learner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves signed Chen in 1993 when he was 16 years old. The
following summer he left his parents, older sister and younger
brother to start his professional baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they told me you have six months until you have to
report, so be by yourself, start to be independent,'' Chen said.
``That was kind of scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen pitched for the rookie league Gulf Coast Braves on
Wednesdays and weekends and went to high school the other days. He
roomed with Andruw Jones, another teenage prospect. Chen said the
two struggled with being away from family on days when baseball
wasn't going well. They didn't have many of those days.
</P>
<P>
   Chen moved straight to Class AA Greenville, then moved to
Triple-A Greenville in August. The Braves brought him to Atlanta
three weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Phillips was Chen's first opposing hitter during his debut
against the Mets on Sept. 7. Chen threw three consecutive fastballs
on the outside corner, and Phillips never took the bat off his
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, 'If I can do that, my fastball is the same as
anybody's,''' Chen said. ``It doesn't matter how hard you throw
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen gave up four runs in three innings, but he gained
confidence. Pitching coach Leo Mazzone got on him afterward about
not giving in to the strike zone. He responded by allowing two runs
in the next 16 innings while winning two games, against the Florida
Marlins and Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   And now this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be different (than September), but it's also
going to be fun,'' Chen said. ``It's a time for you to get the
first taste of baseball. I want to pitch. I want to grab a ball and
face a hitter. It's hard to describe. You miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first full minor-league season in 1997, Chen was a
member of the highly-regarded young pitching rotation in Class A
Macon (Ga.), which included Rob Bell, Jason Marquis and Jason
Shiell, but Chen was the one lagging. He started 6-4 with a 5.00
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided not to worry about numbers, to get better every
day,'' Chen said. ``At the end of the season, I'll be a better
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   He had just turned 20 years old at the time. And he was right.
By the end of that season, he was 12-7 and his ERA was 3.51. He led
the South Atlantic League in strikeouts with 182 in only 146 1/3
innings. Baseball America chose him as the Braves top minor-league
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Chen, who is studying civil engineering at Georgia Tech, blended
in as just another student last year. That will change before long.
``Baseball is my first priority, but getting a diploma would mean a
lot to me,'' Chen said. ``At the beginning, it was more my parents
that were big on it. After the quarter at Tech, I realized I can do
it. It's not that hard. It'd be a great accomplishment if I can
finish my college career. It's going to take a while for me, but it
shows perseverance and hard work, which are the basics for playing
baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   If he's as successful this baseball season as he was this
academic quarter at Tech, he'll be in the Braves' rotation for a
while: Chen was named to the dean's list.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After the farfalle with porcini mushrooms, ricotta
cheese pastiera and decaffeinated cappuccino at Roberto's two
blocks away on Crescent Avenue, it was almost curtain time at the
Belmont Italian American Playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But first, attention had to be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case you missed them, the Arthur Avenue Golden Girls are
here,'' announced Dante Albertie, artistic director of the
Playhouse, a matchbook-size theater in the Bronx. ``If midway
through the show they start talking, just give one of them a shot,
and they'll all get quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Girls tittered. The lights went down. And since
there's no curtain to go up, the show began, with the Golden Girls
in their customary places, in the first of the seven rows on the
right side of the 75-seat theater overlooking Arthur Avenue, the
Bronx's answer to Little Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction this time was ``Rockaway Boulevard,'' a
no-nonsense three-actor drama written by Richard Vetere in what
could be termed Outer Borough Neo-Realism. But the stars of the
evening were clearly the four Golden Girls, three of them in their
70's and Marie Antoinette Diorio, the baby at 57, who make it to
every Belmont production and hark back to a long gone, probably
irretrievable era in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont area was farmland until late in the 19th century.
Its first residents were mostly Italian workers who settled there
and found jobs in landscaping or construction at the Bronx Zoo and
the New York Botanical Garden. It soon became known as the Little
Italy of the Bronx, and though its ethnic mix has become far more
diverse in recent decades, its heart remains the Italian shops,
bakeries and restaurants, most of them handed down generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont playhouse opened in 1991 with the fiercely
anachronistic mission of being a truly local theater, with a core
clientele in the aging Italian populace and a goal of presenting
new works by Italian-American playwrights and new productions of
classic Italian plays. In addition to contemporary plays, work
presented over the years in Italian and English has included
Machiavelli's ``Mandragola,'' Goldoni's ``Coffee Shop,'' one-act
plays by Luigi Pirandello and Eduardo de Filippo's ``Non ti Pago.''
</P>
<P>
   To date, no part of the core clientele has been as solid as the
Golden Girls, though their configuration can change a bit from
month to month. This evening brought out Anne Mariano, Marge
Cristiano, V Cauttero and Ms. Diorio, all in vintage sweaters and
knits and impeccably coiffed. Loretta Borrello, a founding member,
moved to Florida two years ago. Lena Simioni is a regular now, but
she was out sick this time out. And local chroniclers will no doubt
recount the contributions of Chris Solanto, Marie Panniti and Helen
Caputo, who have been card-carrying members at various times
</P>
<P>
   While members may come and go, in some form the group has made
it to every production the theater has presented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really enjoy the performances; they're excellent,'' said
Mrs. Mariano, who lives two doors down from the theater. ``We sit
in the first row, and you can almost touch the actors. And it gives
us a chance to get together, go out to dinner and go to a play. How
many neighborhoods can you do that in?''
</P>
<P>
   There are some. The South Bronx has the Pregones Theater, which
caters to the Puerto Rican community. Groups like the Thalia
Spanish Theater in Queens and Vaso de Leche Productions on the
Lower East Side offer ethnic fare to audiences made up largely of
local residents. Still, recreating the glory days of ethnic
theater, for example, the Yiddish Theater's following on the Lower
East Side, is no easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are behind us,'' said Albertie, one of three full-time
employees at the theater, which occupies what used to be a pool
hall. ``It's different than coming to a neighborhood and opening up
a deli. A deli's not about hope. A theater is. But it's very hard
work, and I'm not sure there's enough of an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd like to think you would work this hard and there's a
guarantee that you'll be rewarded in the end, but I don't know
that's true,'' he said. ``Which is one reason we're so appreciative
of the support we do get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Girls meet at 6 p.m. before heading to Roberto's,
Dominick's, Mario's, Ann &AMP; Tony's or Rigoletto's for dinner. This
evening's repast, at Roberto's, with its pictures of Salerno on the
walls, began with a lesson in neighborhood demographics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a neighborhood like it always has been,'' said Mrs.
Mariano, who owns the building next door to the theater where Mrs.
Simioni and Mrs. Cristiano used to run a gift shop. ``It takes me
two hours to walk down the street because there's always someone
with something to say. But it's changing some. It's Italian, but
not Italian Italian, the way it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got Albanians. You've got Yugoslavs,'' said Mrs.
Cauterro, whose Bronx accent seems the most authoritative of the
four.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Mexicans,'' Mrs. Mariano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Asians,'' Mrs. Cauterro said.
</P>
<P>
   The old-timers are mostly staying put, and are so loyal that
Mrs. Cauterro's newly inaugurated e-mail address includes
arthurave. But attrition is a fact of life. Of the six Golden
Girls, only one, Mrs. Cristiano, whose husband, Nick, comes along
as a Golden Boy for a day, has a surviving spouse. And their
children have all left the neighborhood, most of them, like Mrs.
Cristiano's, for the suburbs (Great Neck) or points south or west
(Houston).
</P>
<P>
   So unlike some of the Hispanic or Asian theaters, catering to a
growing population base, the Belmont theater is fighting the
demographic tide.
</P>
<P>
   The theater is a godsend to the Golden Girls. Mrs. Mariano used
to go to Manhattan to see a movie or show or, years ago, to hear
Frank Sinatra sing at a hotel. Mrs. Cauterro used to belong to a
group of women who attended shows in the city and dinner theater
out in Westchester County. But Broadway is expensive and the trip
can be taxing, so a night at the Belmont is a special event for a
group whose tastes run from Italian opera (Mrs. Mariano) to Sinatra
(Mrs. Cauttero) to Barbra Streisand, Sinatra and Tony Bennett (Mrs.
Cristiano), to Paul Anka (Mrs. Diorio).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very good, and I like that it usually has a message,''
Mrs. Diorio said of the plays presented at the theater. ``Maybe you
don't know what it is at the time, but it makes you think.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinner rolled along. Mrs. Diorio and Cristiano discussed their
different experiences with Bell's palsy. There were discussions of
the generosity of the landlord, Lou Izzo, in supporting the
theater, and a request for a plug for a clothing store
(``specialists in cadets and portlys,'' reads one ad) that is owned
by Mrs. Cristiano's cousin, Vincent Borgese. They spoke in a
rapid-fire melange of Bronxese, sounding as much like men at a
poker game as women at leisure. But it was a particularly good
meal, and when Cristiano, a onetime prisoner of war in Japan,
chimed in about his recovery from a heart attack, he got a special
Golden Girl salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``To your heart,'' announced Mrs. Cauttero. ``May it beat
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   After dinner they walked back to the theater for the 8:30
performance. They milled around the lobby until Albertie ushered
the crowd of about 20 people into the theater with a firm,
``Subscribers and Golden Girls first.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear how things will ultimately turn out. The
audience, mostly people from the Bronx but including one man from
Staten Island, probably was not bad for a cold, rainy Thursday. But
it takes more than two dozen people a night to keep a theater
going.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception eight years ago, the theater has been a
critical success and has staged more than 60 classical and
contemporary plays. But this year it hit a financial wall and had
to cut back its five-show subscription program to two open-ended
productions in the Bronx and another in Manhattan. Nor did it help
that the latest production, ``Rockaway Boulevard,'' the story of a
luckless couple and a heartless hustler, received lackluster
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Belmont needs all the Golden Girls it can find, on
this night, as usual, it managed to please the ones it had. They
managed to stifle the urge to declaim or opine too loudly during
the performance but came away impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``True to life!'' said Ms. Diorio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it all!'' raved Mrs. Cristiano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent!'' reported Mrs. Mariano.
</P>
<P>
   They bade Albertie farewell, walked carefully down the steep
wooden staircase, popped open their umbrellas and headed down
Arthur Avenue toward home.  &QL;

COMMENTARY: DEADHEADS AND WARHEADS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I ran into the Russian reform party leader Grigory Yavlinsky in
Europe two weeks ago and asked him a simple question: ``Grigory,
when America wakes up from its impeachment nightmare, what kind of
Russia will we find?''
</P>
<P>
   He thought about that for a moment and said: ``You will find a
Russia that is even more of a threat to you than the Soviet Union.
Frankly, it's more of a threat to its own people. That's what I
care about. But it is also more of a threat to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky's point is a bit of an overstatement _ but not much.
Russia today is a threat because of its weakness, not its strength.
It is like a supertanker with a busted hull leaking rancid crude
oil all over the place. It is selling weapons to anyone with cash;
its most Dr. Strangelove-like scientists are putting themselves out
to the highest bidders; it can't afford to properly maintain and
safeguard its nuclear arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   So what to do? Well, all the unreconstructed Cold Warriors
around Washington are dying to declare that Russia's experiment
with democratization is over and we should go back to treating it
like the Soviet Union. There are so many people who miss the Cold
War, with its absolute-good-vs.-evil quality; they hunger for a
return of the Politburo. Frankly, I wish Russia were the Soviet
Union again; at least we knew how to deal with it. But it's not,
and pretending that it is only fosters the illusion that we can
just sit back, build an iron curtain around it and contain Russia's
weakness as we once contained its strength. Good luck. Try
containing a Russian technical college selling nuclear know-how to
Iran out of a Mafia-run Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is not the Soviet Union. It is just a big Albania _ an
experiment in democracy gone wrong, spewing out criminality,
weapons and unemployment in all directions. We can't afford to
ignore this Russia and we can't effectively contain it. In such a
messy situation we need to strip our policy down to the basics, and
that means focusing on two things: eliminating Russia's ``deadheads
and warheads.'' Russia needs to just start over, and American
policy, to the extent that it can, needs to help Moscow do just
that.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is slated to hold new parliamentary elections in
December. The Russian Parliament, or Duma, today is still dominated
by Communist deadheads, who live by the old Leninist motto that the
worse things are for Russia, the better they will be for
Communists. If we have learned anything from the past four years it
is that as long as the Duma is dominated by Communists it will be
impossible for any Russian president to put in place the basic
institutions to build a real foundation of reform. Russia needs
many things, but nothing is possible without a different Duma.
</P>
<P>
   The potential votes are there. As the Russian-American scholar
Leon Aron, author of the forthcoming biography ``Boris Yeltsin: A
Revolutionary Life,'' points out, in the 1996 presidential
elections Yeltsin beat the Communist Party leader, Gennady
Zyuganov, by a margin of roughly 4-to-1 among Russian voters under
age 25. The Communists dominated the over-60 crowd. The
demographics in Russia are on the side of reform.
</P>
<P>
   The West right now should focus on organizing forgiveness and a
restructuring of Russia's debts, to take the pressure off the
government of Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov so it can run a
credible budget that may begin to draw back some private
investment, stop the bleeding and provide a reasonably stable
environment for the December Duma elections. This is the only hope
for electing fewer deadheads and more reformers.
</P>
<P>
   On the strategic front, President Clinton should go to Moscow
immediately and vow that he will not leave until he has worked out
an arrangement for implementing the START II and proposed START III
nuclear treaties. Forget about a big ABM and missile-defense deal
right now. It's too complicated. Russia is ready to reduce from
7,500 nuclear warheads to 1,500, as part of the START process.
Let's do that now, and tell the Russians we'll pay for it all.
That's 6,000 warheads that might not end up in Iraq or on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know whether today's Russia is an infant American
revolution struggling up from communism, or a declining Weimar
Republic on a slippery slope to Fascism. I do know, though, that we
cannot afford to just watch, and we can make ourselves safer no
matter which way it goes by focusing on deadhead and warhead
elimination. If Clinton is looking for a national security legacy,
and not just a Social Security one, he should hop the next plane to
Moscow. (BOX)

<P>
   When Wal-Mart Stores proposed in 1990 building its first outlet
in Vermont, in the village of Williston, it started a fight that
turned ugly quickly. The Burlington Free Press ominously
editorialized about the ``New Jerseyification'' of the scenic
vacation town of 6,000 residents. The National Trust for Historic
Preservation declared the entire state of Vermont and its little
white-steepled towns ``endangered'' by suburban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   It took seven years of expensive battling before the store
finally opened. During the same time period, an effort to open an
outpost in nearby St. Albans was blocked by the Vermont
Environmental Board.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, Wal-Mart is no longer treated as an invader. The
company, the nation's largest retailer, opened its fourth outlet in
Vermont last month _ a new 70,000-square-foot store on the
outskirts of Berlin, about 30 miles southeast of Williston. Despite
complaints from preservationists and environmental groups, the
entire process _ from filing a permit to greeting the first
customers _ took little more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's quiet little victory in Vermont has been echoed
throughout the Northeast, where the retailer has lately been
mounting an aggressive expansion drive with little of the uproar
that accompanied its rocky start earlier in the decade.
</P>
<P>
   What is particularly significant about the latest Northeast push
is that most of the new stores are supercenters. Sprawling to as
much as 200,000 square feet, these vast emporiums offer not only
the apparel, housewares, and electronics available at most Wal-Mart
stores but also groceries, pharmaceuticals and extras like eyecare
and auto service.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they compete with a much more diversified range of
retailers than regular Wal-Marts. The average Wal-Mart supercenter
rings up about $55 million to $65 million in annual sales _ almost
double the volume of a regular Wal-Mart and seven times that of a
rival discounter like Ames Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   According to some analysts, Wal-Mart stands to triple its
supercenter presence in the region in the next two years alone _ an
expansion that could draw $3 billion more in annual sales from an
already crowded marketplace. To put this figure in perspective, it
exceeds the 1998 sales for any of the regional chains _ Ames,
Bradlees, Grand Union or Pathmark Stores.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Wal-Mart's expansion will undoubtedly mean more
opportunities for thrifty consumers and heightened rivalry among
the stores who want their business. ``Wal-Mart's expansion into the
Northeast is going to create a killer competitive environment and
an intense price war,'' predicted Burt Flickinger III, who has been
studying regional retail patterns for three decades and is now
managing director of Reach Marketing, a retail and marketing
consulting agency in Westport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Killer is the operative word. Flickinger says that not all the
chains can survive _ and he is not shy about calling the race. He
argues that Grand Union and the supermarket chains run by the Penn
Traffic Co., a company now in bankruptcy that has a significant
presence in eastern Pennsylvania, along with the retailers Ames and
Bradlees, are among those with ``questionable futures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Northeast is only so big, and since Wal-Mart is the winner
in worldwide retailing, it will be the winner here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As its competitors point out in defense of their own viability,
Wal-Mart is not exactly invisible in the Northeast even now. With
244 of its regular discount stores _ like those in Williston and
Berlin, Vt. _ as well as 28 supercenters, the retailer is already
familiar to many consumers in New England, New York, New Jersey and
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   But the chain is entering what Wal-Mart watchers call the
saturation phase in the Northeast. Dr. Kenneth Stone, an economist
with the University of Iowa and a student of the Wal-Mart
phenomenon, says that by its own standards, the retailer has barely
begun to establish a foothold in the region. Sam Walton, the
chain's founder, ``used to joke that he likes his stores so close
together that the managers compete against each other,'' Stone
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart typically provides few details of its expansion plans
for the year beyond an overall number of stores planned. This year
it announced it intends to build 150 supercenters and 40
normal-size discount stores nationwide. When asked about analysts'
projections, a Wal-Mart spokesman, Jay Allen, said that as of now
the company had plans to build only 15 supercenters in the
Northeast this year.
</P>
<P>
   The company, however, has always followed the same game plan
when it expands: Namely, it builds an enormous distribution center
and then constructs stores in concentric circles around it. So it
is easy to make plausible deductions about Wal-Mart's ambitions in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   In five of the last six years, the company has opened a major
warehouse in the Northeast. Its newest, in New Bedford, Pa., is the
first of its sites in the region that has the capacity to supply 75
supercenters. Flickinger estimates that 180 superstores will be
built within the area in the next five years and that as many as 33
may be built this year. Allen does acknowledge that the giant New
Bedford warehouse is currently operating far below capacity.
</P>
<P>
   And Wal-Mart is not likely to stop with another several dozen
supercenters in the Northeast. The retailer is building another
supercenter supply depot in Johnstown, N.Y., scheduled to open in
June 2000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What might Wal-Mart ultimately take to be an appropriate number
of supercenters for the Northeast? To get some idea of its
preferred supercenter-to-consumer ratio, consider that Arkansas,
its home state, with a population of 2.3 million, has 27
mega-outlets.
</P>
<P>
   The new stores are expected to be in neither urban nor suburban
areas, but in territories just beyond that. The retailer generally
prefers to put its stores in semirural areas so it can have large
spaces at low cost. Still, because such stores are typically built
at highway interchanges they will be easily accessible to large
swaths of the densely populated Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's play comes at a time when competition among clothing
discounters, its traditional competitors, has been heating up again
in the Northeast. Several retailers are seeking to grow by picking
up some of the pieces of Caldor, once a leading regional chain,
which announced last month that it was liquidating and putting its
145 valuable properties on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl's, a retail powerhouse from the Midwest, is competing for
32 of the Caldor stores on Long Island, which would transform the
company overnight into a major force in metropolitan New York. The
discounter Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., another Midwest
retailer that is rapidly building a nationwide presence, is also
said to be looking to buy several stores. Wal-Mart, meanwhile has
put in a bid for 13 of the Caldor stores (which are generally too
small for its standard store).
</P>
<P>
   Also suddenly looking for a bigger piece of the population-rich
Northeastern pie are the newly energized regional chains of
Bradlees, which just emerged from bankruptcy with a new
expansion-minded management team, and Ames, which acquired 150
Hills stores late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Discounters in the region say they are ready to meet the
challenge. Bradlees, which has only eight of its 102 stores in the
same market as Wal-Mart, might justifiably fear an escalation in
its conflict with the retailing leviathan. But Bradlees' chief
executive, Peter Thorner, appears sanguine. In markets where they
go head to head, he said, ``Wal-Mart takes only 6 to 8 percent of
sales from our stores and, even then, only in the first year of
competition.'' The minor downside, he said, is that ``we lose some
lower-margin products.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet the challenge, Bradlees has been focusing on more
stylish apparel and decorative items for the house, chic design
having never been a strong suit for no-nonsense Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ettore, chief executive of Ames stores, argues that for him
the battle with Wal-Mart is already over. ``Out of our 301 Ames
stores, 245 are within 10 to 12 miles of a Wal-Mart, and 165 are
within 3 miles,'' he said ``At this stage it is not about our
future survival. We already co-exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ettore's strategy, which has been widely hailed by analysts, is
to sell to consumers with family incomes of under $25,000, just
beneath the middle-income customers who are Wal-Mart's prime
target.
</P>
<P>
   With Wal-Mart opening more supercenters, grocery stores will
also face increased competition. ``It is going to put tremendous
pressure on grocery stores out there,'' said Stone, the University
of Iowa economist.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarket executives acknowledge that Wal-Mart is a threat.
``They are not benign,'' said Bob Tobin, president and chief
executive of Ahold U.S.A., the subsidiary of Royal Ahold NV, the
Dutch grocery giant that owns the New England-based Stop and Shop
chain. ``No one who is a student of this industry welcomes Wal-Mart
into their area.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent study of Wal-Mart's experience in Texas, Stone found
that three years after a supercenter opened, local grocery stores
had lost an average of 17 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Flickinger, the retailing consultant, argues that the Wal-Mart
effect can already be seen in Pennsylvania, where Wal-Mart has 19
supercenters, by far its greatest concentration in the region. Penn
Traffic, the long-troubled owner of several chains of groceries
stores, has shuttered 15 of its area Bi-Lo stores. ``There is no
doubt they became a competitive element in many many of our
districts,'' said Marc Jampole, a company spokesman. Still, he
declined to blame Wal-Mart. ``I don't think their opening was the
overriding factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Other supermarket executives say that they can go toe-to-toe
with Wal-Mart. Tobin of Ahold notes that in contrast to the
Midwest, the Northeast market for groceries has long been both
highly saturated and highly competitive. ``New England,'' he said,
``is not like a cornfield in Arkansas.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a sentiment echoed by Bernard Rogan, a spokesman for
Shaw's Supermarkets Inc, a subsidiary of J. Sainsbury PLC. He
believes the supercenters are an old idea _ Wal-Mart opened the
first of them 15 years ago _ and will not meet the needs of the
region's aging populace, who prefer more intimate shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw's has been shrinking the average size of its stores (down
to 58,000 square feet from 65,000) and expanding upscale offerings
like fresh seafood and meat, deli foods and ready-to-eat meals,
areas where it feels Wal-Mart does not compete well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the $3 billion in sales that Wal-Mart is expected to reap
from its Northeast expansion has got to come from somewhere. No
matter how much retailers contend they can compete, Wal-Mart is
clearly on the prowl. Supercenters will clearly change the
calculus. For example, Ames stands to lose older customers to
supercenters because they have pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Wal-Mart supercenters sell more apparel than their
regular stores because people drawn in by the promise of cheap
fruit and vegetables find themselves lured by Wal-Mart's store
designs to the clothing racks and toy areas.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Tobin of Ahold said, ``Many stores in the area that
thought they had weathered the original hit from Wal-Mart are going
to get hit again.''

RUSSIA TO PLAY KEY ROLE IN PEACE AGREEMENT FOR KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
 (fe) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMBOUILLET, France _ The broad shape of the peace deal that the
two sides in the Kosovo conflict are being compelled to accept
emerged on Monday, with Russia playing a key role in working to
persuade the Serbs to allow NATO-led peacekeepers on their
territory.
</P>
<P>
   French President Jacques Chirac said on Monday that the
Russians, traditionally an ally of the Serbs, had agreed that a
ground force in Kosovo was the best solution to stopping the
bloodshed in the separatist province and that Russian soldiers were
likely to be part of the deployment. ``The Russians accept it, and
I'm convinced they'd participate in it,'' Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov visited the
castle here where the Serbian and ethnic Albanian delegations have
been sequestered for nine days and said afterward that military
intervention would be ``discussed with Belgrade.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Slobodan Milosevic, the authoritarian
president of Yugoslavia. Serbia is the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia, and Kosovo is a province of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians, who have never before been so helpful to the West
on the long-running problem of dealing with Milosevic, pledged
their help on resolving the Kosovo issue last month when Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright visited Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, as the Saturday deadline for the
conclusion of the talks approaches, the Russians have promised to
sell to Milosevic the necessity of accepting the troops, a senior
European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians are working on the Yugoslavs and were asking for
a little more time,'' the diplomat said. ``The Belgrade leadership
needs to put some spin on this, but seems more or less resigned.''
</P>
<P>
   Acquiescence to the presence of troops on Yugoslav soil is part
of a basic tradeoff for the two sides that goes as follows, two
European diplomats close to the talks said: The ethnic Albanians
must drop their demand for a referendum on the status of Kosovo at
the end of the three-year interim period established by the peace
plan. At the same time, the Serbs must agree to a NATO-led
peacekeeping force, a proposition that they have vehemently opposed
on the grounds that it interferes with Serbia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's yes to NATO for the Serbs and no to a referendum for the
Albanians,'' one of the diplomats said. ``All the rest is
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspense for the next few days will be seeing how Milosevic
decides to maneuver and whether the ethnic Albanian delegation,
which has shown surprising unity, will accept the disappointment of
not being promised a referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to the two delegations here on Sunday, Albright said
she believed that the ethnic Albanians saw the peace plan as a
``good deal'' and were prepared to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's room for maneuvering was narrowed further on Sunday
from a quarter where he has sometimes found some comfort, the
European Union, according to the senior European diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   After a Paris meeting of European Union foreign ministers,
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said that all members of
the union had supported military enforcement of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   This is a signal to Milosevic that he cannot expect any
financial relief, which he needs for his desperate economy and has
sometimes received, from European Union countries, the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   For the ethnic Albanians, the insistence on a referendum after a
three-year period of autonomy was based on the understanding that a
referendum would result in a vote for independence, the long-held
goal of their resistance movement.
</P>
<P>
   European countries and the United States have opposed
independence for Kosovo _ where the people, 90 percent of whom are
ethnic Albanian, have been living under repressive Serbian rule.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who has written of his empathy
with the cause of the ethnic Albanians, visited the delegation here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell called the lack of a referendum in the peace agreement
a poor deal for the ethnic Albanians. He was also upset, he said,
that the peace plan required the ethnic Albanian rebel force, the
Kosovo Liberation Army, to dismantle, but allowed limited numbers
of Serbian police and the Yugoslav army to stay.
</P>
<P>
   During Albright's visit on Sunday, the Contact Group of six
nations _ the United States, four European countries, and Russia _
that is running the talks announced a deadline of midday Saturday
for completion.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remaining time appears to be a chance for Milosevic
to develop his ``spin,'' one of the diplomats said. By this he
meant the Yugoslav president needed to formulate some way to
explain to his people why he was accepting something he had opposed
so strongly and so long.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic, who manages the most relentless state-run
propaganda machines in Europe, has remained in power for the last
10 years as the Serbs have lost one war after another and the
promise of a greater Serbia has vanished in the reality of an ever
smaller Serbia.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A provision in the peace agreement that calls for the
demilitarization of the ethnic Albanian guerrilla force will give
Milosevic a ready-made way to explain why foreign troops are
necessary, one of the European diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can sell the international force by saying it would get rid
of the KLA,'' as the Kosovo Liberation Army is known, the diplomat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's army and security police have been fighting the
insurgents for a year and watched them grow from a handful of
poorly armed men to thousands of volunteers with increasingly
sophisticated weaponry.

BRITISH DISCOUNT RENEWED THREATS AGAINST RUSHDIE 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Despite calls from Iran over the weekend for the
10-year-old death sentence against Salman Rushdie to be carried
out, the British Foreign Office said Monday that it was confident
that the Iranian government was firmly committed to its repudiation
of the religious edict, or fatwa.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts in Iranian politics tended to discount the
renewed calls for the writer's death, saying they were a product of
conservative factions that are at odds with the Iranian government
and do not have the means to carry out their threats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the British government or the European Union had the
slightest doubt that Iran's intentions were anything but honorable,
they would be making an official protest right now,'' said Carmel
Bedford, a spokeswoman for Article 19, an anticensorship group.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to President Mohammad Khatami of Iran, widely
considered a reformer and a moderate, Ms. Bedford said, ``The fact
is that President Khatami has made it very clear that he wants the
rule of law to apply in Iran, and he's bringing about a huge change
in the way they conduct business there.'' Over the weekend, two
hardline Iranian groups used the 10th anniversary of the fatwa to
register their support of the campaign against Rushdie. The edict
was originally issued by the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. On Feb.
14, 1989, the ayatollah denounced Rushdie's ``Satanic Verses'' as a
blasphemous insult to Islam and appealed to ``all Muslims of the
world'' to collaborate in killing him.
</P>
<P>
   The Khordad Foundation, a semiofficial charity that has put a
$2.8-million bounty on Rushdie's head, said on Sunday that it was
still committed to his death. ``Surely, this verdict will be
implemented one day,'' the group said in a statement published in a
hard-line newspaper, Jomhuri Islami.
</P>
<P>
   A statement by the Revolutionary Guards, which has been divided
in supporting Khatami, accused the West of conducting a
``disinformation campaign to make world people and Muslims believe
that Iran has backed down from its stances toward the apostate
author Salman Rushdie.'' Rushdie, the group added, ``will
eventually be burnt in the fire of Muslims' wrath.''
</P>
<P>
   Such remarks fly in the face of official Iranian policy. In
September, Foreign Minister Kamal Kharazzi said in New York that
Iran was formally repudiating the fatwa. Britain responded by
agreeing to restore full diplomatic relations with Iran. The two
countries also said they would exchange ambassadors, although that
has not been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the continued clamor for Rushdie, there is no reason to
suspect that anything has changed since the agreement in September,
said an official at the British Foreign Office who insisted on
anonymity. ``We're confident that they remain committed to the
assurances they gave us,'' the official said. ``We work on the
basis of government-to-government relations, and we're convinced
that the Iranian government means what it says. You can't hold the
Iranian government responsible for every person who wants to make a
comment on Rushdie.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An expert in Middle East politics, who also insisted on
anonymity because he travels often to Iran and does not want to
jeopardize his access to information there, said the statements on
Sunday were an indication of conflict between moderate and
conservative factions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iran is a very complex political society, in which there are
all sorts of points of view vying for influence,'' the expert said.
``In a sense, the Rushdie issue is passe. The issues now are who's
been attacking intellectuals in Iran, and how that's going to be
dealt with. What you're seeing is a constant encroachment on the
power of conservative groups by the Khatami agenda. He's
consolidating power.''
</P>
<P>
   The expert called it ``a very hopeful sign'' that the government
recently announced that it had made a number of arrests in the
cases of several dissidents and writers who were slain or found
dead in mysterious circumstances. The government also said its
intelligence minister had been forced to resign, a sign that it was
cracking down on past repression.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how serious are the threats to Rushdie, experts say
that the Iranian government's threat had been the most serious and
that when it officially withdrew its support for the edict last
year, the author's burden was considerably lessened.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal made at the United Nations in September between the
ministers of the U.K. and Iran was made at the highest level, with
complete backing from the highest echelons of government in Iran
and with the backing of the European Union,'' Ms. Bedford said.
</P>
<P>
   But threats do remain, friends of Rushdie said. Among other
aspects, he is still under the protection of bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't mean there's been a 100 percent solution,'' said
a friend who knows about Rushdie's situation. ``It was a very big
step. But we were led to believe that all parts of the Iranian
state had signed up for the agreement. Until it's been demonstrated
that that's true, the deal has some holes in it.''

CHIRAC WILL PRESS CLINTON TO END IRAQ EMBARGO 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PARIS _ President Jacques Chirac of France hopes to make headway
with President Clinton this week on French proposals to lift the
oil embargo against Iraq if it will allow international inspections
of its weapons programs to resume, he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Saddam Hussein, in my eyes, is responsible for all
the miseries of the Iraqi people,'' Chirac told American
correspondents here in advance of his planned meeting with Clinton
in Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``The more the population suffers, the more it
rallies to Saddam Hussein and strengthens him.''
</P>
<P>
   France opposed the British and American bombing of Iraq late
last year for its refusal to cooperate with U.N. arms inspections.
It hopes to get the U.N. Security Council to approve a new plan to
lift restrictions on the amount of oil Iraq can sell abroad if its
leadership will agree to a new system of permanent monitoring of
sites that could be used to make or store weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   As French officials explain the proposal, sophisticated outside
monitoring of what Iraq does with the revenues from oil sales, plus
television and satellite monitoring of the weapons sites, would
provide effective warning of any new attempts to buy or manufacture
components for nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Chirac and others say, any controls would be more
effective than none _ and now there are none inside Iraq. U.N.
inspectors pulled out before the bombing, and Saddam has refused to
let them back in.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has rejected lifting the embargo. Continuing
international pressure could encourage Iraqi opposition groups in
exile or inside the country to rise up and overthrow Saddam, the
United States contends, but as Chirac sees it, that is just wishful
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of Saddam Hussein is easily said, but very
difficult to do,'' he said. But if the international community made
clear it would let Iraq import more medicine, food and other
necessities if Saddam agreed to a new system of arms controls, the
Baghdad government might feel more pressure to go along with them,
Chirac contended.
</P>
<P>
   Both French and American military officials fear that the longer
the current impasse continues, with American and British warplanes
bombing Iraqi air defense sites almost daily, the greater the risk
that eventually an American plane could be shot down and the crew
lost or taken prisoner, bringing on a new international diplomatic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington on Monday, James Foley, a spokesman for the State
Department, said Department officials had not yet seen the text of
Chirac's remarks, and thus were unable to address them
specifically.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ``Our view has been, and continues to be,
that Iraq must comply fully with U.N. Security Council resolutions
before the embargo can be lifted.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chirac's personal relationship with Clinton has been warm
despite disagreements between the two countries on getting approval
from the U.N. Security Council before going ahead with strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said he did not think that either the United States as an
actor on the world scene or Clinton personally had been gravely
hurt by his impeachment and his acquittal by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any weakening,'' Chirac said. ``On the
international stage, President Clinton has a good image, of someone
who is likable, intelligent, cultivated, and has good judgment. All
this means that President Clinton's authority has not been shaken
at the international level.''
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also played down the significance of recent criticism of
American ``hyperpower'' by Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and
other French officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``From time to time there are irritations, just as in any big
family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac has recently been calling for stronger international
representation in the International Monetary Fund and other
international institutions to make sure that Europe and other
regions continue to be heard despite America's dominant position in
world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has long been obvious to me that Europe should take more
responsibility for its own defense,'' he said of French successes
in getting Britain and Germany to join it in working out
arrangements for an independent European role within the NATO
alliance. ``What we don't want to do is create tensions with the
United States.''

 &HT;    CLINTON SAYS MEXICO SHOULD NOT BE ``PENALIZED'' FOR DRUG EFFORTS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico Endorsing Mexico as a courageous if imperfect
ally in the high-stakes drug war, President Clinton said Monday
this country ''should not be penalized'' for its shortcomings, but
rather encouraged for its progress.
</P>
<P>
   The comments, coming just two weeks before Clinton must decide
whether to certify to Congress that Mexico is doing its best to
thwart the flow of narcotics into the U.S. border, signalled that
he intends to give its counter-drug efforts a passing grade despite
serious deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexico should not be penalized for having the courage to
confront its problems,'' Clinton said during a daylong summit with
Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo in this semi-tropical center of
commerce and tourism on Mexico's Yucatan peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ten years ago, our relationship was marred by distrust,'' said
Clinton, speaking in a 91-year-old theater decorated with the flags
of both nations. ''We have increased our cooperation,'' in the drug
war, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, for his part, pledged that Mexico would ''make every
effort. . .to keep up the fight against drugs until we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Meeting for their tenth time, the two leaders signed a series of
low-octane agreements meant to underscore cross-border cooperation
and paper over areas of contention between the neighbors, which
share a 2,000-mile-long border and will do nearly $200 billion in
two-way trade this year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. drug authorities remain largely dissatisfied, for instance,
with the corruption and inefficiency plaguing anti-drug efforts in
Mexico through which passes more than half of the estimated $50
billion worth of illicit drugs that pour into the United States
each year.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, however, the two leaders could agree only on a new
regime for monitoring advances and setbacks in the war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Bi-National Performance Measures of Effectiveness
announced Monday is a largely symbolic agreement on a set of goals
the two countries adopted nearly two years ago, when Clinton went
to Mexico City to declare that the two countries had entered into a
formal alliance in the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Zedillo also signed agreements meant to widen
cooperation and competition among U.S. and Mexican airlines, which
last year ferried some 14 million passengers across the two
countries' borders.
</P>
<P>
   Other agreements Clinton and Zedillo signed Monday are designed
to:
</P>
<P>
   Enhance cooperation between U.S. and Mexican law enforcement
officials to combat lawlessness along the border and to prevent
criminals on one side from seeking safe harbor on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   Provide Mexico with a $4 billion line of credit with the U.S.
Import-Export bank to help fund the construction of infrastructure
projects like roads, water systems and bridges and large-scale
U.S.-Mexican commercial ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Advance U.S.-Mexican cooperation in preventing the spread of
tuberculosis, a major health problem in Mexico, which reports some
11,000 new cases per year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements constituted modest measures, though, in a summit
whose main purpose was to lessen friction between the two countries
over the most contentious issue between them: drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted that he had not decided whether to certify that
Mexico was cooperating fully with U.S. anti-drug efforts. His
comments, however, suggested that he would support Mexico. American
presidents have done so for each of the past dozen years, despite
congressional criticism that Mexico should be doing more..
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is how can we do better to deal with the drug
problem,'' Clinton told reporters just before meeting with Zedillo
at the 17th Century ''Hacienda Temozon'' _ translated, ``whirlwind
plantation'' _ now a hotel 22 miles south of town. ''Neither
country has won the drug war.''
</P>
<P>
   Hailing what he called ''a new season of friendship,'' between
the giant if disparate neighbors, Clinton laid out the case that
cross-border cooperation in combating drugs has been steadily
improving for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Unspoken but clearly implied was the corollary message: failing
to certify Mexico as a fully cooperative partner in the drug war, a
move that would trigger economic sanctions, would risk shattering
the foundations of the bilateral relationship that has produced
wanted gains.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not long ago, we could not have had a conversation about drugs
without falling into an unwinnable argument about who is to
blame,'' Clinton said, speaking to some 1,400 government officials,
executives and human rights workers from this city of ancient oaks,
stuccoed villas, narrow streets and 800,000 people. ''We can talk
candidly about this now, because we have started to speak the same
language.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the controversial congressionally-mandated certification
process, the administration must annually evaluate the
</P>
<P>
   anti-drug programs of several dozen countries that are major
producers or distributors of cocaine, heroin, marijuana or other
illicit drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The process is an attempt by Congress to force other countries
to work to help curb trafficking into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that are not certified are subject to immediate loss
of most U.S. economic assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has long resented the process. Privately, Mexican
diplomats view it as one in which a wealthy country whose drug use
is driving the scourge of narco-crime and corruption is sitting in
judgment of the anti-drug efforts of a far poorer country.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo stressed again on Monday that combatting drugs is not a
job that can be done by any single country, nor can a lone
scapegoat be singled out for blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a struggle to be fought by all nations,'' said
Zedillo. ''We will only win if we work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has tried in recent years to reduce the friction the
annual certification process injects into a relationship already
complicated by enormous trade, economic, historic and cultural
ties.
</P>
<P>
   He made the case Monday that those ties can bring the two
countries closer together, if differences are resolved through a
dialogue based on respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are more than neighbors,'' said Clinton, as hundreds of
Merida's residents, young and old, lined the narrow streets outside
the Peon Contreras Theater, waiting beneath sunny skies to catch a
glimpse of the presidential motorcade.
</P>
<P>
   ''More and more, we belong to the same American family,'' he
said. ''What binds us together is far, far more important than what
divides us.''

FORMER MILITARY RULER WINS NIGERIAN PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By NORIMITSU ONISHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ Pledging to make Nigeria ``great again,''
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, who earned international esteem by becoming
Nigeria's first military leader to give up power voluntarily, won
the nomination of the country's leading political party Monday as
its presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo's selection by the People's Democratic Party set the
stage for his return to the position he held 20 years ago, this
time as a democratically elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``My joy knows no bounds,'' the retired general said in an
acceptance speech at the end of a contentious convention in Jos, a
city in central Nigeria. ``I will devote all my energy and all the
powers available to me to the service of Nigeria and humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   His chief rival, Alex Ekwueme, a former vice president during a
brief period of civilian rule in the early 1980s, stood behind the
general, offering his congratulations and support in the Feb. 27
elections.
</P>
<P>
   From 1976 to 1979, Obasanjo, 61, served as Nigeria's military
president and became the only general to leave office voluntarily
since Nigeria's independence from Britain in 1960. Over the years,
he has become an elder statesman in Nigeria, respected in Africa
and in the West, and was even considered for the position of U.N.
secretary general a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he was arrested and jailed with several others on
charges of plotting a coup against Gen. Sani Abacha, whose ruinous
rule ended only with his sudden death last June. After Abacha's
successor, Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar, released Obasanjo and pledged
an end to military rule, many inside and outside Nigeria pressed
him to run for the presidency, viewing him as the only man capable
of keeping the military in check and of navigating the treacherous
ethnic and religious waters in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   So when he declared his candidacy under a scorching sun in early
November on his farm not far from Lagos, Obasanjo immediately
became the front-runner in the race for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Nigerian has a stake in the survival and prosperity of
the country,'' Obasanjo said during a news conference that day.
``This stake should be recognized. No section or group should be
made to feel disenfranchised or alienated.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, though, criticisms began to be leveled at him.
Even as he delivered that speech, Wasiuogunseye Kunle, a
20-year-old supporter, held a billboard that was a reminder that
Obasanjo, though trusted by the northern military elite, is
disliked by his own people, the Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the past be forgiven; the future is ours to conquer,''
read Kunle's sign, a reference to the fact that many Yoruba believe
that he betrayed them in 1979 by deciding a close presidential
election in favor of a northerner.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, Obasanjo's party lost the local and statewide
elections in the last two months in his districts; his party even
lost the election in the general's own ward in Otta, about 25 miles
north of Lagos. The general also suffered from the widespread
anti-military mood in the country and the perception that he was
backed by powerful generals.
</P>
<P>
   Given those negatives, Ekwueme emerged as a credible
alternative, a civilian with a clean image, a member of the
southeastern Ibo ethnic group, which has strongly supported the
People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because of bitter disagreements, the party's leaders postponed
the primaries twice and began the weekend convention, scheduled to
start on Saturday, on Sunday evening. But by then, Obasanjo had
locked up enough votes _ more than two-thirds of the 2,500
delegates _ to win easily over Ekwueme and several other
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The All People's Party, which is strongest in the north, and the
Alliance for Democracy, which is essentially a Yoruba party of the
southwest, have also chosen southerners as their flagbearers. They
are expected to present a common presidential candidate in an
effort to challenge the People's Democratic Party, and it is likely
they will intensely court the Ibo, who had strongly backed Ekwueme.

CREDIT SUISSE TO BUY WARBURG PINCUS ASSET MANAGEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Credit Suisse Group announced Monday that it would acquire
Warburg Pincus Asset Management Inc. for $650 million, a move that
allows the asset management arm of Credit Suisse to expand its
sales of mutual funds and retirement investment products in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is expected to close this summer following
regulatory approvals, allows Warburg, Pincus &AMP; Co. to focus on its
venture capital and private equity business by shedding the $22
billion asset management arm that has grown explosively during the
last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   It also continues a trend of banks and larger institutional
firms buying smaller asset managers and boutique fund companies
with strong retail distribution networks and brand recognition
among individual investors, while also giving Warburg Pincus Asset
Management more resources to compete worldwide against larger
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition basically fills in almost any missing piece
we might have had,'' said William Priest, chief executive of Credit
Suisse Asset Management in North America and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The deal will not cause changes for shareholders in Warburg
Pincus funds, and it is not expected to lead to any layoffs because
there is little overlap between the two firms, Priest said.
</P>
<P>
   With close to $40 billion under management in the United States,
Credit Suisse Asset Management has only $12 billion in mutual
funds. In comparison, Warburg Pincus manages about $10 billion in
mutual funds. Worldwide, Credit Suisse Group manages about $680
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The two firms established a joint venture last summer with each
company using the other to help sell its products in the United
States and abroad. After several months, executives of the two
firms decided that they were a good fit and began to think about a
merger, Priest said. No other firms bid for Warburg Pincus Asset
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all seen the powerful impact of global trends in the
financial services business,'' said Lionel Pincus, chief executive
of Warburg Pincus &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund industry consultant in
Philadelphia, predicts that the deal could lead Credit Suisse to
make another purchase in the United States. ``With the acquisition
of Warburg Pincus, they finally have a brand name and a
high-profile player in the marketplace. It's not big enough to make
Credit Suisse a major player in the mutual funds arena, but it
certainly gives them a respectable presence,'' Greenwald said.
``For Warburg, it takes them out of the category of being a
relatively small swimmer in a big pool up against the Putnams and
Fidelitys and Citigroups of the world. To be a global player, you
need pretty deep pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Warburg Pincus acquisition follows a string of deals that
have seen larger institutional firms acquire smaller asset managers
with well-known brand names and strong retail distribution
channels, including Mellon Bank Corp.'s acquisition of Founders
Asset Management Inc., and J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co.'s purchase of a 45
percent stake in American Century Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, Credit Suisse will pay $450 million
at closing and up to another $200 million over three years if
Warburg Pincus meets certain financial targets. Analysts said that
at roughly 3 percent of assets under management, the price is in
line with what similar firms have sold for recently.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, Credit Suisse will also acquire a 19.9
percent stake in Warburg, Pincus &AMP; Co. for undisclosed terms. The
New York-based firm, which has more than $7 billion in private
equity investments and an additional $5 billion in uncommitted
capital, has investments in more than 100 companies, including BEA
Systems Inc. and Covad Communications Group Inc.

COMMENTARY: SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The system worked, we are told. Yes, our stable country
and its constitutional institutions handled a year of political
stress as few societies could.
</P>
<P>
   But before we smother in self-congratulation, we should face a
reality. The Clinton saga has left the system wounded. The
presidency, the office on which we stake so much, is newly
vulnerable. Bill Clinton's successors will be at risk unless the
wounds are healed.
</P>
<P>
   The first necessity is to protect future presidents from private
civil lawsuits while they are in office. That is, we must correct
the folly of the Supreme Court's 1997 decision in the Paula Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jones' damage claim, the unanimous court said, would be
``highly unlikely to occupy any substantial amount'' of Clinton's
time. Only judges with no experience of modern litigation, with its
consuming discovery process, could have said that. The Jones
lawsuit led to events that dominated the president's life, and
ours, for a year.
</P>
<P>
   It does not matter whether one believes Ms. Jones' story that
Clinton as governor of Arkansas propositioned her. She adduced no
evidence of damage, the trial judge found, except that she got no
flowers on Secretary's Day. But her lawsuit had large resources
behind it, provided by conservative organizations.
</P>
<P>
   What an inviting way to harass any future president: Find a
plaintiff, pour money into the case, demand that the president be
deposed. Hardly any politician, or any human being, is so perfect
that some long-ago excuse for suing him or her cannot be found.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is unlikely to admit its mistake. But Congress
could pass a statute providing that any private civil action
against the president be suspended until he or she leaves office.
That may be impossible to pass while Bill Clinton is there,
feelings being what they are. But I think Congress may well act to
protect the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The other great injury of the last year has been to a
president's confidential relationships. All of us expect to be able
to talk with friends and colleagues in confidence. It is hard to
imagine living with the sense that anything you said might be found
out by a relentless prosecutor. But that is where Kenneth Starr's
pursuit of Clinton has left the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Starr succeeded in piercing the lawyer-client privilege,
recognized by courts for centuries as a way of assuring people that
they can talk freely in confidence to their lawyers. He argued
successfully that White House counsel, because they are government
employees, could not resist his demand for testimony about what the
president had said to them.
</P>
<P>
   If that precedent sticks, any future president would be well
advised to retain a private lawyer from the day he takes office.
Who knows when he will need to talk, with the bark off, about some
political lawsuit or other trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have to talk in confidence not only to lawyers in the
White House but to other staff members. Some of them were
questioned by Starr's prosecutors, too. Courts rejected their
claims of executive privilege _ rightly, but the precedent
introduces a new strain in the work of the White House staff.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Secret Service. Starr demanded that members of
the detail that protects the president testify about what they saw
and heard while on duty. He won in the courts, but at what cost to
the stress on a president? Former President Bush, among others,
said it was a bad idea to force the agents to testify.
</P>
<P>
   All the intrusions on the privacy of discussion in the White
House were justified by Starr as essential to obtain vital evidence
of serious crimes. Did the forced testimony of White House aides
and Secret Service agents actually produce anything of
significance? Not that I know of.
</P>
<P>
   In Shakespeare's ``Henry V,'' the king muses before the battle
of Agincourt about how his people look to him for everything.
``Upon the king!'' he says, ``Let us our lives, our souls, our
debts, our careful wives, our children and our sins lay on the
king!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we seem to treat the modern presidency that way,
expecting the president to solve everything. It is a job to daunt
the best of human beings, and it should not have to bear extra
burdens.

VIETNAMESE IMMIGRANTS PROTEST HANGING OF HO CHI MINH POSTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Calif. _ In an increasingly tense standoff here
between the First Amendment and memories of war, hundreds of
Vietnamese immigrants on Monday blocked the entrance of a video
store where the owner wanted to re-hang a poster of Ho Chi Minh.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of police officers, wearing riot helmets and carrying
batons and plastic shields, stood in a long line of silence as the
protesters, saying they would rather die than allow the poster to
go up, shouted ``Democracy'' and ``Freedom.'' Fearing that the
demonstration might turn violent, the police persuaded the shop
owner, Troung Van Tran, 37, who is also a Vietnamese immigrant,
into staying away from the store Monday. But Tran's wife, Kim, said
in a brief telephone interview, ``we're going to do it another
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Tran's First Amendment right to hang the poster of
the former North Vietnamese president and a Vietnamese flag was
affirmed by an Orange County Superior Court judge, who last month
ordered the items taken down, pending a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Tran, who came to the United States from his native Vietnam in
1980, put up the poster and the flag on Jan. 18, to, he says,
generate dialogue and healing within the Vietnamese immigrant
community. But as word quickly spread that he had put the poster up
in his tiny video shop in a strip mall here, hundreds of his former
countrymen and their families rallied in front of his store,
Hi-Tek, demanding that the picture be taken down.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as many as 600 demonstrators, many waving tiny orange
and yellow flags of South Vietnam, began gathering at the store
well before 9 a.m. Tran had said he would reopen his shop at 10
a.m., but he never showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Donny Tran, who is not related to the shop owner, arrived the
night before and slept in a homemade replica of a cage used to hold
prisoners of war in Vietnam. ``We forgot about the communist,''
Tran said, ``then he put up his flag and I remember my nightmare, I
remember how my father die.''
</P>
<P>
   At Hi-Tek's entrance, a group of about 20 women and small
children sat on the ground, waving flags and vowing not to move.
``These ladies,'' one of them said, ``say they will die here if
they have to. They risked their lives to be here in this country,
so this is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Lt. Bill Lewis said the authorities were negotiating with
the protesters and with Tran about how to proceed in the coming
days since both sides say they will not give up. ``The bottom line
is,'' Lewis said, ``that we have to maintain the peace and Mr.
Tran's First Amendment rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters said they cherished freedom of speech, but
that Tran was abusing it. ``He doesn't know how to use his rights
wisely,'' a speaker bellowed through a public address system, ``so
he doesn't deserve to have any rights at all.''  &QL;

MODERATE REPUBLICANS VOW TO BE HEARD IN CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Conn., Wis., Minn., N.J., Ind. ) (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since Republicans won control of Congress in 1994,
the party's conservative leaders have treated Republican moderates
like poor cousins _ patiently tolerated but frequently ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Now these moderates, concerned that impeachment has tarnished
their party, and them, are vowing to play a more forceful role in
Congress this year, demanding that the party take pragmatic stands
on issues like abortion, education, taxes and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceived as the most dogmatic, I mean conservative,
are opening their minds to us out of necessity,'' said Rep. Brian
P. Bilbray, a moderate Republican from San Diego. ``They realize
their agenda is not going to move without us.''
</P>
<P>
   Moderates have made pronouncements like that in the past, only
to buckle under pressure from conservatives. But they contend their
hand is stronger this year for several reasons. One is the election
of Rep. Dennis J. Hastert, R-Ill., widely viewed as a pragmatist,
as House speaker. Another is the Republicans' slim five-vote
majority in the House, which will require the leadership to woo
moderate Republicans, or conservative Democrats, to pass
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather we had a larger majority, but for the short term,
it helps us,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who often votes with
the moderates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Republicans of all stripes are saying that the
party must prove it is about more than impeachment. That will
require moving toward the center and passing substantive
legislation on health care, education and taxes, the moderates
contend.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, Republicans aren't terribly popular in many
parts of the country,'' said Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., who
represents the moderates in House leadership meetings.
``Impeachment has exacerbated that problem. The pressure is on the
Republican Congress to produce, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David M. McIntosh, a leading Republican conservative from
Indiana, agreed that conservatives see a need to talk more with
moderates. ``On the social issues, there are big differences of
opinions,'' he said. ``But people understand that when you have a
narrow margin, you can't have everything you want, so let's work
through those issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But the limits of the moderates' influence were made clear last
week when the House leadership won passage of a bill that would
make it easier to kill legislation that is considered expensive to
business, typically environmental or health and safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates, who mustered 34 votes against the measure,
were angry that the leadership had chosen that bill to be one of
the first passed by the House this year. ``It sets the wrong
tone,'' said a top aide to one moderate Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the first weeks of the 106th Congress, the moderates
in both houses have asserted themselves on several major issues.
Most prominently, all five Republican senators who voted against
both articles of impeachment last week were moderates from the
Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   But the impact of the moderates is more likely to be felt in the
House, which has been the more polarized and partisan chamber in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting of House Republicans two weeks ago, for instance,
moderates insisted that there be fewer floor fights over abortion.
Such battles blocked passage of budget bills last year and,
moderates say, made the Republicans look like ideologues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody agrees there are legitimate differences in the
conference over abortion,'' said Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, a moderate
Republican from Connecticut. ``But you don't have to have them come
to the floor 45 times. There was agreement on that.''
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives said they have agreed to limit votes on
anti-abortion bills this year, though they plan to push for
legislation banning a procedure they call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   House moderates, led by Ms. Johnson, are also pushing an
alternative to a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed by
House conservatives. The moderates argue that the 10 percent plan
will favor the wealthy and reduce revenues that could be used to
shore up the Social Security and Medicare programs.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates are calling for smaller, more specific cuts, and
many Republicans say they may have won enough support to block the
10 percent plan.
</P>
<P>
   Moderates say they have also won assurances from the leadership
that the party's education agenda will include initiatives for
public schools, and not just for private education. One moderate
proposal calls for increasing federal aid to programs for disabled
students.
</P>
<P>
   And moderates say they expect the leadership to allow fewer
votes on bills intended to roll back environmental protections, an
issue that perennially divides moderate and conservative
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ideology is part of what is motivating the moderates to assert
themselves. But so is self-preservation. ``You can't look at the
current numbers and be calm,'' said Rep. Amo Houghton, a Republican
moderate from Corning, N.Y., referring to the Republicans' low
approval ratings in many polls. ``Fear rather than love is the
greatest motivator there is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many moderates contend that the Republicans who are most likely
to suffer political damage from the impeachment ordeal are not
those from conservative districts but rather those from moderate
swing districts _ like Bilbray in California, Michael P. Forbes
from Long Island and Bob Franks from Union, N.J. Several moderate
Republican senators from the Northeast are also considered
vulnerable by strategists in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interesting thing about impeachment is that the true
believers on impeachment come from districts where they will not
pay any price for their strong feelings,'' said Steve Gunderson, a
former congressman from Wisconsin who is now executive director of
the Main Street Partnership, a policy group for moderate
Republicans. ``The people who will pay the price are those in
moderate districts, no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews last week, conservatives and moderates said there
was general agreement between both wings of the party to find
common ground on major issues so that Republicans would have a list
of achievements to show voters in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We share many of the conservatives' views on having smaller
government and more individual freedom,'' said Rep. Christopher
Shays, a moderate Republican from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   But many Democrats, and some Republicans, questioned whether the
moderates would be willing to buck their leadership on major
issues. Last year, many moderate House Republicans were clearly
uncomfortable with impeachment, but in the end, only five voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
   One of those five, King, asserted that pro-impeachment
conservatives tried, unsuccessfully, to prevent him from getting
the chairmanship of a subcommittee this year. King said that if the
party did not put the impeachment wars behind it, Republicans would
lose in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to show we are a national governing party,'' he said,
``not a regional party, not a party of hit men.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Washington may be in denial
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The very same prophets who this time last year pronounced Bill
Clinton a goner have spent the last few days analyzing what will
come in the aftermath of his acquittal. They see a future
comforting to their own bruised sense of worth.
</P>
<P>
   Moral decline in the country at large is forecast to accelerate
due to the bad example set by the president _ suitable punishment
for a nation that ignored the prophets last year. Washington,
meanwhile, is seen as returning to the same smug neighborhood it
was before that troublesome Clinton couple moved in.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that public disgust with the impeachment year might
generate a big turnover in the next congressional elections is
being discounted both by Republican strategists, who have reason to
hope it won't be so, and Democrats, who want to hedge their bets.
</P>
<P>
   All these predictions have the classic earmarks of capital
self-denial. Within the Beltway it is hard to see this or admit it,
but the most obvious impact of the impeachment year is the profound
toll it has taken on the prestige of Washington itself.
</P>
<P>
   The nation flatly refused to follow the lead of the capital at
the onset of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and stampede Clinton out
of office, and most Americans appear to feel no worse now for
having done so. They will be that much less likely to take their
cue from Washington when the next big question comes up.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the president's self-absorbed dalliance, and the
obsessive effort to run him out of office over it, have testified
more eloquently than the collected works of Newt Gingrich to how
superfluous Washington has become. If it can take a year off for
this, Washington really isn't as big a deal as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   What the Georgia General Assembly does about health care,
transportation and taxes will have a more immediate impact on the
lives of most Georgians than what Congress will accomplish this
year, hands down. Washington still doles out a lot of money, but
you don't need 24-hour cable to cover that.
</P>
<P>
   Inside Washington the question is always whether an outcome
hurts one party or the other. This one hurts both.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome in the next election, Democrats and
Republicans come away from the impeachment year more vulnerable to
decline in their ranks and to competition from newer, more vigorous
movements.
</P>
<P>
   One unforeseen outcome of the impeachment year may be to sharpen
regional rivalries. This wasn't seen as a sectional battle in the
South or Midwest. But many in the Northeast saw it as an attempt by
Southern Bible-thumpers to take over the government. Underneath
that simplistic attitude lies considerable resentment toward the
Sun Belt's increasing political power, and it may point toward more
friction in the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's an easy bet to predict moral decline, but at the end of
this impeachment saga, some words should be said in defense of the
oft-maligned American public.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many representations, many Americans held passionate
opinions over the past year, which they expressed in an avalanche
of e-mail, letters and calls to Capitol Hill and their local
newspapers. In the vast majority of cases, they have spoken calmly
and acted civilly toward those they disagreed with. There was no
national ``Jerry Springer Show'' over this.
</P>
<P>
   The overall concern for most Americans was the good of the
country at large and the integrity of its institutions, whatever
their partisan leanings.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the citizens of this country have acted with more
caution, judgment and maturity than their leaders in Washington.
Maybe they're not declining so fast after all.

 &HT;    Fundraising for Salt Lake Olympics takes off at Super Show
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year ago, Gary Johnson sat in a booth at the Super
Show in Atlanta and quickly settled into the routine of spitting
out the same answer to a common trivia question. The Nagano
Olympics were going on, and most of the 100,000 people attending
the world's largest sporting-goods trade show didn't have a clue
where the next Winter Games was.
</P>
<P>
   This year, they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me see _ how can I say this?'' asked Johnson, the manager
of advertising and promotions for the Salt Lake Organizing
Committee. ``On the one hand, you couldn't have bought that kind of
publicity, but it's with negative overtones, so that's not been
good. But I no longer have to approach people and tell them the
Games are in Salt Lake. They already know.''
</P>
<P>
   He and the other smiling staff members at the spiffy wood-frame
display in the middle of the Georgia Dome on Monday handed out
press releases about their new leader Mitt Romney, recruited after
a scandal that found that SLOC officials had made secret payments
and lavished gifts on International Olympic Committee members.
</P>
<P>
   Romney was hired Thursday, the day before the marketing staff
began lobbying sporting-goods makers to put the bright
blue-orange-and-yellow snowflake motif on apparel and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who's stopped by our booth, the licensees included,
really seem to understand the situation,'' Johnson said. ``And
they're sincere in their discussions that we have taken care of the
problem and taken the high road, and we're moving this along. They
understand there are bumps in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Salt Lake aims to raise about 4 percent of its $1.45 billion
budget _ roughly $51 million dollars _ from the sales of licensed
products. In Atlanta, that meant T-shirts and baseball hats. In
Utah, it means limited-edition skis and snowboards, fleece vests
and $1,500 leather jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technical outerwear'' is the industry jargon for the
heavy-duty apparel, but it's done with a twist. Native American
imagery is a recurring theme. Heavy knitted sweaters are fables in
wool, with symbols of seagulls, sego lillies and mountains that
hearken to local legends.
</P>
<P>
   This marketing effort employs a good bit more subtlety, a word
not often used to describe most of the flashy merchandise that
still can be found on Atlanta sales racks. Anderson pointed out a
silk tie with pictograms similar to the ancient paintings found in
caves in southern Utah. The 2002 logo can't be detected unless you
look closely.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the biggest difference from 1996 will be the Salt Lake
mascot, unveiled later this spring. It won't be another Whatizit,
Anderson promised. The mascot ``will be very unique, driven by the
contrast between our mountains and deserts,'' he said. ``The story
around it will be inherent to our part of the country, so it
completely makes sense.''

IN NEW ORLEANS `CITIES OF THE DEAD,' ANTIQUE CEMETERY ART IS
DISAPPEARING
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ On an atmospherically moody day, with rain
dripping off the muscadine vines and a concerto by Respighi wafting
through the living room, Peter Patout, an antiques dealer, was
cosseted in the splendor of his Bourbon Street home. There amid
Paris porcelain and ancestral oils in gilt frames, he gave his
version of the insidious crime that has made him one of the most
talked-about men in the city: conspiring to steal cemetery
ornaments from hallowed tombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thieves are in jail,'' said Patout, a descendant of sugar
planters, who is currently out on bail. ``I've been arrested four
times. Would you like some Patout sugar in your coffee?''
</P>
<P>
   Around New Orleans, there is the smell of a rat amid the scent
of sweet olive. It was in Patout's secluded courtyard, lush with
banana trees of deep Louisiana lineage, that detectives seized two
funerary statues, including a $50,000 marble Madonna. The New
Orleans police say they were part of a cache of more than 200 _ and
counting _ romantically patinated urns, angels and Blessed Mothers
plundered by thieves last year from the above-ground marble tombs
and granite sarcophagi that populate New Orlean's legendary
``cities of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, which started small, with four arrests in
April, has implicated respected antiques dealers who police say
were operating a ring that stole cemetery artifacts to sell to
passionate collectors who pay thousands of dollars for moss-covered
garden ornaments and benches with evocative rust. The police have
recovered statuary valued at more than $1 million, and they say
that is only one-tenth of the booty. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation has entered the case, which has moved on to Los
Angeles and may soon include New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even in this Gothic-appreciative city, where gossip unfolds like
drapery and Anne Rice is a tourist industry, the dark specter of
grave robbers cruising the city's historic cemeteries with hammers
and chisels has sent a shudder through the town.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans, that liveliest of cities, holds its 31 historic
graveyards dear. It is a place where a literary journal is named
Exquisite Corpse, where tombs have their own audio tours and a bus
stop is named Cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts tap into two New Orleans obsessions: antiquities and
ancestor-worship. ``The dead are not forgotten in New Orleans,''
said Randolph Delehanty, director of the University of New Orleans
Ogden Museum of Art and a co-author of ``New Orleans: Elegance and
Decadence'' (Chronicle Books, 1993). ``Other places in America have
made death an antiseptic phenomenon. But among New Orleans families
tombs have primitive power.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the prominent victims were the restaurateur Ted Brennan,
who lost a Mother Cabrini statue commissioned by his mother for his
father's tomb, and Lucille Prima, a relative of the jazz legend
Louis Prima. But the sense of outrage is widely felt. Cherished
French and Italian marble sculptures were pried off tombs that
resemble elegant funerary mansions, expressions of the unique New
Orleans way of death. For more than 200 years the dearly departed
have been interred above ground to keep them from floating away
with the waterlogged soil, successive generations pushing old bones
to the back of the tomb to make way for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   From humble brick tombs sprouting ferns to extravagant Victorian
shrines set in formal landscapes, death wears a beautiful face
here. The novelist Walker Percy wrote lovingly of St. Louis No. 1,
the city's oldest cemetery, its ``tiny lanes as crooked as old
Jerusalem, meandering aimlessly between the cottages of the dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On a mild February morning, Rosemary Garcia Sanders, 46, was
replenishing the artificial flowers on her family's tomb at nearby
St. Louis No. 2. ``It's just unbelievable that someone would rob
from the dead,'' she said. On every All Saints Day, Nov. 1, like
many New Orleanians, her family gathers to sweep and whitewash the
tomb, which is topped by a sculpture of the Blessed Mother. She
hollers hello to it every time she drives by on the Interstate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Along Royal Street and Magazine Street, the fabled antiques
thoroughfares where many stolen ornaments were seized in police
raids, Mardi Gras beads cannot disguise a paranoid mood. Dealers
say that kneeling crying angels are out, cavorting Bacchuses are
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it would have been, `Isn't this pretty?''' said
Stephen A. Moses, president of Neal Auction Co., referring to the
large urns, in exquisite decay, that occasionally cross his
threshold. ``Now it's, `I wonder if it's been stolen.'''
</P>
<P>
   The theft ring, whose moves have been chronicled in detail by
the local news media, began to unravel a year ago when a
groundskeeper at Lake Lawn Metairie Cemetery spotted a van moving
slowly from tomb to tomb. He took down the license plate number.
The van sped away, leaving a tall marble angel awry on its
pedestal. The van's owner was eventually arrested and later gave up
three accomplices.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, Tom Bate, a New Orleans-born contractor
living in Los Angeles, noticed what appeared to be gates, urns and
iron crosses from New Orleans cemeteries popping up with exorbitant
price tags in chic West Hollywood shops. It outraged Bate, who grew
up taking walks with his grandfather in Lafayette cemetery. ``It
kind of killed me,'' he said. ``This was our history being sold at
a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   His New Orleans friend Patty Lee St. Martin alerted the police
and together they started the National Cemetery Conservation
Foundation, the city's third preservation group dedicated to the
funerary cause. The pair lobbies dealers and their high-end
clientele to prevent ``cemetery chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Detective Frederick Morton said the four original ``baseline
thieves'' started snatching urns for heroin money but eventually
graduated to more lucrative loot. They led Morton and his partner,
Detective Lawrence Green, to four antiques dealers, including
Patout, who were subsequently arrested on charges that included
obstruction of justice and possession of stolen property. Formal
charges, if any, are on hold for all suspects pending the outcome
of the investigation, according to Zully Jimenez, a spokeswoman for
the Orleans Parish district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   ``I think antiquity led to infatuation,'' said Green, who
usually analyzes blood splatters but whose office is now strewn
with copies of Garden Design magazine and The Newtown Bee, an
antiques weekly. ``These sculptures were forbidden treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL GRAF)
</P>
<P>
   Detectives say the dealers gave the thieves art-history
tutorials. The more detailed the artistry, the more the statues
were worth, Morton said. ``They told them to look for the
through-and-throughs'' _ the chiseled spaces between fingers _
``and eyes with pupils.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucille Prima's family tomb at Lake Lawn Metairie was stripped
of two angels, one carrying a cascade of roses. Of the
upper-echelon dealers who were arrested, she said, ``They are the
very ones I was admiring for preserving the heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roy P. Boucvalt, an anesthesiologist, was arrested after
police seized more than $43,000 in stolen cemetery artifacts at
Boucvalt House, his 150-year-old Greek Revival landmark home. His
lawyer, Kendall P. Green, said the delay in filing formal charges
``is unusual and I suspect it's because they can't find any
evidence to support the conspiracy theory.''
</P>
<P>
   The police also arrested Aaron Jarabica, co-owner of Top Drawer
Antiques and Auction on Magazine Street, who said he had no idea
the artifacts in his shop were stolen. Thieves told him they ``were
from their grandmother's estate.'' Lieut. Jeff Winn, who is leading
the investigation, said such an estate ``didn't exist to our
knowledge, but if it did, the place would look like a Roman
coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Also arrested was Andrew P. Antippas, owner of the Barristers
Gallery on Royal Street. In 1979, Antippas spent a year in jail
after pleading guilty to stealing five rare maps from Yale
University. Since then his pursuits have included the sale of
Haitian and outsider art _ including the work of serial killers. He
acknowledged being ``guilty of being stupid'' for not having known
the origin of two wire cemetery benches found in his home. Police
were shocked to find a self-portrait by John Wayne Gacy hanging
there too. ``It was an investment, not a sign of my depravity,''
Antippas said.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, Patout, whose shop and home have been featured in
the magazines House Beautiful and Vogue, publicly proclaimed his
innocence at the tomb of his ancestors at St. Louis No. 3. One of
Patout's arrests came after police got a call from a citizen who
recognized Ms. Prima's angel as one he had bought at Patout's shop.
``Basically, I bought some things that turned out to be stolen,''
Patout said recently, sitting in a mahogany lyre-backed chair. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thieving for profit is hardly unique to New Orleans.
``Cemeteries are a treasure-trove for those larcenous of mind, ''
said John W. Keefe, the decorative arts curator at the New Orleans
Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, seven iron gates were stolen from the historic Mount
Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Mass., but were recovered, largely
because they were well-documented with telltale iconography,
including weeping willows, said Meg Winslow, the cemetery's
curator.
</P>
<P>
   At the Forest Hills cemetery in Roxbury, Mass., where E.E.
Cummings and Eugene O'Neill are buried, the theft of a bronze
bas-relief inspired cemetery owners to organize an art-theft
committee for New England, a part of the country where owners have
avoided reporting theft for fear of copycat crimes and the
perception of negligence.
</P>
<P>
   In the rural South, a booming collectors' market for folk
pottery has made remote African-American burial grounds
particularly vulnerable. Decorative pottery, used as grave markers,
now fetches thousands of dollars. Dr. John Burrison, a curator at
the Atlanta History Center, said, ``I'm cautious about giving
specific locations when I lecture on cemetery traditions, because I
know a few people in the audience will capitalize on the
information.''
</P>
<P>
   In New Orleans, the City Council recently set up a task force on
cemetery theft. But that may not stop the national compulsion to
transform one's house and backyard into Hadrian's villa.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Charbonnet, a New York decorator and native New Orleanian
whose clients include Michael J. Fox and his wife, Tracy Pollan,
has seen cemetery art at the 26th Street Flea Market in Manhattan.
Its presence in Los Angeles does not surprise him, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have one city seeped in the miasma of its own culture, and
another city with none,'' he said. ``You pull up a pot and a cross
and place it in an L.A. loft with some overstuffed Edwardian
furniture, and someone decides to call it neo-Gothic. But in New
Orleans, the Gothic is real.''

 &HT;    Ohio bill would deny bail to certain crimes; House to hear
victim testimony
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ When appeals court judges reduced the bond for
the man who had attacked her, Michelle Freeze feared the assailant
would get out of jail and come after her again.
</P>
<P>
   When he posted bond and shot another woman before killing
himself a year ago in Clayton, Freeze thought her troubles were
over.
</P>
<P>
   She is going to relive them today, however, in testimony before
the Ohio House criminal justice committee in support of a bill that
would enable judges to deny a criminal defendant bail when the
victim might be at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The change was approved by a statewide vote in 1997, but Ohio
lawmakers have yet to set the guidelines for the bail denial and
have kept it from taking effect.
</P>
<P>
   A bill setting those guidelines has passed the Ohio Senate this
year and is expected to pass quickly through the House.
</P>
<P>
   Freeze said it is overdue because the rights of victims have
been left out of court proceedings for too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are going to have a violent past, they pretty much
are going to have a violent present and a violent future,'' Freeze
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Her former boyfriend, Jeffrey Scott Blair, attacked her in June
1997 in what his attorney later said was a steroid-induced rage.
She needed 200 stitches to repair the knife wounds to her face and
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Blair posted his bond of $500,000 and was released. Police
arrested Blair again in July 1997 after he ate lunch in a
restaurant in a downtown Dayton building where Freeze worked.
Prosecutors charged him with stalking, and Common Pleas Judge
Barbara Gorman increased Blair's bond to $1 million. The Ohio 2nd
District Court of Appeals reduced it, ruling it was
unconstitutionally high.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio law at the time required judges to set bail based only on
whether a defendant was likely to return for court dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had the bond been to protect the victim, one person wouldn't
have been shot and he probably wouldn't be dead,'' Freeze said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Jeff Jacobson (R-Phillipsburg) introduced the bill
and expects it to pass the House quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am comfortable with the bill as it is,'' Jacobson said. ``It
is constitutional and it's fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow bail to be denied to defendants charged
with aggravated murder, murder, a felony of the first or second
degree, aggravated vehicular homicide or a fourth-degree felony of
driving under the influence of alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats, including Sen. Rhine McLin (D-Dayton)
voted against the bill because they said it was unnecessary since
judges still could set high bonds for dangerous offenders.

MOST AMERICAN PILOTS END SICKOUT, BUT ANGER REMAINS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Texas)   (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pressured by a federal judge's contempt citation, the
overwhelming majority of American Airlines pilots returned to work
Monday, alleviating delays for passengers and allowing the airline
to make major strides toward returning to normal.
</P>
<P>
   After canceling about 12 percent of its flights Monday, American
announced that it expected to fly nearly all of its 2,250 scheduled
flights on Tuesday, even though many pilots who returned to work
after calling in sick remain angry at the airline.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Chiames, a spokesman for American, said, ``We
operated close to 2,000 flights today _ 90 percent of our schedule
_ and tomorrow we will essentially be back to full operations.
That's not to say there won't be a handful of cancellations, but
you have a handful of cancellations every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as most pilots ended their sickout, which began 10 days
ago, several pilots interviewed Monday said that out of anger
toward American, they would refuse to fly extra flights beyond
their normal schedule. As a result, officials of American Airlines
said Monday that beginning next month the airline would reduce the
number of scheduled flights by a few dozen each day because of
concerns that many pilots will not agree to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   American, the nation's second-largest carrier after United
Airlines, said it canceled nearly 300 flights Monday _ down sharply
from 1,100 three days ago _ as the number of pilots calling in sick
fell for the third consecutive day. Union officials said about 400
pilots called in sick Monday, about average for a February day and
far below the 2,400 who called in sick last Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots started streaming back to work after Judge Joe
Kendall of federal District Court in Texas issued a ruling on
Saturday that held the pilots union in contempt and ordered it to
deposit $10 million with the court in anticipation of his levying a
fine even larger than that.
</P>
<P>
   In citing the Allied Pilots Association and its two leaders for
contempt, Kendall found that they had not complied with an order he
issued last Wednesday directing the pilots to return to work.
</P>
<P>
   At Chicago O'Hare International Airport on Monday, the lines at
American's counters were far smaller and passengers were far less
irate than they had been on Friday and Saturday. The sharp drop in
the number of cancellations meant fewer delays and made it far
easier for customers to find alternatives if their flights were
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Mann of Bakersfield, Calif., who flew to Chicago on
Saturday to do some business and then was flying to Detroit to
visit family, said, ``I was really worried. I thought I was going
to be stuck in the L.A. airport and not be able to get out, but I
had no problems. I was very happy, to say the least.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Nolting of Chicago, who was at O'Hare with his wife to
take a flight to Tucson, Ariz., to visit their daughter, said, ``I
was envisioning myself sleeping on the airport floor and I didn't
like that. It was good news to see the flight was going.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dallas-Fort Worth airport, one indication that things were
returning to normal was that skycaps were far busier. Wally Smith,
a long-time American skycap, said, ``Last week was terrible. When
flights don't come in, I don't make any money. Today is better. I'm
even smiling today.''
</P>
<P>
   The union and airlines resumed negotiations Monday, after not
holding formal talks since Thursday. The main issue in the dispute
is the union's unhappiness with the way American is handling its
acquisition of Reno Air.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any movement today on the core issues,''
Richard LaVoy, the union's president said in a telephone interview
Monday night. ``I would say a lot of pilots are frustrated that
management hasn't been sensitive to our core issues. There is a
tremendous frustration that we haven't been able to close this
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say they fear that American may move some routes
to Reno Air, whose pilots earn about half of American's, and that
American pilots might lose some work as a result. American
officials denied that they planned to do this, adding that their
intention was to integrate Reno Air into its larger network over
the next 18 months. But union officials said they want to integrate
the airlines far faster and to raise the salaries of Reno pilots so
they are comparable with those of American pilots _ who average
$140,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of American's 9,200 pilots said they remained bitter toward
the airline, insisting that they would refuse to accept extra
flights beyond the 78 hours of flying they are contractually
required to work each month. This tactic could force occasional
cancellations and delays, but far less than during the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   Several pilots also said they would work to rule, meaning they
might delay flights by spending extra time doing equipment checks
and safety checks above and beyond what is required.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really angry at the company right now,'' said one pilot
who called in sick and spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``My
personal feeling is that I'm going to work to rule and I'm not
going to fly any overtime now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eager not to anger Kendall any further, union officials said
they were doing their utmost to persuade pilots to return to the
cockpit and get the airline back to normal. And union officials
said they were not urging pilots to refuse overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The union leadership is not encouraging that,'' LaVoy said.
</P>
<P>
   But many pilots said that despite union leaders' calls to work
overtime, there was a widespread feeling _ even among American
executives _ that many pilots would refuse to work overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the airline's decision to make a modest reduction in
the number of scheduled flights next month, Chiames, the airline
spokesman, said, ``At this point, we're making the assumption as we
move forward that to avoid staffing shortages because pilots refuse
to pick up open time,'' meaning flights beyond the contract's
requirements, ``we'll have to reduce the scheduled flights.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiames added, ``The company's goal here is to welcome all of
our pilots back. The goal is for there not to be hostilities as
they come back to work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his ruling on Saturday, Kendall said he would require the
union to compensate American for the losses it suffered as a result
of the sickout. In court last week, American said its losses
totaled more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiames suggested Monday that the losses could be
considerably more than that. He estimated that the airline lost
$12,000 to $16,000 per canceled flight. Since American was forced
to cancel more than 6,000 flights, that could translate into losses
of $72 million to $96 million.
</P>
<P>
   American officials pointed out, however, that the losses could
be considerably lower than that because it used less fuel and had
lower food expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Several labor experts said that in the negotiations the union
was likely to ask the airline to put forward a low estimate of its
losses at a court hearing scheduled for Wednesday. Kendall said he
would use the hearing to determine Americans' damages and to order
a fine based on that amount.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots' leaders told the judge last week that the union's
net assets totaled about $38 million.

 &HT;    Hairless tradition shaved for Reds
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Just when the Cincinnati Reds should be
stepping into the 21st century, they instead have decided to join
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The hairy issue involving the team's new slugger, goatee-waering
Greg Vaughn, was resolved on Monday. For the first time since 1966,
facial hair is permitted _ beards, mustaches, long sideburns. .
.any hirsute adornments.
</P>
<P>
   One day before the official opening of spring training, the club
announced the elimination of its no-facial hair policy, instituted
in 1967 by former general manager/club president Bob Howsam.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, one certain way to get traded was to challenge the
no-facial hair policy, which outfielder Bobby Tolan did in 1973 and
pitcher Jim Kern did in 1982. Both were traded.
</P>
<P>
   Players were not required to report Monday, but some who did
showed up wearing beards, mustaches or both, expecting a required
visit with a razor to the shower room.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Dmitri Young and infielder Pokey Reese walked into
the clubhouse with short goatees and mustaches and were ecstatic
with the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some ugly people without facial hair,'' Young said,
rubbing his goatee. ``And I'm one of them. But this is going to be
fun, fun, fun. The new-look Reds. . .nice new uniforms, facial
hair, new players. I like the attention we're getting. Last year,
we were written off because a few pieces were missing. Now we have
them in guys like Denny Neagle, Steve Avery and Greg Vaughn. Vaughn
will take the pressure off us guys under 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``My facial hair? Yeah, I'm going to keep it,'' Young added.
``It's a doggone shame some guys had to come through Cincinnati,
guys known for their beards and mustaches _ like pitcher Jeff
Reardon _ and shave it all off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reese, who gets a try at winning the second base job left
vacant when Bret Boone was traded, ``See what one man can do? A lot
of things might change.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese referred to Vaughn, who put the issue on the front burner
after the Reds obtained him via trade with San Diego by pleading
with the media to get the policy changed, ``Because I have two kids
who have never seen their daddy without a goatee. . .they wouldn't
recognize me.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, Reese fingered a pair of diamond ear rings in his
lobes. Those are still a no-no, but Reese said, ``I guess we can't
go that far, but who knows, if Greg wants to wear 'em. . .''
</P>
<P>
   The lifting of the ban doesn't faze fuzzy-cheeked pitcher Danny
Graves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take me 10 years to grow one, and then you wouldn't
notice anything but a few stray hairs. Maybe when I reach
puberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Jason Bere says to grow or not to grow depends on how he
is pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superstition, y'know?'' he said. ``I'll start without one, but
if I'm not going good I might grow a beard to change my luck.''
</P>
<P>
   New catcher Brian Johnson walked into camp with a bald head,
something he started doing as a rookie five years ago. But he had a
small goatee and a pencil-thin mustache.
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the news, he said, ``Oh, good. I was wondering if
I should try to keep this or not. Now it is no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   It is no issue for pitcher Steve Parris, who said, ``I'm not
into beards or hair on the face. It feels bad on my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon wore a bushy mustache when he managed in
Oakland and San Diego, but plans to keep a clean upper lip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me grow a mustache? No, no,'' he said. ``This just makes it a
little easier, one less thing to worry about. Now the players can
do what they want to do, do their thing. I'm only interested in how
they play. We all have our different views and you change with the
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the times changed 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While CEO Marge Schott is taking bows for changing policy, the
truth is that any player could have taken the club's stance to
arbitration and/or litigation and won a verdict. The Reds were
fortunate that no player challenged the policy.

VOLVO GOES SHOPPING STATESIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich., Ill.)  (jw) 
 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Volvo AB, the Swedish automaker that agreed last month to sell
its car division to Ford Motor Co. for $6.45 billion, has again
turned its attention to the United States. But this time, the
company is interested in being the buyer, and the property it is
looking for is a truck manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Junior-level executives from Volvo have held discussions with
counterparts at the Navistar International Corp., the Chicago-based
maker of heavy trucks, school buses, diesel engines and service
parts, people close to the talks said. But those talks, which were
first reported in The Financial Times of London, are still
preliminary and, according to one person, have not included any
high-level negotiating between the chief executives of the
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Navistar, the person said, is not yet sold on being taken over
or even selling part of its operations to Volvo. Volvo, the world's
second-largest maker of heavy trucks, is interested in other
American properties, as well, and also continues to explore
opportunities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Volvo bought a 13 percent stake in Scania AB, a
Swedish rival in the truck industry, and it has said it was
interested in buying the rest of the company as well. If Volvo did
acquire all of Scania, the newly combined company would become the
largest manufacturer of heavy trucks in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Any acquisition by Volvo in the truck sector would give it a
market in which to compete more powerfully against major
competitors, including DaimlerChrysler. That was something Volvo
was not able to do in the car sector despite its well-respected
brand name. And Volvo can afford to buy market share now that the
sale to Ford is expected to leave it with a full pocketbook.
</P>
<P>
   Navistar, with a market value of $2.3 billion, was formerly
known as International Harvester and was a maker of agriculture
machinery. The company set up its first overseas factory in 1905 in
Sweden. But it fell on hard times in 1980 when a recession and a
six-month strike by the United Auto Workers hurt earnings and
nearly forced it into bankruptcy. In 1985, the company sold its
name and its agricultural equipment business to Tenneco Inc. A year
later, it was renamed Navistar International, specializing in heavy
truck and engine manufacturing. Shares in Navistar shot up $2 on
Friday, to close at $35.25.

 &HT;    Former Fisher-Price VP picked to head Mead division
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Mead Corp. on Monday named a former toy executive
to run its school and office products division, company officials
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Neil A. McLachlan, who was senior vice president-international
for Fisher-Price, a subsidiary of toy maker Mattel Inc., will take
over the Mead job March 1. He replaces Patricia B. Robinson, who
left Mead Sept. 30 after 21 years with the paper maker to pursue
personal interests, Mead officials said.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan will be taking over a division that suffered a 25
percent decline in earnings for 1998. The division earned $42.8
million last year versus $57.3 million for 1997. Sales for the
division fell 7 percent in 1998 to $482.4 million from $516.2
million in 1997. Retailers have been buying products from foreign
suppliers and paper sales overall have been slumping, said Mead
spokesman Doug Draper.
</P>
<P>
   Mead's school and office products division operates eight
manufacturing plans in North America that make spiral and wireless
notebooks and other items. The division recently branched out to
selling day planners, backpacks, laptop bags, folders, stationary
and other material.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan, 42, spent the last 17 years with Fisher Price in
various marketing positions. In his most recent job, McLachlan was
responsible for the development of Mattel's infant and preschool
business around the world. He also was senior vice president for
toys and children's products for Fisher Price and general manager
of Fisher-Price Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be interviewed. McLachlan holds a bachelor's
degree in marketing from Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton-based Mead is a $3.8 billion paper company that makes
clay coated paper for catalogs, paper for beverage containers,
colored paper for flooring, and office paper.

CHINA RELEASES PROMINENT JOURNALIST FROM PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Two weeks before a planned visit here by the American
secretary of state, China granted early release Monday to a
prominent journalist who has spent more than five years in prison
for writing about Chinese politics in Hong Kong publications.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Gao Yu, now 55, had served all but nine months
of a six-year sentence, given at a closed trial in 1993 for
``revealing state secrets.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gao's sentence was widely viewed as a warning to other
Chinese journalists not to venture onto sensitive ground, and her
case became a cause of international press organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She has also appeared on lists of high-profile political
prisoners that senior American officials privately raise with
China's leaders when urging them to improve China's record on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected here in early
March to help prepare for an April visit to Washington by Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji. Though the visit is intended to focus on
economic and environmental issues, it is certain to be dogged by
questions about the harsh sentences recently dealt to leading
democracy campaigners here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gao's release came on the eve of the lunar New Year, or
Spring Festival, China's biggest holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my happiest Spring Festival in 10 years,'' Ms. Gao's
27-year-old son, Zhao Meng, told reporters. He said she was in good
spirits, but suffers from high blood pressure and heart problems
and will seek medical care after spending this week resting with
her husband and close relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had turned down earlier requests for medical parole.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Ms. Gao was deputy editor of the Economic Weekly
magazine, which played a part in the pro-democracy ferment of that
year and was shut down by authorities after the June 4 crushing of
the Tiananmen Square demonstrations. Ms. Gao was arrested on June 3
and spent 15 months in jail without being formally charged.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, she was rearrested after she wrote a series of articles
about Chinese politics in two Hong Kong publications, Mirror
Monthly and Overseas Chinese Daily.
</P>
<P>
   The offending articles, written under a pseudonym, included one
analyzing the continuing power of Deng Xiaoping, who was nominally
retired. Another analyzed the Communist Party's retreat from its
vow to separate the party and the government. The government
charged that these were based on secret official documents, which
she firmly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Her arrest came two days before her planned departure to take up
a fellowship at the Columbia University Graduate School of
Journalism in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She received the six-year sentence in late 1994. ``This sentence
can devastate my health but not my spirits,'' she said in a defiant
statement to the court, noting that her body was ailing after the
year in detention awaiting trial. ``I am willing to sacrifice all
that I have for my country's modernization and journalism,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Ms. Gao received Unesco's first annual award for press
freedom. In a response she relayed through relatives during one of
their monthly 30-minute prison visits, she expressed deep thanks
for the support and vowed: ``When I leave prison and regain my
freedom, I will use my pen to repay the world and my homeland.''

MARKET PLACE: THE INSIDE EDGE IN INTERNET STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (ART ADV: Graphic on Active Apparel Group stock is being sent to
NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase
by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Christmas, shares of Active Apparel Group, a clothing
wholesaler, were swept up in the market enthusiasm for retailers
doing business on the Internet. Active Apparel promoted its
Internet debut in a news release and on CNBC, and though the
company had not yet sold any goods in cyberspace _ indeed, its Web
site was not up and running when the first release went out _
investors bid up the stock as high as $25, from $1.25 on Christmas
Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, several officers and directors took advantage of the
stock's surge to sell close to $1 million of their shares.
</P>
<P>
   After those sales, the price of Active Apparel shares quickly
fell back into the single digits. On Friday, they closed at
$4.6875, meaning investors who still own shares bought during the
frenzied days of late December have big losses.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Active Apparel nor the insiders who sold have been
accused of any wrongdoing. But for the buyers of those shares, it
was a painful lesson, and not an isolated one. Outside investors do
not always fare as well as insiders when companies advance on
Internet euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   The tide that has lifted Internet stocks the last few months has
brought with it plenty of flotsam _ companies with only the most
tenuous connections to the Internet but whose shares were bid up as
if they were the next Yahoo or Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Now as the tide recedes and even the biggest Internet stocks
fall sharply from their highs, some investors find themselves with
the equivalent of driftwood _ stocks in companies whose insiders
have bailed out at higher prices and in companies whose promoters
issued ``research reports'' because they were paid to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, insiders of companies that issue new stock to the
public agree not to sell for a ``lock-up'' period of up to six
months. But companies that are already publicly traded and that
suddenly announce an Internet plan are not under the same
restrictions. That makes investors particularly vulnerable to a
downdraft caused by insider selling.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission has taken action against
some companies and promoters that have not fully disclosed their
practices, and regulators are warning investors to proceed with
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``More companies, legitimate and illegitimate, seem to be
getting onto the Internet every day,'' said Chris Ullman, an SEC
spokesman. ``Technological developments have made it so that it
doesn't take much to set up a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the newly christened Internet companies, of course, may
bounce back from recent stock declines. Active Apparel, for
example, now has a fully operating Web site. Its stock, which had
been threatened with delisting from Nasdaq's biggest market when
its market value fell below Nasdaq's requirements, is trading on
Nasdaq's smaller, less prestigious small-cap market.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Marbach, an outside spokesman for the company, said that
the recent stock sales by insiders are no reflection on the
company's prospects. In most cases, the sales represented only a
small portion of their total holdings, Marbach said, and some
insiders have bought stock the last year in addition to exercising
options and selling stock.
</P>
<P>
   Those explanations are not likely to comfort individuals who
bought Active Apparel stock at high prices when insiders were
selling, however. ``Give me hope!'' wrote one such investor, a
California woman who goes by the screen name ``Portofoy,'' on the
Yahoo message board for Active Apparel stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, folks, I bought AAGP at 22, repeat 22,'' she added,
referring to Active Apparel's stock symbol. ``Too much caffeine
that morning, I guess. Is there hope? Should I hold on? I'm hurtin'
for certain.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, timing is everything in the fast-moving, volatile
world of Internet stocks. And insiders have key advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Connect Inc., a Mountain View, Calif., company that
distributes software allowing companies to sell goods over the
Internet. On Nov. 30, as investors heard reports of the crowds
flocking to Internet shopping sites over the Thanksgiving weekend,
shares of Connect, which has since changed its name to
Connectinc.com, soared to more than $15, up from less than $2 the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks later, after the shares fell back into the single
digits, was it revealed that on the very day that its stock price
soared, insiders sold nearly 1.5 million shares, at prices ranging
from $5.63 to $12.44.
</P>
<P>
   Greigory Park, the company's chief financial officer, said the
sales were timed ``to take advantage of a run in the stock that was
pretty much speculation-based.'' He said the company had issued no
news to account for the sixfold increase in its stock price. ``The
run in the stock was a complete surprise to everybody here,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the company was under notice from Nasdaq that its
stock might be delisted because the company had only $1.1 million
in net tangible assets, versus the $4 million minimum Nasdaq
requires.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's efforts to raise money to put it in compliance
with the listing requirement came at a much more lumbering pace
than that insiders displayed when they were selling their own
shares in November.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Connectinc.com raised $4 million from new
institutional investors in a private sale on Jan. 20, the price was
a mere $2.60 a share. That was far less than the $6 the stock was
fetching in the open market at the time and less than half what
insiders had reaped weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Park said the company opted to sell the shares at such a
discount because it wanted to satisfy the Nasdaq listing
requirements as soon as possible. ``Yes, the institutional
investors got a better price than the average investor could have
gotten in the market, but individuals weren't being asked to come
up with one and a half million dollars each,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Park said, the company's sale of shares was
unrelated to the sale of personal holdings by insiders several
weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Because the company's stock had been publicly traded for more
than two years, its insiders were not under the same restrictions
that often govern newly public companies, like the many
Internet-related companies that have gone public in recent months.

 UNDATED: recent months. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Insiders at newly public companies usually agree with their
underwriters to refrain from selling additional shares for up to
six months. That ``lock up'' period gives buyers confidence that
millions of additional shares will not flood the market, depressing
the stock's price, and that managements are in it for the long
haul.
</P>
<P>
   But once the lock-up period expires, the psychological drain can
deflate a stock, whether or not actual selling follows. Take, for
example, Broadcast.com, which feeds audio and video broadcasts over
the Internet and which went public last July, selling 2.5 million
shares. The owners of its other 14.5 million shares agreed not to
sell any of their holdings for 180 days. (The shares have since
split two-for-one.)
</P>
<P>
   Beginning late last month, two big holders and early backers of
the company, Intel and Motorola, filed to sell shares. On the days
those filings became public, Broadcast's share price fell sharply,
although it has since rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   At $68.87, it remains far above the initial offering price of
$9, after accounting for the split, but is well below the high of
$144.75 reached on Jan. 12, before the insiders registered their
shares.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing inherently wrong with insiders turning their
hard-earned shares into cash, of course. But unlike with recent
IPOs, selling by insiders at companies that have long been public
is much less transparent to the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Internet has speeded up the rhythms and cycles of
corporate life and investment, the quick rise of Internet stocks
has brought a flurry of regulatory actions against companies
promoting their alleged Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the SEC filed 23 enforcement actions against 44
individuals and companies across the country, charging that they
used the Internet to fraudulently promote the companies or their
investments.
</P>
<P>
   A particular concern of regulators has been over promoters who
are paid a fee to publicize a company's Internet connections, but
which do not disclose that fact to investors. And even when a
service discloses that it might have been paid such a fee, the
disclaimer is sometimes so far away from the stock tips that an
investor could be confused about the fee or could miss it
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   One example of that trend is the Internet Stock Review, a web
site that provides information about companies involved in
electronic commerce and other Internet-realted businesses. In
January, the Internet Stock Review published a list of ``20
companies to watch during 1999.'' The aim of the list, according to
a press release, ``is to bring attention to the names and or to the
existence of these companies (many of which have no coverage on
Wall Street),'' and then to have investors decide on their own
whether to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Several names on the list are well-known companies like Borders
Group, the bookstore chain; Fingerhut, the catalog retailer that
last week agreed to be acquired by Federated Department Stores; and
Federal Express, which delivers many of the goods bought over the
Internet. None of these companies went to any lengths to show up on
the list. But sprinkled on the list are upstarts like Aim-Smart,
which provides access to Internet shopping sites, and other small
companies like AllNetServices, Dynamic Media.com and MediaX _ all
of which have paid the owner of the Internet Stock Review to
publicize them.
</P>
<P>
   The press release notes that certain companies listed are
``client companies,'' and invites readers to read the disclaimer on
the web site. That disclaimer states that the list is not a buy
list, and notes that for services to certain companies, ``payment
at the time of engagement in each instance was valued at less than
$250,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are not told, however, that since the report on
``companies to watch'' was issued, 1.5 million shares of Aim-Smart
restricted stock have been registered for sale by its owners,
legally the only hint public shareholders may get that a sale of
stock might be afoot.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Perry, who operates Perry &AMP; Co., the public relations
company that publishes the Internet Stock Review, says he believes
the service's disclosures about its compensation are adequate.
Perry &AMP; Co. has not been accused by the SEC of any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys try to hide it,'' Perry said. ``We're proud of
what we do. We're not a buy-sell service,'' but simply one that
points investors to places to begin their own research.
</P>
<P>
   But even the SEC admits that it is becoming much harder for
investors to distinguish between the real and the unreal when it
comes to investments in Internet-related companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the messages that came out of the October sweep is that
just because something is on the Internet doesn't mean it is
legitimate,'' said Ullman of the SEC. ``Something can be the
equivalent of a boiler room but on the Internet it can look as
impressive as a Fortune 500 company.''

IN FRANCE, SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT A BIG BANK MERGER
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Investors cheered only halfheartedly earlier this month
when Societe Generale SA announced it was paying $18 billion for
Paribas SA.
</P>
<P>
   What French banking needed above all, they argued, was to bring
down costs by thinning out an overly dense network of branches, but
these two banks had few that overlapped. And while the acquisition
brought together Societe Generale's investment banking arm with
Paribas, which has focused on that business in recent years, it
failed to create a player in the top tier of investment banks. With
little overlapping business of any kind between the two banks, they
complained, little room for cost-cutting presented itself in their
combination.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst, David Grinsztajn of Merrill Lynch in Paris, said
his valuation of Societe Generale, France's second-largest
commercial bank, alone was equal to the value he placed on the
combination of the two. ``It's above all a tactical move; it has no
strong industrial logic,'' he said of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Smith, an analyst of European banking for MFS Investment
Management in London, agreed that the deal had not created new
value. ``It is a question where one and one equals three,'' he
said, ``and it's hard to see that it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors appeared to buy that logic. At the close of trading
Monday, shares of Paribas, France's fifth-largest bank, stagnated
at 85 euros, or $96, roughly their level before the deal was
announced; Societe Generale has fared worse, closing Monday at
137.8 euros, down from 153 at the time of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean-Claude Branchereau thinks the investors may have missed
the point.
</P>
<P>
   Branchereau is a trade union leader at Societe Generale, and his
attitude typifies the unease of employees who feel the merger
speeds up a movement among French banks, glacial until now, that
could lead to greater job losses and increased insecurity _ even as
he grudgingly admits the changes may assure the banks' survival in
an increasingly competitive world. Pointing to a shuffling that
began in 1996, when Credit Agricole paid $2.3 billion to acquire
Banque Indosuez, Branchereau said, ``That was the first step; this
is an acceleration.'' And he believes the pace will not let up.
</P>
<P>
   The Socialist government of Prime Minister Lionel Jospin plans
to sell its stake in Credit Lyonnais later this year, and suitors
are lining up. This week, Lucien Douroux, the chairman of Credit
Agricole, said he would be among those bidding for a stake. ``Very
informal contacts have already taken place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors may not yet agree with Branchereau's assessment, but
some analysts and experts say he is onto something. True, Daniel
Bouton, the chairman of Societe Generale, and Andre Levy-Lang, his
counterpart at Paribas, may have been in part avoiding the
distasteful task of closing bank branches, and hence cutting jobs,
when they chose each other over other potential partners. But their
banks, by combining, gain economies of scale in a European market
that is fast unifying under the impulse of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Dermine, a professor of banking at the Insead business
school, said European banks needed two kinds of mergers,
consolidations that enable them to close branches and cut costs,
and alliances that create the larger capital bases they will need
to finance customers in the big new euro market. ``Very clearly
this merger was of the second type,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jean-Luc Lepreux, chief banking analyst at Moody's Investors
Service in Paris, agreed, adding that the greater size will have
more than one advantage. ``It is both defensive and offensive,'' he
said of the alliance between the two banks. The volatility of the
prices of stock in French banks, he said, was a sign of their
potential as takeover targets. The deal also affords each of the
banks a chance to increase outlets for retail financial services.
And by bringing together Societe Generale's specialization in
equities and Paribas' in fixed-income securities, the merger
increases their clout on the increasingly liquid euro-denominated
securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind the merger, these experts say, is largely
dictated by the peculiarities of French banking. Societe Generale,
which was nationalized after World War II, was one of the first
French banks to be returned to the private sector when it made the
transition in 1986, and it has had to struggle to assert itself in
a market distorted by state-owned and mutual banks that typically
gained market share while paying scant attention to returns. These
banks, said Dermine, ``focused on size and not profitability.'' He
added, ``That is disadvantageous for banks that have to compete on
international capital markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was distaste for French retail banking among private
French banks and foreign banks alike. Last year, when the Paris
government auctioned off the nationalized bank Compagnie Financiere
de CIC, British banks, traditionally focused on profitability, were
singularly absent among the bidders; Barclays Bank, one of
Britain's largest, closed its unprofitable French retailing arm in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast with Credit Agricole, one of the largest banks by
assets, is revealing. Credit Agricole is effectively owned by its
regional units, which are in turn owned by bank customers, who
receive fixed returns on their investments. Its 8,000 branches,
with 21 percent of the retail market, compared with Societe
Generale's 2,700 branches, or 7 percent, give Agricole a vast
reach.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, government-assured monopolies on certain savings
products assure captive markets, and fixed returns to shareholders
erase concerns for return on equity. And Credit Agricole is not
alone. Its two biggest rivals in the retail sector are also mutual
banks, Credit Mutuel and Banques Populaires, which together control
5,300 branches.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure for change is increasing. Low profitability and mutual
ownership have traditionally blocked the access of the mutual banks
to capital markets. This will put them at an increasing
disadvantage, experts say, as profit-rich banks in other European
countries, like Britain, Spain and the Netherlands, seek expansion
outside domestic markets.
</P>
<P>
   Jospin's government, urged on by strong bank unions, has been
slow to touch the mutual ownership arrangements. Yet the walls of
mutualization have begun to crumble nonetheless. Banques Populaires
has been partially demutualized while others, including Credit
Agricole, have gained access to capital markets by offering shares
in some of their regional banks on stock markets. The banks are
competing for international capital, and that will keep the
pressure on for greater returns. If Agricole enters the circle of
Credit Lyonnais shareholders, the pressure to move away from the
mutual style of ownership can only increase, and Societe Generale's
move on Paribas has created competition that is likely to force the
process. In 1997, Agricole's return on equity was 8.8 percent, and
Credit Mutuel's was 7.5 percent. Societe Generale, by contrast,
reported a return of 10.2 percent, and the combined banks say they
are targeting 15 percent by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it puts pressure on the pedal,'' said John Bennett,
investment director in London for Global Asset Management.
Describing himself as ``fairly ambivalent'' about Societe
Generale's acquisition of Paribas, he said he was ``less ambivalent
about what it means for the sector'' of French banking, which he
thinks will be pushed further toward change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never as fast as you like, and French banking certainly
needs costs taken out,'' he said. But the combination will keep
pressure on bankers and policy makers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the government wants and the French banks need is
mutually exclusive,'' he said, ``but it's getting closer.''

IN `TOWN HALL MEETING,' LOTT AND OTHER REPUBLICANS PUSH BROAD TAX
CUTS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mich. _ Republican leaders came to this blue-collar
Detroit suburb on Monday to hold the first in a series of ``town
hall meetings'' aimed at reshaping the party's image and agenda in
the wake of the unpopular impeachment trial and at drumming up
support for broad tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 500 people, mostly Republicans, responded
fairly warmly, but the enthusiasm was tempered by worries that tax
cuts are not compatible with reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Michigan's top
Republican politicians repeatedly called for a 10 percent reduction
in all Americans' income tax rates, while accusing Democrats of
both wanting to spend more of taxpayers' money and wanting to enact
more limited tax cuts with narrowly targeted benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should it be spent on a myriad of federal programs, or should
it be returned to the people?'' Lott asked, drawing considerable,
but not unanimous, applause.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, dozens of people in the audience did not raise their
hands when Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., asked who would like to
pay less in taxes. A repeated theme in the questions at the
Presidents Day event and in subsequent interviews with members of
the audience was a desire to repay some of the national debt before
taxes are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and his fellow Republicans, including Gov. John Engler,
answered questions from 15 members of the audience chosen by the
moderator, a local television anchorman. Nobody asked about the
impeachment trial, although one person briefly complimented Lott on
his handling of the issue, as the questions focused mainly on
economic issues like Social Security, taxes and the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   George Gomez, a 43-year-old middle manager for an electric
utility who identified himself as a former supporter of Ross Perot,
asked during the meeting whether his 17-year-old son, Sean, would
be shouldered someday with a large national debt. ``I'm not so sure
I got a really solid answer about how we're going to repay the
debt,'' he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been heavily criticized this winter for staying
in Washington and focusing on the impeachment of President Clinton.
Their new strategy, laid out here on Monday by Lott and Patricia
Harrison, the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee,
is to hold town hall meetings _ a political art form perfected by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said that Republican members of Congress would hold 150
such meetings across the nation this year and that he would try to
attend a dozen of them. Ms. Harrison said that the next two would
probably be held in Virginia and Pennsylvania but that the schedule
would depend on the availability of state governors.
</P>
<P>
   Having been bloodied at the polls for their emphasis on
impeachment, Republicans were eager to listen for new ideas on
Monday, even as they stressed tax cuts, and were loath to discuss
the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans here spoke about the trial only when asked after
the meeting by reporters, and with evident relief that the
proceedings were over. ``This meeting here today is to show we're
through with it, and we're ready to move on,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Having lashed out at the president after last Friday's
acquittal, Lott struck a more conciliatory tone with reporters
Monday afternoon. He said that the president had called him at home
last Saturday at 9 a.m. and that they had spoken on subjects
ranging from Kosovo and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still the president, and every bill that we pass he has
to sign or veto,'' Lott added.
</P>
<P>
   Lott predicted that moderate Republicans, conservative
Republicans and Democrats would also be able to work together
closely in the Senate despite their recent differences during the
impeachment process. ``We've been in a foxhole together and
survived a crucible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first town hall meeting was held at the Ukrainian Cultural
Center here, partly because the Republican National Committee had
used the community center before and partly because Warren is still
known as a center of ``Reagan Democrats,'' Ms. Harrison said.
``Reagan Democrats'' are politically conservative, outspokenly
patriotic industrial workers who defied their union leaders in the
1980s by supporting Presidents Reagan and Bush in large numbers,
allowing them to carry Michigan, always a fiercely contested state.
</P>
<P>
   But these workers tended to back President Clinton in the 1992
and 1996 elections. Warren, which has 138,000 residents, is the
heart of Macomb County, which lies on Detroit's northeast border.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are eager to woo back swing voters in this
politically important state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both of Macomb County's congressmen are perennially vulnerable
Democrats. Rep. Sander Levin, who represents the part of Warren
where the meeting was held, has been near the top of Republicans'
lists of targets ever since his district was redrawn after the 1990
elections and has been re-elected each time with only 53 percent to
57 percent of the vote despite strong efforts by unions on his
behalf. Rep. David Bonior, the minority whip, represents the rest
of Macomb County and won only 53 percent of the vote last November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrison said Republicans wanted to tell conservative
workers that they were welcome in the party. ``Reagan Democrats,
y'all come in; we've got a seat at the table for you,'' she said in
an interview after the town hall meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and the other Republicans spoke in front of a huge canvas
painted with a scene of a pine-fringed lake and emblazoned with the
words, ``Listening to America ... Tax Cuts for Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Senor, a spokesman for Abraham, said that half the tickets
for the event were distributed by local Republican officials and
the other half were given to people who called after hearing about
the meeting on local television. Those who called were given
tickets regardless of their political affiliations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   While Lott and his fellow Republicans tried to present an image
of united support for reducing income tax rates, Republicans are
deeply divided on tax policy. They differ over whether to pursue a
broad reduction in income tax rates or focus on more narrow tax
cuts, like eliminating estate taxes and reducing the so-called
``marriage penalty,'' which requires two-income couples to pay more
when married than they would separately.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton, the senior Republican in Michigan's
congressional delegation, was not here on Monday and said in a
telephone interview from his district in western Michigan that he
believed that there were not enough votes in Congress to approve
lower income tax rates. Upton said he would push for targeted tax
cuts instead, notably reducing the marriage penalty _ a popular
theme among many social conservatives in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spoke strongly in favor of a 10 percent tax cut during the
town hall meeting. ``The great thing is, it doesn't pick winners
and losers _ it's good for everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief interview afterward, he voiced a willingness to
compromise on the amount of any reduction, saying that a cut
slightly smaller than 10 percent could be paired with a few
targeted tax cuts, notably an elimination of estate taxes. ``I'm
not dug in or locked into this number or that number _ maybe it
should be 8.7 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed that 62 percent of the projected $4.35
trillion in federal surpluses over the next 15 years should be
devoted to putting Social Security on a more firm financial
footing, while the rest should be spent on a variety of federal
programs and targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Lott repeated his general support for devoting 62 percent to
Social Security, which would reduce the need for future federal
borrowing and thereby reduce the national debt. But Lott said that
he strongly disagreed with the president on how to use the
remaining 38 percent.

PERSONAL HEALTH: AT LIFE'S END, PATIENTS WANT THEIR WISHES TO BE
HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  (fb) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the insightful and poignant drama, ``Wit,'' now
playing off-Broadway to wide acclaim, the protagonist _ a woman
professor with advanced ovarian cancer that spreads despite
aggressive medical treatment _ brings to light many of the issues
that still make dying an unduly painful experience for far too many
people in Western society. The woman writhes with intractable pain
because her doctor fails to order the patient-controlled analgesia
suggested by the oncology nurse. And when she finally takes her
last breath, a team races in with machines ready to revive her even
though her chart clearly states that she does not want to be
resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
   Dying is rarely easy. It is not easy for the person whose end is
near or for family members and friends who love the one who is
dying. It is made no easier when death is unduly prolonged by
life-sustaining medical instruments, when the patient is suffering
from severe pain or other intolerable symptoms, when family members
are forced to make difficult medical decisions without guidance
from the dying person and when the people closest to the dying
person cannot talk openly with the patient about what is happening
and bring their relationships to meaningful closure.
</P>
<P>
   Though in recent decades both families and physicians have begun
to discuss the subject of death and dying more openly, there still
appear to be wide gaps between what patients want for their last
days and what doctors and other health professionals think they
want.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published last month in The Journal of the American
Medical Association, three Toronto experts on aging and dying
reviewed what patients consider to be appropriate care for the end
of life. The team, headed by Dr. Peter A. Singer, a general
internist and ethicist at the University of Toronto, analyzed the
findings of three studies of patients with life-threatening
disorders: 48 patients on dialysis, 40 patients infected with the
virus that causes AIDS and 38 residents in a long-term care
facility. They purposely did not include cancer patients because
most of what is known about end-of-life care has come from previous
studies of people with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted results that could apply across the board to a broad
spectrum of illnesses and that would include the views of people
who are still relatively healthy,'' Dr. Singer said in an
interview. He and his colleagues, Dr. Douglas K. Martin and Dr.
Merrijoy Kelner, concluded that most of the quality-of-care
guidelines that have been promulgated by health professionals in
recent years are either too vague or too specific to be of much
help to patients and their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerns of patients and their families should be central
to what we do because they are at the center of the dying
experience,'' Dr. Singer said. Based on patient interviews, the
Toronto team formulated five concepts that they said could go a
long way toward improving the quality of care at the end of life.
</P>
<P>
   Of greatest importance to patients, the team found, is avoiding
pointless prolongation of life.
</P>
<P>
   Patients said they feared ``lingering'' and ``being kept alive''
by machines after they could no longer enjoy life. Many were
terrified of becoming a ``vegetable'' or living in a coma. As one
patient put it, ``If it ever comes down to being put on a
life-support system, I wouldn't go for it unless there's a chance
that I would come around and be normal again.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients were adamant about wanting to retain control of their
end-of-life care decisions while they were capable of doing so, and
they wanted the proxy of their choice to retain control if they
were no longer able to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But by control, patients did not mean ``micromanaging every
treatment decision as if they were ordering take-out food,'' Dr.
Singer said. ``Rather, they want a sense of control, to know that
their views will be respected and followed.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients interviewed wanted to spare their loved ones of any
serious burdens related to their dying, including having to provide
physical care and having to make decisions about life-sustaining
treatment without guidance from the patient. As one of those
interviewed put it, ``I don't want them making the decisions for me
without knowing how I would decide the same thing. They don't have
to say, `Well, what would he do in this situation?' if it's already
written down.''
</P>
<P>
   The patients also wanted their loved ones to be fully involved
with them in talking about their dying. They said that such
communication strengthened their relationships, even though at
times it required overcoming resistance _ their own and others' _
to deal with such an uncomfortable subject.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, patients wanted to be assured of receiving adequate
treatment for pain and other symptoms, like vomiting, diarrhea and
breathlessness.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Many studies have praised the value of patient-controlled
analgesia both for patients and for the health professionals who
care for them. It allows patients to give themselves pain
medication before pain becomes unbearable and far more difficult to
control.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Singer suggests that you pull together family members and
talk about how each would like to be treated at the end life. Then
there is no indecision or guilt when a son has to order
discontinuation of a feeding tube for a mother dying of
Alzheimer's, or when a wife says no life support for a spouse with
terminal cancer and in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   ``A living will is not just a piece of paper that you fill out
with your doctor or lawyer,'' Dr. Singer said. ``It's really about
facing your death in the context of your family and working with
the family to relieve them of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it is also important if you become a patient in a
medical facility to make your views about end-of-life care known to
the doctors and nurses and to make sure those views are properly
recorded on your chart. If the patient cannot communicate at the
time of hospitalization, family members should inform the staff of
the patient's previously expressed views, especially if these were
recorded in a living will or health care proxy.
</P>
<P>
   As for relief of pain and other debilitating but controllable
symptoms, patients or their families must insist upon it. There is
nothing worse than uncontrolled pain to turn the end of life into
an intolerable nightmare for patients and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors and nurses, too, must participate in improving
end-of-life care by paying as much attention to the needs and
desires of patients as they do to treating illnesses. In ``Wit,''
the doctor has to keep reminding himself that his patient is a
human being with a mind and feelings, not just a rampaging cancer
he is trying desperately _ and unsuccessfully _ to control.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Singer noted, ``For most people, death is not a beautiful
experience. But it ought not to be a terrible one either. By
focusing on issues that are important to patients, most terrible
deaths can be avoided.''

JEAN BALLARIN, 84, FRENCH LEADER OF WORLD WAR II CAVALRY CHARGE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jean Ballarin, who on a day in 1941 drew his saber, spurred his
horse and galloped headlong into French military history, died on
Feb. 3 in his home in Paris. He was 84 and was recalled as the last
man to have led a French cavalry charge.
</P>
<P>
   As cavalry charges go, or went, the one Ballarin led on Jan. 2,
1941, was not much to write home about.
</P>
<P>
   The two dozen Moroccan horsemen under his command simply
happened to spot an Italian army encampment at an Eritrean oasis at
Umbrega. Ballarin, then a 25-year-old noncommissioned French
officer, ordered an impromptu attack, scattering the much larger
enemy force before it could organize a defense.
</P>
<P>
   There were few casualties on either side, and for all the
exhilaration of the whooping charge across the dusty Eritrean
terrain, the skirmish was a minor flourish hardly worth more than a
military footnote _ even to Ballarin's own distinguished career.
</P>
<P>
   He took part in fierce fighting at Alamain and elsewhere in
North Africa, serving as the leader of de Gaulle's personal honor
guard in Algiers, and he took part in the invasion of southern
France and the eventual capture of Hitler's Bavarian mountain
retreat and its famous Tea House aerie.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ballarin, a native of La Villedieu, near Poitiers in
central France, who joined the army at 18 and was eventually sent
to French-controlled Syria, had assured his place in the annals of
French warfare simply by continuing to fight a war the vast
majority of his fellow soldiers had abandoned months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For in the days after the fall of France in June 1940, almost to
a man the French military had sworn allegiance to the
collaborationist Vichy regime. Its leader, Field Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain, commanded such respect that even French forces
stationed abroad, beyond German reach, submitted to Vichy control,
so much so that at one point the British had to bombard a French
fleet in a north African port to prevent Vichy officers from
sailing it off into Nazi hands.
</P>
<P>
   The French forces in Syria had especially close ties to Vichy,
but when de Gaulle issued his famous call to arms from London on
June 18, 1940, Ballarin was among those who rallied to his Free
French cause, although it took a famous stratagem to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the guise of holding training maneuvers, Capt. Paul
Jourdier, the commander of the 1st Squadron of the 1st Regiment of
the Spahis Light Cavalry, assembled his 80 or so men near the
border with Lebanon and the British Palestine Mandate. Then he gave
them the choice of staying behind or following him across the
border to join the British, as Ballarin and some 60 others did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small start to a mighty journey that would win glory
for Ballarin and the Spahis _ a word derived from the same Turkish
stem that produced the native fighters serving under British
commanders known as sepoy in India. In the throats of the Moroccan
horsemen who served for more than a century under French officers,
it seemed more battle cry than name.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month of the Umbrega charge, the 1st Squadron had
exchanged its horses for American-made armored vehicles and mobile
guns, had joined the running fight against the tanks of German
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and had begun an expansion that would
eventually include three further squadrons, one of which was given
the honor of liberating Paris in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   For his service, Ballarin received a more personal honor, the
coveted Cross of the Liberation, awarded to those deemed to have
made the most significant contributions to the Free French cause.
Of the 1,059 holders of the award, about 170 are still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Ballarin, who married de Gaulle's private secretary,
Germaine-Marie Cedart, in Algiers in 1944, with the de Gaulles in
attendance, remained in the army until 1962, when he retired with
the rank of lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   He then joined a Paris insurance company, where he worked until
1980. In addition to his wife, his survivors include four sons,
Charles, Bertrand, Jean-Francois and Jacques.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A World War II cavalry charge may seem quaint, but in a war in
which the Germans used 600,000 horses in their invasion of Russia,
it was not quite an anomaly. The Italians staged a cavalry charge
against the British in Eritrea later in January 1941.
</P>
<P>
   The last American cavalry charge did not come until a year
later, on Jan. 16, 1942, when a polo-playing lieutenant, Edwin
Price Ramsey, led his 26th Cavalry platoon against Japanese
soldiers on the Bataan peninsula in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   And Ballarin's Umbrega charge was not the last cavalry charge
involving the French. Six months later, in an operation that
underscored the significance of Ballarin's decision to break with
Vichy and join the Free French forces in Africa, a British cavalry
unit charged a Vichy French encampment in Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who seem to have a special fondness for cavalry,
did not stage their last charge of the war, by the Gwalior Lancers
in Burma, until 1944, but what is regarded as the last British
cavalry charge did not come until 1953, when the North Frontier
Tribal Police rode down a Mau Mau camp in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to have ended an era, but in warfare it is hard
to be certain.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, British troopers in the King's Royal Hussars began
using horses for operational patrols in Bosnia.

<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton said here on Monday that
``Mexico should not be penalized'' for its performance in the fight
against illicit drugs, leaving little doubt that he plans to
recommend the country to Congress this month as a reliable partner
in the antidrug effort.
</P>
<P>
   With President Ernesto Zedillo listening at his side during a
speech that capped a 23-hour visit here, Clinton praised what he
characterized as the sincerity and valor of the Mexican campaign
against drugs and drug-related corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to acknowledge Mr. Zedllo's efforts in Mexico's
interests to root out this scourge,'' Clinton said to the sustained
applause of Mexican and American officials. ``Much has been said in
my country about the extent of the problem we face. But let's not
forget that what we know in America comes largely from Mexico's
brave efforts to get to the truth and air it. Mexico should not be
penalized for having the courage to confront its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Zedillo presided over an array of discussions among
Cabinet members from both governments on immigration, trade,
conservation and other issues. But because the Clinton
administration has to report to Congress in two weeks on the
cooperation by nations viewed as major drug producers and
transporters, the drugs theme appeared to dominate the meetings
here.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, some American law-enforcement officials have
expressed the view that Mexico's antidrug efforts do not merit a
positive report. The annual White House review of Mexico's drug
performance, those officials say, has become less a study in what
Mexico has accomplished than an exercise in convincing Congress
that what has been done is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   A negative recommendation, called decertification, would set in
motion American trade and economic sanctions against Mexico and
send relations into a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings on Sunday evening and on Monday, Clinton and members
of his Cabinet heard aides to Zedillo, led by Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida, summarize recent antidrug efforts and discuss
a recently announced $500 million initiative. It centers on buying
radar planes, amphibious boats and other equipment to step up
efforts to interdict traffickers and deploying a new national
police force.
</P>
<P>
   In his own speech to several hundred American and Mexican
officials and dignitaries immediately before Clinton's, Zedillo
called the initiative ``the most ambitious strategy in our history
of combatting narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've undertaken this fight because we know its our duty and
because we know it's the duty of all nations,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, while meeting Zedillo at a private hacienda outside
Merida, Clinton was asked by reporters whether he intended to
certify the drug cooperation. He did not answer directly, but left
little doubt about his intentions as he spoke about the Mexican
narcotics industry that smuggles an estimated $15 billion worth of
drugs into the United States each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question is: would we be better off fighting
it together or separately?'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and hundreds of aides
traveled to this capital of the Yucatan peninsula on Sunday
afternoon for his 10th meeting with Zedillo since the Mexican
leader's election in 1994. This was also Clinton's first foreign
venture since his acquittal on Friday in his Senate impeachment
trial.
</P>
<P>
   If the tone adopted by Clinton and Zedillo when talking about
drug issues was invariably somber, at other times it was cordial
and at times exuberantly friendly. The two presidents embraced at
the Merida airport after Clinton's arrival on Sunday and exchanged
jokes before their public addresses on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, Mexican and American officials signed at
least six modest agreements on topics ranging from cooperation in
fighting forest fires to controlling tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno and Mexico's foreign minister,
Rosario Green, signed a joint statement on controlling border
violence, committing both countries to improve cross-border
communication when ``conflicts, assaults, violence and other
threats to public safety occur along the border.'' In the same
statement, the two governments pledged to develop programs to train
police to respond to violent incidents without killing civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The American delegation brought with it commitments from the
Export-Import Bank of the United States to provide up to $4 billion
in loans and loan guarantees over two years to support increased
American exports to Mexico. The fresh money gave officials of both
countries the opportunity to praise the North American Free Trade
Agreement, whose provisions, they said, have allowed Mexico to
surpass Japan as the United States' second-largest export market,
after Canada.
</P>
<P>
   An air transportation agreement signed on Monday will greatly
expand air services between the United States and Mexico, officials
of both countries said. Currently, American and Mexican airlines
have fewer than 100 of the so-called code-sharing arrangements that
allow airlines to sell seats under their own name on another
airline's flights. Applications for code-sharing arrangements on
some 10,000 additional air routes are pending, and the agreement
signed on Monday will allow many of those applications to be
approved, the officials said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If the meetings here were dominated by the upcoming drug
certification, they produced no major new anti-drug agreements.
Meeting with reporters on Monday afternoon, however, Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, Clinton's drug control policy adviser, held up a copy of
a document he called ``Performance Measures of Effectiveness,''
which he said was a list of ``82 variables'' which both governments
will monitor to ensure that both sides are cooperating fully in
anti-drug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's question suggested that the document might be
intended primarily at marshaling support for a drug effort that is
flagging on both sides of the border. McCaffrey disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real documents, this is a real partnership,'' he
said. ``There are planes, boats, training seminars,
intelligence-sharing. There is reality behind all this.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials estimate that two-thirds of the Colombian
cocaine consumed in the United States crosses through Mexico, and
Mexico is also a major producer of marijuana, heroine and
amphetamines. Over the past year, the acreages of drug crops
eradicated by Mexican soldiers and the tonnages of narcotics seized
by police declined. None of the biggest traffickers were arrested,
and none of those already jailed whose extradition the United
States has requested were handed over.

SELF-PROCLAIMED COMPUTER GEEKS HOLD `WINDOWS REFUND DAY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)  (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As mass movements go, Windows Refund Day might not have achieved
the political profile of an anti-war protest or the popular support
of, say, saving the whales. But for a demonstration over computer
software, the turnout Monday was not too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 self-proclaimed computer geeks showed up at
Microsoft Corp. sales offices in several cities to make a public
display of rejecting the software maker's ubiquitous Windows
operating system and of demanding their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by advocates of Linux, a free operating system, the
first March on Microsoft focused on a clause in the Windows license
included with the software that comes installed on personal
computers. That clause states that users who do not agree to the
terms of the license can request a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pay extra money for software they don't need, they
don't want and they're entitled to return,'' said Rick Moen, a
protest organizer in Foster City, Calif., where the largest crowd
gathered on the roof of a parking garage adjacent to the Microsoft
sales office there.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials who met the protesters told them to take it
up with the computer manufacturers who sold them their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But several testimonials published on the Internet in recent
months recount the difficulties users have encountered in obtaining
a refund for Windows, which runs on more than 90 percent of all new
personal computers sold throughout the world. For instance, most
new machines are set up to boot Windows automatically when a user
turns them on. And in a classic Catch-22, that in itself apparently
constitutes an implied acceptance of the license, even though there
is no way to get rid of the Windows operating system without
turning the computer on in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Dell Computer and Micron Computer, two of the
major manufacturers, said their policy was to give refunds within
30 days to customers who are not satisfied with their systems, but
they said they did not give refunds for Windows alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do customers, with very rare exceptions, expect their
computer to come with an operating system, but they, with very rare
exceptions, expect that operating system to be Windows,'' said T.R.
Reid, a Dell spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as though the refund would pay for a new monitor. The
few who have reported success have apparently received between $25
and $50. But protesters insisted that the point was not the money
but choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of money,'' said Mike Schiraldi, 20, who wore a
faded Atari T-shirt and black Keds sneakers to the small
demonstration in midtown Manhattan Monday. ``It's just the idea
that you're forced to buy Windows when there are better
alternatives out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, that perception supports a central point the
Microsoft defense team is trying to make in the company's
continuing antitrust battle with the Department of Justice. Company
executives have several times pointed to the growing popularity of
Linux as proof that contrary to the Justice Department's claims,
Microsoft is not a monopoly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That may be why the company deputized several executives and
public relations representatives to meet the demonstrators with
open arms. In New York and Foster City, demonstrators were handed a
letter that began, ``Dear Valued Customer'' and emphasized that
``fundamentally you, the consumer, have a choice of operating
systems and PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the protest organizers also aimed to bring to the public's
attention other of Microsoft business practices. A 1995 consent
decree between the Justice Department and Microsoft prohibited the
company from requiring computer manufacturers to pay for Windows on
every computer sold whether or not the operating system had been
installed.
</P>
<P>
   But even without that requirement, critics assert that the
company continues to use its market clout to ensure that nearly all
new personal computers come with Windows pre-installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't have the knowledge to understand what
Microsoft is doing,'' said Jordan Coleman, president of NetMonger,
an Internet service provider on Long Island. ``We know there are
technically superior choices. So for us, it's a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   In Foster City, protesters carried signs reading ``Pro-choice?''
and ``What part of `refund' don't you understand?'' One protester
shouted, ``Let my people free.'' Protesters who tried to get to
Microsoft's ninth-floor offices in Foster City found the elevators
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, fewer than a dozen computer users with an aversion
to Microsoft products met a representative outside the World Wide
Plaza on Eighth Avenue before retreating to a hotel room across the
street to install free software on new computers in preparation for
a refund request. About a dozen protesters gathered at Microsoft
offices in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reports were sketchier from New Zealand, the Netherlands and
Japan, where demonstrations had also been planned.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody got a refund.
</P>
<P>
   But by one measure, the protest might have been a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the whole idea of not having any one company
control the operating system market,'' said Peter Lehrer, a
39-year-old accountant who drove in from Leonia, N.J., to attend
the New York event. A Windows user, Lehrer is considering
switching: ``I just wanted to see what this was all about.''

AFTER MINORS, BURNS GLAD TO BE BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bob Burns is back with an exclamation mark.
</P>
<P>
   The former area amateur star, banished to golf's minor leagues
after two years on the PGA Tour, makes his homecoming this week as
1998 Nike Tour champion and money-leader.
</P>
<P>
   Burns will be playing in the Nissan Open at Riviera Country
Club, barely 20 miles from Cal State Northridge, where he won the
NCAA Division II individual title as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time coming and I feel like I worked pretty
hard to get back,'' said Burns, who lost his PGA Tour card after
finishing 191st on the money list at the end of the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   Without exemptions, a finish higher than 130 means an exit from
The Show, and Burns went back to work on his game along with the
rest of golf's professional hopefuls, putting in time on the Golden
State and Nike tours.
</P>
<P>
   The Nike Tour eventually provided his springboard back to golf's
major league when Burns won last year's championship and topped
that tour's money list with $178,664.
</P>
<P>
   He said he definitely appreciates being back after earning
$237,411 in his first two years on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I took for granted what I had the last time I was out
here,'' Burns said last week at the Buick Invitational. ``I think
I'm a better player now. I'm working harder at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The work showed at the Buick, where Burns shot 6-under-par 66 in
the first round and finished tied for 18th to bring home $37,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paychecks are better here,'' he said of the biggest
difference between the Nike and PGA Tours. ``There's a lot of depth
out here, obviously, and the depth on the Nike Tour is getting
larger and larger. Every year, you see a lot of great players
coming to the Nike Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm a great player or one of the great players,
but it's a good proving ground. I think guys have fared well that
have come through the Nike Tour to get back out here, or to get
here for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns didn't need the Nike Tour for his first trip to the PGA
Tour. He got here by placing 11th in the 1993 Tour Qualifying
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He made 23 cuts in 55 attempts in that two-year stay, ranking
101st his first season before plummeting the next year, when his
golf career was interrupted early by the January Northridge
Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to the work of getting back on top, something Cal
State Northridge golf coach Jim Bracken had no doubt Burns could
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when he was at Northridge that he would be able to play
up there,'' Bracken said of Burns, whose 1990 scoring average of
73.1 remains a school record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a solid player and a great ball striker.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns' ball-striking ability showed early in his comeback, when
he shot a 63 at Brookside No. 1 in a 1997 Golden State Tour event,
a course record he shares with Tom Weiskopf.
</P>
<P>
   Burns thinks all-around play is what got him back to the tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past year, I haven't had any major weaknesses,'' he
said. ``I haven't done anything exceptionally well except score _
which is a good thing to be doing well. And that comes from hitting
the ball in fairways a lot and on the greens and being fairly
proficient around the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns believes he plays better on tough courses which emphasize
ball-striking skills more than length. That makes him optimistic
about doing well at tight, tree-lined Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason Burns is glad to be playing in the
Nissan. He had hoped, as one of Valencia's touring professionals,
to get a sponsor's exemption last year, when the tournament was
held at Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bitter,'' he said. ``I still am, especialy the
way the year ended up for me. It was like, `Gee, I was worthy of an
exemption.' ''

EHRLICHMAN, NIXON AIDE WHO WENT TO PRISON OVER WATERGATE, DEAD AT
73 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Wash., N.M., Calif. ) (nk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John D. Ehrlichman, who served as President Nixon's
pugnacious defender and domestic policy chief and went to prison
for his role in the Watergate scandals, died Sunday at his home in
Atlanta. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman had been suffering from diabetes for about a year,
his son Tom said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After serving time in prison for conspiracy and other counts,
Ehrlichman made a new life for himself in 1978, first as a writer
living in Santa Fe, N.M., and for the past several years as a
senior vice president of Law Environmental, an Atlanta-based
engineering company engaged in hazardous-waste handling, his son
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ehrlichman, of Seattle, said that, in his later years, his
father continued to feel ``remorse for the impact on his family''
that his wrongdoing had caused, along with the hope that history
would recall the accomplishments of the Nixon administration, not
just its crimes.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Nixon presidency in 1969, John Daniel
Ehrlichman was a central figure, first as domestic-policy chieftain
in the White House, and later as a participant in the Watergate
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   When five men were caught during a burglary at the headquarters
of the Democratic National Committee in Washington's Watergate
complex on June 17, 1972, the incident at first was airily
dismissed by Nixon aides as a ``third-rate burglary,'' with no
connection to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But as investigations unfolded, it was revealed that the
burglars had links either to the White House or to the Nixon
campaign's Committee to Re-Elect the President and were trying to
fix a faulty listening device installed during an earlier break-in.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations (and the president's own tape-recordings)
would also disclose that Nixon and some of his top aides had begun
an effort to cover up White House involvement in the break-in
almost from the start. Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, rather than
face all but certain impeachment and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Nixon aides were implicated in Watergate and related
crimes, some for relatively peripheral roles. The most important
case involved Ehrlichman and three other high-ranking officials:
former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who died in 1988; Nixon's
chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and Robert C. Mardian, a former
assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial lasting two and a half months, all were convicted
on Jan. 1, 1975, of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury.
They were sentenced to two and a half to eight years in prison,
though Mardian's conviction was overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman's sentence was made concurrent with a term of 20
months to five years imposed on him for his role in the September
1971 break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding was a psychiatrist who had been treating Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, who had said publicly that he had given journalists a
copy of a secret government study of U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War. A covert White House unit, known as ``the plumbers''
and answerable to Ehrlichman, was assigned to find and plug such
``leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The plumbers' break-in at the psychiatrist's office, apparently
in quest of material damaging to Ellsberg, did not become public
until some two and a half years after it was committed, and it
added to the White House embarrassment over the burgeoning
Watergate scandal. Indeed, Ehrlichman later referred to the
Fielding break-in as ``the seminal Watergate episode,'' one that
set the tone for all the cover-ups to follow.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ehrlichman entered prison in Stafford, Ariz., in the
fall of 1976, deciding not to wait until his appeals were
exhausted, Nixon had been pardoned by President Gerald R. Ford and
was trying to rehabilitate his reputation for history.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman had already undergone a major life change after his
conviction. He had left his first wife, Jeanne, and their Seattle
home and moved to Santa Fe, where he began to write.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from prison, Ehrlichman returned to New Mexico
to resume his writing career and to give occasional lectures. He
wrote four novels and a memoir, 1982's ``Witness to Power'' (Simon
and Schuster), in which he reflected on his relationship with the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss Richard Nixon very much,'' he wrote. ``Richard
Nixon probably doesn't much miss me either.''
</P>
<P>
   His association with Nixon began because he had known Haldeman
while both were attending the University of California at Los
Angeles. After graduating from Stanford University Law School, he
joined a Los Angeles firm before starting his own law firm in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman specialized in zoning and land-use law and made many
acquaintances in politics. Haldeman recruited him to help out in
Nixon's 1960 campaign for the presidency and again for Nixon's
unsuccessful run for governor of California in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman went back to practicing law in Seattle, then became a
strategist in Nixon's 1968 campaign for president. In his role as
White House counsel and later as chief domestic-policy adviser,
Ehrlichman became known as the ``White House fireman,''
extinguishing political and bureaucratic brush fires before they
became public.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors referred to Ehrlichman and Haldeman together as ``the
Berlin wall,'' because they were said to shield the reclusive,
occasionally paranoid president from unpleasant news and
unpalatable choices.
</P>
<P>
   But another perspective was offered by Theodore H. White in
``The Making of the President 1972.'' Writing before the Watergate
scandal began, White said of Ehrlichman: ``His shop was one of the
few at the White House where ideas were seriously entertained _
good ideas, too, on energy, on land-use policy, on urbanization, on
preservation of the American environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman is survived by his wife, Karen Hilliard; four sons,
two daughters and his mother, Lillian.

 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS; BLACKHISTORY-BIOS at end of file
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Editor's Note: The following dialogues were culled from
extensive sit-down interviews with each individual. Reporter John
Keilman conducted the tape-recorded interviews and edited
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ America was a nation in metamorphosis after 1910.
A dream of neutrality gave way to war, and the United States sent
its young men to fight and die in the trenches of France.
</P>
<P>
   Inventions such as the automobile and the radio began to gain
popularity, spreading mobility, culture and sophistication across
the land. Labor unions demanded a better deal, and women demanded
the vote. Yet some things appeared stuck in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's blacks, with more than 50 years of emancipation
behind them, were still brutally segregated and subject to racial
violence. More than 70 were lynched in 1920. Abject conditions in
the South prompted many to come North, launching what would come to
be known as The Great Migration.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz Age of the 1920s brought prohibition and prosperity,
but the good times crashed to a halt when the stock market
imploded, forcing the country into depression. Many blacks,
intimately familiar with hardship, scarcely noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the rumblings of protest were beginning. The Scottsboro
boys, nine black young men accused of raping two white women,
gained vocal white supporters. The NAACP Legal Defense and
Education Fund began attacking segregation laws. Smaller protests
and boycotts also took hold.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1930s ended, the country again found itself at a turning
point. A new war was coming. And this one would change everything.
</P>
<P>
   NED WOOD: I was born in a small place _ Aragon, Ga. It's 52
miles from Atlanta. I'm not sure how many people were there. Wasn't
very many. Didn't even have a traffic light. Most everyone farmed
there, and that's what our family did. My father also worked in a
cement plant.
</P>
<P>
   It was me and my parents and my brothers and sisters. Five
sisters and three brothers. There were nine of us children. I was
in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   We raised our own meat. Raised our own hogs. We would slaughter
our hogs and butcher them, and then we would cure it with salt. Of
course, we mostly ate pork chops right after we slaughtered the
hogs. We didn't have refrigeration.
</P>
<P>
   YVONNE WALKER-TAYLOR: I was born in New Bedford, Mass. My father
was the pastor of a little A.M.E church there. He married my mother
when he was a student at Boston University School of Theology. He
was assigned the church to which she belonged, and he claimed that
my grandmother paraded the three sisters in front of him to let him
have his choice in terms of marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN LEE JACKSON: I'm a native Daytonian, born May 13, 1911, at
206 Dunbar Ave. I'm the second of six. All the others are boys. Our
mother passed at an early age. I was nine when she died. She was
having children so fast at her age and the last child that was
born, why, she died from it.
</P>
<P>
   My father was Rueben W. Lee. He worked at Andrew's Bakery as a
truck driver making deliveries. At that time they had a horse and
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   At our house, we had an outside toilet. We had water in our
kitchen, so in that way we were very fortunate. We had a large,
old-fashioned coal stove in the kitchen, and then we had what they
called an ice box that held 100 pounds of ice. The ice man would
come around three times a week with 100 pounds of ice.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE COOPER: I was born in Washington, N.C., a small Southern
town with approximately 8,000 population. As you can well imagine,
it was completely segregated.
</P>
<P>
   At that point in time, at least in my experience, racism was not
only pronounced and prevalent, it was to a large extent accepted as
a fact of life. We didn't have an NAACP in those days. We had a
black doctor in town, a black dentist, obviously all-black
churches. It was, to put it very succinctly, a strictly segregated
situation _ black here, white there, and never the twain shall
meet.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I went to school until the seventh grade. It's about
equivalent to a high-school education now.
</P>
<P>
   I went to school in a one-room rural school. All classes, one
through seven, were in that one room. It wasn't too hard to teach
in that school because there wasn't that many in each grade. There
was about 50 kids at first, but as different ones would graduate,
there was less, down to about 30 students.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: When we left Bedford I must have been about 5
years old. Daddy went to Raleigh, N.C. Shaw University had an
elementary school attached to it and I went to it.
</P>
<P>
   I liked school because I was an only child and going to school
was just my piece of cake. I've always been a funny, outgoing
person. I'm making friends and I'm talking to everybody, and I
picked up one of the books. My father and the teacher went out of
the room to do some paperwork and when they came back I'm reading
the book to the kids.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher said, ``Oh, ho ho ho, she can't stay in this class.
What am I gonna teach her?'' So that was my first skip. I skipped
the first grade.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was never a working mother, except working in the
home. She devoted her time to teaching me how to read. When I was 4
years old I was reading.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I only went to school here in Dayton through the third
grade. When my mother was dying, she requested that I stay with her
aunt in Detroit, Mich. I was there three years and then my father
brought me back to go to Winchester, Ky., and stay with his sister.
I was there for five years.
</P>
<P>
   In Detroit, the schools had all kinds of children there. In the
community where I stayed, there was a lot of Jewish people, Greek
and Italian. There were segregated schools there, too, but not the
one that I went to.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky, those schools were segregated. And the teachers
weren't as knowledgeable as the teachers that were in Detroit. The
fourth-grade teacher, it seemed like she was out more often than
others. They would allow me to teach that grade in her absence.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I obviously went to a segregated school. Fortunately, by
the time I came along _ and I'm number seven in a family of 11 kids
_ a black person could go through high school in Washington. My
older brothers and sisters had to go away to go to high school. It
stopped at the eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   I think our family was very fortunate. My mother and father were
staunch believers in education, though my father stopped school in
the fourth grade and my mother stopped school in the third grade.
They drilled into us from the time we were pups that in order to
get along in this world you've got to have something in your head.
And I'm happy to say because of their foresightedness, their
industry and their pluck, 10 of us got at least a college degree.
The 11th one died before she was a year old.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I remember one little racial incident. We kept our mules
in our neighbors' pasture, and this white kid and I, we had some
harsh words between us. I had a feeling he was going to threaten me
when I came for the mules, so I took my father's .38 pistol.
</P>
<P>
   I was on my way home with our mules and he called to me, ``Wait
up, there!'' So I waited. He put his hand in his pocket and pulled
out some shells. He said, ``I left my gun up there in the bushes.''
I reached in that jacket pocket, took that .38 out and said, ``I
didn't leave mine.''
</P>
<P>
   He took off. He thought I might use it. My father and his
father, they talked it over, and there wasn't no more said about
it.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: My father was an activist and he believed in
freedom and rights of life. There he was, a West Indian in the
southern South with the largest church in Raleigh. A reporter was
at the church every Sunday taking down what he said because he had
urged the people to vote and had classes to teach them how to go to
the polls and vote. So the whites did not like him in Raleigh.
There was an attempt to kidnap me, believe it or not.
</P>
<P>
   It was about 1924. They put this black teen-ager up to saying
that my father had been in an automobile accident and wanted me. My
teacher was a member of my father's church and she smelled a rat.
She just didn't believe it so she called the church and my daddy
answered the phone. She said, ``Dr. Walker, are you all right?'' He
said, ``What do you mean?''
</P>
<P>
   The kid got out of there as fast as he could. There were two
white guys in a car outside and this black teen-ager. So from then
on my parents were afraid to let me out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: When I came home from Kentucky, my brother had an
infected knee. I came home to help my father. I didn't work outside
the home at first, but when I did start, well, my first job was at
a ready-to-wear store named Thal's on Main Street. I was a stock
girl for $9 a week. The white women were salesladies. It wasn't
possible for a black person to be a saleslady at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton was a prejudiced place. As far as the jobs were, you
didn't get to have the good jobs like they have now. You had to
take the minor jobs.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: The realization of racism came on me in a gradual way. I
think it came on most kids in a gradual way, both white and black.
</P>
<P>
   My father was a sheet metal worker by trade. The bulk of his
clientele was white. I picked up the trade from him, and I think it
dawned on me one day that it was pretty strange that if we were
doing a roof and it was time for lunch, we'd have to come down and
go home to eat.
</P>
<P>
   It also began dawning on me that something was wrong because we
lived between a black school and a white school, almost in the
middle. So there was passage both ways. But all the students going
this way was white, and all of them going that way was black.
</P>
<P>
   That started me thinking about the separation of the races, and
beginning to wonder how stupid this is, and in my judgment, how
unnecessary and wrong it is. And that was as a kid, 8 years old. I
used to talk to my older brothers at that time, and my father and
my mother and say, ``Why do we have to live like this?''
</P>
<P>
   You began to wonder more and more, as you lived through that
kind of experience, ``What in the world is going on? There seems to
be something wrong here.'' And you talk to your parents, and your
parents suggest to you that, ``Yes, George, it is wrong, but it's a
way of life. We have to live with it. Trust in the Lord. And if we
do that, things will change and your life will be much better than
ours. And indeed, that's the reason we're insisting that each one
of you kids gets as much education as you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if you get it upstairs, nobody can take it away from
you. And if you get it upstairs and can produce something _
whatever it is _ that's worthwhile, you will become recognized for
that production if nothing else. You will also be able to support
yourself and live a reasonably decent life.''
</P>
<P>
   So that was pounded into us from the kneecap up.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: Of course we always had separate schools and separate
restrooms in that little town. About five or six miles away they
had an eating place, and we knew we weren't allowed to eat there.
My brother and his wife, they came back to visit, and they climbed
up on the stools to be served and they told them they couldn't
serve them.
</P>
<P>
   There was other times we could buy something like ice cream and
pop, but we had to take it with us. We couldn't eat it there. I was
about 6 then.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: You just didn't go to the places you weren't allowed to
go in Dayton. In the cafeteria which was on Fourth Street, you
couldn't go there at that time.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: In the Depression, life sure changed. We lost our farm in
1931. One year we had boll weevils. Boll weevils are something that
will eat and eat the cotton. Our biggest source of income was from
cotton, so we lost it. That's when I had to start working for the
white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dollar a day from sunup to sundown. I remember working
for one farmer with 100 laying hens. They only paid me a dollar a
day, and I would take about 3 dozen eggs. I could sell them for 1
cent each. That gave me $1.36 for a day of work.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't live on that kind of money, but my father was still
working at the cement plant. My money helped, though.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: My father was moved to St. James Church in
Cleveland. It's a whole different life to be the daughter of a
preacher of the largest A.M.E church in Cleveland. I wanted to take
ballet lessons because some of the doctors' kids and lawyers' kids
in Cleveland _ black kids _ were taking ballet. I loved to dance
and I thought that was just wonderful, but I wasn't allowed to
because in those days a preacher's kid wasn't supposed to take any
dancing lessons. So I took piano lessons. My father would also play
miniature golf with me and he taught me to play tennis.
</P>
<P>
   I had a very comfortable life. I never remember wanting for
anything and we always had tons of food during the Depression. I
don't remember any hardships at all.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: You know, you were fortunate to have a job then. They
had a food line in Dayton where you would have to go get your food,
but we never had to do that.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I remember things changing drastically for my town. But
the farms had to go on, so the people had to have tobacco flues
built. They had to have the stoves fixed in the house so that they
could keep warm. They had to keep the roofs in reasonably good
order. We ate very well even during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   During that time there were an awful lot of people in real
trouble financially, and people actually walking the streets
begging. Not like the kind of thing we see here. These people had
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Word got around that the Coopers lived halfway well, and people
would come to the house for handouts. Interestingly enough, white
and black would come. And I can never remember my mother refusing
anybody who knocked on that door. From a sandwich to going out in
the yard and wringing a chicken's neck and giving them a chicken.
And that's how I was brought up.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I left Georgia in 1936. My sister sent for me to come to
Xenia, Ohio, to work in her husband's barber shop. They eventually
built a pool room and I worked there, too. I got pretty good
shooting pool from practicing all day when there wasn't nobody else
to shoot with. I would get high and call some shots that looked
impossible to make, and I would make them.
</P>
<P>
   I left Xenia and came to Dayton when I was 23. At that time,
there wasn't hardly any employment for African-Americans. Just
laborer and janitor work.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: Right after high school I wanted to go to Spelman
College in Atlanta but Daddy wouldn't let me. It was too far. He
sent me to Howard because he knew the dean of women and also the
president. He thought that they could keep tabs on me.
</P>
<P>
   So I took off to Washington, D.C., and boy, did I ever have a
good time. You talk about ``free at last, free at last, thank God
almighty I'm free at last!'' That was unheard of, for me not to
have somebody around checking on everything I was doing.
</P>
<P>
   I went to school on occasion, when I felt like going to school.
Most of the time I went roller skating. I just had a good time and
I just practically flunked out.
</P>
<P>
   When I turned 16 I went out to celebrate. About five of us girls
went out to Richmond, Va., to roller skate. We left at 10 o'clock
in the morning and we didn't get back till 9:30 that night, and
when I got back the dean said to me, ``Yvonne, your father's
here.'' I almost died.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy was fit to be tied. Oh God, he talked to everybody from
the president to the dean of living to the trustee board to
everybody. Why didn't they know where his 16-year-old daughter was?
So he said, ``Enjoy the next two months, 'cause you're not coming
back here.''
</P>
<P>
   He brought me to Wilberforce University, where he was on the
board of trustees. Wilberforce is 177 miles from Cleveland, so
that's a short haul. He could catch me anytime. So he put me down
at Wilberforce and I graduated from here.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I went to college in 1933. Hampton Institute. Right
across the bay from Norfolk, Va. It was a full-fledged college with
a trade school attached to it. You could go there and take a trade
and then go back and work at your trade, which I had intended to
do. Then I decided that if I'm going to stay this long, I might as
well stay an extra two years and get a degree.
</P>
<P>
   It so happened that I have a halfway good singing voice. So that
the first year I was at Hampton I got to be a member of the student
quartet. And our job was to go wherever they sent us _ sometimes
quite a distance from campus _ in a fund-raising effort. We would
get paid for that: 25 cents an hour.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to that, about six miles away was Fort Monroe. Big
military installation. Right next to it was the Chamberlain Hotel.
We would go down at least twice a month, weekends, and sing in the
dining room at the Chamberlain Hotel. They let us keep that money.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of exposure, as you can imagine, immediately puts you
in contact with a lot of different kinds of people. Occasionally,
somebody would come up and just chat with you. Occasionally,
someone would come up and say, ``Well, I can send some money to the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, you'd have the biggest bigot in the world sitting
there wanting to know what the hell you're doing in this hotel.
Even singing! Even entertaining him! What the hell are you doing in
here?
</P>
<P>
   So you had a chance to interact and meet with all types of
people. They were all white. This was the Chamberlain Hotel. The
only black folks there worked in the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   That interaction started your think processes to go deeper into
this whole business of race relations.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: After I graduated from Wilberforce University, I
went right on to Boston University, where I got a Master of Arts in
English. Then I came here to teach in high school. That was my
first job and my father really had a eagle eye on me then because
he built a house here in Wilberforce in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   I remember voting here. My father believed in the vote. He
thought you were stupid if you did not vote. He said that's the one
thing that you have to fight with.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I don't think my mother and father ever voted in Georgia.
They weren't allowed to. They just told them they couldn't vote,
and we didn't pursue it.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I married in 1936 to Leroy Williams. He had a dry
cleaning store on Sixth Street in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: After I graduated, the NYA _ National Youth
Administration _ set up a training program over at Wilberforce. It
needed all kinds of skilled people to work there, including someone
to teach aircraft sheet metal work. I responded to what must have
been an ad, and in rather short order I got an invitation to come
up to Columbus for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, I had my own sheet metal business, and I had
studied sheet metal work at Hampton. So I came up to Columbus. I
walked in for the interview and said, ``How do you do, Mr.
So-And-So, my name's George Cooper.'' And he said, ``What can I do
for you, George?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Well, I'm here for the interview.'' He said, ``I
expect you've made the trip in vain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the job's taken?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it's still open. But you can't do the work. I've never
seen nor heard of a black sheet metal worker. And I just don't
think you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Furious on the inside, I responded to him along these lines:
``Sir, I was invited to come for this interview, and I suspect I
was invited based on material I sent in in terms of my background.
It cost a lot of money to come up here. I think that the least you
could do for me is to not only continue with the interview, but to
give me an opportunity to document and demonstrate my capability as
a sheet metal worker.''
</P>
<P>
   He studied for a while and said, ``You know, that might make
some sense. Now, we've got a shop down on the campus at
Wilberforce, fully equipped. Here's a set of plans for an ordinary
metal locker. Everything you need to make that locker is in that
shop down there. If you can take these plans and turn out a locker
in a week, it's your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, I called him up and told him his locker was
ready.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: The movies in Xenia were segregated in the 1930s.
One movie wouldn't let us in and we picketed that movie. The white
kids at Antioch came over and helped us.
</P>
<P>
   There was another, the Little Xenia Theater, that sat on Main
Street. They would let us in there, but we would have to sit on the
left all the time. But the other man said no blacks in the theater.
</P>
<P>
   Our dean of women was very, very light-skinned. She went and
bought a whole rack of tickets and gave them to all the black kids.
We had a ticket and we waltzed in and white kids sat beside us and
he had to run the movie. The movie was full. I'll never forget
that.
</P>
<P>
   I think having lived in this part of the country, I did not
experience much of the segregation that was so obvious in the
South. But that one thing just gave me such a thrill when we were
able to just go in there and open it up.
</P>
<P>
   We finally broke the manager down. He left and somebody else
took over the management. From then on, the movie was open. You sat
anywhere you wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I got married in 1939. My cousin took a boyfriend away
from a friend, and she in turn introduced me to her friend because
I was similar to the man she stole. By 1944, I had a family. I had
two children. Another one was born in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, I had been drafted.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Drastic changes on horizon
 &HT;    WITH BLACKHISTORY-BIOS at end of file
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _
</P>
<P>
   Editor's Note: The following dialogues were culled from
extensive sit-down interviews with each individual. Reporter John
Keilman conducted the tape-recorded interviews and edited
dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   THE STORY THUS FAR: George Cooper, after a childhood of
near-total segregation, has received a college degree and become a
sheet metal instructor in Wilberforce. Ellen Lee Jackson, who grew
up in West Dayton, has taken a job as a stock girl in a clothing
store, though her race has precluded her from the more prestigious
position of saleslady. Yvonne Walker-Taylor has received a master's
degree in English and returned to the Miami Valley, where she
helped desegregate a Xenia movie theater. Ned Wood, a young man
from rural Georgia, has moved to Dayton to take a job at
Frigidaire.
</P>
<P>
   But for everyone, life is about to change drastically. World War
II is under way.
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN LEE JACKSON: My husband went into the military, but he
only stayed three months because of his health. He didn't make it,
but the next two brothers under me went. Joseph W. Lee went into
the Air Force. He never went any farther than California. Wallace
Lee went into the Army and went to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Did he survive? Very much.
</P>
<P>
   YVONNE WALKER-TAYLOR: There were dozens of men I knew who were
drafted. Oh my God. All of my classmates, some of my ex-boyfriends
that I dated when I was in college. One of the students in the high
school went overseas today and tomorrow he dead. His first name was
Mark. Oh, there was sorrow around when Mark died.
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE COOPER: I went back to Hampton, where we were training
metalsmiths for the Navy. By that point, I was old enough to
rationalize that if I worked in a defense industry, I was indeed
making a contribution to the country. And I would much prefer doing
that than to go into the service.
</P>
<P>
   I literally did not want to go in the service. I had an
impression that the service was very, very restrictive. And that
you had to do anything that they said to do. That sort of concept
just sort of rubbed me the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   I had gone to Hampton with the promise of being kept out of the
service. But while I was on this job, maybe a couple of years
later, the commanding officer said, ``I can't do any more. You've
got to go in. But you will not be sorry. As a matter of fact, I
think you might be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   He never would tell me what he had in mind. What he had in mind
was officer candidate school.
</P>
<P>
   NED WOOD: I went to Fort Sill, Okla. I was in an artillery unit.
It was segregated. The Army was segregated all through the war. It
wasn't until the late 1940s that they integrated.
</P>
<P>
   We were treated fairly good. But they lured a lot of the blacks
into battle where they would be slaughtered, heavy casualties.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the quartermaster service, though. We took supplies to
the fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I thought the men should enlist. I thought they should
go. I thought if you were an American you did what you were
supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: The white folks' war. That's what it was. That's
how it went down. But you still were struggling for recognition and
freedom; therefore, to do a Muhammad Ali was just out of the
question. You're not going to refuse to go. You're gonna go because
that's the way to prove that you're glad you're in America.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of this did not make you sorry you were an American.
You're glad you're an American, but you just hated the fact that
the white folks never gave you a chance to participate in a good
life. You had to fight for everything.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I don't know who made the detailed decisions, but they
made the decision that they would pull 16 guys out of the service,
from the ranks of the enlisted men, and send them up to Great
Lakes, Ill., and start them through officer training.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't really know what our orders said until we got there
and were in the barracks, and discovered that here we are, 16 black
guys, and were supposed to go into Officer Candidate School.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, there were approximately 100,000 black sailors.
The first night we were together, we said, ``Now, here we are.
We're here to be tried and tested. And what happens to us is going
to determine the fate of black participation at the officer level
for decades to come in the United States Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   We represented thousands of black sailors, each one of us did.
That's an awesome responsibility, if you take it seriously. If
George screws up, he ain't screwing up just for George. He's
screwing up for a hell of a lot of other people.
</P>
<P>
   Because the country as a whole didn't want it. Not just the
Navy, the country didn't want it. Because at that point in time, we
were still very much a segregated society.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: The war was just about over when we got there. We landed
in Liverpool on New Year's Eve, 1944. The Englishwomen met us. We
weren't supposed to go out because one of the soldiers died from
meningitis. We were supposed to be quarantined. We didn't pay
attention to that. We ran out of there.
</P>
<P>
   There was a man shortage, because most of the men between 18 and
45 were all in the service. The women didn't have any men, so they
were real vulnerable. We started keeping company with them.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't have been a possibility in the South. No way, uh
uh. No. But it wasn't a hard transition. We were glad!
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: We did pretty well out here with the rationing. I
remember even getting nylons some way and those were key items. I
think our dietary demands precluded any suffering or want. We ate
things that white folks didn't like most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: We pledged that we would either sink or swim together.
We were going to make the damn thing work, or we would all fail
together. There were 16 of us in the class. They commissioned 12 of
us and made one a warrant officer.
</P>
<P>
   It hurt him so that he didn't make it, until a year later he
committed suicide. He didn't make it because of grades. The other
three, nobody knows why they didn't make it. We have finally
decided amongst ourselves that the Navy intended to do 12. They
said, ``We'll put 16 in and four will drop out.'' And when the four
didn't drop out, they stuck with the 12.
</P>
<P>
   The commanding officer at Great Lakes at that time was a General
Armstrong, who was the son of the founder of Hampton Institute,
where I had went to college, and obviously had ties to the
institution. Under normal circumstances, when a class would go
through training, you'd have a commencement exercise, the whole 9
yards. We never had that. We were called in individually, and
handed our certificates over a desk from the CO. and a handshake,
then back to the barracks where you get your orders.
</P>
<P>
   So I walked in and he said, ``Cooper, you're what we call a
hell-raiser in the Navy.'' I said, ``Sir, I haven't even been on
report since I've been in the Navy. I don't understand what you're
talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, don't you remember in your young life you getting in a
fight with a white boy down in Washington, N.C.?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``Yes, sir. If that's what you call being a hell-raiser,
I'm a hell raiser. He called me a nigger on the wrong day, and we
went at it.''
</P>
<P>
   That obviously had to be someplace in the record, in my
personnel folder. Because the FBI, we subsequently discovered, went
back to the time each of the 16 of us were born. The FBI had
records on us that were half a book.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think what was in his mind ever adversely affected me in
the service, because we were immediately transferred out of there,
and each of us went our separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I just loaded and unloaded trucks. Most of the time I rode
with the driver. I was his helper. I didn't do much loading or
unloading. I was kind of slick.
</P>
<P>
   One part of England we were stationed in was called Birmingham.
The white soldiers, they wanted the pubs to be segregated. They
didn't want the blacks in the same one they were in. So one of the
guys came back to camp and told the sergeant, and the sergeant blew
the whistle and called everyone out to attention. He told us,
``Right face and forward march,'' and we marched down to the pub.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much of a fight. One Southern guy said, ``You know,
if we were down home we wouldn't be in the same place.'' This guy
grabbed him by the collar and said, ``You're not down home now!''
</P>
<P>
   Pow! He hit him and the guy slid down, like a snake sliding down
on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the pub was going through with the segregation. It
was an exclusive place with music and dancing and microphones. He
suggested that we go upstairs and the white soldiers stay
downstairs. We went upstairs and got on that microphone and started
crooning. All the women came up to where we were, left the white
soldiers down there.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: The Navy sent me back to Hampton, where I became
personnel officer. I was the only black man within 500 miles in a
naval officer's uniform. If you are familiar with Tidewater, Va.,
it's nothing but Navy. They build the ships in Newport News, which
is right around the corner. The Norfolk Naval Base is right across
the water. Everywhere you go, there's Navy. So a black officer in
that situation stuck out like a sore thumb, naturally.
</P>
<P>
   And now, as always, there are good people and bad people in this
world. Decent people and not so decent people in this world. And a
goodly number of those sailors just didn't want it to happen, as
evidenced by this young man who walked up in front of my face in
Newport News one day, my wife and my daughter to my side, put his
fingers to my face and said, ``I never thought I'd see one of you,
and I hope I never see another one.''
</P>
<P>
   He was going to beat me or I was going to beat him that day,
because he said this in front of my wife and baby. But Peg put her
hands on my shoulder and said, ``George, it's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: After we went to France, they took us way out to rest up.
We were supposed to get rested up and get ready to go to Japan. We
were supposed to go to the Pacific. But instead of us resting, we
went to Paris. I was in Europe nine months.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: I got married in 1941. My husband was
substituting in the Air Force. I went down to Tuskegee with him in
1941.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the 332nd and he did 61 missions over Italy
and all of that good stuff. We were right on the military base. We
had these long, connected houses and maids that came in and
cleaned. He was a captain, a real big shot, you know, and we had
everything that you could want to eat from the PX.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: As personnel officer, I had to sign your leave request,
whether it's normal, sick, whatever. If I had trouble with you on
the base, I had the authority to call you in for captain's mast.
That's where you are brought on the carpet. We raise hell with you
and hand out punishment.
</P>
<P>
   But I would say to one of my yeomen in the personnel office,
``When John gets ready to go on leave, for whatever reason, you
send him in to see me.'' And I would bring you into my office like
we're talking here now, with the idea in mind that by the time you
left my office, you would perceive of me as being a human being and
not a black son-of-a-bitch. It worked most of the time. I'm sure it
did not work all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: When the war ended, a few people felt things were
going to change for black people, but the average person knew
better. They knew that that wasn't going to do it because when our
fellows came back, the prejudice was just as great to the black men
in uniform as it was to the black men not in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: You could get jobs more often at that time. And there
was a lot of black people that had businesses on Fifth Street.
There was a lot of restaurants and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Things were better there after the war.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: When my husband got out of the war, we moved to
Boston. Then I lived in Europe for a year, lived in Germany. That's
where he was stationed.
</P>
<P>
   I left Germany in 1953 or 1954 and went back to Boston. Then, my
father died in 1955 and I was about to divorce this guy anyhow. So
we got a divorce and I moved back to Wilberforce to be with my
mother. She was in a house by herself.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started teaching in the college.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: When we got back to the states, we had 60 days to go back
to work. I went back to General Motors/Frigidaire, where I had been
working before.
</P>
<P>
   They interviewed me and I had gotten everything but the ID. A
guy told me, ``You can have the same job, same rate.'' Seventy-nine
cents. That was top pay. I said I'd be back tomorrow. I didn't even
get my ID.
</P>
<P>
   So I left and went to Universal Inn and started working for 95
cents an hour. In 30 days, I got another 10 cent raise.
</P>
<P>
   They went on strike at Frigidaire very soon after that.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: We stopped through Dayton and made a headquarters here
with some friends. I was questioning about what he did for a
living, because he was really living well. He said, ``Well, if you
really want to know, get up in the morning and come to work with
us.'' I did that. What we did was go in and clean a house.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fairly big-size house. We washed all the walls, the
woodwork, the carpet, the whole house, in one day.
</P>
<P>
   When we come back home, we were sitting around the table having
dinner, and he said, ``I'll make you a proposition. If you come out
here, we'll work together, and I'll sell you half of this
business.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point in time, my thinking was beginning to tell me that
in higher education we were doing more in the business of teaching
people how to make a living than teaching them how to live. I was
disgusted to the point that I said, ``This may be an opportunity
for me to get out of education.''
</P>
<P>
   I took a half-year's leave of absence from Hampton Institute and
came to work with my friend. And I never left.
</P>

 &HT;    Tracing the upheaval of the '60s
 &HT;    WITH BLACKHISTORY-BIOS at end of file
 &HT;    By John Keilman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Editor's Note: The following dialogues were
culled from extensive sit-down interviews with each individual.
Reporter John Keilman conducted the tape-recorded interviews and
edited dialogues.
</P>
<P>
   THE STORY THUS FAR: George Cooper became one of the Navy's first
black officers, but after an injury kept him from combat, he has
decided to leave a teaching job in Virginia and come to Dayton.
Ellen Lee Jackson, who stayed in Dayton throughout the war, has
watched the city's black commercial district grow more robust.
Yvonne Walker-Taylor has returned to Wilberforce and begun teaching
after spending years in Alabama and Europe. Ned Wood has come back
to Dayton after serving with the Army in Europe to be offered the
same menial job he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   But with discontent rising among Southern blacks, the civil
rights movement is starting to spread, touching all of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ELLEN LEE JACKSON: Fifth Street after the war was very, very
quiet. Orderly. There wasn't a lot of confusion. There were two
doctors there. One was a dentist and one was a medical doctor. Then
there was a shoe shop that was owned by Mr. Rice and then the
Dickens boy, when he got grown, had the Dickens Funeral Home on the
corner of Hawthorne and Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Then in later years, The Palace theater was built at the corner
of Fifth and Williams. They had stage shows there, too, and on the
second floor was a dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   YVONNE WALKER-TAYLOR: We took the news about the Brown vs. Board
of Education decision rather mildly. So many things happened that
were fruitless, that was supposed to be proponents of ``good news,
chariot's coming'' and we're finally going to get our total
freedom. Then it falls down the cracks. I think some of us were
pretty skeptical about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people, a lot of black people, thought it was stuff
that the law was never really going to uphold anyway. So many of
the lawyers were just trying to find ways of how to beat us.
</P>
<P>
   NED WOOD: When the strike was over at Frigidaire I came on back
and signed up. I went into material handling. I started at 95
cents.
</P>
<P>
   After the strike, blacks could get better jobs at the plant than
just janitor. But the strike was really about money.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed at Frigidaire for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I worked in the house-cleaning business no more than two
or three years. Then I got sick. I went to the doctor, and the
doctor said, ``You can do one of two things. You can get out of the
pressure you're in in this business, and live a little longer, or
you can stay there and die. Because you're under too much
pressure.'' I went in the next morning and told Crawford I had to
quit.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton had passed an ordinance setting forth standards for
housing. And with my background at Hampton, where they taught all
the building trades, I had at least a speaking knowledge of all of
them. So I took the exam, and got one of the housing inspector
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: During the 1960s, I went to teach for two summers
down in Columbia, South Carolina, 'cause I wanted to see what it
was like to live in the South. Part of it also was to get away from
Mama. I was living with a strict mother who didn't allow you to do
anything. I'd had two husbands and I didn't want to hear this.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the South was like. I had this beautiful French
poodle that a friend of mine had sent me. He was a gorgeous little
fellow. I took him with me and I wanted him trimmed. Now, I'm
driving a new Cadillac and I've got this miniature French poodle
and I want him trimmed. I took him to the little place to get him
trimmed and they refused to trim him.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't understand it. It just didn't reach me at all. So in my
class the next day, I was talking to my class and I mentioned the
fact I took my poodle to this shop and I said, ``There must be an
awful lot of poodles in Columbia.''
</P>
<P>
   And they started ``hee-heeing.'' One lady raised her hand and
she said, ``Ms. Walker, I understand. They didn't trim that poodle
because you said it was yours.'' I said, ``Well, yeah, it is
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   She said, ``I'll tell you what you do. Take it to another one on
the other side of town and when you go in, you say, `I'm having Ms.
Walker's poodle trimmed and you'd better do a good job on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   I drive out there. I was conservatively dressed and in my
Cadillac and I take this poodle out and I claim it's not mine, it's
my boss's poodle. They took the dog and I was scared to death they
would kill it. I was so sorry I did it. I didn't know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   When I went to get my dog, I was so glad to see that dog alive.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I belonged to Bethel Baptist Church, and Pastor George
W. Lucas would talk about civil rights. He would try to get the
members to understand that your life would be better if the civil
rights went through.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: The first thing I heard about civil rights was Martin
Luther King at the bus boycotts. I thought that was a wonderful
thing. That was really a good move. It sparked things in Dayton, it
really did. They started granting blacks loans. Blacks started
registering and voting more, too, after that.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: I don't remember much happening in Wilberforce in
the way of civil rights demonstrations. We were not under the kind
of persecution that the people in the South were. For instance, we
could go to Rike's and try on a dress or a hat. The shops around
Xenia did not bar you from trying on clothes, so we didn't have
that part of the marching that was against department stores.
</P>
<P>
   We had a mixed faculty, black and white, and I just don't recall
any times that we were under any kind of duress except that one
movie theater in the 1930s. But the restaurants in town, we could
eat in all the restaurants and so on, so there wasn't any need for
demonstrations in this small community. We were protective,
overprotective.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: They had a show on the radio called ``People Speak.'' They
had this one guy who called in and wanted to talk. He spoke up and
said, ``We had a nice home on Brookville. Blacks have moved in, so
now we've got to move.''
</P>
<P>
   They called it the white flight. Every time blacks would move
in, signs would go up like popcorn. They started moving out.
</P>
<P>
   Whites ran out of Westwood. And then after Westwood, we invaded
Residence Park. Ran almost all of them out of Residence Park. Then
we started on Dayton View. Ran most of them out. That was a good
deal, too. Some of them had almost like a mansion in Upper Dayton
View. Oooh, man, there was some fine homes up there. But they ran
off and left them.
</P>
<P>
   The races got along real well in the 1950s and 1960s. Because
when we moved in, they moved out. There wasn't any interaction,
really.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: Oh, I remember when they started moving into what I
call Upper Dayton View. Well, if a black person got close to a
white person, the white person would move out. Yes, that was very
noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop them from trying to get into a different
neighborhood. When they moved out to Jefferson Twp. there weren't
too many blacks out here.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: The housing inspector job lasted about 1 1/2 years. I
became a city planner, and then I went to Antioch University to
find jobs for students on the work-study plan.
</P>
<P>
   But I came back to Dayton because I had been invited to take a
job by the then-city manager, whose name was Jim Kunde. He said,
``We do not have any black directors for the city of Dayton. I'd
like you to be the first one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim offered me my choice of four departments if I would come
back to work for him. And having something of a background of being
the first black to do this, that or the other, I looked on this as
another opportunity in my life to further document that blacks are
able to do anything anyone else can do, if qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
   So I elected to come in as director of Department of Human
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: I used to go out recruiting for Wilberforce. All
the other recruiters were white from white schools all over. We
traveled with this group and I was the only black. We went to
Georgetown, in Washington, D.C. We tried to go to a restaurant, and
one of the guys went up and put our names down. There were about 10
or 12 of us. They didn't see me at first. Then when the table was
ready, they said come in.
</P>
<P>
   But they put out an arm and stopped me. They told me, ``We don't
serve Negroes.''
</P>
<P>
   So I looked at the guy and I said, ``Hey, guys. Did you hear
what he said?'' So they went round and round, and ahh, such a
ruckus they started raising! So I was afraid that we'd all get
arrested so I said, ``You all go. I'll just go some place else. But
all of them said, ``I'm going with you.''
</P>
<P>
   So we finally wound up going back to Washington to one of the
real nice places in Washington. It's still there.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I remarried in 1965 and I went to Tennessee in 1966 to
live. It was a small town and they were just integrating the
schools at that time.
</P>
<P>
   It went off nicely there in Harriman. That was the name of the
place. People were afraid there was going to be a lot of confusion
but it didn't happen that way.
</P>
<P>
   But just before I went, I was at Lucas Furriers and they had
just had this disturbance in Clinton, Tenn., just maybe a month or
so before I left. All the sales girls would say ``Oh, Ellen, aren't
you afraid to go to Tennessee? How close is this place to where
they are doing all that to where you are going?''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``They say it is real close. They say it is only about
12 miles to where I am going.''
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't have any trouble at all in Harriman.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: I was out of town when the riots happened in 1966. We went
to Pittsburgh. When we came back, the liquor stores was closed. I
went over there to get me a bottle, because after coming back from
a trip, you wanted to get your drink and relax. The liquor stores
were closed so we went all the way back to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: Martin Luther King came to Wilberforce to speak
and I remember I was assigned to see him around on campus. I know
you're going to ask me the year, and I can't remember it to save my
life.
</P>
<P>
   I got an opportunity to talk to him. He seemed so tired, so
very, very tired. I asked him, ``Aren't you tired,'' and he said,
``Yes.'' He was a very gentle man and he asked to be let alone.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I think most black people perceived of Martin Luther
King as basically a savior. I recall joining 80-plus other people
and taking two buses out of Dayton to go to the March on
Washington. It was one of the most inspiring, electrifying
experiences one could possibly have.
</P>
<P>
   To stand there at the foot of that monument and listen to his,
``I Have a Dream,'' you recognize that there is a person who brings
hope, who brings promise, who brings an uplifting spirit to the
whole race, with a message that it can be done. And we can do it.
And we can do it without violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now when you see some of the things that have been inflicted on
black people over the years, to expect a black person to say, ``No
matter what you do to me, I'm not going to fight back'' _ you have
to have been there to appreciate a thing like that.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-TAYLOR: Malcolm X never came to Wilberforce. I love
Malcolm X but I don't think the president thought much of him. He
was a kind of a rebel and a lot of blacks shied away from Malcolm
X. I liked his daring. I liked the fact that he'd say, ``I'm
fighting back.''
</P>
<P>
   See, I didn't like Martin Luther King's way, like, ``Beat me
over the head and I'm going to sit here and let you pour hot coffee
on me.'' See, I'm not going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   I saw the kids sitting down there in Columbia, S.C., and they'd
let people do that, some of them, kicked on top of their heads and
things like that in those sit-ins that they had at the 5 and 10. I
saw that myself and I thought, ``Oh, there'd be no way, oh Lord no,
no, I know I would kill them. I would hit them and they'd kill
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm X said, ``I'll take so much but after that, no more.''
And my heart broke when his own people killed him. I just couldn't
understand that at all, how members of his group, the Muslims,
could have done what they did to him. It just appalled me. But he's
still my hero.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I didn't think too much of Malcolm X myself. I didn't
like his approach, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   COOPER: I never had any truck with Malcolm X. He had his
perspective and his outlook and his following, but it was the kind
of outlook, perspective and following that was not for me.
</P>
<P>
   I recall questioning the extent to which Malcolm X had any
influence on anything. Malcolm X was just the opposite of Martin.
He preached violence and hatred. And that's not the way to go in
any set of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   WOOD: When Martin Luther King got killed, that affected me just
as bad as when Kennedy got killed. It was grief. But, you know,
both of them in a sense committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King went out on that balcony knowing his life was
in danger. I would have gone out on no balcony knowing my life was
in danger, unless I had one of the helmets on we had in the
service. He wouldn't have killed me, shooting me in the head. He
would have had to shoot me in the heart.
</P>
<P>
   JACKSON: I thought it was a sad day. But I know that no matter
how hard you work to accomplish something, there is always someone
in the way that turns up.

   BLACKHISTORY-VOICES-1900 _ DAYTON, Ohio _ America in the early
1900s was a nation in metamorphosis. Yet some things appeared stuck
in the 19th century. The nation's blacks, with more than 50 years
of emancipation behind them, were still brutally segregated and
subject to racial violence. More than 70 were lynched in 1920.
Abject conditions in the South prompted many to come north,
launching what would come to be known as The Great Migration.
George Cooper: ``The realization of racism came on me in a gradual
way. I think it came on most kids in a gradual way, both white and
black.'' Ellen Lee Jackson: ``Dayton was a prejudiced place. As far
as the jobs were, you didn't get to have the good jobs like they
have now.'' Yvonne Walker-Taylor: ``I liked school because I was an
only child and going to school was just my piece of cake.'' Ned
Wood: ``In the Depression, life sure changed. We lost our farm in
1931. One year, we had boll weevils.'' (Keilman, Dayton Daily News)

OIL RIGS HANGING ON TO WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas.)  (fb) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Grey Wolf Drilling Co. announced recently that it would lay
off 1,700 workers, Freddy Garcia feared that his flush times in the
oil field might be over.
</P>
<P>
   His worries were well founded: job cuts have been widespread in
the oil patch as crude oil prices tumble and rigs are shut down. In
10 years, Garcia, 35, had risen to the top of his field,
supervising a crew of three workers and earning $13.50 an hour in
shifts often 12 hours long.
</P>
<P>
   But to his surprise, Garcia was kept on the payroll, even though
his crew had no work with its rig at the end of the year. The
company transferred him to another rig that was still active.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a wife and kids,'' he said. ``I want to pay my house
off. When they call, I tell my wife, `Give me that phone; I'm ready
to work.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Garcia was not the only one. Instead of laying off all its
rig crews, Grey Wolf decided to keep about 400 of its best and
most-skilled workers on the payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The practice by oil services companies _ including Grey Wolf,
Global Marine Inc. and Rowan _ to hold on to some rig workers even
when there is not enough work is a significant departure for a
cyclical industry that is used to letting people go at the first
signs of a slump.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and the other rig workers still employed are the
exceptions. Tens of thousands of oil workers have been laid off in
the last six months. The number of oil and gas rigs operating in
the country continue to slide. The number of rigs fell to 544 as of
Feb. 5 from 558 the previous week and down from 972 a year ago,
Baker Hughes Inc. said on Friday in its weekly survey. It was the
fourth consecutive week the number has reached a record low, said
Baker Hughes, which has been counting the nation's rigs since 1944.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, however, have decided to hold on to a core of
workers to man the rigs until crude oil prices recover and demand
for rigs picks up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned from the previous downturns where most companies
simply reacted to declining revenue and just cut people
accordingly,'' said Gary Lee, the vice president for human
resources at Grey Wolf. ``We're trying to plan for the return of
the good times.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rowan, E.E. Thiele, a senior vice president, said that the
company had about 11 rigs that were not in operation, yet each rig
was manned by 65 employees, who were making repairs and upgrading
equipment. That meant that about 700 workers were being kept on the
payroll although the company was not getting any revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do that as long as you have cash,'' he said. When
times are good, Rowan adds to its reserves, which currently total
$100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thiele said this policy will end up saving money in the long
run. ``The crews get used to working together, which means you have
fewer accidents on the rigs'' he said. ``When things pick up, you
have trained people, which means you save on the training costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, fresh in the memory of the management of oil service
companies is that only a year ago the oil industry was scrambling
to find skilled workers to man rigs, which were in high demand. Day
rates, the cost of renting an oil rig per day, were at record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The industry was plagued with safety and quality problems as
companies hired inexperienced workers. As the labor pool dried up,
many companies were forced to turn to experienced but less
desirable workers who had poor work records.
</P>
<P>
   To cope with the shortage of workers, many companies set up
expensive training programs. Some added more supervisors to handle
crews on the more sophisticated offshore rigs, which can cost more
than $100 million to build. One mistake can end up disabling a rig,
causing a huge loss of revenue if it is idled for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The labor shortages and problems became so severe last spring
that some companies ended up having to turn business away.
</P>
<P>
   With each downturn, the oil industry has seen its pool of
workers shrink. From the boom times in the early 1980s, when there
were more than 400,000 oil field service workers, the industry has
gone into a protracted slump of close to 10 years. Hundreds of
companies went bankrupt or were taken over. Tens of thousands of
skilled workers have retired or gone into other fields. Today,
there are about 200,000 employed oil service workers, according to
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   But the shrinkage of the oil service industry also means that
the smaller fleet of rigs is hired very quickly when demand picks
up.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Grey Wolf wants to hold on to workers like Garcia for when
the good times return. Garcia demonstrated his skill on a recent
day as he maneuvered a two-ton drilling weight like a feather to
add a piece of pipe after the crew had reached 6,000 feet in
Rosenberg, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 12-hour shift, during which he sometimes took
refuge in a little cabin atop the rig to escape the cold wind, he
prepared dinner for his crew.
</P>
<P>
   He has always been eager to work the 12-hour shifts for seven
days straight, even willing to take on extra work on his days off,
for which he gets paid extra.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they call I'm ready to work,'' he said in telephone
interview from his home, a house on 10 acres of land in Ricardo,
Texas, about 45 miles south of Corpus Christi. He recently built a
barn for his horses.
</P>
<P>
   The oil service industry, however, remains under pressure. There
is little chance that crude oil prices will recover soon, and the
stocks of oil service companies have fallen sharply. The
Philadelphia oil service sector index is down 59 percent from the
52-week high it reached on May 4. As a result, most oil service
companies are still digging in for a long-term slump: slashing
their costs and letting thousands of workers go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tough times are ahead,'' said Bob Rose, the president of
Global Marine.
</P>
<P>
   But others are preparing for when demand picks up. A school for
oil service workers in Abilene, Texas, was reopened a year ago by
the Texas Engineering Extension Service of Texas A&AMP;M University.
The current class has 11 students, and Wayne Davis, who runs the
school, is optimistic that they will find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a scarcity of skilled employees,'' he
predicted.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
If you had told Tom Gugliotta 10 years ago he would one day be the
subject of a multimillion-dollar tug of war between two NBA teams,
he probably would have laughed in your face.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Come to think of it, if you had tried to tell anybody that, they
would have laughed in your face.
</P>
<P>
   But Gugliotta was the subject of just such a tussle, eventually
signing a six-year, $58.5 million deal with the Phoenix Suns _ and
turning down an offer from the Minnesota Timberwolves that would
have paid him almost $30 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Professional athletes don't typically do something like that,
but this isn't your typical professional athlete. Gugliotta, whose
Suns visit Compaq Center tonight to play the Rockets, is a guy who
not only wasn't heavily recruited coming out of Walt Whitman High
in New York but one who actually wound up at a major college
because his father called in a favor.
</P>
<P>
   The serendipitous journey to the NBA began with a simple phone
call. Gugliotta's father, Frank, called family friend Jim Valvano,
then coaching at North Carolina State, and asked if he would at
least come and watch his son, Tommy, play.
</P>
<P>
   Valvano twice came to see Gugliotta but quickly realized it
would be a reach to offer him a scholarship. At 6-7 and 190 pounds,
Gugliotta was a painfully undersized power forward, and in the
rugged Atlantic Coast Conference, size matters.
</P>
<P>
   Offering the kid a scholarship just didn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   But then, neither did Valvano's thought processes at times.
Never one bound by convention, Valvano had a coaching philosophy
that was shaped by his outlook on life _ 70 percent emotion, 20
percent instinct and 10 percent logic. Using that same formula,
Valvano offered Gugliotta a full ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father told him he thought I could play at a high level _
maybe not right away, but he thought I could be good,'' Gugliotta
said. ``Coach Valvano saw me play a couple times, and he was honest
with me. He said, `I haven't seen you enough to know if you can be
good at this level. But if you're willing to work hard, be a good
student, work on your game and graduate, you have a scholarship.'
Before he could even think about what he said, I signed my name.''
</P>
<P>
   And then went about making a name for himself. Valvano advised
hard work, both on the court and in the weight room, and Gugliotta
responded to the prodding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I could be a great player,'' Gugliotta said. ``And I
believed him. Everybody knows he was a great coach and a great
motivator, but anybody who knew him knows he also was just an
unbelievable person. He always had so much excitement about
everything he was doing. He was enthusiastic about everything he
did in life. That's why I believed him. It was great to hear him
say something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta, now 6-10 and 240 pounds, became not only an All-ACC
pick at N.C. State but an NBA All-Star as well, even though that
road was a bit different _ and lengthy. Drafted by the Washington
Bullets, Gugliotta was traded to Golden State for Chris Webber
before winding up in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Gugliotta became one of the best all-around
players in the game, able to pound inside for rebounds like a power
forward or use his deft touch and passing skills to play outside
like a small forward. In Minnesota, he teamed with Kevin Garnett
and Stephon Marbury to lead the Timberwolves into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But when his contract came up at the end of last season,
Gugliotta found himself one of the most high-profile free agents on
the market. And Phoenix was definitely interested.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had been left high and dry by Antonio McDyess, who
bolted Phoenix for a return trip to Denver, where he had started
his career in 1995. The Suns, who were rebuffed by Scottie Pippen
as well, set their sights on Gugliotta, who was coming off a season
in which he averaged 20.1 points, 8.7 rebounds and 4.1 assists with
the Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns had one big ace in the hole _ winning.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 seasons, only once have the Suns endured a losing
season. That, more than anything else _ and in this case ``anything
else'' includes an extra $28 million from the Timberwolves that he
left on the table _ was the lure. His Washington teams won just 46
games in two seasons. The Warriors were on the way to 56 losses in
Gugliotta's brief stint there before he was traded to Minnesota.
And his teams there finished above .500 just once, going 45-37 last
season before being eliminated by Seattle in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta wanted to win, and he placed that desire above money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to some of the older players in the league who
have made a good amount of money and saved a good amount of money,
when you're younger, contracts are very important,'' he said.
``They are at any stage, but I was fortunate enough to put myself
in a (financial) situation where I didn't have to make the contract
the most important thing. That left other options open for me for
what I really wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Suns couldn't be happier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Gugliotta, we would have taken a big step backward,''
said Phoenix coach Danny Ainge. ``This was risky business. This was
anything but a guarantee. We let a lot of free agents go by, but we
waited and got the guy we're all very excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why.
</P>
<P>
   Gugliotta debuted with 24 points and 17 rebounds in a 101-92
victory over the Los Angeles Clippers and followed with 29 points
and 13 rebounds in a 115-108 victory over Denver. Big things were
expected, and Gugliotta obviously wasted no time in delivering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to come out here and try to continue my career in
the direction it's been going the last couple of years,'' Gugliotta
said. ``That's playing at an All-Star level and trying to help make
this team very successful, to be able to compete against the other
elite teams in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Others around the league think the Suns came out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they lost anything,'' said Utah's Karl Malone.
``What Googs brings to the table is a well-rounded forward who can
do a lot of things. He can do it all. Antonio is a talented player,
but I don't think they lost one step by getting Googs.''

HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON WOULD BE `TERRIFIC' SENATOR, PRESIDENT
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also MEXICO-CLINTON, moved in `i' category) 
(fe) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton said on Monday that Hillary
Rodham Clinton would be a ``terrific'' senator from New York,
adding his praise to a growing Democratic clamor for Mrs. Clinton
to run for the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision she'll have to make,'' the president said,
after a reporter asked if he would encourage her to run. ``She'd be
great if she did it.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that that the idea had not occurred to Mrs. Clinton
before ``a lot of people started calling'' and urging her to seek
the seat of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For reasons I'm sure you'll understand,'' Clinton said in an
apparent reference to his impeachment trial, ``she hasn't had
anything like adequate time to talk to the people who think she
should do this, much less people who think perhaps she shouldn't. I
mean, she just hasn't had time to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   With the trial behind him, Clinton, publicly cheerful and at
ease during a 24-hour working visit to this colonial city in the
Yucatan, seemed happy to fan speculation about the futures of him
and his wife after he leaves the office he has been fighting so
fiercely to keep. ``She and I both would like to continue to be
useful in public affairs when we leave office,'' Clinton said. Mrs.
Clinton did not comment on her plans.
</P>
<P>
   From a wispy notion planted by a few New York Democrats, the
prospect that Mrs. Clinton might run for the Senate has sprouted
into full speculative bloom. On Sunday, Moynihan spoke glowingly
about Mrs. Clinton's ``magnificent, young, bright, able,
Illinois-Arkansas enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is dean of the
state's congressional delegation, said he was ``very excited'' by
Clinton's remarks. ``Politically, we have pulled together an offer
that the first lady can't refuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Mrs. Clinton had been assured that she would have
no opposition in the primary and that she would have the support of
the Democratic Party and organized labor. Further, he said, major
New York donors have called Mrs. Clinton to say that they would
back her bid for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it's a question of will,'' said Rangel, who is
a member of the official delegation here. ``She's been through so
much that if she decided it would be too much, nobody should lean
on her just because it would be good for our state and our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel did not elaborate on the nature of the assurances that no
other Democrat would enter the race. But Judith Hope, the state
party chairwoman, described Rangel's remarks as ``a figure of
speech'' and said he was not describing ``any kind of official or
formal process.'' But Mrs. Hope, who has repeatedly encouraged Mrs.
Clinton to enter the race, said Monday night night that ``it is
more clear to me now than it has been that she is in fact giving
this quite serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware, who is also part of the delegation,
said he discussed the possibility of a Senate race with Mrs.
Clinton on Sunday night. ``She seemed very serious,'' he said.
``She said everybody tells her, `You could win this thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also met on Friday with Harold Ickes, a White House
adviser who has long been active in New York politics, in part to
discuss the Senate race, Ickes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who returned to Washington Monday evening with her
husband, has never held elective office, and as first lady, she has
spoken longingly of her wish for a ``zone of privacy'' around her
family. Instead, her hairstyles have been critiqued, her billing
records as an Arkansas lawyer scrutinized, and her steadfast
loyalty to her husband lampooned. Reporters monitor her every move
_ did she take her husband's hand? did she move out from under his
encircling arm? _ for signs of marital peace or discord. She does
not like that at all, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons do not own a home. To register to vote, they have
used the Little Rock address of Dorothy Rodham, Mrs. Clinton's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   For a Senate race in New York, Mrs. Clinton would have to
establish residency there and determine how to balance campaigning
with her extensive duties as first lady. She would almost certainly
face a full-time and well-financed Republican opponent, possibly
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. She plans to decide whether to run soon,
officials say, to avoid unnecessarily interfering with other
potential Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior White House aides seem baffled by the Clintons'
interest in a possible race for Senate and express surprise that
they have not dismissed the idea. They predict that Mrs. Clinton
will ultimately decide not to run.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the president, White House officials dodged comment
on the subject on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the speculative bubble grows, few senior public
officials, in or out of the administration, can avoid being asked
for their opinion of Mrs. Clinton's plans _ whatever they may be.
It was the first question put on Monday to Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, when she tried to brief reporters on the
multitude of incremental agreements on fighting drugs, controlling
illegal immigration and snuffing forest fires that Clinton reached
here with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton is a fantastic human being, and anyone who knows
her knows that she would be a great public servant,'' Ms. Albright
said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite her qualms about the spotlight, Mrs. Clinton, who has
become resoundingly popular nationally, clearly relishes her
influence on policy.
</P>
<P>
   After her public approval ratings collapsed over the failure of
her plan to remake the health care system, Mrs. Clinton retreated
from the aggressive role she had played at the start of the
administration. She still wielded great influence on a wide variety
of issues behind the scenes, but in public she kept a lower profile
as she pushed for better education and child care and a more
innovative approach to foreign development.
</P>
<P>
   The public overwhelmingly approved of Mrs. Clinton's decision to
stand by her husband after he was accused of an affair with Monica
S. Lewinsky and after he admitted that the accusations were true.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip to Mexico _ where the Clintons' honeymooned (in the
company of Mrs. Rodham) 24 years ago, as the president recalled
today _ they have been all smiles and clasped hands. On Sunday,
they even made an extremely rare appearance in the rear cabin of
Air Force One. Mrs. Clinton wore a gold heart-shaped pin that she
said the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a better kind of heart of darkness,'' the president
said as he dispensed Valentine's Day chocolate from a giant
heart-shaped box in his hands.

 IRAQ THREATENS TO ATTACK AIR BASE IN TURKEY  (See also IRAQ-FRANCE,(sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Iraq threatened on Monday to attack an air base in
southeastern Turkey if American and British jets based there
continue to patrol northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The threat, delivered by Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin
Ramadan, came after weeks of strikes by American and British
warplanes against military targets in the northern and southern
no-flight zones of Iraq, including new attacks on Monday. His
remarks about the base at Incirlik, Turkey, also followed sharply
worded Iraqi threats against Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The comments appeared to reflect mounting Iraqi frustration with
the air strikes, which have steadily eroded Iraq's defenses in the
weeks since the United States and Britain pounded Iraq for four
nights in December.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those air raids and continuing attacks that have clearly
weakened Iraq, military experts say it could still pose a
significant military threat to its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan warned Monday on the Monte Carlo radio, ``I say if
America and Britain do not retreat, they'll soon pay dearly in
relation to the properties and elements they use to launch
aggression on the people of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks on Iraq's official television, Ramadan mentioned the
countries that have supported the United States and Britain by
allowing use of their air fields for the patrols of the restricted
zones. ``We can reach the dens of evil in Turkey, just as we can
those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has issued ominous threats in the past, but just as often
failed to carry them out.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Monday in Mexico,
where she was traveling with President Clinton, that the American
response to any attack by the Iraqis would be ``swift and sure.''
</P>
<P>
   While officials at the Pentagon on Monday viewed the newest
Iraqi threat with skepticism, they did not dismiss it. The
vehemence of Iraq's warnings seem certain to heighten tensions
among its neighbors, already made uneasy by the low-level warfare
that the United States and Britain have been conducting against
Iraq nearly every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an empty threat,'' the Pentagon's spokesman,
Kenneth H. Bacon, said on Monday, adding that if Iraq attacked
Turkey, Kuwait or Saudi Arabia, the consequences would be
devastating. But he said the Pentagon would take the threat
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the threat to Turkey seemed unusual given that
Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, visited the Turkish
capital Monday on a diplomatic mission intended, at least
symbolically, to ease Iraq's isolation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Iraq could have missiles able to reach bases in Turkey and
Kuwait. President Saddam Hussein's government was supposed to
dismantle its long-range missiles as a condition of ending the
Persian Gulf war in 1991, but U.N. weapons inspectors never
accounted for all of the Scud missiles Iraq had before the war.
Also, Iraq was allowed to keep building missiles with ranges
shorter than 100 miles _ long enough, conceivably, to be used
across its borders with Kuwait and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Monday's warnings, Turkey considered the threat from
Iraq serious enough that it asked the United States to send a
battery of Patriot air-defense missiles to Incirlik, which the
Pentagon agreed to do in January. The United States also has
Patriots defending bases in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq considers the no-flight zones to be violations of its
sovereignty, but it has never challenged them in such a sustained
way. The United States and its allies created the zones to protect
Iraqi ethnic groups facing repression by Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   After the raids in December, Iraqi forces began to confront the
American and British jets patrolling them in a series of one-sided
exchanges that have resulted in the destruction of several Iraqi
anti-aircraft missile sites and other targets with no loss of
allied aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Those exchanges continued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Iraq, two American F-15E's attacked an anti-aircraft
artillery battery north of the city of Mosul after Iraqi forces
opened fire, according to the Pentagon's account.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, an EA-6B electronic warfare jet fired a high-speed
radar-seeking missile at an Iraqi radar installation that was
tracking the jet, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Iraq, American and British jets attacked four
separate targets in response to an incursion by two Iraqi warplanes
into the no-flight zone below the 33rd parallel.
</P>
<P>
   All of the American and British jets returned safely to their
bases. Iraq's news agency announced that five civilians had been
killed in Monday's attack; officials at the Pentagon said there was
no way to verify the Iraqi claims of casualties.

NO. 2 IRAQI TELLS TURKS HIS COUNTRY WANTS DIALOGUE 
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN KINZER

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq told
Turkish officials Monday that his country had complied at least
partly with U.N. disarmament resolutions and was ready for dialogue
with the outside world, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Ankara by Aziz, Iraq's second-ranking leader, is
something of a landmark because it comes as the United States is
trying to isolate and depose the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
   But any progress that Aziz made in soothing Turkish concerns may
have been wiped away soon after his talks ended. Another senior
Iraqi official, Vice President Taha Yassin Ramadan, warned in
Baghdad that his country was preparing to attack the Turkish base
from which American planes launch bombing raids over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they were pleased that Aziz had
apparently not achieved anything substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to think that he could be going home happy,''
said an American diplomat, who, like others who discussed the
talks, spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``If he was trying to
redefine the terms of debate, quite clearly he failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who took part in the Ankara meetings said Aziz was
soft-spoken and not confrontational. They said he had asked Turkey
to help persuade foreign powers that Iraq was not bent on unending
confrontation with the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made the point that he wants dialogue, even with the United
States,'' a diplomat said. ``He wants the world to acknowledge that
there has been at least some compliance with the U.N.''

73

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ John D. Ehrlichman, who served as President Nixon's
pugnacious defender and domestic policy chief and went to prison
for his role in the Watergate scandals, died Sunday at his home in
Atlanta. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman had been suffering from diabetes for about a year,
his son Tom said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   After serving time in prison for conspiracy and other counts,
Ehrlichman made a new life for himself in 1978, first as a writer
living in Santa Fe, N.M., and for the past several years as a
senior vice president of Law Environmental, an Atlanta-based
engineering company engaged in hazardous-waste handling, his son
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Ehrlichman, of Seattle, said that, in his later years, his
father continued to feel ``remorse for the impact on his family''
that his wrongdoing had caused, along with the hope that history
would recall the accomplishments of the Nixon administration, not
just its crimes.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the Nixon presidency in 1969, John Daniel
Ehrlichman was a central figure, first as domestic-policy chieftain
in the White House, and later as a participant in the Watergate
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   When five men were caught during a burglary at the headquarters
of the Democratic National Committee in Washington's Watergate
complex on June 17, 1972, the incident at first was airily
dismissed by Nixon aides as a ``third-rate burglary,'' with no
connection to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But as investigations unfolded, it was revealed that the
burglars had links either to the White House or to the Nixon
campaign's Committee to Re-Elect the President and were trying to
fix a faulty listening device installed during an earlier break-in.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations (and the president's own tape-recordings)
would also disclose that Nixon and some of his top aides had begun
an effort to cover up White House involvement in the break-in
almost from the start. Nixon resigned on Aug. 9, 1974, rather than
face all but certain impeachment and removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Nixon aides were implicated in Watergate and related
crimes, some for relatively peripheral roles. The most important
case involved Ehrlichman and three other high-ranking officials:
former Attorney General John N. Mitchell, who died in 1988; Nixon's
chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, and Robert C. Mardian, a former
assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial lasting two and a half months, all were convicted
on Jan. 1, 1975, of conspiracy, obstruction of justice and perjury.
They were sentenced to two and a half to eight years in prison,
though Mardian's conviction was overturned on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman's sentence was made concurrent with a term of 20
months to five years imposed on him for his role in the September
1971 break-in at the office of Dr. Lewis Fielding in Beverly Hills,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Fielding was a psychiatrist who had been treating Dr. Daniel
Ellsberg, who had said publicly that he had given journalists a
copy of a secret government study of U.S. involvement in the
Vietnam War. A covert White House unit, known as ``the plumbers''
and answerable to Ehrlichman, was assigned to find and plug such
``leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   The plumbers' break-in at the psychiatrist's office, apparently
in quest of material damaging to Ellsberg, did not become public
until some two and a half years after it was committed, and it
added to the White House embarrassment over the burgeoning
Watergate scandal. Indeed, Ehrlichman later referred to the
Fielding break-in as ``the seminal Watergate episode,'' one that
set the tone for all the cover-ups to follow.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Ehrlichman entered prison in Stafford, Ariz., in the
fall of 1976, deciding not to wait until his appeals were
exhausted, Nixon had been pardoned by President Gerald R. Ford and
was trying to rehabilitate his reputation for history.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman had already undergone a major life change after his
conviction. He had left his first wife, Jeanne, and their Seattle
home and moved to Santa Fe, where he began to write.
</P>
<P>
   After his release from prison, Ehrlichman returned to New Mexico
to resume his writing career and to give occasional lectures. He
wrote four novels and a memoir, 1982's ``Witness to Power'' (Simon
and Schuster), in which he reflected on his relationship with the
former president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't miss Richard Nixon very much,'' he wrote. ``Richard
Nixon probably doesn't much miss me either.''
</P>
<P>
   His association with Nixon began because he had known Haldeman
while both were attending the University of California at Los
Angeles. After graduating from Stanford University Law School, he
joined a Los Angeles firm before starting his own law firm in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman specialized in zoning and land-use law and made many
acquaintances in politics. Haldeman recruited him to help out in
Nixon's 1960 campaign for the presidency and again for Nixon's
unsuccessful run for governor of California in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman went back to practicing law in Seattle, then became a
strategist in Nixon's 1968 campaign for president. In his role as
White House counsel and later as chief domestic-policy adviser,
Ehrlichman became known as the ``White House fireman,''
extinguishing political and bureaucratic brush fires before they
became public.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors referred to Ehrlichman and Haldeman together as ``the
Berlin wall,'' because they were said to shield the reclusive,
occasionally paranoid president from unpleasant news and
unpalatable choices.
</P>
<P>
   But another perspective was offered by Theodore H. White in
``The Making of the President 1972.'' Writing before the Watergate
scandal began, White said of Ehrlichman: ``His shop was one of the
few at the White House where ideas were seriously entertained _
good ideas, too, on energy, on land-use policy, on urbanization, on
preservation of the American environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman was born in Tacoma, Wash., on March 20, 1925. He was
an Eagle Scout and after his freshman year at UCLA, he enlisted in
the Army Air Corps in 1943. He flew 26 missions over Germany as a
navigator in a B-24 bomber and was awarded a Distinguished Flying
Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman's first two marriages, to Jeanne Fisher and Christine
McLaurine, ended in divorce. He is survived by his mother, Lillian
Ehrlichman, who is 97; his third wife, Karen; three sons and two
daughters from his first marriage: Peter and Tom of Seattle and Rob
of San Francisco; Jan Ehrlichman of Sante Fe and Jody Pineda of
Santa Fe; a son from his second marriage, Michael, of Princeton,
N.J., and 13 grandchildren.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed by the excesses of the plumbers, Ehrlichman eventually
ordered it disbanded. But by then, the Watergate scandal had taken
on a life of its own. Though later accounts suggested that
Ehrlichman favored an admission of wrongdoing before it was too
late, he became caught up in the all-out cover-up attempt.
</P>
<P>
   When L. Patrick Gray III, the acting FBI director, was
peripherally linked to the Watergate defendants, Ehrlichman
famously advised Nixon to leave Gray ``twisting slowly, slowly in
the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon eventually sacrificed Ehrlichman and Haldeman to the
cover-up campaign; they resigned at the president's request on
April 30, 1973, weeks before the Senate hearings in which John
Dean, the president's former counsel, would begin to reveal the
depth of Nixon's complicity.
</P>
<P>
   After going to prison, Ehrlichman said he had brought his
troubles on himself. ``I abdicated my moral judgments and turned
them over to somebody else,'' he said in 1977. ``And if I had any
advice for my kids, it would be to never, ever defer your moral
judgments to anybody _ your parents, your wife, anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Egil (Bud) Krogh, who headed the plumbers unit for a time and
served four months in prison, said Monday that he regretted his own
role in the Watergate-related scandals and that he should have
served Ehrlichman better. He said they had remained close over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``John felt really saddened by the whole thing,'' said Krogh,
who practices law in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman called the characters in his 1976 novel ``The
Company'' (Simon and Schuster) ``wholly fictional,'' but the
disclaimer was unconvincing to anyone at all familiar with
Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In the novel, a White House operative is caught burglarizing the
office of a Democratic candidate in San Francisco. Hearing of this,
a high government official (not the president) worries to his wife:
``I have a feeling someone has just lit a very long fuse that leads
right to me, sweetheart. Just pray to God I'm wrong.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ At any other time, Lewis R. Mitz would have been an
easy touch for the young man who came to his front door collecting
money for the Salvation Army. But he politely brushed off the
fund-raiser because this was a Thursday night in winter, and, as it
has been for the last quarter century of Mitz's life, Thursday
night is hockey night.
</P>
<P>
   A successful lawyer and real estate investor, Mitz, 54, had
already changed from his suit and tie into an old pair of nylon
pants so worn and torn they were held together with safety pins. He
pulled on a 30-year-old red windbreaker, and carried a pair of
thick hockey gloves, worn at the palms, that were almost as old as
his son Ryan, 21, who was back from college and free to play in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The game. For nearly three decades, every Thursday night, it has
been the game. Same place, the Phil White Arena, tucked into a
hard-to-find Toronto ravine. Same time, 8:30 p.m., an absolutely
luxuriant hour compared with the midnight or 1 a.m. that some adult
hockey teams get ice time in this hockey-crazed city. And largely
the same group of people, who come together week after week, year
after year, in a ritual as Canadian as saying ``excuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment that is sacred to me,'' Mitz said, excited as
any peewee player about to take the ice. He was prepared to spend
most of the next two hours in a clammy, and cold, bare-bones arena
where he had learned to ice skate before the place even had a roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about this place is beautiful,'' he said. ``In fact,
it's pretty rugged. But this is the way Canada lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Canadian will tell you it can be tough living under the same
North American big top with the United States always filling the
center ring. Sometimes you just want to cling to what sets you
apart, they say, what reminds you who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say hockey is Canada, and that has never been more
true than now, while Toronto is braving a major bout of
hockey-induced nostalgia. The Toronto Maple Leafs, after 68 years
playing at what to many Canadians is the Vatican of hockey, Maple
Leaf Gardens, will be moving to a new arena a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   During the final game last Saturday, one of the 15,726 fans who
paid up to $2,000 for a ticket held up a sign that said ``Hockey is
my religion and I'm in church.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadians begin playing hockey just about as soon as they
start to walk. Then some keep playing until they need to walk with
a cane. Dick Cordick, director of registration and insurance for
the Canadian Adult Recreational Hockey Association in Ottawa,
figures there must be at least 600,000 Canadian men and a growing
number of women who play hockey while they are in their 30s, 40s,
50s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   With so many baby boomers trying to hang on to the vestiges of
youth, the competition for ice time has become fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less ice available than what is needed in this
city,'' said Rita Shahani, a Toronto recreation department employee
who keeps track of rink time at the Phil White Arena and other
rinks in Toronto's west end. ``It's become a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only by sheer stamina that Mitz's group manages to keep
its privileged time slot at a publicly owned rink. It was Robert
Masters, the father of two of the current Thursday Night Hockey
players, who originally reserved the time, but an injury sidelined
him years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Masters, a lawyer, cannot remember how long the 8:30-to-10 slot
has been in his name, but he knows it dates back to before the Phil
White Arena was covered with a Quonset hut-style roof.
</P>
<P>
   That was 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a homely thing, just a few smelly locker rooms, a few
soda dispensers, a whirring Zamboni machine that lays down a fresh
flood of shimmering ice before each game, and the stirring
possibilities of the ice itself, which all 20 men will tell you has
the ability to make dreams real.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about business and this is not about networking,''
said Stephen Kauffman, 50, the director of real estate for Home
Depot in Canada, who has been a Thursday night regular for more
than 20 years. ``This is not about anything except being a boy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the mystique, the players say, is that for an hour or
so, each player gets to set up the dimensions of his own world.
Some imagine being center ice at the Gardens. Some imagine they are
18 again. Some just skate and imagine what it would be like if life
really were hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Although every player can afford the newest and best hockey
equipment, they take the ice in some pretty ratty outfits. Robert
M. Davidson, 48, has as many holes in his hockey socks as he does
houses in the real estate listings he handles as a successful
agent. Throughout the locker room, ancient shoulder pads sit on
shoulders that were once squarer than now, and gloves are old
enough to genuinely be called wizened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that those guys can't afford better clothes,''
Kauffman said. ``But we live in a world where you get your car
washed once a week. This game is like the rebellion against
structure. When you're out there on the ice there's no referee.
It's all self-regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows the rules because they made them: no checking,
no rough blocking, no slap shots unless you have a clear path to
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   But there should be no mistaking _ this is no Sunday afternoon
softball game. The younger players, in their early 30's, skate hard
enough to make the old-timers sweat. To keep things competitive,
they use itinerant goalies provided by an agency called
Rent-a-Goalie, and they play hard.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of missed shots, erratic pucks and dropped
sticks. There isn't too much in the way of organized play making,
or fancy skating. As the night wears on, Kauffman switches to a
special hockey stick that is longer than normal by about six
inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 50 years old, I need every inch I can get,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the night, nobody really knows the score but they
all know that the light jerseys have two more goals than dark.
</P>
<P>
   Fridays after the game are often filled with creakiness and sore
spots, but not on the heart. ``I may get bruised, and I get cut
sometimes,'' Mitz said, ``but the people I deal with on Friday
can't get me upset.''
</P>
<P>
   These have been difficult times for Canadian hockey. Americans
dominate the National Hockey League, the Canadian women's hockey
team did not win the Olympic gold medal it was expected to win last
year, and junior hockey has been hit by several sexual abuse
scandals, including the discovery of a group of adults who preyed
on young boys at Maple Leaf Gardens itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs will play their first game in the brand-new Air
Canada Center next Saturday. Hockey memories have been revived
nonstop in offices and around restaurant tables throughout Toronto
for the last few weeks, and some fans even cried when the last game
ended.
</P>
<P>
   But no memory, no matter how strong, no matter how evocative,
substitutes for the game itself. Sammy Davis, president of the Late
Night Adult Hockey Association of Toronto, said that on the night
of the last game at Maple Leaf Gardens, all of his scheduled adult
hockey games went on as scheduled, and every player showed up. He
expects the same this Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition is important,'' Davis said, ``but the game is more
important.''

<P>
   TORONTO _ At any other time, Lewis R. Mitz would have been an
easy touch for the young man who came to his front door collecting
money for the Salvation Army. But he politely brushed off the
fund-raiser because this was a Thursday night in winter, and, as it
has been for the last quarter century of Mitz's life, Thursday
night is hockey night.
</P>
<P>
   A successful lawyer and real estate investor, Mitz, 54, had
already changed from his suit and tie into an old pair of nylon
pants so worn and torn they were held together with safety pins. He
pulled on a 30-year-old red windbreaker, and carried a pair of
thick hockey gloves, worn at the palms, that were almost as old as
his son Ryan, 21, who was back from college and free to play in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The game. For nearly three decades, every Thursday night, it has
been the game. Same place, the Phil White Arena, tucked into a
hard-to-find Toronto ravine. Same time, 8:30 p.m., an absolutely
luxuriant hour compared with the midnight or 1 a.m. that some adult
hockey teams get ice time in this hockey-crazed city. And largely
the same group of people, who come together week after week, year
after year, in a ritual as Canadian as saying ``excuse me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a moment that is sacred to me,'' Mitz said, excited as
any peewee player about to take the ice. He was prepared to spend
most of the next two hours in a clammy, and cold, bare-bones arena
where he had learned to ice skate before the place even had a roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing about this place is beautiful,'' he said. ``In fact,
it's pretty rugged. But this is the way Canada lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Any Canadian will tell you it can be tough living under the same
North American big top with the United States always filling the
center ring. Sometimes you just want to cling to what sets you
apart, they say, what reminds you who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Some people say hockey is Canada, and that has never been more
true than now, while Toronto is braving a major bout of
hockey-induced nostalgia. The Toronto Maple Leafs, after 68 years
playing at what to many Canadians is the Vatican of hockey, Maple
Leaf Gardens, will be moving to a new arena a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   During the final game last Saturday, one of the 15,726 fans who
paid up to $2,000 for a ticket held up a sign that said ``Hockey is
my religion and I'm in church.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadians begin playing hockey just about as soon as they
start to walk. Then some keep playing until they need to walk with
a cane. Dick Cordick, director of registration and insurance for
the Canadian Adult Recreational Hockey Association in Ottawa,
figures there must be at least 600,000 Canadian men and a growing
number of women who play hockey while they are in their 30s, 40s,
50s and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   With so many baby boomers trying to hang on to the vestiges of
youth, the competition for ice time has become fierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less ice available than what is needed in this
city,'' said Rita Shahani, a Toronto recreation department employee
who keeps track of rink time at the Phil White Arena and other
rinks in Toronto's west end. ``It's become a commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only by sheer stamina that Mitz's group manages to keep
its privileged time slot at a publicly owned rink. It was Robert
Masters, the father of two of the current Thursday Night Hockey
players, who originally reserved the time, but an injury sidelined
him years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Masters, a lawyer, cannot remember how long the 8:30-to-10 slot
has been in his name, but he knows it dates back to before the Phil
White Arena was covered with a Quonset hut-style roof.
</P>
<P>
   That was 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is a homely thing, just a few smelly locker rooms, a few
soda dispensers, a whirring Zamboni machine that lays down a fresh
flood of shimmering ice before each game, and the stirring
possibilities of the ice itself, which all 20 men will tell you has
the ability to make dreams real.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about business and this is not about networking,''
said Stephen Kauffman, 50, the director of real estate for Home
Depot in Canada, who has been a Thursday night regular for more
than 20 years. ``This is not about anything except being a boy.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Part of the mystique, the players say, is that for an hour or
so, each player gets to set up the dimensions of his own world.
Some imagine being center ice at the Gardens. Some imagine they are
18 again. Some just skate and imagine what it would be like if life
really were hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Although every player can afford the newest and best hockey
equipment, they take the ice in some pretty ratty outfits. Robert
M. Davidson, 48, has as many holes in his hockey socks as he does
houses in the real estate listings he handles as a successful
agent. Throughout the locker room, ancient shoulder pads sit on
shoulders that were once squarer than now, and gloves are old
enough to genuinely be called wizened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that those guys can't afford better clothes,''
Kauffman said. ``But we live in a world where you get your car
washed once a week. This game is like the rebellion against
structure. When you're out there on the ice there's no referee.
It's all self-regulating.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows the rules because they made them: no checking,
no rough blocking, no slap shots unless you have a clear path to
the goal.
</P>
<P>
   But there should be no mistaking _ this is no Sunday afternoon
softball game. The younger players, in their early 30's, skate hard
enough to make the old-timers sweat. To keep things competitive,
they use itinerant goalies provided by an agency called
Rent-a-Goalie, and they play hard.
</P>
<P>

MEESE PANEL URGES CURBS ON FEDERAL OFFENSES
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An American Bar Association panel led by former
Attorney General Edwin Meese III warned lawmakers Monday against
the ``misguided, unnecessary and harmful'' tendency of showing they
are tough on criminals by turning more offenses into federal
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a report, the panel said that the penchant for federalizing
crimes that had been the purview of the states _ like murder, drug
possession and trafficking, rape and robbery _ ran counter to the
nation's historic reluctance to concentrate broad powers in a
national police force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enactment of each new federal crime bestows new federal
investigative power on federal agencies, broadening their power to
intrude into individual lives,'' the report said. ``Expansion of
federal jurisdiction also creates the opportunity for greater
collection and maintenance of data at the federal level in an era
when various databases are computerized and linked.''
</P>
<P>
   The task force's reports said the federalization of crime was
quickening as lawmakers, seeking to be perceived as being tough on
crime, were approving an increasing number of federal criminal
statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The report said 40 percent of all federal criminal laws that had
been enacted since the Civil War were passed since 1970. In the
previous congressional term, more than 1,000 bills dealing with
federal criminal statutes were introduced through July.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the task force said, so many federal criminal statutes
are now on the books that ``there is no conveniently accessible,
complete list of federal crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``The Federalization of Criminal Law,'' is
similar in tone to comments made in December by Chief Justice
William Rehnquist. In his year-end report to the judiciary,
Rehnquist criticized Congress, saying that it was buckling under
pressure to ``appear responsive to every highly publicized societal
ill or sensational crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's report is also noteworthy since the task force was
headed by Meese, who, during his tenure as President Ronald
Reagan's attorney general, had the reputation as being a prosecutor
tough on crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report warned in dire language of the potential threats of
the explosive growth in federal criminal statutes. It noted that
federal criminal justice system expenditures grew by 317 percent
from 1982 to 1993, compared with a 163 percent increase in state
criminal justice financing in the same period. And the report said
the number of federal prosecutors in U.S. attorneys offices
increased to 8,000 from 3,000 in the last 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Several new laws that were passed amid heightened publicity,
like legislation in 1994 making ``drive-by shootings'' federal
offenses, did not result in the filing of even a single charge in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that of the 59,242 federal charges that were
made against individuals in 1997, 16,629, or 28 percent, were for
only one type of offense _ drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increased federalization is rarely, if ever, likely to have
any appreciable effect on the categories of violent crime that most
concern Americans, because in practice federal law enforcement can
only reach a small percent of such activity,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that despite the huge increase in financing for federal
anti-crime efforts, 95 percent of all prosecutions are still
handled by state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the increase number of federal crimes placed new
strains on federal courts. Scarce resources for the federal courts
were increasingly being soaked up by criminal trials, sentencing
hearings, post-sentencing matters and appeals. ``Civil litigants
therefore suffer because of the priority that must be given to any
increase in federal prosecutions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report's authors also worried that increased federal
responsibility in the criminal arena might confuse and discourage
local law enforcement efforts. ``In light of federal assumption of
jurisdiction, some state entities may hesitate in pursuing the
conduct in question,'' the report said. ``Such hesitation or
withdrawal by local law enforcement would undermine the primary
role played by state law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested several means to help Congress refrain from
enacting more federal criminal statutes.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended, for example, that Congress consider the costs to
the federal and state systems of any new federal criminal law
before any new criminal statutes are enacted. The panel suggested
that the Congressional Budget Office or the Congressional Research
Service could conduct such an analysis. The panel also recommended
that new federal criminal laws contain a ``sunset provision'' of no
more than five years that would force lawmakers to take another
look at the need for the law after passions had cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to halt the trend, the report said, could have dire
constitutional consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current federalization trend presents a troubling picture
with far-reaching consequences,'' the report concluded. ''It
reflects a phenomenon capable of altering and undermining the
careful decentralization of criminal law authority that has worked
well for all of our constitutional history.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Shifting support will make voucher fight different this time
around
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ask Samantha Smoot about the chances of a school
voucher pilot program getting through the Legislature this session,
and the staunch voucher opponent breaks into a broad grin.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Texas Freedom Network, which Smoot now heads,
and other voucher opponents had little to smile about. They were up
against a savvy and well-heeled voucher lobby, favorable public
opinion polls and a lackluster public school system. Though the
vote fell short for vouchers, it was close.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers again are wrestling with the question of whether
public tax dollars should be used to send students to private
schools. But this time, Smoot and others sense they have the upper
hand _ if not the money _ in the ongoing battle.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a major rally today in support of vouchers that is
expected to draw Gov. George W. Bush and as many as 1,500 Texas
parents, several observers say the political momentum for vouchers
has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things are going on in education that undermine the
voucher lobby's momentum,'' Smoot said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas public schools have registered marked improvement _ even
gaining national acclaim in some areas. Dozens of state-financed
charter schools are up and running, providing parents more choice
in the public school setting. Furthermore, public opinion polls
have shifted, with Texans now less supportive of diverting public
tax dollars to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   With battle lines increasingly blurred and public opinion
shifting, a voucher program _ even a small pilot as proponents now
are pushing _ faces high hurdles in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will not be easy,'' said Lt. Gov. Rick Perry's spokesman,
Ray Sullivan, when asked about the chances of a voucher pilot
passing this session.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the voucher proposals before lawmakers this session
would give thousands of students in low-performing schools the
right to transfer to any public, private or religious school at
state expense.
</P>
<P>
   Private schools that participate in the voucher pilot, however,
would have to test voucher students by using the state achievement
test, agree to take students on a first-come, first-served basis,
and follow other state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Those strings, tied to money, are necessary for accountability,
said Democratic House Speaker Pete Laney, a voucher opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are using taxpayer dollars, you just can't give
taxpayer dollars away without accountability,'' Laney said. ``Many
of these schools very much would like to have free money, but there
must be accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment worries some private school operators and social
conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any private school that whole hog buys into a voucher funding
system will inevitably lose the ability to provide education that
is uniquely built around the values of their faith group,'' said
Phil Strickland, director of the Christian Life Commission, the
public policy arm of the Baptist General Convention of Texas.
``Ultimately, private schools will get entangled in the spider web
of government control.''
</P>
<P>
   Government regulations, which surely would accompany a voucher
pilot, have raised the red flag among social conservative
organizations and some Catholic school operators, long considered
loyal to the voucher movement.
</P>
<P>
   Cathie Adams, president of the socially conservative Eagle
Forum, warned in December: ``We see it as a back-door approach to
control every private school in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Talley, a spokesman for Putting Children First, one of the
leading pro-voucher groups, concedes that defections by these
groups have slowed momentum. But he says he believes a pilot
project still has support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to be for every private school, and if they
don't want them, they don't have to take them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But as some private school operators and conservative groups
have shifted away from vouchers, some Democrats and minority
parents have started leaning toward them.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston long was the sole African American
lawmaker supporting vouchers. In recent years, he has been joined
by Rep. Glenn Lewis, D-Fort Worth. Lewis and Wilson support a
voucher pilot because they say it would allow minority students
trapped in low-performing, inner-city schools to flee to better
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   That's also why Angie Garcia and her group of Hispanic parents,
San Antonio Parents for School Choice, are supporting vouchers and
targeting South Texas lawmakers to win support.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts run counter to shifting public opinion. In 1995,
more than half _ 55 percent _ of Texans favored a voucher program
using tax dollars to send public school students to private
schools, according to the Texas Poll. Thirty-five percent were
opposed.
</P>
<P>
   That has flip-flopped: Now, nearly half _ 49 percent _ of Texans
surveyed are opposed to vouchers, while 41 percent favor them. The
recent poll of 1,001 adult Texans was conducted between Jan. 21 and
Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Support appears to be fading, even for a limited voucher project
as proposed by Rep. Mike Krusee, R-Round Rock, or Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Texans split almost evenly when asked if they supported the
Legislature creating a pilot voucher program to allow
low-performing students in poor-performing schools to use tax
dollars for private schools _ with 45 percent favoring a voucher
pilot and 46 percent opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, however, more than half _ 56 percent _ of Texans
favored such a program, according to the Texas Poll, while 36
percent opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   At least one lawmaker says he owes his November election to a
shift on voucher sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt I was elected because of the
swing vote _ Republicans who voted for me,'' said David Lengefeld,
D-Hamilton, who opposes vouchers and whose district includes parts
of Copperas Cove, Gatesville and Stephenville.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman lawmaker, who replaced Allen Place, added: ``I
believe a big part of that was the voucher issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in rural areas, vouchers are losing ground,
Lengefeld and Laney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In rural areas your whole community is centered around the
church and school,'' Laney said. ``The school is the biggest
employer in a lot of communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of that, vouchers, even in a small pilot, will be
tough-going in Laney's House. Currently, seven Democrats _ most of
whom are opposed to vouchers _ sit on the nine-member House Public
Education Committee, which would consider any voucher legislation.
</P>
<P>
   It still could pass the House via an amendment, but likely would
be felled in the Senate, where it takes only 11 of the 31 votes to
block consideration of a bill on the floor _ which happened in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   All of those factors have voucher opponents smiling and voucher
proponents scurrying for additional support.

 &HT;    Change in judicial elections proposed
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In what may be the Legislature's boldest stroke
to change how Texas judges are selected, state Rep. Pete Gallego
has drafted legislation to get rid of party politics and big money
in top judicial elections.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego's draft bill, incorporating Chief Justice Tom Phillips'
proposals, would finance Supreme Court and Court of Criminal
Appeals races with taxes collected from most of the state's 65,000
lawyers. Gallego, D-Alpine, sits on the Texas Judicial Council and
Phillips leads the policy-planning group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sounds like the most creative idea on campaign financing
yet,'' said Anthony Champagne, a University of Texas at Dallas
professor and national authority on judicial selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very different, very creative effort in that
regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Partisan election of Texas judges was villainized on the eve of
last fall's Supreme Court election by ``60 Minutes'' correspondent
Mike Wallace. Wallace updated a 1987 investigation of campaign
contributions influencing the state Supreme Court, concluding that
Texas judicial elections remained open to abuse despite limits on
judicial contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego said the idea was born at a breakfast he had last fall
with Phillips as they talked about the ``60 Minutes'' television
report. Phillips, stung by criticism that the court's decisions
generally favor the defense lawyers who have been its biggest
recent contributors, has lobbied for limiting campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Phillips was saying he hated raising campaign money,
that everyone on the court hated it,'' Gallego said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gallego proposal may meet opposition even among the
judges on the Supreme Court. ``It's horrible,'' said Justice Greg
Abbott, who favors a merit-selection method by which judges would
be appointed first and later stand for a retention election in
which voters approve or disapprove of their job. ``I'm against
taxing people for the purpose of using it for campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Center for State Courts, only
Wisconsin now finances judicial campaigns (and other statewide
races) with public money. Texas would be unique in paying just for
judicial elections and unique in financing it through a levy on
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gallego's proposal is similar to a proposed constitutional
rewrite and other bills that allow the governor to appoint judges
and have retention elections, while getting rid of party labels.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of eight states with partisan judicial elections.
But critics say the current state system is tainted because
expensive partisan campaigns are necessary for statewide election
in judicial races.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush remains opposed to changing the current
system, however, said his spokeswoman, Karen Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The Gallego bill would finance campaigns with proceeds from the
$200 lawyer occupation tax assessed on private attorneys in Texas.
That tax raises about $9 million a year, said Laureen Chernow,
Texas State Bar spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Under a draft of Gallego's proposal, judicial candidates would
qualify for public campaign financing by raising at least $30,000
from contributors who would give when they signed the candidate's
petition. Contributor-- would give no more than $100 apiece. That
$30,000 or more would then be supplemented by a share of a campaign
fund split among qualified candidates running for the Supreme Court
or Court of Criminal Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But Champagne said the problem of indirect contributions
supporting a candidate _ law firms, for example, buying TV ads _
could undermine the Gallego proposal. ``The result is that you get
Baker &AMP; Botts, Vinson &AMP; Elkins and Fulbright &AMP; Jaworski still
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in the campaigns,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can stop those independent expenditures.''

TOP OFFICIALS JOIN CROWD IN GUINEA AS BODY OF SLAIN PEDDLER
ARRIVES

<P>
   CONAKRY, GUINEA _ The prime minister of this small West African
nation joined an array of government officials, family and friends
on the sweltering airport tarmac to welcome Amadou Diallo's parents
as they arrived from the United States on Monday to find that their
son, in death, had attained the status of a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of our people, he left to go to another country, and
he worked hard and studied hard,'' said Prime Minister Sidya Toure,
speaking of Diallo, the Guinean street peddler who was shot to
death by four New York City police officers on Feb. 4. ``But he is
a Guinean, one of ours always, and it's natural that we should show
solidarity with him because of the way he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's coffin, a plain pine box with his name and destination
written in felt-tipped pen on the top, was removed from the plane
that brought it from Newark International Airport in New Jersey,
through Paris, to Conakry, the capital. It was driven in a
screeching motorcade of air-conditioned government vans and
battered private cars that sped along a rutted road lined with
fruit vendors and smoking grills to the city morgue.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour rally outside the morgue and then a
government-sponsored prayer service for Diallo are scheduled for
Tuesday. On Wednesday, the family and numerous government officials
will take the coffin 300 miles to Hollade Bouru, the village where
Diallo's father was born.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Saikou Diallo, said that his son had spent school
vacations in the village. The son will be buried next to his
grandfather, who was a teacher and scholar of the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of many of the country's top ministers in a crowd
of about 100 people at the airport was just one sign of the
distress and excitement that Diallo's killing has aroused in
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Many young men at the airport wore white T-shirts on which
Diallo's photograph and name were printed in black. The Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has organized the caravan to accompany the body to
the cemetery on Wednesday. One ministry official said the trip
could take much longer than the normal five hours because people
living along the route had been encouraged, on government radio and
television, to join it as the motorcade passed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case has received much attention in the official
media, partly as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a young
black immigrant in New York City, and partly as a reflection of the
unrelenting coverage that the killing has received in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It has also provided an eye-opening account of black political
activism in the United States, several Guineans said. Accounts of
the rallies held in New York City after the Diallo shooting have
been printed in the newspapers, and most people on the street, it
seemed, now know exactly how many bullets _ 41 _ were fired by the
police officers who killed the 22-year-old immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not naive. We know there is racism in America,'' said a
man named Antoine waiting for friends outside the airport. He
refused to give his last name. ``And we have many bodies of our
compatriots coming back to Guinea who have been killed there. But
now we want to show our support for the struggle of black people in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Diallo, who have been divorced for five years,
flew home with the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network
made the flight arrangements and shepherded the family through news
conferences, public appearances and tours of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, on his first visit to Guinea, said Diallo's mother had
asked him to be the executor of her son's estate. He said he would
stay in the country until after the funeral. ``I promised this lady
I would stay with her son until he is laid to rest,'' said Sharpton
during the flight, nodding toward Kadiadou Diallo, who was sitting
across from him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo said she and her former husband had met several of
the men who are now government ministers when the couple had an
import-export business in Thailand. They imported gemstones from
Guinea for jewelers in Southeast Asia, beginning in about 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo spent much of his youth out of Guinea. His parents
said he studied at a French international school in Bangkok,
starting in 1990, and then in 1993, in Singapore, took courses in
computers and accounting, conducted in English.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents also are well traveled. The father said he followed
a family and tribal merchant tradition, starting at age 17 by
buying and selling goods between Guinea and neighboring Liberia and
Ivory Coast. He left Guinea in the early 1960s, because
then-President Sekou Toure restricted private business, and
eventually settled in Thailand after a round-the-world trip to the
United States, Europe and Asia to decide which countries had the
best climate for trading.
</P>
<P>
   He said his son was also observing that tradition in his work as
a street vendor. ``He was good at business,'' Saikou Diallo said.

 &HT;    Testimony begins in Texas dragging deathBy Denise Gamino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ It is perhaps the most watched jury in the
country and it will gather at an undisclosed location this morning
to be escorted to work by armed guards.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 jurors and two alternates will be driven in a small bus
to a special driveway cordoned off by yellow rope at the
Victorian-style Jasper County courthouse. They will wear badges
that identify them as jurors and news photographers are forbidden
from taking their pictures.
</P>
<P>
   The government is taking no chances as testimony begins today in
the trial of the first of three white men accused of dragging James
Byrd Jr. behind a pickup until he was beheaded last summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more brutal and it's more racial than you guys
anticipate,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy James Gray told
reporters on Monday. ``It's a bad case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The proof is going to be more than just Saturday night drunks
in a fight,'' he said. ``I expect the community and the jury to be
astonished as the evidence unfolds.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury of seven men and five women is not all-white. Court
officials have released no other details about the panelists who
will decide the fate of John William ``Bill'' King, 23, an
unemployed labor.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities allege King, an ex-convict, was the ringleader in
plotting Byrd's death on June 7. Byrd, who was unemployed and
disabled, was beaten, stripped and chained to a pickup that dragged
him nearly three miles on a backwoods road outside Jasper,
prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   King, who claims he is innocent, could receive the death penalty
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say they found a spot of blood on King's shoes and
confiscated white supremacy literature and photographs from his
apartment the morning after Byrd's murder. King was a member of a
white supremacy group called the Confederate Knights of America and
was working to form his own white supremacy group in the Jasper
area, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   King is heavily tattooed with white supremacy symbols. One
tattoo shows a black man hanging from a tree branch.
</P>
<P>
   King's court-appointed defense attorney, C. Haden ``Sonny''
Cribbs, Jr., said the government has compiled about 4,500 pages of
documents, photographs, charts, and records, as well as several
video tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence appears overwhelming'' against King, Cribbs said,
but ``some of it may or may not be admissible.'' Still, ``you've
got to prove that the person did it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cribbs tried to have the murder trial moved away from Jasper
County because of intense news coverage of Byrd's death, but was
overruled by State District Judge Joe Bob Golden. Cribbs plans to
seek a change of venue again this morning before testimony begins,
he said, but doubts it will be granted.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has been asked by the New Black Panthers of Dallas to
rescind his order prohibiting any groups from gathering within a
two-block radius of the courthouse during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the New Black Panthers, many carrying shotguns,
came to Jasper to counter protest at a courthouse rally held by the
Ku Klux Klan. The two groups exchanged heated words, but law
officers prevented any fights.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper County authorities support the judge's order prohibiting
courthouse gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee you that the judge is not going to permit any
activity that would intimidate this jury,'' said Gray, the district
attorney.

SCIENTISTS UNCOVER CLUES TO FLU EPIDEMIC OF 1918 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GINA KOLATA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists report on Tuesday that they have completed the first
major step in deciphering the secrets of one of the deadliest
viruses ever known, the influenza virus of 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Though their work answers some questions about the origin of the
virus, the scientists say it leaves the most fundamental question
dangling: What made the virus, which killed 20 million to 40
million people worldwide, so lethal?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey K. Taubenberger of the Armed Forces Institute of
Pathology in Washington and his colleagues have determined the
sequence of an essential gene, the hemagglutinin, finding that it
is perfectly ordinary and dashing the hopes of those who had hoped
it might hold the virus' deadly secrets. But an analysis of that
gene did show that a popular hypothesis _ that the virus jumped
directly from birds to people _ was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Taubenberger's paper is published on Tuesday in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Virologists are chilled by the statistics from the 1918 flu,
which killed mostly people age 20 to 40. If such a plague came
today, killing a similar fraction of the U.S. population, 1.5
million Americans would die. It would kill more Americans in a
single year than die annually from heart disease, cancers, strokes,
chronic pulmonary disease, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease combined.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the secret of the 1918 flu has been the ultimate goal of
Taubenberger's meticulous work, which has riveted the attention of
influenza experts. He expects to complete his genetic analysis,
getting the sequence of all eight of the virus' genes, by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   It may be, Taubenberger said, that even when every gene of the
virus is known, there will be no answers; perhaps it was many small
changes that combined to make the virus a killer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Oxford, a virologist at Royal London Hospital, said he
suspected that there was an obvious genetic reason why the virus
was so lethal. But Oxford said that if the virus turned out to be
mundane, if it was something about the circumstances, like the
crowding and troop movements of World War I that caused the deadly
epidemic, ``that would give us some degree of comfort because it's
very unlikely that all these things could happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all after the same goal here,'' Dr. Oxford said.
</P>
<P>
   Taubenberger's current work gives virologists hope that their
goal is in sight. It a ``tour de force,'' said Dr. Robert Webster,
a flu expert from St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in
Memphis, in a telephone interview from Hong Kong, where he is
instituting a new surveillance system to look for new and
potentially lethal flu strains.
</P>
<P>
   Taubenberger and his colleagues began by finding shards of the
1918 virus in shreds of lung tissue from flu victims, preserved
since 1918. Then they fished the fragments out with powerful
methods of molecular biology and pieced them together.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists chose as their first target the virus'
hemagglutinin gene, which directs the production of a protein that
the virus uses to hoist itself into lung cells. Many virologists
thought that changes in the hemagglutinin gene determined how
infectious and how dangerous a flu strain could be.
</P>
<P>
   While Taubenberger's analysis of that gene did not reveal any
such nefarious features, it did cast doubt on a widespread
hypothesis about the origins of deadly flu strains.
</P>
<P>
   In two other flu epidemics this century, in 1957 and 1968, a new
virus that resembled bird viruses swept the world, leading Webster
to propose that the worst strains of flu viruses arise in birds.
</P>
<P>
   But Taubenberger found that the 1918 virus was more closely
related to viruses that infect pigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's different from the pandemics of 1957 and 1968,'' he
said. ``It makes the hypothesis a bit more complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   He cannot say whether the virus jumped from pigs to humans or
from humans to pigs, but, he said, he can rule out a direct avian
origin.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The work also showed that the 1918 virus apparently did not
change much as it circled the globe. Taubenberger and his
colleagues analyzed the complete hemagglutinin gene from one flu
victim and half of it from two others. They found that the gene
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Lung samples from three people who died of the flu in 1918 ended
up in Taubenberger's laboratory in fortuitous ways.
</P>
<P>
   One sample was from a 21-year-old Army private, Roscoe Vaughan,
who died in Camp Jackson, S.C., at 6:30 a.m. on Sept. 26, 1918. At
2 p.m., an Army doctor arrived to do an autopsy, cutting off a
slice from Vaughan's lungs, impregnating it with formaldehyde and
embedding it in a chunk of candle wax about the size of a
thumbnail. Then he sent it to Washington, where it was stored in a
small brown box on a shelf of a vast pathology warehouse until
Taubenberger found it one day in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that Vaughan died, Pvt. James Downs, a
30-year-old soldier at Camp Upton, N.Y., succumbed to influenza
after three days in the base hospital. He, too, was autopsied, by
an army captain who wrote that a ``bloody froth'' came from Downs'
lungs. His lung tissue, too, ended up in the pathology warehouse,
stored until 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the soldiers died, an obese woman died when the
flu swept through her isolated Alaskan village. She was buried in a
mass grave, along with 72 other adults _ virtually all of the
adults who lived there. Dr. Johan V. Hultin, a retired pathologist
from San Francisco, unearthed the woman's still-frozen body about a
year and a half ago and sent samples of her lungs to Taubenberger
for his analysis.

CRACKING DOWN ON COPS AND CRIME ALONG MEXICO'S BORDER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Nev.)   (See also MEXICO-CLINTON) 
(jw) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico _ Moctezuma Rodriguez Meza says he has
learned a thing or two about the corrupting power of greed during a
long career in law enforcement, corrections and security. And it
has come in handy, he says, now that he is here in his native town
trying to reform one of the most notoriously corrupt and violent
police forces along the trade-booming, drug-rich U.S.-Mexico
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``For three years here in Nuevo Laredo, it was chaos,'' said
Rodriguez, the new police chief of the city, directly across the
Rio Grande from Laredo, Texas, at what is by far the border's
busiest commercial crossing. ``There was violence, robberies,
shootings, and we've discovered that in a number of the incidents,
police officers were involved. Ordinary people were abused by the
police regularly; bribes were demanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was talking about the Nuevo Laredo governed by the
previous administration, which presided over a city where by all
accounts drug wars and official corruption had reached alarming
dimensions even by the standards of border towns. Cleanup claims by
new administrations are common on both sides of the border, of
course, and the purported cleanup here comes just after the Mexican
government announced a new ``total war'' on narcotics and just
before the annual March 1 deadline for the president of the United
States to certify to Congress whether Mexico is a reliable partner
in the war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
   So Rodriguez will understand if his listener is a bit wary. But
he insists that he and the new mayor, Horacio Garza, are in
earnest, determined to cleanse this teeming city, which has nearly
doubled in population, to 400,000, in the five years since the
North American Free Trade Agreement was adopted.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, 49, works out of a dark corner office on the second
floor of the city's shabby police headquarters, at the southern
edge of the downtown tourist district. Since taking office on Jan.
1, he has dismissed 130 of the department's 600 officers, including
all six division commanders. The only thing slowing him is that the
police academy he created in January will not turn out the first of
its every-other-month class of 60 officers until March, and he can
manage to reduce the force only so much before fresh graduates
become available.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they are cautiously optimistic, hopeful that
Rodriguez's seemingly energetic efforts mean he is a genuine
reformer. ``We are very positive about what he's done thus far,''
said Rudy Watkins, principal officer at the U.S. consulate in Nuevo
Laredo. ``But he's only been in there since Jan. 1, so it's too
early to tell much. So far, we haven't seen much change.''
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Garza, director of the Commission for Human Rights here
in the state of Tamaulipas, also finds it too early to declare
victory. Even if Rodriguez proves as good as his promises and his
early crackdown, the question remains whether official corruption
is too much an endemic problem for him to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Garza (no relation to the mayor) said that his office handled
nearly 400 complaints of human rights violations in prisons and
towns throughout the state last year and that the majority involved
abuses by Nuevo Laredo police officers, everything from curbside
shakedowns to torture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to wait to see how this story will end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez acknowledges that it is common for a new police chief
_ or, for that matter, a department head in any new administration
_ to make dismissals a first order of business. But he vows that
his drive will be no fleeting thing and will be aimed not at
earlier patronage hirings but at corrupt, undisciplined and lazy
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he says, just a few weeks into his tenure, he senses
less violence and less tension on the narrow, rutted streets of
Nuevo Laredo, thick with traffic and pedestrians, some of them
among the growing number of tourists from north of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was born in Nuevo Laredo and became commandant of the
overcrowded La Loma prison here before serving an initial two-year
term as the city's police chief beginning in 1983. Later he worked
for the state police and the Mexican attorney general's
antismuggling task force before returning here to become chief of
security for a local politician's campaign for the Mexican
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Then, three years ago, ``I thought Las Vegas might be worth
trying.'' He went to work there as a casino security officer, but
late last year, homesick and energized by the reform promises of
Mayor-elect Garza, decided to apply for the chief's job again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem I found when I came in here was lack of
discipline and leadership,'' he said. ``Before, police would abuse
people, be involved in robberies, have shootings for no real
reason, act as bodyguards for narco-traffickers _ and they would
not be punished, not even reprimanded. So everything unraveled.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of months this fall and winter came a series of
horrors: Two Nuevo Laredo officers were grabbed off the streets by
unidentified abductors and have not been seen since. Another two
officers were killed when automatic weapons fire tore through their
patrol car. And then 12 Nuevo Laredo policemen were involved in the
shooting of a state officer. Rodriguez says he has no doubt that
all these incidents were somehow related to drugs and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   The new chief says he has taken no special precautions for his
own safety since the dismissals began and that he has had no real
trouble other than a handful of threatening phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   He opened his desk drawer and pulled out a glossy magazine about
law enforcement in Central and South America. On the cover was a
general in Colombia who used to be among those in charge of that
country's antidrug efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know him,'' Rodriguez said proudly. ``The cartels have put a
price on his head of $10 million.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of another drawer he pulled a snapshot of himself and the
Colombian officer standing at attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no price on my head,'' Rodriguez said, a thin smile
forming at the corner of his mouth. ``Not yet. It is early.''

   NEW YORK _ Never mind those cozy Valentine's Day sentiments.
Donna Karan's DKNY show on Sunday caught the weird chill blowing
between the sexes, and it wasn't just because her guys and gals
were bundled in polar-white rubber coats, padded pullovers or
trousers with a slick, icy feel. Halfway through the show, which
Karan staged on a metallic-blue runway, one fashion editor looked
up, as if snow-blinded, and said, ``Have we seen any men yet?''
</P>
<P>
   There were men, all right, but Karan had unwittingly blotted
them out.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful that Karan, who has trains of products to keep
running, was thinking of the cold sexual climate in recent films
and plays like ``In the Company of Men'' by Neil Labute and
``Closer'' by the British playwright Patrick Marber, which opens
next month on Broadway. In those dramas, the men and women come out
of their smug, well-insulated cocoons only to mate _ and then with
hostile indifference. They're too cynical, too smart, to bother
coming together on any other level when all they really want from
each other is sex.
</P>
<P>
   Though no first-rate designer has come forward to deal with this
theme, it's intriguing that Karan and Cynthia Rowley, who also
showed men's and women's clothes on Sunday, presented collections
that completely hazed the gender lines _ to the point where all the
models, male or female, seemed isolated in their own
anonymous-looking drag.
</P>
<P>
   Not for the first time, Karan relied on high-tech fabrics, like
leather bonded with polar fleece lining and cotton laminated with
resins, to create a look that was resolutely urban, informed, yet
also strangely lacking in flesh-and-blood romance.
</P>
<P>
   Piece by piece, the clothes were certainly novel: a
fleece-bonded coat in icicle-blue calf hair; felted wool jackets
and jersey tops made without shoulder seams; down coats with
pop-on, pop-off duvet covers, and a pair of molded, white leather
motorcycle pants. But as a collection, the many bonded and molded
clothes seemed stiff and Gumby-like, lacking in that offhand
attitude that modern clothes need to avoid being high-tech
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley missed the boat entirely with her collection. She had the
actor Alan Cumming from ``Cabaret,'' dressed as a kind of satyr in
laced-up breeches, mincing down her runway.
</P>
<P>
   But there, in the front row, was his erstwhile co-star Natasha
Richardson, who will be seen next in ``Closer.'' That made Cumming,
however charming, seem like yesterday's news.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley has no obvious feeling for the postmodern mix of colors
and textures, and many of her creations, like a black taffeta shift
striped with leather and a shredded gauze dress, looked hastily
thrown together. In any case, they've been done better by other
designers.
</P>
<P>
   It's understandable if Rowley wants to go in a new direction _
apparently toward a tougher urban look _ but it seems foolish to
abandon the sweet prints and lighthearted touch for which she has
been known.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's collections were indeed something of a mixed bag, as
retailers and fashion editors shifted from tent to tent at Bryant
Park, where many of the big-name shows will be held this week, and
then raced downtown to catch Bruce, a new label designed by Nicole
Noselli and Daphne Guttierrez, or maybe to see Jade Jagger's
jewelry at a party at Lot 61.
</P>
<P>
   Moet &AMP; Chandon, the Champagne maker, organized a show for four
young design teams: David Rodriguez, who showed dandified tweeds
and wide flannel trousers; P.A.K., a line that seemed to
overintellectualize the plainest wrap dress; Robert Danes, who
noted the inspiration of Richard Serra's sculpture and Frank
Gehry's architecture, when a more common touch would have served
for his generic slips, and William Calvert, the most accomplished
of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Calvert, who worked at Balenciaga and Balmain before setting up
his own evening-wear business on West 57th Street, used a lot of
luxe satins in ivory and red, which he mixed with humbler mohair.
</P>
<P>
   Among the British designers showing in New York is Tomasz
Starzewski, who recently got a lot of attention for dressing both
Camilla Parker-Bowles, who is Prince Charles' companion, and Sophie
Rhys-Jones, the fiancee of Prince Edward.
</P>
<P>
   Starzewski, who makes society clothes, was apparently so keen on
making a big impression in New York that he flew over 10 models, as
well as the London florist Stephen Woodhams, who decorated the
designer's runway with pussy willows. Before his show, Starzewski,
who has prominent New Yorkers buying his so-called ``demi-couture''
(made-to-measure clothes at significantly less than haute couture
prices), said that he hoped to expand his $5 million business.
``Our lives are changing, and it's because of New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Starzewski's clothes are certainly very glamorous. He uses a lot
of beautiful tweeds, mohair and glossy silk, in shades of brown,
charcoal, pistachio and violet and then jazzes them up with beading
and dyed-to-match feathers and fur.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something passe about gathered-up satin skirts,
little felt crash helmets and a model whipping open her
important-looking fur to reveal _ shock! _ another satin slip
dress.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown, the famously dapper Mayor of San Francisco,
happened to be in the front row at Starzewski's show and afterward
said he was intrigued by the designer's new men's-wear line but not
altogether sold on its dandified colors and velvets. ``I don't know
yet,'' said a politic Brown. ``I've got to get closer to the
fabrics. I'm not a velvet person, really.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce is not a name that many people know; it may not even be a
name that means anything except to the two women who design it.
</P>
<P>
   In a smoke-filled ballroom on the Lower East Side, Noselli and
Guttierrez showed only a couple of dozen outfits _ gray gaucho
pants, slinky gray sweaters with puckering up the front or strands
of yarn exploding from the shoulders like dreadlocks, a slim dress
inset with a mink bodice _ but they were all charming.
</P>
<P>
   The designers didn't come out at the end, and the audience sat
there for two or three minutes before it realized the show was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Herrera, showing Monday, left little doubt that she has
an uncomplicated sense of what American women want: good-looking,
wearable clothes with a low-key spin of luxury. Herrera cut caramel
leather outfits close to the body and, in lieu of jewelry, added
fur collars or stoles, some of which were tied around the back of
suits or a cashmere sweater.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of self-conscious attempts to be hip or arty, it's
hard not to be seduced by a gray mohair coat in windowpane plaid
with pinstriped trousers and the palest blue shell.

FRANCE SELLS A THIRD OF AEROSPATIALE TO GROUPE LAGARDERE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French government announced agreement Monday on the
terms of a long-expected combination of the state-owned
Aerospatiale group and the privately owned Matra High Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Groupe Lagardere, Matra's owner, will pay
the government as much as $345 million for a third of the shares in
the new company, Aerospatiale-Matra.
</P>
<P>
   It would become the world's fifth-largest military and aerospace
contractor _manufacturing satellites, rocket launchers,
helicopters, weapons systems, fighter-bombers and fighters, as well
as civilian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities here also hope that the restructured French
military giant could eventually attract DaimlerChrysler Aerospace,
a unit of DaimlerChrysler of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Such a combination would produce a huge armaments contractor
that could compete effectively with British Aerospace, which has
just acquired the Marconi armaments unit from General Electric of
Britain, and with Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon in the
United States, fulfilling President Jacques Chirac's hope of
keeping Europe on the map as a global arms power, with technology
to match.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale also owns a 37.9 percent share in Airbus Industrie,
the four-nation European consortium that is Boeing's biggest
competitor as a builder of civilian airliners.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will essentially complete a vast
reorganization of French defenses originally announced three years
ago by Chirac, a conservative who abolished the draft and began
privatization of much of the vast French military-industrial
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's Socialist Cabinet, which came to
office in June 1997, essentially carried on with most of the plan,
but prefers to call the partial privatizations of state-owned
companies an ``opening of capital.''
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace's deal for Marconi last month came as a shock
to the French, who had flirted with the hope that British Aerospace
might choose to join forces with a French company instead. After
that did not happen, French officials renewed efforts to attract
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, which had reportedly hoped for a deal
with the British as well.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
referring to the possibility of building a French-German company on
the scale of the American and British competition, warned, ``It
will only succeed if the French are willing to make greater
progress in privatizing and reducing the state's share in the
enterprise.''
</P>
<P>
   That got the green light with publication of a decree by Jospin
over the weekend announcing the decision to reduce state ownership
in Aerospatiale below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government's announcement Monday said the state would remain
the largest single owner, even after the partial privatization. A
stock issue is expected to be floated before the second half of the
year ``if market conditions permit,'' the announcement said.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale and Matra kept silent Monday, but a statement
released by Economics Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, Defense
Minister Alain Richard and Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot
said the merger would not mean the loss of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Groupe Lagardere, the announcement said, would initially pay
$147 million for its interest in the company and as much as $198
million more in the future, depending on the market value of
Aerospatiale-Matra shares.
</P>
<P>
   Outside bank appraisals had valued the shares' potential above
$800 million, according to French press reports, prompting some
criticism from the Socialist Cabinet's labor union supporters that
it had sold out to private enterprise for too little.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Lagardere's 71-year-old chairman, Jean-Luc
Lagardere, will become head of Aerospatiale-Matra's supervisory
board, while Yves Michot, Aerospatiale's chairman and chief
executive, will be president of its executive directorate.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale acquired the state's 45.76 percent share in
Dassault Aviation, the privately held maker of the Mirage 2000 and
Rafale fighter planes and Falcon executive jets, late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The French government will retain a stake of 45 to 49 percent in
the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Aerospatiale had revenue of 58 billion francs _ roughly $10
billion _ last year and profit in the first half of the year of
1.216 billion francs, or $210 million.

<P>
   CONAKRY, GUINEA _ The prime minister of this small West African
nation joined an array of government officials, family and friends
on the sweltering airport tarmac to welcome Amadou Diallo's parents
as they arrived from the United States on Monday to find that their
son, in death, had attained the status of a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like many of our people, he left to go to another country, and
he worked hard and studied hard,'' said Prime Minister Sidya Toure,
speaking of Diallo, the Guinean street peddler who was shot to
death by four New York City police officers on Feb. 4. ``But he is
a Guinean, one of ours always, and it's natural that we should show
solidarity with him because of the way he died.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo's coffin, a plain pine box with his name and destination
written in felt-tipped pen on the top, was removed from the plane
that brought it from Newark International Airport in New Jersey,
through Paris, to Conakry, the capital. It was driven in a
screeching motorcade of air-conditioned government vans and
battered private cars that sped along a rutted road lined with
fruit vendors and smoking grills to the city morgue.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour rally outside the morgue and then a
government-sponsored prayer service for Diallo are scheduled for
Tuesday. On Wednesday, the family and numerous government officials
will take the coffin 300 miles to Hollade Bouru, the village where
Diallo's father was born.
</P>
<P>
   The father, Saikou Diallo, said that his son had spent school
vacations in the village. The son will be buried next to his
grandfather, who was a teacher and scholar of the Koran.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of many of the country's top ministers in a crowd
of about 100 people at the airport was just one sign of the
distress and excitement that Diallo's killing has aroused in
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Many young men at the airport wore white T-shirts on which
Diallo's photograph and name were printed in black. The Ministry of
Foreign Affairs has organized the caravan to accompany the body to
the cemetery on Wednesday. One ministry official said the trip
could take much longer than the normal five hours because people
living along the route had been encouraged, on government radio and
television, to join it as the motorcade passed their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Diallo case has received much attention in the official
media, partly as a cautionary tale of what can happen to a young
black immigrant in New York City, and partly as a reflection of the
unrelenting coverage that the killing has received in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It has also provided an eye-opening account of black political
activism in the United States, several Guineans said. Accounts of
the rallies held in New York City after the Diallo shooting have
been printed in the newspapers, and most people on the street, it
seemed, now know exactly how many bullets _ 41 _ were fired by the
police officers who killed the 22-year-old immigrant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not naive. We know there is racism in America,'' said a
man named Antoine waiting for friends outside the airport. He
refused to give his last name. ``And we have many bodies of our
compatriots coming back to Guinea who have been killed there. But
now we want to show our support for the struggle of black people in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   The parents of Diallo, who have been divorced for five years,
flew home with the Rev. Al Sharpton, whose National Action Network
made the flight arrangements and shepherded the family through news
conferences, public appearances and tours of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton, on his first visit to Guinea, said Diallo's mother had
asked him to be the executor of her son's estate. He said he would
stay in the country until after the funeral. ``I promised this lady
I would stay with her son until he is laid to rest,'' said Sharpton
during the flight, nodding toward Kadiadou Diallo, who was sitting
across from him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Diallo said she and her former husband had met several of
the men who are now government ministers when the couple had an
import-export business in Thailand. They imported gemstones from
Guinea for jewelers in Southeast Asia, beginning in about 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo spent much of his youth out of Guinea. His parents
said he studied at a French international school in Bangkok,
starting in 1990, and then in 1993, in Singapore, took courses in
computers and accounting, conducted in English.
</P>
<P>
   Both parents also are well traveled. The father said he followed
a family and tribal merchant tradition, starting at age 17 by
buying and selling goods between Guinea and neighboring Liberia and
Ivory Coast. He left Guinea in the early 1960s, because
then-President Sekou Toure restricted private business, and
eventually settled in Thailand after a round-the-world trip to the
United States, Europe and Asia to decide which countries had the
best climate for trading.
</P>
<P>
   He said his son was also observing that tradition in his work as
a street vendor. ``He was good at business,'' Saikou Diallo said.

 &HT;    Volvo-Navistar: Takeover talk persists
 &HT;    By Don Baker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ News reports continue to fuel speculation
that Volvo AB might buy Navistar in a possible $3 billion deal that
would more than double Volvo's share of the North American truck
market.
</P>
<P>
   The British newspaper Financial Times reported Monday that Volvo
confirmed it has held talks with Navistar on a possible takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted an unnamed source close to the talks as
saying senior executives from Volvo have met with Navistar
officials to discuss a buyout offer.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen from both companies refused to comment, saying they
don't react to rumors.
</P>
<P>
   John R. Horne, Navistar chairman, president and chief executive
officer, is scheduled to appear on the cable business channel CNBC
at 8 a.m. today in a live interview, but Navistar's spokesman said
the appearance was previously scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-based automotive industry publication Stark's
Component Ledger reported Monday that Volvo also has opened
``exploratory discussions'' on buying Mack Trucks from French car
and truck maker Renault SA. But Renault has consistently said it
will not sell its Mack Trucks division, and Stark's reported that
Volvo is more interested in buying Navistar.
</P>
<P>
   One possible scenario sketched by Stark's has Volvo buying
Navistar and selling Navistar's diesel engine operations to Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo last month announced the sale of its car division to Ford
for $6.45 billion. Ford has a long-term contract to buy engines
from Navistar.
</P>
<P>
   David Cole, director of the University of Michigan's office of
the study of automotive transportation, said Volvo is financially
prepared to take over an American truck maker because of the
billions of dollars it received in the deal with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would certainly be in a buying mood, and they want to be
in the heavy trucks in North America,'' Cole said. ``Volvo's really
in a growth mode.''
</P>
<P>
   Other reports said Volvo may buy only Navistar's heavy truck
line, or may negotiate a deal for some kind of alliance with
Navistar.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry is experiencing the merger mania that the
banking industry went through last year, with Volvo being a big
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of standard operating procedure to line yourself up
with whoever is best positioned worldwide,'' Cole said. ``Merger
mania is just alive and well in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Navistar's stock climbed $2 a share Friday to $35.25. More than
1.25 million shares traded, nearly three times the daily average
volume of about 420,000 shares. The financial markets in the United
States were closed Monday for the federal holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has seen heavy trading volumes in the past week after
reports of a possible deal between Navistar and Volvo hit Wall
Street Feb. 8, and at least two investment firms have increased
their share of the company _ Fidelity Management and Salomon Smith
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity reported Friday in Securities and Exchange Commission
filings that it now owns more than 4.6 million shares of Navistar
stock _ close to 7 percent of the company and valued at nearly $164
million.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon also filed a report with the SEC saying it owns more
than 4.1 million shares of Navistar, or 6.3 percent of the company
and valued at nearly $146 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential Insurance Company of America previously reported it
owns a 7.2 percent share of Navistar, or 4.77 million shares valued
at more than $168 million.
</P>
<P>
   Navistar employees and local officials were talking about the
rumored deal Monday, expressing concern about the possible effect
on the company's Clark County operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will watch it with anxiety and hope it's for the betterment
of our community,'' said Clark County commissioner John Detrick.
</P>
<P>
   Cole said a merger or acquisition is studied intensely by both
sides before the deal is signed, but it's hard to determine exactly
what will happen in a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't know what they're going to do until they get
you and then they're going to do what's in their best business
interest,'' Cole said. ``I would be surprised if they closed
facilities, but you never know.''

RENOWNED SOLO SAILOR SENDS MESSAGE THAT SHE CAPSIZED AT SEA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: S.C., Wash., France, Australia)  (fb) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another tale of potential disaster in the high-risk world of
yacht racing was developing on Monday as word came from the South
Pacific Ocean that Isabelle Autissier, the renowned French solo
sailor, was in serious trouble in a single-handed race around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   An emergency beacon belonging to Autissier, a veteran of three
global sailing competitions who was the overall leader in the race,
sent a satellite signal indicating that her 60-foot yacht had
capsized. She was sailing in intermittent squalls of about 30
knots.
</P>
<P>
   Her mayday was transmitted from a reach of cold and wind-driven
ocean 1,900 miles west of South America's tip at Cape Horn. She was
sailing her boat alone, as are the 10 sailors competing against the
42-year-old Autissier, perhaps the most popular female sporting
figure in France.
</P>
<P>
   The fleet of sailboats ranging in length from 40 to 60 feet is
racing in the Around Alone, a 27,000-mile single-handed competition
that began in Charleston, S.C., last Aug. 26. The eight-month race,
which includes three stopovers _ the next one is in Uruguay _ is
scheduled to conclude in Charleston this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier once had to be rescued in a forerunner of this race.
And the news of another sailor fighting to survive comes on the
heels of the Sydney to Hobart Race, in which six yachtsmen died and
seven yachts were abandoned on Dec. 27. A severe storm with
80-mile-an-hour winds and 30-foot seas produced that ocean tragedy,
which started out as a friendly but competitive race for fully
crewed sailboats from Sydney to Hobart, a small Australian port on
Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
   With Autissier now in jeopardy, the issue of safety in
long-distance yacht racing comes under scrutiny again. Dan
McConnell, a race spokesman, said from Seattle on Monday that no
one knew for certain whether Autissier was in a life raft or still
on her boat.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Schrader, the Around Alone race director, instructed
Giovanni Soldini of Italy, a competitor who was about 200 miles
north of Autissier's position, to go find her. Her mayday signal
came a few hours after a telephone call from Autissier to a friend
in Paris. Her message was relayed to a French shore crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking over a line that was crackling with interference,
Autissier reportedly said she'd been `capsized,' before activating
the beacon,'' race officials said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at about 17 knots, Soldini might have been able to
reach the area as early as midnight last night.
</P>
<P>
   Soldini was instructed by satellite e-mail to divert from his
position. He too is on a 60-foot racing boat, Fila, designed by
Groupe Finot, the same French naval architecture firm that created
Autissier's racing machine.
</P>
<P>
   She was into the outer reaches of open ocean at a latitude of 55
degrees south when her beacon went off. The weather there is nasty
and inhospitable almost all the time. John Rousmaniere, author of
the ``Annapolis Book of Seamanship,'' questioned why any sailor was
racing there.
</P>
<P>
   ``These boats are probably beyond the ability of one person to
handle,'' Rousmaniere said. ``They are extremely unstable and would
be a handful even if they had a full crew. But to put them out in
the lower latitudes of the Screaming Fifties, each with only one
exhausted crew member on board, is like going into harm's way
intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   McConnell took issue with that analysis, citing the safety
record of the races since the first quadrennial competition of
1982-83. In the previous four competitions, two of the 87
competitors died at sea; 56 finished the global races.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has been done in the design of these boats to make them
more stable and self-righting,'' McConnell said. ``We have worked
closely with their designers. But there are conditions that are
extreme where no boats can stand up to the weather. Our safety
record indicates that we've been able to solve most of our problems
ourselves.''

   On several occasions, most notably in the 1994-95 BOC Challenge
_ the forerunner of the Around Alone race _ a competitor was picked
up by another racer and taken to the next port-of-call. In that
race, Josh Hall of England hit a submerged object in the
mid-Atlantic. Alan Nebauer, a BOC competitor from Australia,
rescued Hall from his yacht just before it sank.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Hall suffered a major mishap last week in the
Around Alone race. His 60-foot sailboat was dismasted, and he is
now limping along under a jury-rig sail to Chatham Island in the
South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Mike Plant, a former BOC Challenge competitor, died at
sea en route to a French single-handed yacht race. His
disappearance led to a multimillion-dollar rescue effort that
failed to find him or his boat.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last BOC race, in 1994-95, Autissier also was
responsible for a large rescue effort. Her 60-foot sailboat was
dismasted in the Indian Ocean, and two weeks later, smashed by
giant seas 1,000 miles off the coast of Australia. Autissier was
rescued by an Australian military helicopter, which plucked her
from her sinking boat, at a cost of $6 million to Australian
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Autissier rests her reputation on being a survivor. No one could
have suspected from her last e-mail sent to race headquarters in
Charleston on Monday that she was concerned about anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``A beautiful morning,'' she wrote, ``with snowy squalls
alternating with sunshine, which melted the snow. But this morning,
it turned very gray, and the wind picked up.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: FOOTNOTES IN THE CASE OF U.S. VS. MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-PROTEST) 
(fb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For four months, in a federal courtoom in Washington, the
government has relentlessly portrayed the Microsoft Corp. as a
bullying monopolist. Now, as the antitrust trial enters the home
stretch, the government is moving beyond accusations to try to
figure out how to curb the software giant without crippling it.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft _ advised
by a small group of economists, business school and law professors
_ are scrambling to devise a set of remedial steps to recommend to
the court if the government wins the case. Most legal experts who
have followed the trial expect that Microsoft will be found to have
violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been reached on a preferred remedy, according to
people involved in the effort. But the suggested steps, they say,
fall broadly into two groups. One set of advisers is pushing for
more radical, ``structural'' remedies _ breaking up Microsoft or
forcing it to license the software code for its industry-standard
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Another group favors ``behavioral'' remedies _ prohibiting
Microsoft from writing exclusive contracts, requiring it to
publicly disclose the software specifications for Windows, forcing
it to publish a Windows pricing list for major manufacturers, and
requiring antitrust training for all Microsoft managers.
</P>
<P>
   Both approaches are problematic. A sweeping structural remedy is
risky because it could reshuffle one of the nation's crucial
high-technology industries with uncertain results. Detailed
behavioral remedies could mire the government and the courts in a
kind of permanent regulatory oversight of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy phase of legal proceedings, which will occur after
trial if the government wins, is when the key public policy issues
in the Microsoft case will be addressed. And it represents a great
challenge for the government. ``Historically, the government has
spent its time on showing bad conduct on the part of the dominant
firm in antitrust cases, and far too little attention has been paid
to what should be done about it,'' said William Kovacic, a George
Washington University Law School professor.
</P>
<P>
   To aid in the effort, the Justice Department is tapping outside
advisers including Timothy Bresnahan, a Stanford University
economist and co-chairman of Stanford's Computer Industry Project.
The state attorneys general also have consultants including Herbert
Hovenkamp, an antitrust expert and law professor at the University
of Iowa. In the last few weeks, several advisers have been asked to
submit memos with recommendations to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But these suggestions are only a set of options for the
consideration of Joel I. Klein, assistant attorney general in
charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, and his
boss, Attorney General Janet Reno. Because any steps that would
seriously affect Microsoft amount to a major economic policy move,
it would be expected that the White House and congressional leaders
would be consulted as well.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, it would be up to the courts to decide what
remedy, if any, should be imposed. And since any ruling by the
Federal District Court will be appealed, whatever remedy is
eventually approved may not go into effect for two years or more.
That means that the government is engaged in setting ground rules
for the future instead of restoring competition in the Internet
browser market, the main focus of the suit filed last May.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismisses the debate over remedies. ``It's all
academic because Microsoft will win the case when all is said and
done,'' said Charles F. Rule, a former senior Justice Department
official who is a consultant to the software giant. ``And this talk
of structural remedies is the antitrust equivalent of nuclear
winter _ just bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   The most drastic structural remedy, of course, would be to break
up Microsoft. One approach would be to slice it up into one company
that has the Windows operating system and another that has other
software applications, like the Microsoft Office suite of word
processing, spreadsheet and data base programs.
</P>
<P>
   Another breakup proposal is to carve Microsoft into two to five
identical companies, each with the programming code for all
Microsoft products. The resulting companies _ the ``Baby Bills,''
after Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, and a pun on the Baby Bells
formed in the split-up of AT&AMP;T _ would then compete with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   This approach has been promoted by some of Microsoft's harshest
critics _for months by Gary L. Reback, a former legal adviser to
the rival Netscape Communications Corp., and more recently by
Robert H. Bork, the former federal judge, who is a consultant to
Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have occasionally endorsed breakup remedies _
notably, in the cases of Standard Oil in 1911 and AT&AMP;T in 1984. But
these have been the exception. Generally, the courts have sided
with Judge Charles Wyzanski, who in 1954 wrote in a landmark case,
United States vs. United Shoe Machinery: ``Judges in prescribing
remedies have known their own limitations. They do not ex officio
have economic or political training. Their prophecies as to the
economic future are not guided by unusually subtle judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   A more modest structural remedy would be to force Microsoft to
auction off its Windows programming code, along with the Windows
brand name, to two to four companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can break up the monopoly without having to break up the
company,'' Hovenkamp said.
</P>
<P>
   The purchasing companies _ perhaps IBM, Sun Microsystems and
others _ would then compete with Microsoft in the operating systems
business, restraining prices and fostering innovation, Hovenkamp
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But the danger of that approach, critics say, is that it runs
the risk of having incompatible operating systems. There is an
enormous benefit to consumers, they say, of having one
industry-standard operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Windows is a natural monopoly, so let it be, this argument goes.
Instead, the focus should be on changing Microsoft's behavior so
that it cannot use its operating-systems monopoly to thwart
competition in new areas _ and browsing software has been just one
example of this broader issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to make it more difficult for Microsoft to
leverage its Windows monopoly without crippling Microsoft,'' said
Michael A. Cusumano, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology's Sloan School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   A suggested behavioral remedy is to force Microsoft to publish
at one time the software hooks, or application program interfaces,
to which rival software makers must write programs if they are to
run on Windows. This would address the charge, which Microsoft
denies, that the company releases this software information in
stages, with favored companies getting special treatment, and that
it keeps some critical knowledge of the operating system to itself.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggested remedy is to force Microsoft to publish a
most-favored-customer pricing list for Windows _ the standard price
available to all the major PC makers. This would prevent Microsoft
from using Windows pricing to punish manufacturers who do not favor
Microsoft products, a charge that Microsoft disputes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of steps are much more surgical strike than
nuclear blast,'' said a business school professor who has advised
the Justice Department.

NEW YORK'S SCHEDULE HURTS LONDON'S 
MILLENNIUMS OF CHINESE FASHION  
 DIBBEN'S PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif.)  (fb) 
 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The move by American designers to pre-empt the
European fashion calendar by showing fall collections this week is
wreaking havoc across the Atlantic. The latest fallout is in
England, where top designers are bailing out of London's fashion
week, or considering such a move.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Berardi has decided to present his collection in Milan,
Italy, on March 1. Jaspir Uppal, a spokesman for Berardi, said
Monday that the designer was concerned about low attendance in
London, where the collections run from Saturday through Feb. 25.
</P>
<P>
   With Americans moving to the front of the women's ready-to-wear
schedule, fashion retailers and journalists face a calendar running
from Feb. 11 through March 15, when the Paris shows end. Several
American retailers are skipping London because they must remain in
New York to write orders after the American shows wind up on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports in British newspapers, Alexander McQueen
plans to show his spring collection in New York next fall. McQueen
did not return telephone calls seeking comment. Hussein Chalayan is
said to want to move his signature collection from London to Paris.
Chalayan declined to discuss the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, none of this pleases the British Fashion
Council. ``The only one who's actually made the decision is Tony
Berardi _ he's absolutely right for the development of his
business,'' said John Wilson, chief executive of the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of Lee,'' Wilson added, referring to McQueen by
his nickname, ``he feels he's putting on the best or one of the
best shows in the world, and he would like, when he does his show,
to see members of the major media, especially from America,
present.''
</P>
<P>
   As a countermove, the council is working on stronger promotion
of its designers and seeking to keep its schedule short. The group
has no plans to squeeze the London shows into a two- or three-day
window between Paris and Milan, as was sometimes done in the past.
This year it would be impossible: Paris begins March 7, the same
day Milan ends.
</P>
<P>
   From China's Attic
</P>
<P>
   China Millennium is a fashion show that presents a living
history of textiles and clothing in China dating to 221 B.C.
Sponsored by the Chinese government, the exhibition was seen in
Paris last October and is to be shown again at the New York Public
Library on Friday, the last day of fashion week.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation-only show includes originals and reproductions of
spectacular handmade clothing worn by Chinese peasants and those
who ruled them. Familiar signposts of Chinese style _ the
cheongsam, the kimono, platform shoes _ are presented throughout,
but often with unexpected sumptuousness. Some of China's top models
wear robes threaded with thousands of gold filaments, or beautiful
silk gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Han, foreign affairs director of China's official textile
and fashion exhibitions, said China Millennium was intended to
educate not just international audiences, but those at home as
well. ``Chinese don't treasure their own fashion,'' she said.
``They copy Western. If Ralph Lauren recognizes something in
Chinese fashion, then they'll say, `Oh, so we do have some
treasures.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dibben's Offstage Moves
</P>
<P>
   Absent from the men's and women's shows this week are the
designs of Andrew Dibben, whose collections have been a bright spot
on New York's runways for the last two years. But instead of
staging a show, Dibben is preparing to open his first store, in Los
Angeles on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, it was much harder to open one's own store than to
sell to a big department store. But for small-scale designers like
Dibben, that is no longer so. ``It's the best way to gain control
of your business and have freedom,'' he said. ``I don't believe in
categories like shirts and suits. People in department stores say
they can only buy your clothing if you're doing suiting.''
</P>
<P>
   Dibben, who worked as an assistant designer for Helmet Lang and
Marc Eisen before striking out on his own, creates clothes that
embody a sort of glamorous slacker stance. His store and design
studio will be at 1618 Silver Lake Boulevard, near Sunset
Boulevard.

   NEW YORK _ Look, Ma, no hands! With utility chic ruling many
runways for spring, designers draped bags across the chest
messenger style, on belts spanning the waist or hugging the hips.
It's a style that leaves the hands free for talking on the cell
phone, pushing a shopping cart, eating on the run, or just
gesturing. Now the body and belt bags are coming into stores.
</P>
<P>
   Trussardi's small double-bag belt in yellow or purple leather
($248), and a hot-pink satin hip-belt bag ($168) from Frou by Paige
Novick are available at Henri Bendel.
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York has leather Burberry messenger bags ($475) and
nylon ones by Prada ($240). And there are Prada belt bags in
leather with a cell phone holder ($630) and in nylon with a neat
rectangular purse ($240) or pouch ($270). Prada also has two
leather belts, one with two zippered flat pockets for cash, credit
cards or keys ($252) and one with a small change purse ($242).

<P>
   WARREN, Mich. _ Republican leaders came to this blue-collar
Detroit suburb on Monday to hold the first in a series of ``town
hall meetings'' aimed at reshaping the party's image and agenda in
the wake of the unpopular impeachment trial and at drumming up
support for broad tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of about 500 people, mostly Republicans, responded
fairly warmly, but the enthusiasm was tempered by worries that tax
cuts are not compatible with reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, and Michigan's top
Republican politicians repeatedly called for a 10 percent reduction
in federal income tax rates to make use of part of the projected
$4.35 trillion budget surplus over the next 15 years. They accuse
Democrats of both wanting to spend more of taxpayers' money and
wanting to enact more limited tax cuts with narrowly targeted
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should it be spent on a myriad of federal programs, or should
it be returned to the people?'' Lott asked, drawing considerable,
but not unanimous, applause.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, dozens of people in the audience did not raise their
hands when Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., asked who would like to
pay less in taxes. A repeated theme in the questions at the
Presidents Day event and in subsequent interviews with members of
the audience was a desire to repay some of the national debt before
taxes are reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and his fellow Republicans, including Gov. John Engler,
answered questions from 15 members of the audience chosen by the
moderator, a local television anchorman. Nobody asked about the
impeachment trial, although one person briefly complimented Lott on
his handling of the issue, as the questions focused mainly on
economic issues like Social Security, taxes and the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   George Gomez, a 43-year-old middle manager for an electric
utility who identified himself as a former supporter of Ross Perot,
asked during the meeting whether his 17-year-old son, Sean, would
be shouldered someday with a large national debt. ``I'm not so sure
I got a really solid answer about how we're going to repay the
debt,'' he said after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been heavily criticized this winter for staying
in Washington and focusing on the impeachment of President Clinton.
Their new strategy, laid out here on Monday by Lott and Patricia
Harrison, the co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee,
is to hold town hall meetings _ a political art form perfected by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said that Republican members of Congress would hold 150
such meetings across the nation this year and that he would try to
attend a dozen of them. Ms. Harrison said that the next two would
probably be held in Virginia and Pennsylvania but that the schedule
would depend on the availability of state governors.
</P>
<P>
   Having been bloodied at the polls for their emphasis on
impeachment, Republicans were eager to listen for new ideas on
Monday, even as they stressed tax cuts, and were loath to discuss
the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans here spoke about the trial only when asked after
the meeting by reporters, and with evident relief that the
proceedings were over. ``This meeting here today is to show we're
through with it, and we're ready to move on,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Having lashed out at the president after last Friday's
acquittal, Lott struck a more conciliatory tone with reporters
Monday afternoon. He said that the president had called him at home
last Saturday at 9 a.m. and that they had spoken on subjects
ranging from Kosovo and health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still the president, and every bill that we pass he has
to sign or veto,'' Lott added.
</P>
<P>
   Lott predicted that moderate Republicans, conservative
Republicans and Democrats would also be able to work together
closely in the Senate despite their recent differences during the
impeachment process. ``We've been in a foxhole together and
survived a crucible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first town hall meeting was held at the Ukrainian Cultural
Center here, partly because the Republican National Committee had
used the community center before and partly because Warren is still
known as a center of ``Reagan Democrats,'' Ms. Harrison said.
``Reagan Democrats'' are politically conservative, outspokenly
patriotic industrial workers who defied their union leaders in the
1980s by supporting Presidents Reagan and Bush in large numbers,
allowing them to carry Michigan, always a fiercely contested state.
</P>
<P>
   But these workers tended to back President Clinton in the 1992
and 1996 elections. Warren, which has 138,000 residents, is the
heart of Macomb County, which lies on Detroit's northeast border.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are eager to woo back swing voters in this
politically important state.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Both of Macomb County's congressmen are perennially vulnerable
Democrats. Rep. Sander Levin, who represents the part of Warren
where the meeting was held, has been near the top of Republicans'
lists of targets ever since his district was redrawn after the 1990
elections and has been re-elected each time with only 53 percent to
57 percent of the vote despite strong efforts by unions on his
behalf. Rep. David Bonior, the minority whip, represents the rest
of Macomb County and won only 53 percent of the vote last November.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harrison said Republicans wanted to tell conservative
workers that they were welcome in the party. ``Reagan Democrats,
y'all come in; we've got a seat at the table for you,'' she said in
an interview after the town hall meeting ended.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and the other Republicans spoke in front of a huge canvas
painted with a scene of a pine-fringed lake and emblazoned with the
words, ``Listening to America ... Tax Cuts for Everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Senor, a spokesman for Abraham, said that half the tickets
for the event were distributed by local Republican officials and
the other half were given to people who called after hearing about
the meeting on local television. Those who called were given
tickets regardless of their political affiliations, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Alphonse Singer, a 75-year-old retired unionized auto worker and
former Democrat, said before the meeting that the first economic
priority should be paying down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald W. Pruss, 60, a precinct delegate of the Michigan
Republican Party and a Chevrolet retiree, agreed in a separate
interview after the meeting, although he also liked tax cuts.
``They didn't really address getting rid of the debt, and that's
important,'' Pruss said.
</P>
<P>
   But Betty Norlin, another precinct delegate and a retired
68-year-old manager of a health food company, said tax cuts were
needed now.
</P>
<P>
   While Lott and his fellow Republicans tried to present an image
of united support for reducing income tax rates, Republicans are
deeply divided on tax policy. They differ over whether to pursue an
immediate 10 percent reduction in tax rates or to implement tax
cuts gradually as the projected budget surplus grows.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton, the senior Republican in Michigan's
congressional delegation, was not here on Monday and said in a
telephone interview from his district in western Michigan that he
believed that there were not enough votes in Congress to approve
lower income tax rates. Upton said he would push for targeted tax
cuts instead, notably reducing the marriage penalty _ a popular
theme among many social conservatives in the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Lott spoke strongly in favor of a 10 percent tax cut during the
town hall meeting. ``The great thing is, it doesn't pick winners
and losers _ it's good for everyone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But in a brief interview afterward, he voiced a willingness to
compromise on the amount of any reduction, saying that a cut
slightly smaller than 10 percent could be paired with a few
targeted tax cuts, notably an elimination of estate taxes. ``I'm
not dug in or locked into this number or that number _ maybe it
should be 8.7 percent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed that 62 percent of the projected $4.35
trillion in federal surpluses over the next 15 years should be
devoted to putting Social Security on a more firm financial
footing, while the rest should be spent on a variety of federal
programs and targeted tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Lott repeated his general support for devoting 62 percent to
Social Security, which would reduce the need for future federal
borrowing and thereby reduce the national debt. But Lott said that
he strongly disagreed with the president on how to use the
remaining 38 percent.

   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The yellow flag waved on Lap 175, and for
those lucky enough to avoid the messy 12-car wreck on the previous
lap, there was a tough decision to be made: Stay out or come in?
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rusty Wallace was leading Sunday's Daytona 500. He
radioed his crew chief, Robin Pemberton, to discuss strategy. Stay
out on worn Goodyears, or come in for some new ones? Since the car
was handling OK, Wallace and Pemberton chose to stay out and take
their chances. Wallace's teammate, Jeremy Mayfield, stayed out,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Their gamble didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt, who both passed Wallace some 15
laps later and finished 1-2, had come in under the caution on Lap
175 for new rubber. Gordon and Earnhardt, both driving Chevy Monte
Carlos, came to the decision after watching the Ford Taurus' of
Wallace and Mayfield stay out on the track.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was shuffled out of the lead pack with 10 laps left and
finished eighth; Mayfield met the same fate and wound up 20th.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, there was much debate over that final pit stop,
whether the extra grip provided by the new tires affected the
outcome of the race. Some say the fresh rubber made the difference.
Others aren't so sure. In recent years, pit stops have often
decided Nascar races in the late stages.
</P>
<P>
   But Wallace had the day's strongest car. Gordon and Earnhardt
had struggled at times on Sunday to maintain contact with the top
group of cars. But after taking on the new tires, the cars of
Gordon and Earnhardt appeared to outhandle Wallace's. ``Well, I
thought the decision was OK,'' Wallace said on Sunday. ``Looking
back on it right now, maybe if I would have had a little bit more
grip in the tires I would have been able to hold that bottom line a
little bit better, but the car still handled good. I wasn't having
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace added: ``People keep talking about the tires, but the
only thing that lost me the race was that he got a fender
underneath me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, referring to his crew chief, Ray Evernham, said: ``I was
glad that Ray made the call to come in for four tires. A lot of
other guys came in, too, so that helped my decision. My car was
handling great, and with those four tires I was able to make some
pretty, I don't want to say wild, but I was able to make some moves
out there I wouldn't have if I'd only had on the older tires.''
</P>
<P>
   The moves Gordon referred to came on Lap 190, and they were
wild. Wallace was leading when Gordon pulled low on the track and
went to pass on the inside. The problem was, Ricky Rudd's
slow-moving mangled machine was blocking Gordon's path. With a
last-second jerk of the steering wheel, Gordon avoided Rudd, who
saw what was happening and dived onto the infield grass.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's daring move _ made at nearly 200 miles an hour _ surely
will be talked about for years. Gordon's wife, Brooke, told
reporters that she screamed as she watched her husband make the
pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brooke and I talked about it a lot last night,'' Gordon said
Monday morning before his Daytona 500 winning Monte Carlo was
handed over to Nascar for display at the trackside museum at
Daytona USA. ``I would have done it time and time again if I had to
just because it's the Daytona 500. Probably in some races you might
not do something like that. It's such a big event.''
</P>
<P>
   The guts it took to make that move, combined with the smarts it
took to stay out on the track several laps before, are the
ingredients of champions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's victory was worth a record purse of $2,172,446,
including a $1 million bonus from Winston. And it has him rolling
at full speed toward a third straight _ and fourth overall _
Winston Cup championship. The circuit moves to Rockingham, N.C.,
next week for the second of the season's 34 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think winning on Sunday works a couple of different ways,''
Gordon said. ``It shows these guys that we are back at it again.
They're ready to go and we're going to have to fight them all year
long for it. At the same time, it makes those guys even hungrier to
put us away. They're thinking we're tired of that No. 24 team
pulling into the victory lane. That makes it even more difficult
for us. We already had a bull's-eye on us. Now it's even bigger.''

LAWMAKER'S KINSHIP WITH SLAIN IMMIGRANT FUELS CRITICISM OF POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related NY-SUSPECT-SHOT, NY-SUSPECT-COPS) 
(nk) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was early on the morning after the shooting of a
West African immigrant that Assemblyman Ruben Diaz Jr. received a
call from the commander of a police precinct in his district in the
South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I asked was whether a police officer had been
hit,'' said Diaz, whose sister is an officer assigned to the
precinct. ``But then they told me what had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Since first hearing the news that the immigrant, Amadou Diallo,
had been killed in a barrage of 41 bullets fired by four police
officers, a number of elected officials have been vehement in their
reaction to the shooting. But few have been more outspoken and
visible than Diaz, a two-term assemblyman who represents the
Soundview and Hunts Point sections of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz has appeared with the parents of Diallo, speaking
passionately about his contention that young black and Hispanic men
are disproportionately targeted for abuse by police officers. He
has met with the Bronx district attorney and has asked U.S.
Attorney Mary Jo White for federal assistance in conducting the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   And he has introduced legislation in the Assembly that would bar
what is known as the 48-hour rule from being a provision in future
contracts with the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The rule,
which gives police officers two business days to consult with union
lawyers before they speak to investigators, was not invoked in the
Diallo case because it applies only when the Police Department
pursues possible administrative charges.
</P>
<P>
   What has fueled his own passions about the Diallo case, Diaz
said, is that the shooting took place in his Assembly district, a
half-mile from his home and three blocks from his Assembly office.
But also, Diaz, who is 25, said he has come to feel something of a
kinship with a man he had never met, the 22-year-old immigrant from
Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I spoke with the commander, I went to the scene of the
shooting,'' Diaz said. ``It was sickening to see all the bullet
holes.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that since those first few hours after the shooting, he
has spoken at great length with Diallo's relatives and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt that I have come to know this young man and to
love him,'' Diaz said of Diallo. ``And I have come to realize that
although I am a Puerto Rican man and he is from Africa, the only
difference between us was the half-mile distance between his home
and mine. We're in the same generation, and if it happened to him,
it could happen to me or anyone in my community.''
</P>
<P>
   Diaz developed an interest in politics as a child through
viewing the campaigns of his father, Ruben Diaz, a Pentacostal
minister who ran unsuccessfully for the City Council, the Assembly
and the state Senate. The younger Diaz was elected to the Assembly
three years ago at age 22.
</P>
<P>
   He easily won re-election last year. Diaz, who is married and
has two young sons, is also a student at Lehman College, pursuing a
bachelor's degree in political science.
</P>
<P>
   Some politicians have accused Diaz of using rhetoric bordering
on the inflammatory in his criticism of the police in the Diallo
case. But Diaz said that he has been measured in his remarks and
that he gives high marks to the overwhelming majority of police
officers in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, as a 25-year-old Hispanic resident of the South
Bronx, Diaz said that he was qualified to discuss the interaction
of the police with young black and Hispanic New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most police officers are doing a good job,'' he said. ``But
what I've been saying is that I see a pattern where the victims of
aggressive police conduct have been black and Latino young men. It
has even happened to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The assemblyman is gaining admirers in some quarters. ``I have
been impressed with him in this situation,'' said the Rev. Al
Sharpton, who has been advising the Diallo family. ``He has not
been afraid to advocate for the people he represents both in the
streets and in the legislative chambers.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to his critics, Diaz said, ``I'm not calling for
people to retaliate. We just want justice in this case. I feel that
if I don't come out strongly in a situation like this, then my
community would deserve another representative.''

 &HT;    John Ehrlichman: Nixon aide key to president's rise and fall
 &HT;    By Tom Bennett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Ehrlichman spent his last years in Atlanta
enjoying his freedom and working to show the public how he had
changed from the hard-bitten Richard Nixon loyalist who went to
prison for taking part in the Watergate scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman, 73, of (Atlanta suburb) Sandy Springs, died Sunday
of complications from diabetes at Grace Communities private care
facility. A private family service is planned. Atlanta's H.M.
Patterson &AMP; Son, Spring Hill, is in charge of arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   A decorated World War II veteran, lawyer, novelist, lecturer and
amateur sketch artist, Ehrlichman was the presidential adviser for
domestic affairs in the Nixon White House from November 1969 to
April 1973. He was, Nixon said, the ``conscience'' of the
administration.
</P>
<P>
   In the hierarchy of Nixon's first term, Ehrlichman was second
only to the chief of staff, his best friend and former UCLA
classmate Bob Haldeman, who died in 1993. As the palace guard, they
controlled access to Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman and Haldeman fell from their lofty roles and resigned
April 30, 1973. Critics say they took the fall for Nixon, who
escaped impeachment and possible prosecution when he resigned and
was pardoned by President Gerald Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman and Haldeman went to prison for their roles in
Watergate, including covering up the June 1972 break-in by White
House ``plumbers'' at Democratic National Committee headquarters in
the Watergate complex in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Once fiercely loyal to the president, Ehrlichman turned on Nixon
after he refused to testify or give a deposition during
Ehrlichman's two federal trials in 1974-75.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman blamed the former president for starting and covering
up Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman was one of the contradictory figures in American
political history. He seemed to bear the persona of a political
ogre and flagrant abuser of executive power when he testified
before the Senate Watergate Committee for five riveting days in
July 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also was a man who was ``predisposed to be gentle,''
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote.
</P>
<P>
   To be seen as a new person _ markedly different from the
sarcastic, ruthless Machiavelli during the hearings _ seemed most
important to him. ``I would hate to think that the way I was in
those five days is the way I really am. But that image is out
there, embedded in the memory of people. I frequently hear people
say, `You aren't the way I remember you.' I never was, in that
sense,'' Ehrlichman told Don O'Briant of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution in 1992. The ex-presidential adviser still was
working to tell his side of Watergate almost three decades after it
happened. In 1997, he worked with novelist Tom Clancy and Cobb
County, Ga. film producers Thomas J. and Mark Barnette to produce
the Watergate documentary, ``John Ehrlichman: In the Eye of the
Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman was married three times, first in 1949 to his UCLA
classmate, Jeanne Fisher. With the breakup of his second marriage
in 1991, Ehrlichman left his longtime post-prison hideaway in Santa
Fe, N.M., and moved to Atlanta. Here he became senior vice
president for Law Companies Group, an architectural and
environmental engineering firm. In January 1995, Ehrlichman and
Atlanta restaurateur Karen Hilliard married. They traveled and
seemed to enjoy visiting his children, meeting his speaking
engagements and fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman was a self-described Christian Scientist teetotaler
and former Seattle Sunday school teacher who, before the Senate
Watergate Committee, criticized members of Congress for drinking
too much. However, to keep him writing a cookbook, Hilliard said,
``We just keep his wine glass full.'' A native of Tacoma, Wash.,
Ehrlichman enlisted in the Army in 1943. He flew 26 bombing
missions over Germany and received the Distinguished Flying Cross.
</P>
<P>
   After his discharge, he enrolled at UCLA on the G.I. Bill
andbecame friends with Haldeman. He received his law degree from
Stanford University in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   As a founding partner in the Seattle law firm of Hullin,
Ehrlichman, Roberts and Hodge from 1952 to 1968, Ehrlichman was an
expert on real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with the law, he accepted Haldeman's invitation to join in
running the 1959-60 Nixon political campaigns for the GOP
nomination for president against Nelson Rockefeller, and for
president against John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman also helped guide Nixon's disastrous run for
California governor in 1962. The Nixon team returned from oblivion
to defeat Hubert Humphrey for the presidency in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman was counsel to the president for the first 11 months
of the Nixon administration, from January to November 1969. He then
moved up to presidential assistant for domestic affairs, a role
paralleling Kissinger's in national security. Ehrlichman argued for
a national energy policy, welfare reform, anti-poverty programs and
liberalized abortion laws.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlichman's protege and former Seattle law associate, Egil
``Bud'' Krogh, headed the White House's special investigations
unit, nicknamed the ``plumbers.'' Ehrlichman was its ``chairman of
the board,'' wrote Frank Mankiewicz, a longtime Democratic insider.
The June 1972 break-in at Democratic National Committee
headquarters by five ``plumbers,'' and their subsequent arrest, was
dismissed by the White House as a ``third-rate burglary.'' It
eventually brought down the Nixon administration. Ehrlichman went
to trial twice. He was found guilty of conspiring to violate the
civil rights of Dr. Lewis Fielding (Dr. Daniel Ellsberg's
psychiatrist), and of three counts of perjury for lying to the FBI
and a grand jury, in July 1973. He was found guilty of conspiring
to hinder the Watergate investigation in January 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Karen Hilliard of Atlanta; two
daughters, Jan Ehrlichman of Santa Fe, N.M., and Jody Pineda of
Seattle; four sons, Tom Ehrlichman of Everett, Wash., Peter
Ehrlichman of Seattle, Bob Ehrlichman of San Francisco and Michael
Ehrlichman of Princeton, N.J.; his mother, Lillian Ehrlichman of
Seattle; and 10 grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family requested that contributions be
made to Adventure Unlimited, Camper Scholarship Fund, 5201 S.
Quebec St., Englewood, CO 80111.

89-YEAR-OLD REBEL WITH A CAUSE HITS ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGUILA, Ariz. - In front of her stretches a straight strip of
miles and miles of U.S. 60 and not much else. Somewhere in the
distance is Wickenburg. It seems a long way off when you're
walking, but it's nothing, really. Not when you've got thousands of
miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   And Dorris Haddock does. The New Hampshire resident is walking
across the country, from Pasadena, Calif., to Washington D.C.,
gathering petitions and drawing attention to the need for
campaign-finance reform. She calculates the trip at 3,055 miles.
She started after the Rose Parade on New Year's Day; walking 10
miles a day, she hopes to get to D.C. by November.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one more thing _ she's 89 years old. Is she nuts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my dear friends have said that,'' she said last week,
laughing. ``My family said that. I said, `Look, I've got 10
great-grandchildren in this world. I want them to come into a
democracy that is of the people, by the people and for the people
instead of, of the corporation, by the corporation and for the
corporation.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If one person can do that, I can.'' &QL; 
Longtime activist &QL; 
 &QL; 
She's probably right. Whether protesting with her husband to stop
nuclear testing in Alaska in the '60s _ they lived, for a time, in
skin-covered huts near the Bering Strait _ or working to stop a
major highway from going through Dublin, N.H., where she lives,
Haddock has long been an activist. Not a professional one, mind
you. Although she's plenty savvy about politics, she doesn't spend
her time poring over ``Mother Jones'' magazine, looking for issues.
She just waits for the right one. And then she runs _ or in this
case, walks _ with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see something that's not right and I say, `Can one woman do
something about this? Let's try.' Sometimes, it works and
sometimes, it doesn't. But I keep trying.''
</P>
<P>
   The walk is her biggest effort at activism. She thought the feat
would draw the most attention to her cause. But there's another
reason she chose such an arduous method.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother has always been an adventurer,'' said Betty Lawrenz,
her daughter, from her home in Chevy Chase, Md. ``She just is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawrenz, 64, remembered with a chuckle her mother starting
church dances for teenagers, which stirred up trouble for a time
with other churches _ until they followed suit and started their
own dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's a cause she wanted to be a part of, she'll do it,''
Lawrenz said. ``(But) she wasn't doing it all her life. She was
making a living.''
</P>
<P>
   She did that at a shoe company where she worked; her husband,
James, who died in 1994, worked for a utility company. When the
right issue struck, he was just as committed as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my dad was living, they both did such things,'' Lawrenz
said.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing inflames Haddock like the need for reforming
campaign finances. She'd much rather talk about that, for instance,
than her walk. She's been interviewed on CNN and by National Public
Radio, events that left her a little frustrated _ she felt like the
reporters were more interested in the saga of an 89-year-old woman
walking across the country than the cause itself. But the cause is
what drives her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, to me, is the biggie,'' she said. ``I feel the
corporations have taken over the elections. I feel a poor man has
to sell his soul to run for office because the costs are so
prohibitively high. I find as I go along that people are not
voting. They say, `Oh, politicians are crooks. I don't vote
anymore.' They just feel that they've been isolated from the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Haddock says all this in a crisp New England accent, the words
coming faster and faster as she warms to her subject. That's the
way she walks, too. I walked two miles with her and Doug Vance, a
35-year-old California man who is accompanying her partway; forget
89 _ her pace was brisk for any age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll cut it down a bit if you like,'' Haddock said, in all
seriousness. No need. Her enthusiasm and energy inspire you to keep
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has an incredible grasp of politics,'' said Dennis Burke,
executive director of Arizona Common Cause. (The group is assisting
Haddock's walk; members and friends have offered meals and
lodging.) ``I think what she hopes is to take an issue that is
fairly complex and ho-hum in the minds of most people and put a
personal face to it.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
`Indomitable spirit' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That face is wrinkled and creased, and topped most of the time
by a disintegrating straw hat. She wears a sign around her neck
that says, ``Granny D _ pilgrim for campaign finance reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona swing of her trip will take her through Buckeye,
Phoenix, Tempe, Guadalupe, Chandler, Sacaton, Coolidge, Picacho,
Marana, Rillito, Tucson, Benson, Willcox and San Simon (to follow
her progress on the Internet, visit www.arizonatimes.com). She's
never met Sen. John McCain, himself a proponent of campaign-finance
reform, but hopes to. She also hopes to meet Sen. Jon Kyl, and
twist his arm to support her cause.
</P>
<P>
   Can she make it to D.C.? Even Haddock doesn't know. She began
walking 10 miles a day last year to train, said Jim Haddock, her
son. Told she might have to sleep outdoors, she pulled a sleeping
bag into her front yard and slept there.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's always been a rebel,'' Jim said from the donated van he
was driving, a sort of mobile rest stop for his mother (he'll be
with her a month before returning home to New Hampshire). ``She's
an indomitable spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at times her age has shown. Haddock developed a mild case
of pneumonia walking through the California desert and had to take
a few days off. Her son worries about her, of course. But she
doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it matter to me if something happens to me on the
way?'' she asked. ``That's all right. But if I can just nudge those
senators . . . .'' &QL;

<P>
   It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it a coincidence that a print advertisement with a skiing
theme for the Newport brand of cigarettes sold by the Lorillard
unit of the Loews Corp. features a backdrop of oversized Newport
logos, which when viewed upside down look like the Nike ``swoosh''
logo?
</P>
<P>
   _ How could Northwest Airlines keep running promotional
newspaper ads early last month, showing models posed as happy
passengers enjoying ``worldwide winter travel,'' when at the same
time thousands of real passengers were complaining about being held
on the tarmac of the snowed-in Detroit Metropolitan Airport for as
long as 11 hours?
</P>
<P>
   _ How pleased could America Online be to learn that its ad in
the March 9 issue of Woman's Day magazine appears between the pages
of an article titled ``Terrorized on the Internet''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the introduction of the Light Done Right line of salad
dressings by the Kraft Foods unit of the Philip Morris Companies,
coming after the table spread called I Can't Believe It's Not
Butter and the shampoo called Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific, set
off a fad for product names that make complete sentences?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it an accident that the episode of the NBC sitcom
``Suddenly Susan'' scheduled to run on Monday is centered on the
characters' being eligible for $11 million given away by American
Family Publishers when that sweepstakes is operated by a company
partly owned by the Time Inc. unit of Time Warner Inc., which
produces ``Suddenly Susan'' through its Warner Brothers subsidiary?
</P>
<P>
   _ In a print ad for McDonald's, when a young girl looks at her
newborn brother in a hospital nursery and asks her father, ``So
when can he have a Happy Meal?,'' shouldn't the father reply, ``At
least let's wait till he gets some teeth''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why is it that in a television commercial for the Crest brand
of toothpaste sold by the Procter &AMP; Gamble Company, a choir
performing a gospel version of ``O Happy Day'' can be heard singing
the first line of the hymn (``O happy day'') but not the second
(``When Jesus washed my sins away'')?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the reason that the background has been rendered so blurry
in a new ad photographed in Times Square, in which the model
Rebecca Romijn-Stamos poses in a bikini and a ``milk mustache'' for
the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board, that the giant
signs behind her are promoting Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola?
</P>
<P>
   _ Has there been a more condescending or patronizing promotion
for films on pay cable television than a commercial that recently
ran on the Cinemax network owned by Time Warner, which began with
an announcer asserting: ``I'm not a big fan of movies that take
place in the past. But `Oscar and Lucinda' is a lot of fun''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it necessary for the newspaper USA Today to explain that a
recent syndicated television special that showed ``two 12-year-old
boys, one black and the other white, who travel in time with the
help of a magical watch'' was a ``fictional story''?
</P>
<P>
   _ When the CNBC cable network ran an ad promoting ``The Money
Summit'' _ which carried the headline ``You could watch `It's a
Wonderful Life.' Or you could watch a program that helps you make a
wonderful life of your own'' _ did anyone recall that ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' is now shown only on the CNBC sibling broadcast
network, NBC?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why is it that cereal companies are having so much trouble
persuading consumers to buy their products when an unknown company
called PLB Sports could distribute more than a million boxes of
sugar-frosted flakes named after the football player Doug Flutie?
</P>
<P>
   _ In the brave new world of offbeat advertising and marketing
titles, who is more senior, a director for knowledge management or
a chief knowledge officer?
</P>
<P>
   _ How unexpected a delight was it when at a recent New York
Rangers game at Madison Square Garden, the giant video screen
played the clip from ``All About Eve'' when Bette Davis warns her
party guests, ``Fasten your seat belts, it's going to be a bumpy
night''?
</P>
<P>
   _ As the executives of the Times Square Business Improvement
District and Countdown Entertainment, a marketing company
representing the owners of One Times Square, sell rights to
advertisers to be designated the ``official'' products of the
celebration on Dec. 31, 1999, are they aware that the Franklin Mint
is selling a ``Millennium 2000'' commemorative plate showing a
scene in a cityscape closely resembling Times Square, complete with
a giant ball dropping from a building?
</P>
<P>
   _ And is the Franklin Mint aware that an ad selling the
commemorative plate is detailed enough for readers to see the
marquee of a movie theater carrying the message ``Auld Lang Syn''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was a mathematician consulted by the Campbell Soup Co. for an
ad declaring that the five-tenths of a gram of fat in each serving
of Swanson Chicken Broth is ``three times less'' than the 1.5 grams
of fat in each serving of a rival brand, College Inn Chicken Broth?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there a consumer in the world who would seriously think, as
an ad in a coupon insert suggests, that the Shield brand of soap
sold by Unilever is ``a refreshing part of your active life
style''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did Philip Morris consider that an ad for Marlboro cigarettes
showing three somber-looking cowboys, including one whose head is
bowed, could be interpreted as a scene from a funeral of a Marlboro
Man who died of lung cancer?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will a swampful of suddenly unemployed frogs and lizards
complain to an advertising columnist that ``you ask a lot of
questions for someone from Brooklyn''?

INCREASING RATE OF HIV FOUND IN YOUNG GAY MEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)   (jw) 
 By LYNDA RICHARDSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first large-scale study of HIV infection among
young gay men in New York City has found that large numbers have
become infected with the virus in the last two years, with the
infection rates of young black men exceeding those of whites and
Hispanic men.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the Young Men's Survey, conducted by the New York
City Health Department and the New York City Blood Center,
indicated that 12 percent of their sample of 15- to 22-year-old men
who have sex with men are infected with HIV, the virus that causes
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of those participating in the survey reported that
they had also had sex with women.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with 545 men who have sex with men were conducted
last year in dance clubs, businesses and street locations
throughout the city. The survey was financed by the federal Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and was conducted in nine urban
areas. Though the surveys began in 1994, New York City participated
for the first time last year.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 46 percent of the respondents reported that
they had unprotected anal sex within the last six months, placing
them at high risk for acquiring and transmitting HIV. Young black
men were most heavily affected. Eighteen percent of young
African-American men and 16 percent of gay men of mixed race in the
survey were HIV positive, while the infection rates were 9 percent
among young Hispanic men and 3 percent among young white men,
according to the Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the racial and ethnic disparities in HIV
infection levels reflected nationwide trends.
</P>
<P>
   The HIV infection rate among the young men who previously had a
sexually transmitted disease was 23 percent, while it was 10
percent among those without such a history.
</P>
<P>
   The study's results were announced at the recent Sixth
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a cause for concern,'' said Dr. Mary Ann
Chiasson, assistant commissioner for disease intervention research
at the city Health Department. ``It tells us exactly what kind of
high-risk behavior this particular group of men is engaging in. It
allows us to focus prevention where prevention is needed the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chiasson said Monday that the study did not answer the
question of whether high-risk behavior was on the rise among young
gay men in New York City. She said the study was specifically
intended to look at the prevalence of HIV infection and current
behavior of this particular group of young men, instead of changes
in their behavior over time.
</P>
<P>
   But in San Francisco, similar behavioral surveys among men who
have sex with men indicate that there have been increases in unsafe
sexual behavior and rectal gonorrhea from 1994 to 1997, according
to a weekly report published last month by the CDC.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the New York City survey, about a third of the 15- to
18-year-olds had had a sexual partner who was older than 30 in the
six months prior to participating in the study, while about 45
percent of the 19- to 22-year-olds had partners older than 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more likely that older men are HIV infected than younger
men so they may be at a higher risk of transmitting HIV,'' Ms.
Chiasson said. ``You see this pattern in sexually transmitted
diseases, particularly in young women who are more likely to have
older partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials and advocates for people with AIDS said
the survey pointed to the need for more prevention efforts in New
York City, which has been one of the hardest-hit cities in the
country since the early days of the epidemic.

Three-dimensional motion analysis of 20 recreational athletes found
that women run and perform some other athletic movements in a much
less crouched position than men, causing the quadricep muscles in
the fronts of the thighs to generate a great deal of power. In an
awkward movement, like landing on uneven ground, the highly
activated quadriceps have enough force to pull the tibia, or shin
bone, forward and tear the ACL, making women more prone to knee
injuries than men. (Richard Harbus/New York Times Photo)

COLUMN: LOVERS AND DANCERS KNOW MEANING OF `UNREQUITED'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., N.C.)  (jw) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Valentine's Day, thoughts turned to matters both
heartwarming and heartbreaking. They led to the brightly lighted
studios of the Joffrey Ballet School, up two flights from Avenue of
the Americas in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   It was audition day for 200 young people _ just about all girls
in, or approaching, their teens _ who hoped to be accepted into the
school's summer program, a rigorous exercise geared to those truly
serious about dance. No dilettantes need apply, which may also be
said of similar training offered by other New York dance companies.
</P>
<P>
   If they are lucky, to say nothing of talented, a few dozen of
those who showed up on Sunday will hear good news when Joffrey
sends out letters of acceptance or rejection in a few weeks.
Auditions are also held in 16 other cities in the United States and
Canada, with roughly 1,500 children altogether competing for fewer
than 200 places.
</P>
<P>
   In short, as with so many things in New York, this was not a
scene for anyone short of pluck or skill. The girls knew they had
to be _ forgive us _ on their toes.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes ran high as they limbered up in black leotards and pink
tights. That was the heartwarming part. But nervousness poked
through. A foot jiggled incessantly here, a nail was bitten
furtively there. Heartbreak, everyone knew, could be a step away.
``It's very competitive,'' said Edith D'Addario, the school's
director since 1961.
</P>
<P>
   While the girls went through their paces in groups of 45 or so,
Ms. D'Addario and other judges could see almost right away who had
what it took and who did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know in the first five minutes what training the girls
have,'' said Angela Corosanite, who came by bus with 20 young
hopefuls from Philadelphia, where they study at the Children's
Ballet Theater, which she runs. ``They can tell immediately what
technique they were trained in, sometimes even what school.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one will get the final word until the letters go out.
``I don't believe in telling them on the spot, because it's so
emotionally shattering for them,'' Ms. D'Addario said.
</P>
<P>
   The parents did not have it much easier. ``I should have brought
worry beads,'' Lorraine Peate said to Loretta Woods as they waited
in a hallway for the auditions to begin. She was kidding. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Peate's daughter, Lauren, studies with Ms. Woods' daughter,
Lisa, at the Seiskaya Ballet School in St. James, N.Y. Yes, said
Lisa, who is 13, she thought she was ready. But when asked how she
felt, she offered a nervous laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're worried about their feelings,'' Ms. Peate said. ``If
they get hurt, you get hurt.'' But there is just so much sheltering
that a parent can or should give, she added, a point that had Ms.
Woods nodding agreement. ``They have to learn to accept
rejection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There must have been a few stage moms around, the ``Sing out,
Louise!'' types who give involved parenting a bad name. If so, they
did not announce themselves. Mostly, the mothers and fathers lent
their daughters low-key support while trying to keep their own
fidgeting under control.
</P>
<P>
   They were people like Amy Carrasco, who flew up for the day from
Chapel Hill, N.C. Her daughter, Tammy, 13, made it into the Joffrey
summer program last year, but now had to earn her stripes all over
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know that the rejection can come, and you have to handle
it yourself,'' Ms. Carrasco said. ``She only reacts as well as I
do. My attitude has to be: OK, we'll keep trying. You have to throw
as many darts at a target as you can and hope one of them hits.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Jessica Concannon's feelings as well. Jessica, 14, was
part of Ms. Corosanite's Philadelphia contingent, which, win or
lose, was determined to have a perfect Sunday in New York,
following the auditions with lunch and then the New York City
Ballet at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident I'll get in,'' Jessica said before she
stepped up to the barre. And if she turns out to be wrong? ``I'll
try again next year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So will many of the others, who already put in hours and hours
of work each week, convinced that a dancing career is not beyond
their grasp. In an age when the rallying cry of many young people
is ``whatever,'' their commitment was all anyone needed to
guarantee that the day's heartwarming side triumphed over
heartbreak.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Carrasco put it, ``to have a passion is a wonderful
thing.''

   `Last Supper' Site To Close for 3 Months &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie housing Leonardo da
Vinci's ``Last Supper'' in Milan will close from March 1 to May 27
for completion of a restoration that began two decades ago. The
painting can be seen by visitors during Holy Week from March 30 to
April 4. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The delicate operation on the fresco was necessary because the
masterpiece began disintegrating soon after it was completed in
1498, mostly as a result of the artist's unfortunate choice of
medium: not conventional fresco, in which the paint is applied to
wet plaster, but tempera applied to dry plaster.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from as early as 1517 spoke of its deterioration. The
fresco underwent a number of restoration attempts and touch-ups
throughout the centuries, and the refectory that houses it was
badly damaged in 1943 when a bomb demolished the roof of the
building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This most recent restoration began in the late 1970s and has
involved dozens of specialists and technicians. This is the first
scientific restoration of the masterpiece, following a careful
scientific analysis, where the restorers are removing rather than
adding to the fresco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that it will be longer lasting than earlier
attempts,'' said Pietro Cesare Marani, a fine-arts expert who has
been closely involved in the project, ``but we aren't presumptuous
enough to believe that it will last forever. Nothing lasts
forever.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Bedtime for Bonzo' In a Presidential Suite &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For his eight years as president, Ronald Reagan almost never
stayed anyplace else in Los Angeles but the Westin Century Plaza
Hotel and Tower. Reagan's 88th birthday was Feb. 6, and the hotel
took the occasion to formally rename its renovated presidential
suite in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, the 8,000-square-foot suite, which occupies the
entire 30th floor of the tower building, will be known as the
Ronald Reagan Suite, and it comes equipped with floor-to-ceiling
windows, a wraparound balcony, two whirlpool baths and its own
butler _ all for just $5,400 a night. The tower was built in 1984
with security in mind _ the suite has reinforced concrete walls,
bulletproof glass, access to a rooftop helipad and its own
elevator.
</P>
<P>
   The most personal touch is the Reagan memorabilia, with more
than 40 gilt-framed photographs chronicling his life, including one
of him happily tossing a paper airplane from the suite's balcony.
Guests will also have a private videotape library of Reagan's
films, including ``Kings Row,'' ``Brother Rat'' and, for late-night
viewing, ``Bedtime for Bonzo.''

   Midtown Manhattan Gets 2d Visitor Center &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The theater district of Manhattan will soon be home to another
visitor center, joining the Times Square Visitors Center, which
opened last fall on Broadway between 46th and 47th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The new center will open March 3 on Seventh Avenue between 52nd
and 53rd Street, across from the Sheraton New York Hotel and Towers
and a block away from the Broadway Theater, currently the home of
``Miss Saigon,'' and the Ed Sullivan Theater, where ``Late Night
With David Letterman'' is taped.
</P>
<P>
   Free publications _ including maps, guides and brochures _ will
be offered at the center, which will also provide help from a
multilingual staff.
</P>
<P>
   Interactive electronic kiosks will feature updated information
on attractions and events throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Admission tickets for some museums and attractions such as the
Brooklyn Museum of Art will be sold at the kiosks. An ATM will
accept major bank and credit cards, and souvenirs sold at the
center will not be available anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The Visitor Information Center, 810 Seventh Avenue, (212)
484-1222, will be open weekdays from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and weekends
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. &QL;

   2 European Tours Strike Classical Music Themes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a year that commemorates Johann Strauss, Chopin, Schoenberg
and Smetana, among other composers, Vienna will be a major stop on
many tours. In the Footsteps of the Great Composers, a 12-night
program that visits Vienna, as well as Prague and Budapest, departs
May 6, Sept. 23 and Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   A seven-night Storybook Musical Adventure cruise on the Danube
aboard the river cruiser Mozart calls at Durnstein, Vienna,
Esztergom, Budapest, Bratislava and Melk and Grein. Departures are
May 26, following three nights at the Vier Jahreszeiten Hotel in
Munich, and Sept. 22, with three nights at the Bayerischer Hof
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs offer tickets to concerts and operas, backstage
visits and a classical-music expert as guide. The Storybook cruises
will also be accompanied by George Shangrow, musical director of
Orchestra Seattle, and Joseph Fratianni, an American classical
guitarist who lives in Salzburg.
</P>
<P>
   The Footsteps tour is $6,615 a person, double occupancy,
including round-trip air fare from New York. Storybook fares range
from $5,770 to $7,965, depending on cabin, and also include
round-trip air fare from New York. Information: I.S.T. Cultural

   Phoenix Museum Celebrates New Space &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Heard Museum in Phoenix, known for its extensive collection
of Native American, African and Oceanic tribal art, is growing. In
a series of events beginning next Sunday, the museum will celebrate
a 50,000-square-foot expansion that creates room for three new
galleries, a studio for artists in residence, an auditorium, an
education pavilion, a cafe and a bigger shop. With a total of
130,000 square feet, the museum hopes to better accommodate annual
attendance of over 250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The grand opening on Sunday, with free admission, will feature
artist demonstrations, crafts activities, music and dance
performances and offerings of traditional Native American foods.
</P>
<P>
   The Heard's annual two-day Indian fair and market begins March
6, with close to 500 Native American artists selling their pottery,
jewelry, basketry, weavings, carvings, paintings and sculptures.
Musicians and dancers will also perform.
</P>
<P>
   On March 20 and 21, the museum will hold the World Championship
Hoop Dance Contest, with dancers from the United States and Canada
moving in and out of hoops in creative displays of athleticism and
grace.
</P>
<P>
   During all these events, visitors will be able to view several
exhibitions in the new and old galleries, including ``More Than
Art,'' an introduction to native cultures; two exhibits of
contemporary Indian art; ``Horse,'' which uses saddles, tack,
blankets and other artifacts to explore the meaning horses hold for
Native Americans in the West and Southwest, and ``Cradles, Corn and
Lizards,'' a hands-on exhibit about the relationships among
Arizona's tribes, plants and animals. Zuni artifacts from the 20th
century are featured in ``Blue Gem, White Metal: Carvings and
Jewelry from the C.G. Wallace Collection.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heard Museum, 2301 North Central Avenue, is open daily.
Admission is $7, $6 for seniors and $3 for ages 4 to 12.

SPAIN'S CASALS MUSEUM  
 NEW LONDON FESTIVAL  
 KONA FISHING CHARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SUZANNE MacNEILLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics) Do you have information on the Pablo Casals museum
in Barcelona? _ Maria Hernandez, New York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. The museum, which is also the home where the cellist Pablo
Casals was born in 1876 and lived for 11 years, is actually in El
Vendrell, 50 miles south of Barcelona. The house was opened as a
museum last year.
</P>
<P>
   El Vendrell, which already honors Casals with a copper statue
and a summer music festival in an auditorium which also bears his
name, has lately been sprucing up other Casals-related landmarks,
starting with the birthplace museum, at 2 Calle Santa Anna.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits there include photographs of the young cellist
wearing a sailor's suit, a piano on which his musician father gave
lessons, and furniture recreating a late-19th-century ambiance in
the narrow, four-story home that his family rented.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the museum is free, and it is open daily from 11
a.m. to 1 p.m. and, except for Sunday, from 5 to 7 p.m. as well.
</P>
<P>
   El Vendrell's City Hall also is directing the $2.5 million
restoration of the spacious Mediterranean beachfront home that
Casals bought in town early in this century. He rarely visited it
after going into exile during the Franco regime. Casals died in
1973, in Puerto Rico, and the beachfront home in El Vendrell, about
two miles from the birthplace home, later became a museum. It
closed in late 1997 for repairs and is expected to reopen next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Another link to Casals is the 18th-century Baroque organ in the
Sant Salvador Church, a five-minute walk from his birthplace.
Casals began playing this organ when he was about 9 years old and
paid for its restoration in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can reach El Vendrell by driving an hour southwest of
Barcelona on the A-16 toll road, which was recently named after
Casals. For more information: (34) 977-665-684. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I've heard rumors of a new literary festival in
London. Can you tell me anything about it? Also, when are the Hay
and Cheltenham festivals this year? _ Anne-Marie Stand, Bangor,
Maine.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The Word,'' a new literature festival, is scheduled to take
place across London from March 19 to 23. Sixty-six writers, 22 from
London, 12 from elsewhere in Britain and 32 from other countries
will participate in a celebration of the written and spoken word.
The director of the event is Peter Florence, who also founded the
annual literature festival in the Welsh border town of Hay-on-Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Some 350 events _ including readings, lectures and workshops _
will take place throughout the 33 boroughs that make up London.
Writers taking part include Antonia Fraser, Doris Lessing, Richard
Dawkins, Orlando Figes, Margaret Atwood, Armistead Maupin, Seamus
Heaney, Ariel Dorfman and Toni Morrison. Among the events are
these:
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 p.m. on March 21 at the Barbican Center on Silk Street,
Richard Holmes, a biographer of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge,
will talk about the current boom in biographical writing, followed
by a reading by Joseph Heller at 7:30 (information, (44-171) 638
8891. On March 22, Nadine Gordimer, David Said and David Grossman
will discuss the role and engagement of the writer in society and
political life, and on March 23, Germaine Greer will talk about her
new book ``The Whole Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Both events are at 7:30 p.m., at Westminster Central Hall,
Storey's Gate, telephone (44-171) 494 5371. On March 26 at 7 p.m.
there will be an evening of readings and discussion with Peter
Carey, Ms. Lessing, Chinua Achebe, Derek Walcott and Emily Perkins
at the Commonwealth Institute on Kensington High Street, (44-171)
494 5371.
</P>
<P>
   For information about ``The Word,'' call (44-171) 837) 2555; fax
(44-171) 278 0480. There is no central number so reservations
should be made at each place. Some events are free; others range in
cost to $60.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Sunday Times Hay Festival, runs from May 28 to June
6. Among the writers and personalities provisionally signed up to
appear are the former president of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk, and
the writers Hilary Spurling, John Mortimer, Jan Morris and Paul
Auster. Details will be available in April. Information: (44-1497)
821299, fax (44-1497) 821066.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheltenham Festival of Literature is to take place 120 miles
west of London in the Regency spa town of Cheltenham from Oct. 8 to
24. To celebrate its 50th anniversary, the festival will run twice
as long this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Details will be available in April, with a brochure to be
published in August. For a brochure, call (44-1242) 237377; the
number for reservations is (44-1242) 227979. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)I'd like to find out about chartering fishing boats
on the Kona coast in Hawaii. Do you know the names of some
operators? William Keenan, Miami Beach(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Chartering a fishing boat along the Big Island of Hawaii's
Kona coast should not be a problem given the number of outfitters
that offer excursions. Dozens of boats are available for full- and
half-day trips from Honokauau Harbor, just outside the town of
Kailua Kona, off Route 19.
</P>
<P>
   The water offshore is celebrated for its bounty of marlin,
yellowfin tuna and mahi-mahi. While all three fish may be caught
throughout the year, the best season for marlin (the most
sought-after fish, which can weigh well over 1,000 pounds) is
January to March, and July to September; yellowfin tuna abound in
the summer; and mahi-mahi are most frequently caught after winter
storms. Because the climate is so temperate, rough seas are
relatively uncommon. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The price of hiring a boat usually includes a captain and crew,
fishing bait and the use of fishing tackle. However, passengers are
usually asked to bring their own food and drinks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boats are generally 30 to 35 feet in length and limited to four
to six passengers. Most excursions stay within about 10 miles of
shore. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charter boat operators from Honokauau Harbor include: Notorious

PESTICIDE COMPANY DISPUTES SERIOUSNESS OF CONTAMINATION
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies ENVIRONMENTAL-ACTIVIST) c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elf Atochem officials strongly disagree with the opinions and
conclusions that were espoused by Mark O'Connor about the
seriousness of arsenic contamination in Bryan, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in no way want to show any disrespect to the deceased,''
said Peter McCarthy, vice president of Elf Atochem North America,
``because he forced us to do a lot of research, so there has been a
benefit to his work. But in truth, our research shows that he spent
his life pursuing things that were just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy referred to recent Elf Atochem studies on the effects
of arsenic inhalation, prompted by numerous lawsuits. The studies,
released to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram but not yet public, show
that the company has measured the effects of inhalation of arsenic
in rats to determine if it affected their offspring. The study
concluded that only when the rats inhaled enough arsenic to kill
them would it have any effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study clearly shows that inhalation of arsenic in the
amounts we were talking about does not cause birth defects,'' said
Karen Flynn, associate general counsel of Elf Atochem North
America. ``In fact, if we had had this study when we settled the
(anencephalic babies) case in 1994, we would not have settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Flynn said the studies the company has conducted are
groundbreaking and go further than previous studies. Many studies
done on arsenic levels in drinking water suggest a correlation
between arsenic ingestion and lung or skin cancer. Other studies
have suggested a correlation between lung cancer and arsenic
inhalation, although none of these studies claims to be absolute in
its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, we would not want the people in Bryan to think there
is currently an arsenic problem still there, because there is
not,'' Flynn said.

AMERICAN SCHEDULE HEADING BACK TOWARD NORMAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH _ American Airlines operated nearly 90 percent of its
scheduled flights on Monday, for the first time since Feb. 7, as
the number of pilots still out sick dwindled to fewer than 800.
</P>
<P>
   American cancelled about 250 flights on Monday, and it expects
to operate 99 percent of its 2,250 scheduled flights on Tuesday,
said Robert Baker, executive vice president of operations. The
airline plans to cancel only 18 flights, mostly on long-range
international routes, because cockpit crews aren't yet in position
to fly the return legs, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, negotiations between the Fort Worth-based carrier's
management and the Allied Pilots Association, the union that
represents American's pilots, resumed for the first time since
Thursday. The talks continued into the evening, and were expected
to continue on Tuesday, but neither side would say whether they
made progress toward a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   American has cancelled more than 6,000 flights since Feb. 5,
disrupting the travel of an estimated 600,000 people, after large
numbers of pilots called in sick to protest the specifics of
American's plan for combining the recently purchased Reno Air with
American.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall in Dallas came down hard on the
union last week, ordering it to deposit $10 million with the court
by Tuesday, as a down payment on contempt of court fines, and
damages incurred by American. Union President Rich LaVoy and Vice
President Brian Mayhew were told to deposit $10,000 and $5,000,
respectively. Kendall is expected to assess fines and damages at
hearing scheduled for Wednesday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall ruled that Allied Pilots leaders were in contempt of
court when they didn't do enough to encourage their members
participating in the sickout to return to work, as he had ordered
them to do last Wednesday. The number of pilots on the sicklist
grew by several hundred after Kendall issued his back-to-work
order.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, on Friday, the number of pilots on the sick list
hit 2,473. American has 9,300 pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials declined to answer questions on Monday. They
were working on two items of business: urging pilots who remained
on the sick list to call in and declare themselves fit to fly; and
responding to Kendall's contempt ruling and his ruling in favor of
American on underlying issue of the case, that the sickout was
illegal under the federal Railway Labor Act.
</P>
<P>
   While union officials are considering an appeal, they have no
choice but to comply with the judge's order to deliver a check to
his office by noon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The union has an estimated net worth of about $38 million. But
much of that money is invested in securities and property,
including a new office building that opened late last year in far
east Fort Worth. LaVoy said Sunday the union does not have $10
million in cash and will have to convert some of its invested
capital into cash to comply with Kendall's order.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's revenues are expected to continue to suffer, both
because of consumers' hesitancy to book the airline in the wake of
last week's disruptions, and because it plans to reduce its
schedule as a defensive move against future cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   The airline plans to cut back its daily flight schedule by about
2 percent in the months of March, April and May, or about 45 to 50
flights a day, because management does not believe enough pilots
will volunteer to fly additional hours each month to cover all
2,250 flights now on the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pilots' sick roll is only a third as long as its
was at the peak of the sickout on Thursday and Friday, there
continued to be nearly twice as many American pilots out sick than
400 who normally would be out ill at this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, American officials spoke optimistically about getting
their carrier's operation back up to full speed by Wednesday. And
they said they are determined to restore both consumers' confidence
in American and the morale of those employees who bore the biggest
part of the burden created by the sickout that began Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not necessarily talking about a big fare sale,'' a common
response by airlines whose operations have been disrupted by labor
strife, Baker said. ``We've got a number of heavy promotional
efforts we're going to be doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker also said the airline has ``a lot of work to do within our
own company to get this thing put back together right.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker _ to whom the pilots report _ and Cecil Ewell, American's
vice president of flight and chief pilot, later this week will
launch a whirlwind tour of the airline's various pilot bases, where
they plan to listen to pilots' concerns about the integration of
Reno Air and the more deeply-rooted problems that both sides agree
were the underlying causes of the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Baker, American Chairman Donald Carty, and other
senior executives are urging American's nearly 80,000 non-pilot
employees to not be upset at the American pilots, 75 percent of
whom did not participate in the sickout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need everybody working together to rebuild the traveling
public's trust in our company,'' he said.

TIGHT-FISTED KNICKS BEAT PISTONS, 78-69 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (Eds: See also BKN-ARATON-COLUMN) 
(mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Wingate stepped onto the floor with hair as
gray as a cloudy day, lug nuts for knees and an aging thin frame. A
player fit for a cardigan and a game of bingo. But the 35-year-old
reserve, who was sitting next to Siberia on the Knicks' bench, did
not spend Monday afternoon in search of a catnap.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a lively Wingate sneaked into the game for 30 pivotal
seconds. For half a minute, Wingate leaned on his 12 years of
experience and the mental notes he had been taking on Detroit's
Grant Hill through nearly three quarters of a sleep-inducing game.
For half a minute, Wingate gave up 3 inches, 40 pounds and,
ultimately, his body to guard Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Wingate was flat on his back after taking a charge
with 5.4 seconds left in the third quarter. Suddenly, the groggy
Madison Square Garden crowd lifted its voice in approval as yet
another Hill-led comeback attempt was snuffed out. In one microcosm
of the game, Wingate displayed the kind of smart, physical and
energetic defense that led the Knicks to an esthetically
displeasing, but perfectly satisfying, 78-69 victory against the
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach just asked me to go out and play good defense for 30
seconds,'' said Wingate, who has played just four total minutes in
five games for the Knicks(3-2). ``I was in the game and paying
attention. We go over everyone's tendencies and weaknesses. I knew
what Grant liked to do and didn't like. I knew to keep the ball in
his left hand, and shade more to his right. I stuck to the details
and played aggressively.''
</P>
<P>
   A little brains and a little brawn. This is how a Knicks team
that went 12 minutes without a field goal and shot zero for 13
during one unbearable stretch of the second half managed to win
anyway. This is how they contained Hill (31 points) and shut down
the satellites that whirl around him. No other Piston _ not Jerry
Stackhouse (one for 11) nor Joe Dumars (0 points) _ scored in
double figures on a team that shot 33.3 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   And this is how you make team history. For the first time since
the inception of the 24-second clock, the Knicks held a team to
fewer than 70 points for the second straight game. Three days
earlier, the Bulls managed to squeeze just 68 points out of the
tight-fisted Knicks. Part of their opponents' paltry sums can be
attributed to the hangover effect of the National Basketball
Association's lockout. But the Knicks can take credit as well.
</P>
<P>
   They made the Pistons sweat every shot. It was in the way Chris
Childs (four steals) attacked Hill (four turnovers) when his shift
to guard the superstar came, and how Patrick Ewing (14 points, 10
rebounds) popped up out of the paint like a cork and blocked six
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel if we continue to play the kind of defense we're
capable of,'' said Ewing, who was six for 12 from the field, ``when
our offense catches up to us, we'll be unstoppable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' offense was as lost as a set of keys in the second
half. They looked everywhere, under seat cushions and in their
pockets, but could not unearth a field goal for 12 minutes
beginning midway through the third quarter and ending mercifully
with six minutes left in the game. During that time, the Knicks'
14-point lead began to evaporate as Hill put the Pistons on his
shoulders. With seven minutes left, the Knicks were up by a fragile
four points.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, this would have been Allan Houston's cue to fade
into the background against his former team. Before the game, he
had averaged seven points and shot 28 percent against the Pistons
in the three years since his departure.
</P>
<P>
   But Houston, who scored a team-high 19 points, pressed onward.
It was Houston, struggling to hit six of 18 for the game, who ended
a string of 13 missed field-goal attempts by plopping in a 13-foot
jumper over Hill with 5 minutes 27 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The shot fell like a domino. As the Pistons got as close as two
points with three minutes left, Ewing put down a 14-foot jumper,
followed by another score from Houston. Fighting through a slump _
not succumbing to it _ shows why Houston has the potential to
develop into a dominant star, much like Hill.

   The Knicks believed in defense Monday. Wingate revealed just how
deep down the bench that belief reaches. He could have nodded off
in his remote spot on the bench. He could have stepped on the floor
and showed his age. Instead, he showed his experience and acute
attention to detail. It's that kind of effort that allowed the
Knicks to limit the Pistons to fewer than 70 points.

Van Gundy said. ``Our guys do an extraordinary amount of studying,
comparatively to other teams, concerning film. It's not only as a

THERE'S SOMETHING MISSING FROM THE LIST
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER 
c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I will be eligible to participate in my company's 401(k) plan
soon, and I would appreciate some guidance as to what percentages
of my investment should go into the following fund choices: Invesco
Select Income, SoGen International, Fidelity Equity-Income II,
Templeton Foreign, Invesco Small Company Value, and Invesco
Dynamics funds. My husband and I are both 35, and we have a
2-year-old child. Retirement is 35 years away. L.C., Cape
Elizabeth, Maine
</P>
<P>
   A. It almost seems that there's something missing from the list.
Usually at the head of such a list is a fund focusing on large-cap
growth stocks, or at least a fund that seeks to duplicate the
results of the Standard and Poors Index. The closest to that you
have here is Fidelity Equity-Income II, a fund which focuses on
large-cap stocks, but usually ends up at the value end of the
investment style spectrum as a result of its search for stocks with
substantial dividend payouts.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I start out there is that you want to begin with what
most people call their core holding, which is a fund that largely
seeks to reflect the results of US economy as a whole, or of the
dominant growth-oriented segments of the economy. If there is
indeed no other large-cap fund available, the best you can do here
is Fidelity Equity-Income II _ a fine fund in its way, but not
precisely the ticket I'd prescribe. But if that's your only
large-cap play, I'd assign half of my investments there. (If there
were an index fund or a large-cap growth fund, I'd change the
prescription to 30 percent in one of them and 20 percent in
Equity-Income II.)
</P>
<P>
   That leaves you with the other half of your investment to
diversify the portfolio. Given your very long investment time
frame, I'd give Invesco Select Income fund a skip altogether _ this
is a fund that invests in long-term bonds, and while it's the
safest fund on the menu, it's also the fund that's liable to
deliver the lowest long-term results. This is the kind of thing
you'll want to look to during the last ten years before retirement,
when you want to moderate risk and preserve the retirement savings
you've built up. But for now, the right percentage for the bond
fund is zero.
</P>
<P>
   Invesco Dynamics fund puts the lion's share of its assets in
midcap growth stocks, and has built a strong record there. If your
401(k) allows you to use any percentage you chose for investments,
I'd suggest 16 2/3 percent; if your plan requires, as many do, that
allocations be made in multiples of 5 percent, I'd bump the figure
up to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Invesco Small-Cap Value fund will complete your diversification
within the US securities market. Although the fund doesn't have a
particularly stellar record _ it's rated below-average by
Morningstar Mutual Funds _ to a large extent that reflects the
general doldrums that have affected small-cap stocks in recent
years, rather than the results of the fund itself. Over the long
haul it should be a winner, and I'd put 16 2/3 percent there, or 15
percent if you have to choose round numbers.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves us with the final 15 or 16 2/3 percent to go into
international stocks. The two choices here _ Templeton Foreign and
SoGen International _ are pretty different, and I'd give the nod to
the Templeton offering. This is a fund that invests nearly all its
assets in non-US stocks, and is one of the oldest and largest funds
in this arena. It's fairly cautious, weighting its investments
heavily in utilities and industrials, but the caution has paid nice
dividends over the years, propelling it to a 10.59 percent record
of 10-year average annual total returns, a figure which compares
nicely to the 8.54 percent reported for the same period for the
average foreign stock fund tracked by Morningstar Mutual Funds.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am trying to plan an investment strategy for my financial
security in later years. I'm 25 years old and single. I have
$10,000 in cash and $30,000 equity in a new home with a $96,000
30-year mortgage. I have no other debt. My full-time employer will
match with company stock 80 percent of my $35 weekly payroll
deduction for a tax-deferred savings plan. That $35 is the maximum
I am allowed to save at this point. My choices for this money are a
bond fund, a stock index fund, an interest income fund, which I
think is pretty much a money market, an asset allocation fund, a
global fund, and company stock, which I am already getting in the
match funds. How should I divide this up?
</P>
<P>
   N.B., Fort Worth, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a more typical menu than that offered to L.C. in the
letter above, but it's still unsatisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly you'll want to treat the stock index fund as your core
holding, and put 70 percent of the money there _ not because that's
the right number, but because your opportunities to diversify are
so limited.
</P>
<P>
   I'd put the other 30 percent in the global fund, which will
doubtless take your domestic large-cap commitment well beyond that
70 percent. (This is because a global fund means just that _
investing in stocks of all nations, and usually with a very
substantial position in US equities; a foreign fund such as
Templeton Foreign mentioned in the letter above, invests entirely
outside the United States.)
</P>
<P>
   One thing I think too many people, and especially newer and
lower-level employees, are shy about doing is lobbying management
for a broader menu in 401(k) plans and other tax-deferred
retirement savings plans. But if you and a number of your coworkers
politely suggested that you'd like to see some small- and midcap
funds, a pure overseas fund, and perhaps even a fund investing in
the health care sector, perhaps management would listen.
</P>
<P>
   What can you lose? Such options would allow you much better
diversification, and probably would lead you to better returns over
the long haul.

LAWSUIT PITS ARTISTS' RIGHTS VS. ATHLETES'
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga., Pa., Calif., Ohio, Conn.)   (jw) 
 By MARCIA CHAMBERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly two years ago Rick Rush, a painter of sporting scenes,
went to the Masters at Augusta National Golf Club to paint the new
sensation, Tiger Woods, who wound up with a record-setting victory.
</P>
<P>
   Rush, a 52-year-old artist from Tuscaloosa, Ala., who has been
painting famous sports figures and events for 23 years, produced a
series of numbered prints that were signed by him and called ``The
Masters of Augusta.'' The series features Woods in the foreground
and other golf greats in the shadows. A limited edition of 250
serigraphs selling for $700 each was issued in April, along with
5,000 smaller lithographs selling for $15 each.
</P>
<P>
   Rush said that he hoped the Woods painting would join many of
his others of famous athletes _ like those of Michael Jordan, Magic
Johnson and Jack Nicklaus _ as he works on ``painting America
through sports.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Woods painting has ignited a bitter and costly legal
battle that pits an artist's freedom of expression against a
subject's property rights. The case began in June when the ETW
Corp. filed a trademark and right-of-publicity lawsuit against
Rush's company, Jireh Publishing, in federal court in Cleveland.
ETW's president is Tiger Woods' father, Earl, and its address in
Cleveland is the same as that of International Management Group,
the high-powered agency that represents Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   In decades past, athletes and movie stars tended to be happy for
whatever publicity they received. Now many of them want to guide
and control that publicity for their own profit, and the law has
helped them do so. Some sports figures register their names as
trademarks (Woods has) and invoke right-of-publicity laws to assure
that they and not others will benefit from their fame.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a new legal climate that is changing the
environment in which some American painters work. The issue is: May
an artist at a public event freely create paintings of great
athletes in action and sell them, or must he pay for the right to
use an athlete's image?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s many entertainment and sports stars, guided by
their agents and law firms, have demanded control of their names
and images. Though they may already earn millions of dollars in
their professions, they or their agents maintain that in an age of
rampant commercialism they must hold onto the hottest properties
they know: themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ETW was created to control the marketing of Tiger Woods' image.
It is represented by IMG's top outside counsel, Jones, Day, Reavis
&AMP; Pogue, one of the nation's largest law firms. Since 1997, ETW has
filed lawsuits against five other companies that it claims have
interfered with Tiger Woods' right to publicity. Jireh, in
contrast, is represented by Dennis Niermann, a solo practitioner
who describes the litigation in his court papers as ``predatory.''
Tiger Woods, according to court papers, was unaware of the lawsuit
against Jireh at the time when it was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Don Rush, Rick's brother and the president of Jireh, said in an
interview last week that the litigation was draining the company's
resources by plunging it into the daily demands of a major lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case took an ominous turn for Jireh last week when U.S.
District Judge Patricia Ann Gaughan of the Northern District of
Ohio ordered Jireh to turn over the names of the 879 distributors
and customers who bought the Woods prints. Timothy Fraelich, an
associate with Jones, Day, has told the judge he plans to subpoena
those clients. Fraelich declined to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Fraelich is seeking a permanent injunction to prevent Jireh from
marketing Woods' likeness or image. He has also requested that the
remaining Masters prints be destroyed, that ETW get a share of
Jireh's profits from previous sales of the Woods painting and that
the court award triple damages, attorney's fees and other costs,
which could include the cost of deposing 879 clients located around
the country.
</P>
<P>
   James D.A. Boyle, a visiting professor at Yale Law School who
teaches on intellectual property, said federal and state laws were
making it tough on artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been an increasing tendency,'' Boyle said, ``for the
law to cover different aspects of a celebrity's life: their name,
their likeness, their images both through trademark law and through
rights of publicity. At times this has presented the danger that
the public domain will be increasingly privatized.''
</P>
<P>
   LeRoy Neiman, perhaps the most recognizable name in sports art,
began drawing sports figures more than three decades ago, long
before these changes in case law began to appear. ``There were no
artists out there,'' he said. ``There was no market. Nobody was
selling paintings and prints of Wilt Chamberlain, and in the early
Ali days nobody was drawing him. It was a different time.''
</P>
<P>
   That began to change in 1977 after a Supreme Court ruling in
Zacchini vs. Scripps-Howard Broadcasting Co. The court said that by
videotaping and broadcasting without permission the plaintiff's
entire 15-second human cannonball act, a television station had
effectively exploited the plaintiff's right to control his own
publicity. States soon adopted right-of-publicity statutes, and
these, along with federal court opinions and trademark law, have
expanded the rights of stars and athletes to protect their images
in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Mirell, an entertainment, media and intellectual
property lawyer at Loeb &AMP; Loeb in Los Angeles, said, ``I think that
there are enormous constitutional issues that are raised by these
kinds of statutes, and I think we are just beginning to see how
pernicious these laws actually can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Painters, he said, now must be ``very careful because there is
the assertion that what you are doing is trading on fame and
fortune which would otherwise be exploitable by the celebrity
himself or herself.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mirell represented the private Franklin Mint, of Philadelphia,
after ETW sued when a commemorative coin was issued in connection
with Woods' Masters victory. Woods had been selected for the Mint's
``eyewitness medal series,'' which has chronicled significant
events, including presidential inaugurations and the signing of
peace treaties, for 25 years. ETW, the first to sue the Mint over
the series, raised trademark and right-of-publicity claims. The
case was settled.
</P>
<P>
   Don Rush said Jireh's case was a fight on behalf of all artists
who want to paint public figures at public events. ``It is
conceivable that we ought to abandon the fight and cut up the
paintings,'' he said. ``And we may have to do that to save the
company. But we really don't want to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rush said: ``I believe these events are in the public
domain. I want to capture the sporting life style.'' He said that
to eliminate the sports star from his paintings ``would sterilize
and dilute the image'' of what he was creating.
</P>
<P>
   Not all artists agree with Rush's view. Neiman said that star
athletes should share in any profits the artist earns, even if it
was a small share.
</P>
<P>
   Neiman, who recently commanded $7,500 for a signed, sealed and
framed limited-edition serigraph of Mark McGwire, says he obtains
permission from his subjects. ``In the one of Mark McGwire hitting
a home run,'' he said, ``we had the official approval of the team,
the league, the player. Each gets a small percentage. I believe in
that. Why should an artist just looking for a hot market do
something without having an arrangement? The player is entitled to
a cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is he? Under all circumstances? That's what the court must
decide _ unless escalating legal costs force Jireh to settle.

SELF-PROCLAIMED COMPUTER GEEKS HOLD `WINDOWS REFUND DAY' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change company name in 7th graf from Micron Computer to
Micron Electronics. No other changes.) (Eds: See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As mass movements go, Windows Refund Day might not have achieved
the political profile of an anti-war protest or the popular support
of, say, saving the whales. But for a demonstration over computer
software, the turnout Monday was not too shabby.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 self-proclaimed computer geeks showed up at
Microsoft Corp. sales offices in several cities to make a public
display of rejecting the software maker's ubiquitous Windows
operating system and of demanding their money back.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by advocates of Linux, a free operating system, the
first March on Microsoft focused on a clause in the Windows license
included with the software that comes installed on personal
computers. That clause states that users who do not agree to the
terms of the license can request a refund.
</P>
<P>
   ``People pay extra money for software they don't need, they
don't want and they're entitled to return,'' said Rick Moen, a
protest organizer in Foster City, Calif., where the largest crowd
gathered on the roof of a parking garage adjacent to the Microsoft
sales office there.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials who met the protesters told them to take it
up with the computer manufacturers who sold them their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But several testimonials published on the Internet in recent
months recount the difficulties users have encountered in obtaining
a refund for Windows, which runs on more than 90 percent of all new
personal computers sold throughout the world. For instance, most
new machines are set up to boot Windows automatically when a user
turns them on. And in a classic Catch-22, that in itself apparently
constitutes an implied acceptance of the license, even though there
is no way to get rid of the Windows operating system without
turning the computer on in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Dell Computer and Micron Electronics, two of the
major manufacturers, said their policy was to give refunds within
30 days to customers who are not satisfied with their systems, but
they said they did not give refunds for Windows alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do customers, with very rare exceptions, expect their
computer to come with an operating system, but they, with very rare
exceptions, expect that operating system to be Windows,'' said T.R.
Reid, a Dell spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   It is not as though the refund would pay for a new monitor. The
few who have reported success have apparently received between $25
and $50. But protesters insisted that the point was not the money
but choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a lot of money,'' said Mike Schiraldi, 20, who wore a
faded Atari T-shirt and black Keds sneakers to the small
demonstration in midtown Manhattan Monday. ``It's just the idea
that you're forced to buy Windows when there are better
alternatives out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, that perception supports a central point the
Microsoft defense team is trying to make in the company's
continuing antitrust battle with the Department of Justice. Company
executives have several times pointed to the growing popularity of
Linux as proof that contrary to the Justice Department's claims,
Microsoft is not a monopoly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That may be why the company deputized several executives and
public relations representatives to meet the demonstrators with
open arms. In New York and Foster City, demonstrators were handed a
letter that began, ``Dear Valued Customer'' and emphasized that
``fundamentally you, the consumer, have a choice of operating
systems and PCs.''
</P>
<P>
   But the protest organizers also aimed to bring to the public's
attention other of Microsoft business practices. A 1995 consent
decree between the Justice Department and Microsoft prohibited the
company from requiring computer manufacturers to pay for Windows on
every computer sold whether or not the operating system had been
installed.
</P>
<P>
   But even without that requirement, critics assert that the
company continues to use its market clout to ensure that nearly all
new personal computers come with Windows pre-installed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't have the knowledge to understand what
Microsoft is doing,'' said Jordan Coleman, president of NetMonger,
an Internet service provider on Long Island. ``We know there are
technically superior choices. So for us, it's a cause.''
</P>
<P>
   In Foster City, protesters carried signs reading ``Pro-choice?''
and ``What part of `refund' don't you understand?'' One protester
shouted, ``Let my people free.'' Protesters who tried to get to
Microsoft's ninth-floor offices in Foster City found the elevators
blocked.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, fewer than a dozen computer users with an aversion
to Microsoft products met a representative outside the World Wide
Plaza on Eighth Avenue before retreating to a hotel room across the
street to install free software on new computers in preparation for
a refund request. About a dozen protesters gathered at Microsoft
offices in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reports were sketchier from New Zealand, the Netherlands and
Japan, where demonstrations had also been planned.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody got a refund.
</P>
<P>
   But by one measure, the protest might have been a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm interested in the whole idea of not having any one company
control the operating system market,'' said Peter Lehrer, a
39-year-old accountant who drove in from Leonia, N.J., to attend
the New York event. A Windows user, Lehrer is considering
switching: ``I just wanted to see what this was all about.''

MAYFAIR HOPING TO RECAPTURE MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What can an early-season win on the PGA Tour do
for you? There are the benefits of the winner's check, but for
Billy Mayfair, a win at last year's Nissan Open (in nearby
Valencia) had a lot more effect than just financial.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair capitalized on his playoff win over Tiger Woods at the
1998 Nissan to have one of his best seasons. Now he's looking to
defend his championship beginning Thursday at the Riviera Country
Club, which will host the tournament for the 35th time in its
73-year history of what used to be called the Los Angeles Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different course, so I don't think Billy has much of an
advantage,'' said Scott McCarron, who challenged eventual champion
Nick Faldo into the final round the last time the Nissan was played
at Riviera, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he is defending champion and that makes you walk a little
bit lighter on your toes that week.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair would agree to that. He floated confidently through the
rest of the season after his '98 Nissan victory _ one made more
memorable by the fact he held off long-hitting Woods in a playoff
on a par-5 hole.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair rode that confidence to his best year since 1995, adding
a win at the Buick Open and posting five top-10 finishes while
earning $1,281,685 for his second-highest season total in 10 full
years on tour. He had earned nearly $1 million less the year before
his win at Valencia and had not won in 27 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always a thrill when you win, but when you don't win for
a couple of years, it's a much nicer win,'' he said. ``Coming the
way that I won (getting into a playoff with a birdie on his final
hole of regulation) helped Billy Mayfair a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of got my game form back and I beat Tiger in a playoff,
then just went on and played pretty solid the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from last year and in '95, when he won the Tour
Championship and ranked No. 2 on the final money list, the former
Arizona State star was more famous for what he accomplished before
his pro career or before a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair gave indications of his pro potential in 1986 when he
won the U.S. Public Links championship. The next year he added a
U.S. Amateur title and was named college Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Mayfair and Tammy McIntire were married on the 18th
green at TPC at Las Colinas, prior to the Byron Nelson Classic in
Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be spending most of our lives on golf
courses,'' he explained at the time. ``We thought we might as well
be married on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, it wouldn't be the final Mayfair family get-together
on an 18th green. Last year at Valencia, Tammy brought along
Rottweiler pups Dallas and Tulsa _ ``our kids,'' said Mayfair _ for
the celebration after Billy held off Tiger in the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Tammy went home at the turn and got them and we kept
them in one of the tents, just in case,'' Mayfair said. ``They
seemed to have a good time out there on the green. Daddy was out of
breath _ he didn't know what to do _ but they were having a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair won't enter this week breathless, except maybe for the
anticipation. He sat out the last two tournaments resting up for
the Nissan and next week's World Match Play Championship at La
Costa.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Riviera still carrying the confidence he won last
year at Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing was I knew I could win again,'' he said.
``Right now, I'm swinging at it so well, I'm putting so good that
if I hit a bad shot or bad drive, I'm not letting it bother me. I'm
not trying to change anything. . . . I'm not worried about it, I
just go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's kind of the difference from when you're struggling a
little bit. If you hit one bad shot, you want to change
something.''
</P>
<P>

nothing changes this week besides the venue.

FIREARMS TRAINING QUESTIONED AFTER POLICE SLAYING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Pa., Calif., N.H.)  (See related NY-SUSPECT-SHOT, NY-SUSPECT-DIAZ)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time was, firearms training for police officers was
all about how to shoot. Now, it increasingly focuses on when to
shoot _ and when not to.
</P>
<P>
   But even as police academies in New York and across the nation
spend more hours and energy on tactics, using interactive videos as
well as role-playing exercises, officers are still formally judged
only on their marksmanship. They win qualification to carry weapons
based on their scores in target practice, not their performance
under pressure in training exercises designed to test
decision-making skills.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal Feb. 4 shooting of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed West
African immigrant, by four police officers has renewed calls among
police critics and black and Latino leaders to improve the training
in firearms use, with a particular emphasis on how the city's
cultural diversity should fit into officers' split-second choices
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is not the shooting, the problem is who they're
shooting,'' said Officer Charles Billups, an 18-year veteran of the
Police Department who heads a statewide group of black officers,
the Grand Council of Guardians. ``Proper firearms training is
knowing when to draw the gun or to keep it holstered, and they
don't get enough of that.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the goal of video simulators like that used by Firearms
Training Systems, a company that provides training programs to 450
law enforcement agencies, including the New York department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absolute worst thing you can have in a no-shoot situation
is an accurate shooter,'' noted Steve Higgins, a former director of
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, who now works at the
firearms training company, which is based in Suwanee, Ga. ``This
has taken training to whether or not you should be shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   When law enforcement experts here and around the nation were
asked in interviews last week to isolate the tenets of arms
training, they struggled to get beyond the generalizations of their
manuals. The policies are written in strong, simple language _ in
New York, for example, officers are told to shoot only as a ``last
resort'' and only enough to stop a threat. But that leaves a lot of
room for interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   What does it take to stop a threat? Can a suspect be stopped
without being killed? As the number of bullets fired at Diallo _ 41
_ is repeated across the city in incredulous conversations, police
experts cannot even agree on whether it is realistic to expect
officers to pause after a few rounds rather than empty their
16-bullet clips.
</P>
<P>
   Firearms training, in New York and elsewhere, starts at the
police academy and continues throughout officers' careers.
</P>
<P>
   New York rookies get 10 days of training in firearms and tactics
during their seven months at the academy. That is less than the 90
hours provided for the state police but about average nationally,
several experts said. Officers then get informal training in their
precincts, and a day of seminars twice yearly when they are tested
again in the use of their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Some departments test officers every month (Los Angeles does so
quarterly) but others require requalification just once a year,
experts said. And by and large, requalification tests only measure
the accuracy of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the scores do is test your mechanical ability to hit the
target,'' said James Fyfe, a criminologist at Temple University.
``The more ephemeral stuff is encouraging officers to approach
situations in a more careful way. I don't know how you can test for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the New York Police Department, when officers are transferred
to undercover assignments like the Street Crimes Unit that was
involved in the Diallo shooting, they attend a special three-day
workshop that includes some firearms and tactics review. An
additional two-day firearms training unit for street crime officers
is being designed and, in the days since the shooting, the unit has
had extra training sessions before each shift.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our training is very dynamic,'' said Marilyn Mode, the
department's chief spokeswoman. ``We're always looking at different
things to see how we can improve.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 10-day course in weapons use at a firing range,
police academy recruits spend half the time on shooting
fundamentals and reviewing the law and policy on deadly force, and
in firing exercises using 600 rounds of live ammunition. The other
five days are devoted to tactics. Two of those days are given to
the Firearms Training Systems simulator, which uses a
laser-equipped gun and an interactive video to imitate dangerous
situations. In addition, they fire 350 more rounds and take a trip
through what officers call the ``fun house,'' a mock tenement
building filled with surprises that present rookies with common
``shoot/don't shoot'' choices.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``fun house,'' in a large, hangar-like building just off
the main shooting range, yellowed newspaper clippings taped to the
walls tell of police officers killed in the line of duty;
instructors tell students they are trying to keep the collection of
clippings from growing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the building, trainers act out harrowing scenes by
playing innocent citizens and vicious thugs, harmless junkies and
murderous kingpins. The scenes are crafted to make the students
anxious, and they are often more ambiguous than the situations
described in the department's Patrol Guide.
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental message is simple: Shoot only when life is
threatened, and then only enough to stop the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should shoot when they think their life is in danger, but
that may differ: I may shoot before you shoot,'' said Ron McCarthy,
a firearms consultant based in California who is familiar with New
York's training program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things that are boilerplate, like a deadly force
policy, like the law, and all of those are mitigated by
circumstances,'' McCarthy said. ``And then there's an intangible.
You can be right by the law, and right by the policy, but deep down
inside know that you could resolve this without firing a shot.
That's the ethics thing, that's the personal character, what you
only see when nobody else is looking.''
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, New York officers were taught to shoot to kill;
later, the instructions were changed to aim at ``central mass,''
the torso. Now it is ``shoot to stop,'' which is intended to be
more restrained, but is also more vague.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Bratton, the first police commissioner in the
Giuliani administration, said in an interview that officers should
fire several bullets and then reassess the threat. But others say
that is unrealistic in the rapid-fire world of semiautomatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not Picasso,'' said Aaron Rosenthal, a retired New York
officer who now teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice.
``You don't paint and then step back to admire your work.''

 NEW YORK: your work.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If officers are mistaken in their perception of threat, not
pausing can result in a barrage of bullets like the 41 fired at
Diallo; if the threat is real, pausing can be deadly to the
officers.
</P>
<P>
   New York's policy on the use of force goes beyond state law and
is more restrictive than that of the FBI, forbidding officers to
fire from or at moving vehicles, to sound warning shots, or to
shoot at a fleeing felon. National experts praised both New York's
policies and its training regimen as a model for the nation,
although several noted that it is difficult for the department to
find the time and money to keep its huge force of about 40,000
officers in top form.
</P>
<P>
   The department's live firing range accommodates only 150
officers at a time, and the department has only a half-dozen
Firearms Training Systems machines, which cost about $80,000 each.
With large academy classes of 2,000 recruits, ``the logistics of
training them is a nightmare,'' Fyfe said.
</P>
<P>
   Expanded training in other areas, such as the diversity of an
urban population, has eaten into the budget and time available for
training in traditional areas, such as firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have suggested that cultural issues be included
more directly in the firearms training. If a person does not
respond to commands like ``Show me your hands,'' for example, they
suggest that the person may not be able to understand English.
</P>
<P>
   Others have criticized the videos for presenting negative
stereotypes of members of minority groups, and for not including
situations common in New York, such as high-rise apartment
buildings, subways and crowded streets. (The department and the
training company are at work on a video that is specific to New
York.)
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement experts say the best training is just running
officers through as many situations as possible, so right and wrong
decisions can be internalized and recalled instinctively when
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more about software than hardware,'' said Massad F.
Ayoob, a police officer in New Hampshire who heads the firearms and
deadly force committee of the American Society of Law Enforcement
Trainers. ``We educate the brain before the trigger finger.''

WINDSWEPT FIRE AT CHURCH KILLS THREE FIREFIGHTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN and BILL TEETER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Texas _ The roof of a small, blazing church crashed
onto three firefighters Monday, burying and killing them in the
flaming debris as others scrambled off the collapsing structure.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ two off-duty Fort Worth firefighters working with
suburban volunteer fire departments _ were found about an hour
later at the rear of the gutted church, not far from the sanctuary
and pulpit of the Precious Faith Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Four other firefighters were injured, none seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 3 p.m., mourning colleagues doffed their helmets
as the bodies of Brian Collins, 35, Phillip Dean, 29, and Garry
Sanders, 20, were carried from the smoldering ruins. Collins and
Dean, close friends who once worked at the same station in Fort
Worth, both leave pregnant wives.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of, if not the, worst disasters for firefighters in
Tarrant County history.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the fire apparently started in a wood-frame
storage building built onto the church at 3204 Roberts Cut Off
northwest of Fort Worth and spread into the attic. No cause had
been determined, but an arson-trained dog was sniffing through the
debris Monday night for possible accelerants.
</P>
<P>
   Fire marshals and arson investigators, including agents from the
U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, also were scouring
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which the wind-swept blaze went from fairly
routine to deadly _ just seconds _ cast a palpable pall over the
men and women in bunker gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing is always in the back of your mind when you
go,'' volunteer firefighter Herbert Cartwright said, sitting on the
side of his red truck and coughing from smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the fire hall at suburban River Oaks was crowded
with counselors, ministers, firefighters and their families. To
give the volunteers some time off, other area fire departments
agreed to cover emergency responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just grief-stricken right now,'' said Chris Martin,
a firefighter and paramedic with the River Oaks department.
</P>
<P>
   Of the injured firefighters, two remained in the burn unit at
Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. They were identified as Joe
Hamilton Jr., 24, and Andrew Ailara, 29. Both were in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two others were treated at area hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials did not explain why firefighters entered the
church to battle the blaze, which was visible to witnesses who
stepped outside about 10:45 a.m. as the first fire trucks arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Worth Lt. Kent Worley said the wind, with gusts to 30
mph, was likely a major factor in the flames' rapid spread. Fifteen
minutes after the first crews arrived, the roof caved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears from looking at the building that the fire got up
into the attic and the wind pushed it through the attic very
quickly,'' Worley said. ``The roof came down on them very quickly,
probably at the moment they were going to change tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   As two crews of volunteer firefighters rolled up to the church,
dense smoke poured from the building and flames were slightly
visible, Cartwright said. A 17-year volunteer, he was among
firefighters who went into the church through a back door, spraying
water, while another crew burst into the front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``pitch black'' inside, and even over the roar of fire
and water, he said he heard the roof begin to give way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the beams beginning to let go'' and men
scrambled for the exits, dragging water hoses as they went,
Cartwright said.
</P>
<P>
   When Cartwright emerged, his jacket had begun to curl from the
heat, and all he had left of the fire hose was the nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky is all,'' he said, rubbing his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people from the surrounding neighborhood and two strip
shopping centers watched in horror as the roof began to buckle with
firefighters on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were five or six of them up there cutting holes in the
roof,'' said David Simpson, owner of DFW Electronics, down the
street from the church. ``You could just watch the roof begin to
fold in and guys jumping off.''
</P>
<P>
   Belinda Hart of Massage from the Hart store said the fire was so
immense that heat from the fire hit her like an oven blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flames were billowing and the smoke was covering the sky,''
Hart said. ``The firefighter was on the roof with his hatchet. Next
thing I knew, the ceiling collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful. I could see the guy hanging on with his hands.
It was just so amazing to think he could have lost his life, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Another witness, Charity Emanuel, 19, said she saw the
firefighter clinging to the roof, flames licking around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His buddy just turned around and pulled him up over the
edge,'' Emanuel said.
</P>
<P>
   MORE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lt. J.R. Whiteside, a fire training instructor with the Fort
Worth Fire Department, said ``truss roof'' buildings like the
church are ``the most dangerous structures'' that firefighters
face.
</P>
<P>
   Like many churches, auditoriums and other buildings without
interior load-bearing walls, the church had a roof supported by
lightweight wooden trusses, he said. If one truss or connecting
plate fails, the whole roof comes down, pulling down with it the
exterior walls to which the trusses are bolted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trusses kill firemen more than anything else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two nearby businesses were transformed into makeshift grieving
and counseling areas for families and firefighters. They were
operated by Fort Worth's critical incident caseworkers and American
Red Cross volunteer counselors.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a lieutenant and 14-year veteran in Fort Worth, and
Dean, who was recently promoted to engineer after six years on the
force, had completed their regular shifts and were off just a
couple of hours when they responded as suburban volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Collins often dressed as a clown as part of the department's
``Learn Not to Burn'' campaign, teaching children at elementary
schools, festivals and other venues about the dangers of fire. He
had been a suburban volunteer for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, a Sunday School teacher at Trinity Baptist Church, had
been a volunteer in the suburbs for more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were about to become fathers _ Collins for the third
time, Dean the first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Collins and Dean were family guys who loved the fire
department,'' said Fort Worth Capt. Steve Beasley, who had worked
with both for several years at Station 16 in west Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths were the area's first multiple firefighter fatalities
in more than a decade, when Dallas firefighters Ed
Metters.MDBR/.MDNM/ and Charles Rogers.MDBR/.MDNM/ died battling a
blaze at the Hunt oil mansion on Aug. 21, 1981, said Denny Burris,
.MDBR/.MDNM/chaplain for the Dallas department.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ President Clinton said on Monday that Hillary
Rodham Clinton would be a ``terrific'' senator from New York,
adding his praise to a growing Democratic clamor for Mrs. Clinton
to run for the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a decision she'll have to make,'' the president said,
after a reporter asked if he would encourage her to run. ``She'd be
great if she did it.''
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that that the idea had not occurred to Mrs. Clinton
before ``a lot of people started calling'' and urging her to seek
the seat of Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``For reasons I'm sure you'll understand,'' Clinton said in an
apparent allusion to his impeachment trial, ``she hasn't had
anything like adequate time to talk to the people who think she
should do this, much less people who think perhaps she shouldn't. I
mean, she just hasn't had time to deal with this.''
</P>
<P>
   With the trial behind him, Clinton, publicly cheerful and at
ease during a 24-hour working visit to this colonial city in the
Yucatan, seemed happy to fan speculation about the futures of him
and his wife after he leaves the office he has been fighting so
fiercely to keep. ``She and I both would like to continue to be
useful in public affairs when we leave office,'' Clinton said. Mrs.
Clinton did not comment on her plans.
</P>
<P>
   From a wispy notion planted by the chairman of the Democratic
Sen- atorial Campaign Committee, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jer-
sey, and embraced a few New York Democrats, the prospect that Mrs.
Clinton might run for the Senate has sprouted into full speculative
bloom. On Sunday, Moynihan spoke glowingly about Mrs. Clinton's
``magnificent, young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Monday, Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is dean of the
state's congressional delegation, said he was ``very excited'' by
Clinton's remarks. ``Politically, we have pulled together an offer
that the first lady can't refuse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Mrs. Clinton had been assured that she would have
no opposition in the primary and that she would have the support of
the Democratic Party and organized labor. Further, he said, major
New York donors have called Mrs. Clinton to say that they would
back her bid for office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, it's a question of will,'' said Rangel, who is
a member of the official delegation here. ``She's been through so
much that if she decided it would be too much, nobody should lean
on her just because it would be good for our state and our
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel did not elaborate on the nature of the assurances that no
other Democrat would enter the race. But Judith Hope, the state
party chairwoman, described Rangel's remarks as ``a figure of
speech'' and said he was not describing ``any kind of official or
formal process.'' But Mrs. Hope, who has repeatedly encouraged Mrs.
Clinton to enter the race, said Monday night night that ``it is
more clear to me now than it has been that she is in fact giving
this quite serious consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, who is also part of the
delegation, said he discussed the possibility of a Senate race with
Mrs. Clinton on Sunday night. ``She seemed very serious,'' he said.
``She said everybody tells her, `You could win this thing.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also met on Friday with Harold Ickes, a White House
adviser who has long been active in New York politics, in part to
discuss the Senate race, Ickes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who returned to Washington Monday evening with her
husband, has never held elective office, and as first lady, she has
spoken longingly of her wish for a ``zone of privacy'' around her
family. Instead, her hairstyles have been critiqued, her billing
records as an Arkansas lawyer scrutinized, and her steadfast
loyalty to her husband lampooned. Reporters monitor her every move
_ did she take her husband's hand? did she move out from under his
encircling arm? _ for signs of marital peace or discord. She does
not like that at all, friends say.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons do not own a home. To register to vote, they have
used the Little Rock address of Dorothy Rodham, Mrs. Clinton's
mother.
</P>
<P>
   For a Senate race in New York, Mrs. Clinton would have to
establish residency there and determine how to balance campaigning
with her extensive duties as first lady. She would almost certainly
face a full-time and well-financed Republican opponent, possibly
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. She plans to decide whether to run soon,
officials say, to avoid unnecessarily interfering with other
potential Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior White House aides seem baffled by the Clintons'
interest in a possible race for Senate and express surprise that
they have not dismissed the idea. They predict that Mrs. Clinton
will ultimately decide not to run.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the president, White House officials dodged comment
on the subject on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But as the speculative bubble grows, few senior public
officials, in or out of the administration, can avoid being asked
for their opinion of Mrs. Clinton's plans _ whatever they may be.
It was the first question put on Monday to Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright, when she tried to brief reporters on the
multitude of incremental agreements on fighting drugs, controlling
illegal immigration and snuffing out forest fires that Clinton
reached here with President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton is a fantastic human being, and anyone who knows
her knows that she would be a great public servant,'' Ms. Albright
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite her qualms about the spotlight, Mrs. Clinton, who has
become resoundingly popular nationally, clearly relishes her
influence on policy.
</P>
<P>
   After her public approval ratings collapsed over the failure of
her plan to remake the health care system, Mrs. Clinton retreated
from the aggressive role she had played at the start of the
administration. She still wielded great influence on a wide variety
of issues behind the scenes, but in public she kept a lower profile
as she pushed for better education and child care and a more
innovative approach to foreign development.
</P>
<P>
   The public overwhelmingly approved of Mrs. Clinton's decision to
stand by her husband after he was accused of an affair with Monica
S. Lewinsky and after he admitted that the accusations were true.
</P>
<P>
   On this trip to Mexico _ where the Clintons' honeymooned (in the
company of Mrs. Rodham) 24 years ago, as the president recalled
today _ they have been all smiles and clasped hands. On Sunday,
they even made an extremely rare appearance in the rear cabin of
Air Force One. Mrs. Clinton wore a gold heart-shaped pin that she
said the president had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a better kind of heart of darkness,'' the president
said as he dispensed Valentine's Day chocolate from a giant
heart-shaped box in his hands.

ANIMATOR LEAVING HOME OF `SIMPSONS,' OTHERS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Phil Roman, founder and chairman of Film Roman,
has resigned from his struggling animation studio after 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Roman and his company, best known as home to
Bart, Homer and the rest of ``The Simpsons'' family for the past
eight years, gave no reason for the departure when it was announced
Friday evening. The company was closed Monday for Presidents Day.
</P>
<P>
   Roman's departure ends a four-decade-plus career that included
25 Emmy nominations, six Emmys and the creation of a company that
employs more than 200 people. Film Roman currently supplies the
animation for a quartet of TV shows _ ``The Simpsons,'' ``King of
the Hill,'' ``Family Guy'' and ``The Downtowners'' _ and is
developing ``Johnny Tsunami,'' a two-hour movie for the Disney
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   But the North Hollywood-based company has never been able to
turn a profit since it went public in late 1996. Film Roman sold
$33 million of stock at $10 a share but investors quickly became
skeptical of its goal to convert from a fee-for-service specialist
to a studio owning its cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   The company began bleeding red ink because its properties were
unable to draw high enough prices to make up for production costs.
Additionally, TV networks were squeezed financially as their
audiences became increasingly fragmented.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, which has traded between $1.50 and $3.50 this year,
closed Friday at $2.25, down 18.75cents.
</P>
<P>
   Roman grew up near Fresno in a family that picked crops for a
living. Inspired by The Walt Disney Co.'s ``Bambi,'' he came to Los
Angeles in 1949 with $60 in his pocket and began taking classes in
animation, then broke into the business in 1955 by working on
Disney's ``Sleeping Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   After working on a wide variety of animation jobs, Roman opened
his own company in 1984 with two employees in Toluca Lake and saw
his first production, ``Garfield in the Rough,'' win an Emmy. The
company gained national prominence in 1991 when it took over
production of ``The Simpsons'' and also produced ``The Critic,''
``C-Bear and Jamal,'' ``Bruno the Kid,'' ``The Mask,'' ``The
Twisted Tales of Felix the Cat,'' ``CRO,'' ``Richie Rich'' and
``Bobby's World.''
</P>
<P>
   Roman was replaced in August 1997 as chief executive officer by
industry veteran David Pritchard in an attempt to regain investor
confidence, but the stock has never reached $4 since then. In the
last nine months of 1998, the company lost $3.95 million on
revenues of $22.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Pritchard said, ``Phil is a unique talent and
the impact he has made on the world of animated entertainment
speaks for itself. We have every intention to continue with the
creative passion he instilled in everyone who worked with him.''

TURNER RETURNING ALBERT TO TV FOR NBA GAMES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marv Albert's comeback from a season in exile received its
latest boost Monday when Turner Sports hired him to announce
National Basketball Association games for TNT and TBS beginning in
April. He is scheduled to call six regular-season games starting in
April and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Albert was unemployed last season after being fired by NBC and
resigning from MSG Network after he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
assault charge for biting a woman during a sexual encounter in a
Virginia hotel room. He returned to work last September, when MSG
hired him to be host of its ``SportsDesk'' program and to call New
York Knicks games on WFAN radio.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, it was believed that Turner was interested in
hiring Albert. But the first meeting with him did not come until
last month. His MSG work will take precedence over his Turner
schedule, and the number of playoff games he calls will hinge on
how far the Knicks advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've followed his progress in his personal and professional
life,'' said Mike Pearl, the executive producer of Turner Sports.
``His name was cleared by the courts and he's taken care of his
personal situation. We did some research, checked with MSG and
everything was positive.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``I'd be lying if I said there wouldn't be some
negative reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert, NBC's lead NBA voice for seven seasons, said: ``It's
thrilling to do the game on a national level. I'd hoped that
something like this would take place, but it's just wonderful that
it took place at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert will be in Turner's NBA play-by-play rotation with Kevin
Harlan, Dick Stockton and Bob Neal; Neal's games will be reduced to
accommodate Albert. In addition to NBA games, Albert will call
boxing, 2001 Goodwill Games events and pro football if a league
planned by Turner and NBC comes to life.

RODMAN: UNSIGNED, UNSEALED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Dennis Rodman might one day be a Laker _
maybe even today _ but the past few days have proven that when it
comes to the Worm, nothing is certain, or predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Various reports had the seven-time rebounding champion due to
sign over the weekend, but it never happened. Sunday night, unnamed
sources told the Associated Press that Rodman could sign Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen either. A source close to the situation told
the Daily News that Rodman is expected to sign a deal with the
Lakers today. The source added that everyone associated with the
matter is taking Rodman's apparent intentions with a few thousand
grains of salt because, simply, ``Dennis will do whatever Dennis
wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, team officials again denied that Rodman has agreed to
anything and insisted nothing was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   No Rodman sightings, no Rodman signing, no nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, what he wants to do is drag out the process and
maximize his publicity, since there are no negotiations to conduct.
The Lakers can only offer a prorated version of the $1 million
veterans minimum, or about $12,195 per game _ that's $536,585 if he
signs now, and of course less with every game he isn't in uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Even players are treating Rodman's supposed interest with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard he's coming,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``But I don't
like to get my hopes up high until it happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I know as much as you guys know,'' he said.
``I wake up every morning and go though the same ritual. I read the
articles that you write. The other day it said, `Rodman chooses
Lakers.' I thought he was coming. I'm not sure now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coach Del Harris, already coping with endless roster
uncertainties caused by injury and illness, wants the matter
resolved this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping,'' he said. ``Hopefully we can settle and be who
we're supposed to be and commit to one another and say, `Hey this
is our team and we're going to make things happen in a very
positive manner for ourselves.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rodman's arrival would probably knock Robert Horry out of the
starting power-forward slot and potentially knock a player off the
roster entirely. Add that to the persistent rumor that Elden
Campbell and Eddie Jones will be traded to Charlotte for Glen Rice
once Rice is healthy, and it's clear the Lakers (3-3) are swimming
in uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it does weigh on our players a little bit,'' Harris
said. ``It's not the best situation, where you feel like you have a
good team and yet so many of the players think that maybe they're
going to be (traded) or replaced in some way. I want our guys to
know the likelihood of changing is minimal and that it's just the
nature of the beast. And that we can't use that for any kind of
excuse for not playing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to us, no matter what is being said, to perform to our
utmost. Our guys are good enough players, they should have
confidence in their own abilities and not worry about what people
might be saying.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are mostly tuning out the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't talked about it that much,'' guard Derek
Fisher said. ``Nobody in the front office has come to us and said
these rumors are true, so as far as we're concerned, he's not part
of the team. It's not our position to assume (anything).''
</P>
<P>
   But is it a distraction?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Fisher said, ``our distraction is losing games.''

A WITNESS TO A SMEAR: `WHO LOST CHINA?'
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Md., W.Va.)  (Eds., also filed in `i' category) 
(fb) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur W. Hummel Jr. is far from China these days, but it is
never far from his mind. The living room walls of his modest
red-brick house in Chevy Chase, Md., are covered with the delicate
screens and placid clay figurines he collected in China first as a
child, then as a teacher, then as an unlikely soldier and finally
as U.S. ambassador from 1981 to 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The hum of nearby traffic is muffled by a thick stand of bamboo
he planted alongside his driveway, and he is hard at work
translating into English the memoirs of a Nationalist Chinese
guerrilla leader.
</P>
<P>
   With the death this month of John S. Service _ the first of the
so-called ``China hands'' falsely accused of being Communist
sympathizers and driven from the State Department in the 1950s _
Hummel, 79, took an afternoon last week to recall an era when his
long career as a China specialist was just beginning and he watched
paranoia and demagoguery prematurely end the careers of so many
others.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fate that struck closer to home for Hummel than for
many of his young colleagues. His life before coming to the State
Department closely mirrored that of Service and a handful of other
China experts whose careers were destroyed. Though about a decade
younger, he too was born in China, the child of missionary parents,
with a knowledge of the language and culture much deeper than that
of his superiors in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hummel joined the State Department in 1950, the year that North
Korea invaded South Korea. It was also the year that Sen. Joseph
McCarthy stood up in Wheeling, W.Va., and first announced that he
had a list of 205 people ``known to the secretary of state as being
members of the Communist Party and still working and shaping the
policy of the State Department.''
</P>
<P>
   The climate at Foggy Bottom then was one of circled wagons, but
a growing sense of bewilderment and anger, he recalled. ``There was
very little paranoia among those you worked with because everyone
felt like it was us against them,'' he said. In fact, one of
Hummel's first jobs was helping Oliver Edmund Clubb, another of the
accused China hands, compile documents for his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we all discussed it a lot,'' Hummel said. ``Where is it
going to go next? What kind of idiocy can right-wingers be
perpetrating next _ maybe domestically, and not just foreign
affairs?''
</P>
<P>
   Personally, Hummel had little to worry about. He had an
anti-Communist credential that even McCarthy would have had trouble
tarnishing: during World War II, for 15 months, he had actually
fought against both the Chinese Communists and the Japanese with a
column of Nationalist Chinese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In his low, gravelly voice, Hummel does his best to play down
any heroic Hemingway plot lines. At that point in his life, during
his early 20s, he said, he was simply trying to find anything to
occupy his time and ``get my parents off my back.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been born in Shanxi province, west of Beijing, where his
father _ a noted Sinologist and later head of the Oriental book
division of the Library of Congress _ was then a Congregationalist
minister. The family returned to the United States when Hummel was
8, and he struggled for a sense of belonging. He said he was kicked
out of two prep schools and dropped out (``well, actually, flunked
out'') of Antioch College. He then lived as a self-described
``early hippy,'' working a series of odd jobs _ including factory
worker and detective _ before agreeing to go back to China in 1940
to help his father on a book-buying trip.
</P>
<P>
   But his father ended up not going, and on the day the Japanese
invaded Pearl Harbor, Hummel was rounded up and locked in an
internment camp along with about 2,000 other foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no way,'' he explained, ``to ask the Japanese
kindly, `Would you let me go home?''' So he and a British friend
engineered an escape with the help of Nationalist guerrillas
concealed nearby. He crawled over barbed-wire and walked most of
the night and the next day.
</P>
<P>
   He was 20 and had no military training. But he was handed a
small Belgian pistol, and he had little choice but to stay and
help, harassing Japanese patrols by night and trying to defend a
small patch of land against a communist takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why, but I really cannot remember being scared,''
he said. ``It all seemed like great fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after McCarthy's fall, Hummel said he liked to joke that
he ``was too small a fish for him to be interested in, but if he
had ever hauled me up for a hearing, I would have said, `I was
fighting Chinese communist troops in 1944. Where were you,
senator?''' Through his experience, though, he learned of the
corruption of the Nationalist leadership, which later became the
refrain of Service and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back now, Hummel said perhaps the only shortcoming of
many of those drummed out of the State Department was a lack of
political sophistication. Clubb, for example, read from his diary
during a hearing. McCarthy then subpoenaed the whole diary and
``went through it with a red paintbrush'' to make it appear that
Clubb was disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   As senators only a few miles away wrapped up the impeachment
trial of a president, Hummel recalled those earlier years as a
crisis in government still unlike any he has known. ``We worried
not merely about these people,'' he said, ``but about the whole
apparatus of government. It was a feeling of, `What the hell is
happening?' and `Thank God,' when it was over.''

IN BATTLE OF BAGS, CONFUSION RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Iowa, N.Y., Mo., Kan., Fla., Wash.)  (For release Sunday, Feb. 21.) 
(jw) 
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The airlines are all driven by the same need: to get passengers
aboard smoothly, latch the luggage bins and take off on schedule,
without alienating the customers who are dragging their belongings
aboard. In addition to the unarguable safety problems created by
overloaded luggage bins and obstructed aisles, late flights cost
airlines profits.
</P>
<P>
   But in the domestic-flight carry-on luggage wars, the airlines
are setting varied rules. The results are confusing, and
particularly maddening for the passenger in a rush whose bag is
deemed one too many for the cabin and has to yield it.
</P>
<P>
   The evolving tug-of-war at the boarding gate is partly caused by
passengers' fear of losing checked luggage, a possibility that
increases with the number of connections. Pilfering from luggage is
also a worry. And even if nothing evil happens, there is the
irritating wait for bags at the carousel.
</P>
<P>
   And some people truly cannot check everything: Families with
toddlers must have diapers and bottles on hand, and for speed in
debarking, usually take the opportunity offered by early boarding
to get strollers aboard. Flight attendants may initially let them
pass, but may have to reverse themselves in the crunch. And parents
are not the only ones: Researchers need to keep original materials
in sight; antiques and fragile acquisitions are not always packable
for checking.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight major airlines, four _ Northwest, American, TWA and
Southwest _ fall into a semitough category of enforcing their
carry-on rules but not going out of their way to do so. Continental
and US Airways appear to be the most carry-on-friendly. United and
Delta, both enforcing size rules with templates outside their
security barriers, are the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   The differences are so pronounced that late last year,
Continental _ which is enlarging the luggage bins on 184 MD-80s,
737s and 757s _ sued Delta for what it considered overzealous
enforcement. As it happened, last fall, Gordon Bethune, the chief
executive of Continental, was at the San Diego airport, where his
airline and Delta share a concourse, where Delta had installed its
metal template. Carry-on bags had to fit through the hole _ 9
inches high and 14 inches wide _ and if not, they were taken away
for checking.
</P>
<P>
   Bethune watched as some Continental passengers, unable to get
their bags through, according to David Messing, a Continental
spokesman, ``experienced great frustration.'' Continental, which
has no measurement requirements for carry-ons, then told Delta to
remove the template. When Delta did not, Continental sued on Nov.
24. Two months later, Messing said, Delta took the template down
and Continental dropped its suit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment, Kay Horner, a Delta spokeswoman, said her line
had a policy of saying nothing about the suit, even if it had been
settled. At the end of January, Ms. Horner said that Delta had
templates in place at about 10 airports nationally.
</P>
<P>
   United Airlines is using templates with those same dimensions on
its security machines. According to Joseph Hopkins, a United
spokesman, the first installation was in Chicago in November, after
a test in Los Angeles. They are now in 27 domestic airports, mostly
big ones.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, suitcases with the proper dimensions will not fit
because overpacking makes the soft sides protrude. Hopkins said
passengers had been seen taking out clothes and putting them on, or
stuffing sweatshirts into pockets. Garment bags, the staple of the
business traveler, sometimes go through, he said, but they have to
wrap up pretty snugly to meet the nine-inch requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said that where there were common concourses and
airlines shared the security costs, United got its neighbors to
support the use of templates as a way of speeding planes on their
way.
</P>
<P>
   United also conducted a well-publicized experiment on its
flights out of Des Moines 15 months ago. Passengers who bought the
cheapest coach tickets were limited to one carry-on.
</P>
<P>
   Although first-class and business-class passengers always have
more latitude for stowing luggage, United's test was an opener to a
further refining of the idea that ticket dollars buy better bin
space as well as more leg space. United's effort, not a success,
was quickly ``declared over,'' according to Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its Procrustean bed, United is joining luggage-friendly
Continental in increasing the depth of bins on its 737s by 2.5
inches. This measurement means that four of the wheeled suitcases,
called ``wheelies,'' will go into a bin side by side if the wheels
face outward. Shallower bins will hold only two of these bags end
to end.
</P>
<P>
   The retrofitting will not change United's rule limiting each
passenger to two bags, but it may mean that fewer passengers
boarding at the end of the process will have to check their bags
willy-nilly because the bins are full. The 59 737s used by United
on its West Coast Shuttle will have deeper bins by the end of May,
as will all 182 of its 737s by the end of October, Hopkins said.
</P>
<P>
   When the templates first went up, Hopkins said, there was
considerable tension. ``But as we have settled in, those who fly
frequently have adapted what they carry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other airlines, middle-of-the-road TWA is testing
templates at La Guardia in New York and Kansas City, where,
according to Jim Brown, a spokesman, TWA need not get any other
line's agreement on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Many airline officials concurred with the view that the earlier
in the departure process luggage is measured or counted, the easier
the boarding goes. For that reason, smaller airlines frequently
accede to the big lines' wishes for templates.

<P>
   Northwest Airlines limits its passengers to one carry-on,
although a briefcase, purse or umbrella is permitted in addition.
The seven other lines allow two carry-ons within their specified
dimensions. What else is permitted often depends on size: A purse
of briefcase dimensions may not qualify. Except at Continental and
US Airways, most garment bags are not making the cut in coach.
</P>
<P>
   But these rules are not absolute. On a lightly booked flight,
passengers are welcomed aboard with additional dunnage. On a full
flight _ increasingly common _ airlines with two-bag limits simply
take the second bag away from people waiting to board, especially
toward the end of boarding. On a United flight to Denver last
winter, two agents stood observing the flow into the plane. Behind
their backs, they held batches of luggage tags to pop onto second
carry-ons that they would not allow into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   All the airlines say boarding by row, from the rear forward, is
essential for on-time departure, because it means people are not
squeezing past one another. But they all let their higher-level
frequent-flier members board when they like; TWA calls for them
first. This means that people with 20,000 or 25,000 miles in their
accounts, and the gold or platinum plastic card to prove it, get to
shove their two bags into the bins before the limit is lowered.
</P>
<P>
   American, which described its position on luggage as in the
middle, is not modifying its existing bins, but rather, getting
bigger ones on its new Boeings. Tim Smith, an American spokesman,
was asked about letting its premium frequent-flier members aboard
early. In the summer of 1997, he said, American began to ask its
Aadvantage members to show their cards, which have magnetic
stripes. ``We thought there might be some resentment,'' Smith said,
``but it turned out that the members liked that recognition and it
works well.''
</P>
<P>
   The carry-on issue is causing problems all the way back to the
luggage store. Most purchasers are not going to buy a bag 10 inches
thick when it may have to be pushed through a 9-inch template.
</P>
<P>
   Anne DeCicco, executive vice president of the Luggage and
Leather Good Manufacturers of America, said that all association
members and retailers were now being told that nothing should be
described or sold as a carry-on bag if it exceeded the dimensions
of 22 by 14 by 9 inches, which is known in the trade as a ``45-inch
bag'' because that is what the dimensions add up to.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeCicco's association petitioned the Federal Aviation
Administration in December for a standard carry-on rule to be
applied to all domestic airlines, as did the Association of Flight
Attendants. Both want to take the issue out of competition among
airlines. There has been no response to either, but Margaret
Gilligan, deputy associate administrator of the FAA, said she
believed the carry-on situation was improving anyway because
passengers were being educated by airlines and the media about
limited cabin space.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. DeCicco and Ms. Gilligan scheduled a joint news conference
for Saturday in Orlando, Fla., to press a new campaign: ``Think
small, think smart, think safety.'' Ticket-sized leaflets are to be
distributed by airlines, travel agents, luggage makers and others.
Basically, the message is: Be prepared to give up your luggage on a
crowded flight; be sure prescriptions are in bags that will
absolutely stay with you; don't put heavy bags in the overhead
bins.
</P>
<P>
   An unscientific poll about carry-ons was made by CNN Interactive
on Jan. 11. Fifty-one percent of the 31,469 voters said ``strict
carry-on limits'' would be the best solution to ``the carry-on
crunch.'' A better baggage-check system was favored by 26 percent.
Bigger bins and the same limits got 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (According to Kerrin Roberts, a spokesman, visitors to the Web
site were allowed to vote only once, but otherwise the poll
``cannot be presumed to represent the opinions on Internet users in
general nor the public as a whole.'')
</P>
<P>
   Department of Transportation statistics show that the rate of
``mishandled baggage'' for domestic flights rose in 1998 to 5.16
reports of ``lost, damaged, delayed or pilfered'' bags for each
1,000 passengers, compared with 4.96 for each 1,000 in 1997. Almost
all of the 2.49 million mishandled bags covered by the 1998 reports
_ most estimates say 95 percent _ reach their owners within 36
hours. Most did not make their connections or were sent to the
wrong airport through mislabeling.
</P>
<P>
   A colleague owns a bag that will create two blips in the January
1999 ``delayed'' report. Bound for Berlin on Lufthansa, he was
required to change in Frankfurt. He always checks his bags because
he takes books, magazines and work, heavy items he says he has no
wish to carry through an airport. The plane was too late to make
his Frankfurt connection. He got on a flight to Berlin a few hours
later, but his bags, with the bags of hundreds of others, did not.
</P>
<P>
   His luggage, with the requisite dinner jacket, was delivered to
his hotel the next afternoon, in time for dinner. On the way back,
his flight was late, and although he barely made his connecting
flight, the bag did not. It was delivered to his office a day
later. He said that although he traveled a lot, he had never lost a
bag, and seldom suffered delays.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Reich, a lawyer in the law office of Gerald Lefcourt in
New York, lost a suitcase for good on the way to Seattle last
August, although three others made it safely when all were checked
with United by Ms. Reich, her husband and their infant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reich had a long, fierce correspondence with United, and in
December it paid $1,250 for the lost bag, adding a travel voucher.
``In Seattle for a visit with friends,'' she said, ``and I had to
go shopping for a nursing bra!''
</P>
<P>
   The possibility of this sort of inconvenience is what makes
travelers cling to their carry-ons, but if the airlines keep the
squeeze on, travelers will have to learn to pick and choose better
when they pack.

BEN EDWARDS, 82, BROADWAY SET DESIGNER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ala., Va., Minn., N.C.)   (jw) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ben Edwards, one of the most important and productive
scenic designers on Broadway for more than 50 years, died Friday at
his home in Manhattan. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia associated with lymphoma, said his wife,
costume designer Jane Greenwood.
</P>
<P>
   Distinguished and courtly, Edwards was celebrated for the
striking designs he created for plays by Eugene O'Neill, William
Inge and other American dramatists, as well as for his work with
classics by playwrights including Euripides, Shakespeare and Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   As a designer, he was triply talented, often doing the settings,
lighting and costumes. In recent years, he concentrated on
settings, frequently with his wife as costume designer.
</P>
<P>
   Influenced by Robert Edmond Jones and Jo Mielziner, he was a
master of evocative interiors, creating in fine detail rooms with
diverse atmospheres: the rustic tavern of O'Neill's ``Touch of the
Poet,'' the small-town homeyness of Inge's ``Dark at the Top of the
Stairs'' and the decaying elegance of Henry James' ``Aspern
Papers'' (in Michael Redgrave's adaptation).
</P>
<P>
   With ease and expertise, he could move into the monumental, with
his designs for Robert Whitehead's two productions of ``Medea,'' in
1947 with Judith Anderson and in 1982 with Zoe Caldwell.
</P>
<P>
   As producer and designer, Whitehead and Edwards often worked
together. ``He didn't go for expansive excursions, but had a
modesty and great imagination,'' Whitehead said Monday. ``He gave
great beauty and simplicity to the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   For Edwards the design did not necessarily have to be realistic,
he said, but it ``had to have the truth of the text.''
</P>
<P>
   Designer Robin Wagner once said that Edwards had ``a poetic
vision of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   As a demonstration of his versatility, Edwards created the
emblematic design of Richard Burton's ``rehearsal'' version of
``Hamlet'' and the modular settings for ``A Few Good Men'' by Aaron
Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Edwards was born in Union Springs, Ala. In 1935, he came to
New York to the Feagin School of Dramatic Arts, thinking he might
become an actor. Because he had a talent for drawing, he was
encouraged to become a scenic designer. In 1936, he worked at the
Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va. Two years later he designed five
productions on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Army Air Corps during World War II, he
returned to the theater. Beginning with ``Medea,'' he became one of
the most prolific Broadway designers, working closely with such
directors as Elia Kazan, Jose Quintero and Harold Clurman, and with
stars like Katharine Hepburn, creating the sets for ``A Matter of
Gravity'' and ``West Side Waltz,'' in which she starred.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every year he worked on one or more Broadway plays and
also designed for the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and the
American Shakespeare Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Among the scores of Broadway shows for which he designed the
scenery were ``Time of the Cuckoo,'' ``The Ponder Heart, ``Waltz of
the Toreadors,'' ``A Shot in the Dark,'' ``The Disenchanted,''
``More Stately Mansions,'' ``A Moon for the Misbegotten,'' ``Purlie
Victorious'' and its musical version ``Purlie,'' ``A Texas
Trilogy,'' the Dustin Hoffman revival of ``Death of a Salesman''
and revivals in the late 1980s of ``The Iceman Cometh'' and ``Long
Day's Journey into Night,'' both starring Jason Robards.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the producers and the designer of Hugh Wheeler's
``Big Fish, Little Fish'' and Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson
McCullers' ``Ballad of the Sad Cafe.''
</P>
<P>
   He also did sets for television, many for David Susskind, and
worked in movies, including ``Fort Apache, the Bronx,'' ``Sweet
Liberty'' and ``Lovers and Other Strangers.''
</P>
<P>
   His most recent shows were ``Vita and Virginia'' and the 1996
revival of Herb Gardner's ``Thousand Clowns'' at the Roundabout
Theater Co. Although he was often nominated for Tony awards (as
producer as well as designer), he did not win one until last year
when he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, who lives in Manhattan, he is survived
by two daughters, Sarah of Manhattan, and Katherine of Wilmington,
N.C., and a granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his work process in an interview in Theater Crafts
magazine, Edwards said that he began by concentrating on the
script: ``You read it and you read it and you think about it,'' and
you try not to think about the scenery. From his point of view, the
play dictates the setting and the scenery serves the play. ``And in
serving the play, you must serve the actors,'' he said, explaining
why he paid such attention to detail. Even if the audience did not
notice the detail, the actors would be aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   Colleen Dewhurst, who acted in many plays designed by Edwards,
once said that when ``you walk into whatever atmosphere Ben has
created, you know you are home.''

DRUGS ARE AT TOP OF THE AGENDA AS CLINTON, MEXICO'S ZEDILLO MEET
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERIDA, Mexico _ Standing at center stage of an 18th-century
theater in the heart of this tropical city Monday, Presidents
Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo formally agreed to intensify antidrug
efforts by implementing new ways to measure their progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not long ago, we could not have had a conversation about drugs
without falling into an unwinnable argument about who is to
blame,'' Clinton told an audience of 1,500 people, which included
business leaders, Cabinet members, and legislators from both
countries. ``That has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hinted that he would renew Mexico's ``certification'' as
an ally in the war against drugs by March 1. Failure to win
certification could mean loss of most-favored-nation trading status
and economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The visit marked Clinton's first trip out of the country since
he was acquitted on two impeachment articles on Friday by the
Senate. Asked if he felt vindicated by his acquittal, the president
responded, ``This is the time for reconciliation and renewal. What
we have to do is serve the American people. If we do that, we'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidents, who met for two hours  &UR; yesterday &LR;   &UR; morning  &LR; at a
17th century hacienda in the middle of Mayan ruins outside Merida,
also signed modest agreements related to environmental and health
issues and to increase airline business between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they announced $4 billion in loan guarantees for
Mexican businesses looking to purchase equipment from US firms.
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said the agreement was
important for increasing US exports, which last year increased by
11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the new drug-fighting agreement, Clinton and Zedillo
committed their administrations to following 82 new benchmarks for
determining whether joint efforts along the 1,900-mile US-Mexico
border are successful.
</P>
<P>
   US officials estimate that two-thirds of Colombian cocaine on US
streets crosses Mexican territory. Mexico is also a major producer
of marijuana, opium and amphetamines.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has come under fire recently from US law enforcement
authorities and Republican lawmakers for failing to extradite more
drug suspects and making fewer drug seizures over the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico considers the certification process insulting and blames
much of its drug problems on heavy demand in the United States, but
it has been certified for the last 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although top administration offcials declined  &UR; yesterday &LR;  to say
whether Mexico's certification this year was guaranteed, they
repeatedly praised the country's work. In his address at the
theater, Clinton said the country's efforts have vastly improved
under Zedillo, who recently announced a $500 million drug-fighting
package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico should not be penalized for the courage to confront its
problems,'' Clinton said to applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Zedillo called Clinton ``a sincere friend'' of
Mexico and said his people are ``convinced and determined to keep
up the fight against drugs until we win.''
</P>
<P>
   The new drug-fighting benchmarks are meant to help guide
officials in both governments on their work, but are not meant to
be binding, US officials said. Some of the benchmarks for Mexico
include extraditions and drug seizures, while the US must show how
it is succeeding in reducing demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago we developed this strategy and now we have the
concrete steps on practical ways of cooperating,'' the US drug
policy coordinator, Barry McCaffrey, told reporters in a briefing
after the presidents' speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Both governments also agreed to train Mexico's new federal
police force, which officials said will be modeled after the FBI
and represents a break from traditional, corruption-ridden
departments.
</P>
<P>
   Both presidents repeated their praise of the five-year-old North
American Free Trade Agreement, which they say has created jobs and
economic growth in the United States, Mexico and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo credited the pact with generating $185 billion in
economic activity. A Clinton administration official said
 &UR; yesterday &LR;  that 1 million US jobs now depend on trade with Mexico,
which has overtaken Japan as America's second-largest trading
partner. Canada ranks first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we still have work to do on labor, environmental
and other issues,'' Clinton said. ``But NAFTA has taught us that we
have far more to gain by working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Other bilateral measures that were signed include increased
border safety for immigrants, strategies to reduce border pollution
and tuberculosis infections and an order allowing for increased
commercial air traffic, including joint marketing between airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Following the speech at the Peon Contreras Theater, which was
the only public event for the two presidents, Clinton met with US
diplomats stationed in Mexico before he and Hillary Rodham Clinton
returned to Washington.

BIG SNOWS BRING SPORTSMEN, BUT ALSO DEADLY AVALANCHES 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The global weather pattern known as La Nina has been
credited with helping to bring heavy snowfall to many parts of the
West this winter. But while all the snow has meant excellent
conditions for thousands of skiers, it has brought danger as well,
a fact underscored this weekend by a massive avalanche in the North
Cascade Mountains of Washington state that killed a snowboarder and
swallowed a skier who is missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, avalanches also killed five people in
California, Colorado and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cascades on Sunday, the two men had both ventured into a
wilderness area adjacent to the Mount Baker Ski Area, when a wall
of snow at least 200 yards wide and 15 feet high broke loose above
them, roaring down at speeds of 200 miles per hour, said Gwyn
Howat, a spokeswoman for the operators of the ski area. It is about
90 miles northeast of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche killed 19-year-old Justin M. Parker, of Parkland,
Wash., almost instantly. Sean Riches, 25, of London, Ontario, who
was skiing several hundred yards downhill, was buried. A search
Sunday with helicopters and trained dogs flown in from British
Columbia failed to turn up his body, and the fear of another
avalanche on Monday hampered further search efforts.
</P>
<P>
   An avalanche last month in the same area, known as Rumble Gully,
apparently killed Jason Fuller, 25, a snowboarder from Bellingham,
Wash. He disappeared in the tons of snow that rolled down the
mountain and has not been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   In straying off marked ski trails, which are designed to avoid
areas most at risk of avalanche, the men were breaking no law, but
they were flouting widespread warnings of dangerous off-trail
conditions. They would have passed safety ropes and signs alerting
them of a $500 minimum fine for any rescue efforts, and advising
them that such rescues might not even be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Some safety advocates want stricter guidelines to prevent
adventure-seekers from risking their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing outside of the ski area, where about 20 feet of snow
had fallen in the last two weeks, was like ``playing Russian
roulette,'' Ron Peterson, a sheriff's deputy in Whatcom County,
Wash., said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   While officials were not sure what triggered the avalanche, the
slightly warmer weather in recent days was a possible factor.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the snow slid three-quarters of a mile down the slope,
creating a draft so strong that it knocked down several skiers on
the trails nearby. Howat said the authorities had put off the
search for Riches in part because they believed the wilderness area
was still ripe for similar avalanches.
</P>
<P>
   All told, nearly 60 feet of snow has fallen on Mount Baker this
season, which, while not a record, is more than in many recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   One major factor is believed to be La Nina, an unusually cold
pool of Pacific Ocean water near the equator that spurs widespread
atmospheric changes. The same weather pattern has been linked to
record snowfalls in Chicago and Buffalo, snaps of arctic weather in
parts of the Midwest and Northeast, and a high number of tornadoes
in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle, no stranger to rain, has received 27.44 inches of
precipitation in November, December and January, one of the highest
amounts on record for that period. While most of the region has
absorbed the rain with few major problems, more downpours will
increase the danger of mudslides, which racked the region two
winters ago.
</P>
<P>
   At higher elevations, the huge amounts of snow have posed a
danger as well. A snowboarder and a telemark skier died in separate
incidents at Crystal Mountain, Wash. And near Leavenworth, Wash., a
couple on a snowmobile were engulfed by snow and stranded for 12
days. The woman died, while the man, dazed and racked by hunger and
frostbite, was discovered earlier this month by other snowmobilers.

FILM COMMISSIONS CONVERGE ON LOCATIONS '99 TRADE SHOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're a Hollywood producer wondering if you
need a 200-pound grizzly bear in your next movie, you'll be able to
take a meeting with Teton Totem this week courtesy of the Idaho
State Film Commission.
</P>
<P>
   And he won't bite. Probably.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very tame and just a teen-ager in bear years,'' said Peg
Owens, head of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-year-old bear is just one of hundreds of attractions
that'll fill the Los Angeles Convention Center this weekend for the
Locations '99 trade show. It runs Friday through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The show is expected to draw 4,500 key players in the world's
entertainment business, such as producers, location scouts and more
than 200 different film commissions from Barbados to Fiji, Iceland
to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The bear will be in a cage on loan from Idaho's Wild Bunch
Ranch, which specializes in supplying trained animals. His purpose
is to tout the virtues of filming in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota,
South Dakota and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   And there's plenty of competition among exhibitors: Last year,
for example, the city of Memphis and Shelby County, Tenn., staffed
their booth with an Elvis Presley impersonator; several years ago,
the state of Washington and Starbucks operated a Seattle-style
coffeehouse on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   So the High Plains states decided the bear might lead to more
movies like ``The Horse Whisperer'' (Montana) and ``The Wild Wild
West'' (Idaho). ``We're often asked for lists of animal handlers,
so Teton Totem is our way of letting people know we do have this
expertise,'' said Lonie Stimac, head of Montana's commission.
</P>
<P>
   Teton Totem's owner, who has overseen the bear from being a
bottle-fed baby to a roly-poly adolescent who stands 4 1-2
(one-half) feet tall, believes the trip to Tinseltown will be
routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll bring him in a day in advance to give him a chance to
feel comfortable about his surroundings,'' said Jean Simpson, owner
of the Wild Bunch Ranch in Driggs, Idaho. ``He really is a very
good bear. He's used to being on a chain, but we also go on a lot
of walks and go swimming together because he should still have time
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The ranch's 35 animals include Storm Cloud, the 9-year-old wolf
who starred in the ``White Fang'' movies and who can snarl and
mock-attack on cue. Simpson is a veteran of two decades of
supplying animals to Hollywood and has yet to have one of his
charges escape or harm anyone. He also trained Bart, the Kodiak
bear who starred in ``The Edge,'' ``The Bear'' and ``The Great
Outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his cuteness, however, Teton Totem has a serious purpose
_ trying to help the five states keep their paws on movies, TV
shows and commercials. ``Everyone has become much more savvy about
marketing their locations,'' admitted Stimac, who saw her state's
production activity plunge from $16 million in 1997 to $4.2 million
last year. ``This business is capricious at best.''
</P>
<P>
   Southern California gets the lion's share of production work,
estimated at as much as 75 percent of the $30 billion pie. But the
success of the Canadian market, attractive due to low labor costs
and big tax breaks, has set off alarms throughout the entertainment
world.
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Kellett, head of Washington's state film commission, has
watched her state lose business to Vancouver due to its reputation
as the original home of ``The X-Files'' TV show.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have felt the impact of Vancouver probably as strongly as
anyone,'' Kellett said. ``Seattle and Vancouver are very similar in
people's minds, so Canada's success has led to us kind of losing
our sense of uniqueness.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellett credits British Columbia officials with making sensible
long-range plans to replace lost jobs in forestry and fishing. But
the answer, according to British Columbia film commissioner Peter
Mitchell is much simpler: the favorable exchange rate, which
significantly lowers costs for producers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exchange rate has been the driving force and, as a result,
has created the critical mass,'' Mitchell said. ``Without it,
`X-Files' would have been shot in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The province's economic activity from entertainment production
jumped 28 percent last year to $808 million in Canadian dollars.
Two major features _ ``White Out'' with Sylvester Stallone and
``Duet'' with Gwyneth Paltrow _ were being shot last week in
British Columbia along with 23 other shows.
</P>
<P>
   The province is home to 45 soundstages, with more coming.
``We're seeing the private sector jump into what was previously
seen as a pretty foot-loose industry,'' said Mitchell, who promised
an announcement of a major project in April.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will staff two dozen booths at Locations '99, operated
for the 14th straight year by the Association of Film Commissioners
International. The exhibits will include plenty of pitching beyond
film commissions, including production service specialists such as
Screen Gems Studios in Wilmington, N.C., headed by veteran producer
Frank Capra Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a lot of contacts and relationships that help
because they know there's someone at Screen Gems who knows what
producers want,'' said Capra, son of the legendary director.
</P>
<P>
   Capra admitted his name is an advantage, noting, ``Not a day
goes by that someone doesn't talk with me about my dad's work.''
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't selling memories; Capra markets the largest lot
outside Los Angeles _ 114,000 square feet _ and it is the home of
``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really does feel like an L.A. lot,'' Capra said. ``We have
an extraordinary crew base of 1,000 people in Wilmington.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the booths will be fairly simple, such as that operated
by Brian Ziegler, film commissioner for Fresno County. Since 1992,
the county has generated $2.5 million in activity with its most
notable scores being ``Mouse Hunt'' and ``Addams Family Values.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people we're just up the road from Los Angeles and that
permits are only $25,'' Ziegler said. ``You're not required to have
police or fire department representatives on the set so that will
save you some money, and the hotel bill won't be as expensive. I
know there's some burnout from using the same locations over and
over in Los Angeles, so I tell them locations that are fairly
virgin. And I'm going to give out raisins.''

HAROLD FELIX, 93, AIDE TO LATE NEW YORK MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Harold Felix, a New York City labor commissioner
under Mayor Robert Wagner, died on Jan. 20 at his home in
Manhattan. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   He was commissioner from 1957 to 1962. Felix and Wagner had been
close friends since both were young political workers in the
Democratic wards of the Yorkville section of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Felix was especially proud that in 1958, while he was
commissioner, the city enacted its so-called Little Wagner Act,
which gave collective-bargaining rights to city employees. The act
had been drafted by Ida Klaus, counsel to the city's Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Felix was best known for mediating strikes, but the major work
of the Labor Department in his day was to set job and salary
standards for city employees and to compile statistics on wages and
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Felix was born in Yorkville, the son of a prosperous interior
decorator. He graduated in 1927 from Harvard College and in 1930
from Columbia Law School. From 1931 until World War II he practiced
general law in New York. In the war he was an Army artillery
instructor. Afterward he specialized in labor law, representing
both unions and management.
</P>
<P>
   He was first deputy commissioner for two years before becoming
commissioner. After he stepped down as commissioner in 1962, Wagner
appointed him a Family Court judge, and he spent more than a decade
on the bench.

HOME SALES DIP, PRICES RISE IN L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After maintaining a blistering pace during 1998,
the San Fernando Valley's residential real estate market cooled
considerably during January as single-family home sales fell 12.6
percent from year-ago levels, a trade group said.
</P>
<P>
   Prices, though, continued their steady climb with the median
rising to $190,000, or a gain of 8.9 percent from January 1998,
said the monthly report from the Southland Regional Association of
Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the steep decline in sales, the market remains strong;
last month's 721 closed escrows is the second-highest total for a
January this decade.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's downturn was expected and is in line with an
earlier forecast predicting fewer sales this year than last. It
comes on the heels of a 12 percent decline in December 1998 from
the previous year's volume level.
</P>
<P>
   This two-month drop in annual sales was the first since
March-April 1997, when sales fell 4.6 percent and 3.6 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But in the nearby Santa Clarita Valley, sales kept up a torrid
pace, rising 19.8 percent from a year ago on the sale of 145
single-family homes. Condominium sales rose 39.5 percent on the
sale of 60 units.
</P>
<P>
   The median price _ the point at which half the units sold for
more and half for less _ was $222,800 for a single-family home in
Santa Clarita, a gain of 17.9 percent. The median price for a
condominium was $122,000, up nearly 9 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Single-family home sales have been torrid for nearly two years
in the San Fernando Valley, a period in which they topped the 1,000
mark for 17 months. That is by far the best run of the decade. And
last year's total of 13,242 single family sales was the most since
1988.
</P>
<P>
   So a slowdown is not causing much concern at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feverish pace started to tail off in November and December
and it continued in January. I still think this is a very strong
market; it's just not going at the pace it was during the spring
and summer of last year,'' said Jim Link, executive vice president
of the Realtors group.
</P>
<P>
   Link expects sales this year to be flat or decline slightly from
the 1998 level. Beth Sommer, the group's president, likewise is not
alarmed. She believes the market is simply catching its collective
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not see a single negative on the horizon,'' Sommer said.
</P>
<P>
   The market does exhibit signs that the sales drop could be
short-lived. Pending escrows, an indicator of future sales, rose
11.1 percent from December's level, the first such increase in
three months.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the slowing sales is a tight inventory. There are
about 5,170 properties for sale throughout the Valley, with active
listings up 6.2 percent from this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   But that is still about 2,000 units shy of what Realtors believe
is needed to keep pace with demand.
</P>
<P>
   This will keep exerting upward pressure on prices, which should
appreciate between 5 percent and 9 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County Economic
Development Corp., said that low unemployment and interest rates
coupled with strong consumer confidence should keep driving the
market.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks demand is still strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets your attention but you have to look at what is out
there,'' he said of January's sales drop. ``The unsold inventory is
getting kind of thin so people may not be able to find what they
want and price appreciation has been such that it may be another
limiter on the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the condominium market gained ground last month.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow closed on 191 units, up 6.1 percent from January 1998.
The median price, the point at which half the units sold for more
and half for less, soared to $123,000, or a gain of 19.4 percent.

A DISCOUNT AIRLINE IS IN PERIL AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Mich., Minn., Ill., Mass. )  (fb) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe Kiwi International Air Lines is not a phoenix, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the airline, based in Newark, N.J., seemed to be
rising out of the ashes of bankruptcy, rehiring workers and
resuming its low-cost flights to Florida and Puerto Rico, which
have been popular with thousands of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the airline is in financial peril again. Unpaid bills
are piling up, passengers are complaining about poor service,
once-loyal employees are becoming increasingly disgruntled, and the
airline is in danger of having two of its five working jets
repossessed.
</P>
<P>
   And some days, the airline just seems jinxed. Late Saturday
night, passengers on a Cancun charter flight, which had already
been delayed for 12 hours because of mechanical problems on one
plane, boarded another _ whose right wheel promptly fell into a
sinkhole that opened in the tarmac at Newark International Airport.
A third plane was called in, bouncing passengers bound for Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The company says its troubles are temporary, just one more
chapter in its strange and colorful history. That history began in
1992, when its founders _ former pilots from several bankrupt
airlines _ named it after the flightless bird of New Zealand. Once
owned by its employees, Kiwi now is owned and run by a Baltimore
surgeon who took control with the help of some denizens of Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, customers raved about Kiwi's inexpensive
flights _ $99 to Orlando, a fraction of what the big airlines
charged _ and its service. With the Northeastern economy then weak
and other lines going broke, workers jumped at the chance to get a
job at Kiwi, and New Jersey officials were glad to guarantee its
loans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the situation is far different. Newark is one of the
busiest airports in the world, and Kiwi's 550 employees there
account for just a fraction of the airport's 18,000 jobs. Strong,
low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines are bringing competition
and lower air fares to the region. Many airlines have just reported
one of their best years and are vying to hire people.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi, meanwhile, is struggling.
</P>
<P>
   The company insists that things are not as bad as they may
appear. The number of passengers rose more than 20 percent last
month compared with the previous year. Financially, ``things are
tight, but distressed, no,'' said Robert B. Kulat, a Kiwi
spokesman. ``What for a lot of companies would be a cash crunch,
for us is a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles C. Edwards, the doctor who owns the airline and is
running it while continuing to do spinal surgery in Baltimore,
declined to be interviewed; Kulat said the doctor planned to raise
several million dollars from private investors in the next few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But outsiders, including former employees, suppliers and lawyers
who worked on its bankruptcy case, are not so sure that it can
recover this time. Its previous efforts to raise cash from sources
other than Edwards have failed, and some of its most experienced
senior managers have left.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the employees, I truly hope Dr. Edwards can find a
long-term partner with $5 or $10 million,'' said Jerry Murphy, who
resigned as president in November after a series of disagreements
with the doctor. ``The company clearly needs an infusion of cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are even gloomier. ``I am personally skeptical about
Kiwi's abilities and prospects _ this is a critical month for
them,'' said Jeff J. Friedman, a lawyer who represents Fly Finance,
which is considering repossessing the two planes it leased to Kiwi.
After a court battle over rental payments, Kiwi agreed to buy the
planes by Jan. 31, but did not. Kulat said the company had received
an extension on its plane leases; Friedman said his client had not
decided what to do about them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Newark, where most of Kiwi's flights originate and where most
of its 600 employees work, the company is current on its payments.
But the Transport Workers Union and Kiwi are now in mediation over
the flight attendants' contract, said Richard Boehm, president of
Local 504 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest complaint among the flight attendants is the
airline's erratic schedule. In the last year, Kiwi has added and
dropped flights to Detroit, Minneapolis, Flint, Mich., and Niagara
Falls, N.Y. It has pulled out of Chicago and, now, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi passengers' complaints to the U.S. Department of
Transportation more than doubled last year, to 209. These
scheduling problems have drawn the attention of the agency's
regulators, who in December met with Edwards to discuss the
airline's financial fitness, a meeting first reported in The Newark
Star-Ledger. Safety was not an issue in these discussions, and the
Federal Aviation Administration has not increased its safety
inspections. ``We are aware of their economic status and we will
monitor that,'' said Arlene Salac, an FAA spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Kiwi has never had a serious accident, but some of its early
problems stemmed from run-ins with the FAA In 1994, the agency
grounded the airline, complaining that it did not have adequate
records of its pilots' training. In June 1996, the airline stopped
flying four of its 15 jets because the FAA said it did not have
enough properly trained pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, the airline filed for bankruptcy protection.
Two weeks after that, it ran out of money and stopped flying.
</P>
<P>
   The airline's executives frantically searched for cash. Soon, a
savior seemed to appear in the form of Joe Logan Jr., president of
a Florida company, Wasatch International. But he could not come up
with the $5 million he had promised. A month later, Logan showed up
with Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards did have money _ the ability to borrow up to $20
million, based on his large real estate holdings. What he did not
have was any experience at all in running an airline _ or much
information, apparently, about his new business partners.
</P>
<P>
   According to a court deposition of Edwards, he did not realize
when he went into business with Wasatch that it was controlled by a
South African with a history of clashes with securities regulators,
who was deported from the United States after pleading guilty to
criminal securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Logan did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment.

LOTT SAYS HE'LL ENFORCE GOP UNITY WHEN IT COMES TO TAX CUT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARREN, Mich. _ The moderate Republicans who voted to acquit
President Clinton, including four senators from New England, may
have escaped the full wrath of party leadership during impeachment,
but they had better not even think about breaking away on tax cuts,
Senate majority leader Trent Lott said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be different from impeachment,'' the Mississippian
told a group of mostly Republicans following a town hall meeting in
this working-class Detroit suburb. ``We won't let them off the
hook.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's remarks came in response to a question from a 60-year-old
retiree about whether the Republican Party planned to rein in
members who voted against the party on impeachment. It fit neatly
into the subtext of the day: redefining the GOP in the wake of the
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The event, called ``Listening to America: Tax Cuts for
Everyone,'' was the first of 150 such Republican forums planned in
cities nationwide. But it was Lott who ended up doing most of the
talking _ along with Senator Spencer Abraham, Michigan Governor
John Engler, and Representative Joe Knollenberg _ in promoting
across-the-board tax cuts as the best gift the majority party can
deliver this legislative year.
</P>
<P>
   The hand-picked crowd was overwhelmingly friendly to the
participants and their ideas, giving a standing ovation to each
speaker and cheering promises to return money to the taxpayers.
Despite a few critical questions _ about Social Security and
military pay _ the crowd of 400 made it mostly a pep rally for
Lott, giving him an easy backdrop against which to ``move on to the
issues,'' as Republicans, flagging in polls, have said they are
eager to do.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, reiterating remarks he has made several times in recent
weeks, said he was in favor of an across-the-board tax cut.
Although he had previously said he would like to see a 10 percent
cut, he said Monday he could be flexible as long as the cut was
significant and broad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not locked in to only this number and that number. Maybe
it should be 8.7 percent, and take the other part and do something
else with it,'' Lott said. But, he added, ``I think the concept of
an across-the-board tax rate cut is fairer and better for the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of cut, which is at the center of the Republicans'
post-impeachment message, is already facing serious opposition on
all sides. Clinton has begun a campaign to use the budget surplus
to strengthen Social Security before slashing taxes, and would
prefer that any tax cuts be aimed at targeted groups. Many
Democrats view an across-the-board tax cut as elitist, helping
wealthy taxpayers more than it does the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Most perilous for Republicans, however, may be opposition from
their own moderates, who could help kill the measure, particularly
in the House, where the GOP majority shrank after the November
elections. And from the standpoint of morale, an internal dispute
could also destroy efforts to reunite the party around a popular
cause, a much-desired goal after the impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a group of Republican House moderates has backed away
from broad tax cuts. Led by Representative Nancy L. Johnson of
Connecticut, the group of 11 moderates has devised its own tax
plan, complete with targeted cuts, closer to what Clinton supports.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, moderate Republicans have long been wary of
sweeping tax cuts. John H. Chafee of Rhode Island and James M.
Jeffords of Vermont have advocated targeted cuts in the past;
Olympia Snowe of Maine has preferred balancing the budget and
examining Social Security before cutting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Maine Senator Susan M. Collins expressed
reservations about broad tax cuts as well, saying she would rather
pay down the national debt and concentrate on eliminating certain
targets, including a far more popular tax cut, the marriage penalty
tax.
</P>
<P>
   But because those four Republicans _ known as the ``mod squad''
for their consistent departures from the more conservative core of
the party _ were at the center of the Republican opposition to the
articles of impeachment, they may enjoy less leeway on the tax
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, in fact, said he would ``get real aggressive with any
senator who says, `I'm not going to vote for that.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different, an impeachment vote from a tax vote,'' Lott
said, speaking to a small group of reporters after the town hall
meeting. ``I did not lobby anybody (on impeachment). When it comes
to tax cuts, you're talking about a tax cut or not for my
daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The four Republican senators from New England were not available
for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lott insisted his remarks did not indicate lingering resentment
over impeachment. And he tempered his comments on Clinton; although
he said immediately after the impeachment trial he was unsure
whether he could trust the president in their working relationship,
Lott said Monday that Clinton called him the next day, Saturday, at
9 a.m. to talk about ``Kosovo, the Medicare Commission, issues we
were going to have to be dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to be cautious, but he is still the president,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said he ``bent over backwards'' not to pressure the
New England moderates before the Senate vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they would be the first to tell you, I was very
aggressive in trying to keep them involved in the process,'' Lott
said. ``I called Olympia Snowe. I called Susan Collins. I realized
that New England is a tougher area than the Midwest or the
Southeast, for that matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he said, ``I was disappointed that they had to vote
that way.'' But, he added, ``I think I have a better relationship
with them now than we've ever had.''

OLD STANDARDS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK IN CHILDREN'S NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ First, Renee Bell named her wire-haired dachshund
Ashley, a name Ms. Bell had liked since childhood. It seemed
appropriate because it sounded vaguely British, and her dog had
come from England. Then she gave the same name to her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had Ashley dog, and then I got married and I had Ashley dog
and Ashley baby,'' Ms. Bell, a legal assistant here, said Monday.
``I have no idea why.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Ashley, the girl, is 9, and in 1997, her name was the most
popular name for girls born in New York City for the sixth year in
a row, after rocketing to the top seemingly out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to names, the experts say, the most popular ones
are uncannily consistent across the country, from the biggest
cities to the smallest rural towns. But if any place is likely to
produce surprises, it is New York City, as demonstrated by the
top-10 chart for 1997, just released by the New York City Health
Department. (The breakdown of names by city lags a year behind the
national statistics, said Sandra Mullin, the associate health
commissioner.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of the large number of immigrants and ethnic groups
stirring the pot, New Yorkers tend to be a bit behind, and a bit
rebellious when it comes to what the experts call onomastic trends.
So in New York, the top name for Asian boys is Kevin, while in the
rest of the country, Kevin is more likely to be the name of the
fathers than of the sons. And David, Daniel, Rebecca and Rachel
still make the top 10 in New York, helped, perhaps, by a large
concentration of Jews, while those names are fading elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But like parents in the rest of the country, some experts say,
New Yorkers are coming out of a cycle of highly individualistic
names and moving into a cycle of more traditional ones. Parents
still want their children to stand out, if only through their
names, but they are returning, perhaps, to the Bible and family
roots for inspiration, rather than television and the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking back to history to give a kind of stability to
the kids and society,'' said Edward Callary, a linguist at Northern
Illinois University and editor of Names magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the millennium approaching? ``That would be an
interesting speculation,'' said Cleveland Kent Evans, an associate
professor of psychology at Bellevue University, outside Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, parents favored more conventional names for boys than
for girls, perhaps because they are still viewed as heirs to a
family tradition. ``That's why we name boys Junior,'' Callary said.
``And businesses are so and so and son, but it's very rare to see
one that says so and so and daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   So Michael and Christopher were the first and second choices for
boys in New York City, continuing a trend since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   For girls, Ashley has been in first place since 1992. It first
appeared on the list in 1990, when it ranked third. It is, the
experts say, part of a waning trend toward giving girls names once
reserved for boys. Ashley Wilkes, for instance, was a male
character in ``Gone with the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Brianna made the list for the first time this year, ranking 10th
among all girls. But among black girls, Brianna ranked second,
after Ashley. And spelled slightly different, as Briana, it also
ranked eighth among black girls.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said it was not surprising that Brianna was so popular
among black parents, because it sounded like many African names,
which are three syllables long with the accent on the second
syllable.
</P>
<P>
   Destiny was the fifth most popular name for black girls and
ranked 10th among Hispanic girls. Evans said it has spread across
the country, especially among black and Hispanic families. But he
said he believes it is connected more to the working-class
background of parents who use it than to their racial background.
It is favored, he suggested, among people who feel ``buffeted by
destiny.'' Another name more popular in the rest of the country,
which he believes is related, is Desiree.
</P>
<P>
   Although the experts could not be sure it was a factor, the
album ``Destiny'' by Gloria Estefan ranked high on the music charts
in 1996, the year before the crop of babies being studied was born.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle, No. 1 among Asian girls, might have been influenced by
Michelle Kwan, the champion figure skater, as well as the desire to
assimilate, experts said. Kevin, now No. 1 among Asian boys, was
the first-ranked name in many European countries _ including
Austria, Germany, France and the Netherlands _ in the early 90s,
when Kevin Costner, Kevin Kline and Kevin Spacey were exported via
American movies, Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Callary has a ``saturation'' theory of naming. When too many
children in a kindergarten class have the same name, he suggests,
parents start to move on. That may account, he said, for the rising
popularity of old-fashioned names like Sarah (No. 6) and Emily (No.
9), which were last popular decades ago. Indeed, Sarah ranked No. 8
in New York City in 1898.

DESPITE 3-3 TIE WITH LIGHTNING, STEWART SEES SOME POSITIVES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JENNY KELLNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ With two months left in the regular season and
their chances of a playoff berth approaching the vanishing point,
the Islanders have but one choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every guy has to ask himself, `What's going on?' '' said
Zigmund Palffy, who scored two goals as the Islanders skated to a
3-3 tie with the Tampa Bay Lightning on Monday afternoon. ``You can
see on the ice what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, not enough.
</P>
<P>
   While Coach Bill Stewart said he saw ``a semblance of
consistency'' in the Islanders' past three games, he intimated that
some players are not pulling their weight and that changes are
going to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll re-evaluate the lines,'' he said. ``We'll look at all
different avenues. We will look at the overall game and assess
things player by player.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dollar factor there, too. Are we getting fair market
value from our players?''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart spoke well of Palffy, who scored his 10th and 11th goals
of the season, and of Mariusz Czerkawski, who opened the scoring
for the Islanders at 15 minutes 55 seconds of the first period on
assists from Trevor Linden and Kenny Jonsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing with a lot of heart,'' Stewart said of
Czerkawski, who scored the game-tying goal against Buffalo on
Saturday night. ``I'm a positive guy and I see a lot of positive
things in our last three games.''
</P>
<P>
   But Palffy, who scored his first goal of the season Dec. 26
after a contract holdout, appeared frustrated by the Islanders'
failure to beat the worst team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working hard in practice,'' Palffy said. ``We have to
work the same way on the ice each game. It's been 3-3, 2-2. We have
to be better in our zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``To play one good game is not enough,'' he said of the tie with
the Sabres. ``We have to play four or five games that way. We can't
give it up. There are too many games left.''
</P>
<P>
   Palffy's first goal, at 1:18 of the second period, gave the
Islanders a 2-1 lead, with Darcy Tucker having scored for the
Lightning at 2:04 of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   After Michael Nylander tied it 2-2 at 6:08 of the third period,
Palffy found himself alone with the puck past the face-off circles
a minute later and laced it through a tangle of players at 7:10 for
the lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the victory slipped away when Vincent Lecavalier took a
cross-ice pass from Pavel Kubia and sent it past Tommy Salo at
10:29 for the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, I didn't feel we played as well,'' said Stewart,
3-4-4 since taking over from Mike Milbury. ``I have respect for
Tampa, but we will be back to work tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart said that if his team plays the same way against
Pittsburgh on Wednesday, it will be a long night. ``But we are
starting to get some consistency in our game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Rich Pilon agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, we had some lapses, but we're playing pretty
well,'' he said. ``As a group of 20 guys, we have to find a way to
make it work. Obviously, he is not going to play the same 20 guys
all the time. And he's made it clear to us that if you play well,
your reward will be ice time, which is what we all want. We have a
choice: We can either make it a fun two months, or a miserable two
months. I'd rather have fun.''

GERMAIN G. GLIDDEN, 85, ATHLETE AND PORTRAITIST
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Conn.; Calif.; Ind.)  (fb) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Germain Green Glidden, a national squash racquets champion,
painter, muralist, cartoonist and founder in 1959 of the National
Art Museum of Sport, died last Tuesday in Norwalk (Conn.) Hospital.
He was 85 and lived in the Silvermine area of Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   Glidden was born in Binghamton, N.Y.; raised in Englewood, N.J.,
and educated at Phillips Exeter Academy and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His national titles in squash racquets included the
intercollegiates (1935 and 1936), singles (1936, 1937 and 1938,
retiring undefeated), doubles (1952) and veterans (1953, 1955 and
1956, again retiring undefeated).
</P>
<P>
   After college, he studied at the Art Students League and the
Metropolitan Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, he served as a naval officer in Hawaii
teaching instant recognition of planes and surface ships. He then
became a portrait artist.
</P>
<P>
   His works are displayed in the Churchill Library, the Fogg Art
Museum and the national halls of fame of baseball, basketball and
tennis. The National Art Museum of Sport commissioned his portraits
of Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The National Art Museum of Sport resided rent free at Madison
Square Garden from 1969 to 1978.
</P>
<P>
   It is now based in Indianapolis, although many of its paintings,
sculptures, prints and photographs have been shown around the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Its exhibits have included Ruth May's oil painting of Sam Snead
teeing off, Stanley Martineau's five-foot-tall sculpture of Bob
Cousy in the air, George Wesley Bellows' painting of Jack Dempsey
being knocked out of the ring by Luis Firpo, Frederic Remington's
painting of a touchdown in a Yale-Princeton football game and
Glidden's portraits of Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill and Ivan
Lendl.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, Glidden married Anna Louise Escher of Englewood, N.J.
She died in 1987. He is survived by three daughters, Pamela Zapata
of New York, Christine Glidden of New Canaan, Conn., and Dianna
Glidden of Santa Cruz, Calif., and two grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Glidden once said squash racquets taught him about the demands
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It furnishes something of an individual adventure,'' he said,
``almost like going into a prize ring. When you go into a
four-walled room or court and shut the door behind you, you know
that someone will have to come out a winner. You soon learn what
the pressure of competition means, and to me that is a vital part
of living.'' &QL;

AL JOYNER FACES LIFE'S LESSONS WITH HIS THIRD-GRADER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a sports day for third-graders, and all of
them, girls and boys alike, wanted to run against a certain
8-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone kept challenging her,'' her father said, ``so she ran
race after race and beat them all.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not surprising, considering that her mother, father and
Aunt Jackie had won seven Olympic gold medals among them. Her
mother was the late Florence Griffith Joyner, the celebrated Flo
Jo, who in 1988 set world sprint records that still stand. Her
father is Al Joyner, a triple-jumper of the past and, he hopes, the
near future. Aunt Jackie is Jackie Joyner-Kersee, perhaps the
greatest female athlete ever.
</P>
<P>
   The young star is Mary Ruth Joyner, who, her father says, is 8
going on 28. At Monday's New York Track Writers Association
luncheon and in conversations during the past week, Al Joyner said
his daughter was handling the loss of her mother better than he
was.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner died Sept. 21 at home in Mission Viejo, Calif.
She was 38. A coroner's report found that while she was sleeping,
she suffered a seizure caused by a congenital abnormality of blood
vessels in the brain and suffocated.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, Mary had been an aspiring gymnast. Her last day in
the gym was the day her mother died. A few days later came this
conversation with her father:
</P>
<P>
   ``How come you're not going to gymnastics?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start a track team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to run?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   So now she is running. She wants to be a hurdler, and her father
says that as young as she is, she can clear the 33-inch hurdles
used by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I saw her do it,'' he said, ``it scared me. In
the house, she set up hurdles _ a coffee table, chairs, a balance
beam. She made me a hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the human hurdle is in New York as part of a book tour. When
his wife died, she had almost completed ``Running for Dummies''
(IDG Books, $19.99 paperback). Joyner finished the book, a
compendium of advice for veteran and new runners.
</P>
<P>
   Joyner said that until her death, his wife had been training for
the marathon. He said that every Wednesday she had been running 22
miles in 2 hours 40 minutes to 2:50. That translated into a 3:10
marathon, good but almost 50 minutes slower than the world best.
</P>
<P>
   Why a race of 26 miles 385 yards for someone who usually ran 100
or 200 meters?
</P>
<P>
   ``She just wanted to do it,'' Joyner said. ``She never missed a
workout, even if she had to get on a treadmill at 2 in the morning.
She just loved to run. I don't love to run. Anyone who can get on a
treadmill and run through two movies, that's someone who loves to
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Joyner insists that at 39, he is planning a serious comeback to
make next year's Olympic team. When he won the triple jump in 1984
by jumping 56 feet 7{ inches, he was 6 foot 3 and 170 pounds. His
weight soared to 210, but he is down to 193 and, he said, is headed
to 180.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I can jump 55 feet,'' he said. ``I've done 52 and 53 in
practice with six steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he does not say so, one reason for his comeback seems
to be his desire to keep his daughter happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence was my friend, my training partner, my inspiration,
my coach, the mother of my daughter,'' he said. ``I miss her
dearly. This is the hardest thing I've had to deal with in my life.
Mary helps me. The reason I'm still alive is because of my
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, you forget which one is the parent and which one
the child. When I'm going somewhere, she'll say: `Daddy, I don't
want anything to happen to you. Where are you going? When are you
coming back?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary is dealing with things. She keeps my spirits up. That
comes from Florence, who laid down a foundation. Mary's gotten her
strong personality and beliefs from her mother. Aside from jumping,
I run a bit. I'm not too faithful with it, but Mary says, `Daddy,
Mommy wants you to run.' So I run.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: FREE SPEECH AND THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Federal and state lawmakers may be eager to shield children and
others from smut on the Internet, but it is very difficult to do so
without trampling on the First Amendment. Two recent cases show the
constitutional harm misguided laws can inflict.
</P>
<P>
   One case involves the 1998 federal Child Online Protection Act.
Federal District Judge Lowell Reed of Philadelphia showed proper
sensitivity to the First Amendment in issuing a preliminary
injunction against enforcement of the statute.
</P>
<P>
   The law would require all commercial sites, including free
sites, that contain material that might be deemed ``harmful to
minors'' to obtain credit card numbers or adult identification
numbers from users. Violators could be subject to heavy fines and
up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   This would force Web site operators either to put up age
verification barriers or delete potentially sensitive materials
from Web pages in an effort to avoid possible prosecution. It could
also deter adult Internet users from obtaining access to all kinds
of nonpornographic material because they may not want to lose their
anonymity by entering an identification or credit card number into
the computer.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
unwisely brushed aside First Amendment concerns in upholding a
Virginia law that prohibits state employees from using office
computers to read or download sexually explicit material on the
Internet without getting written approval from a department head.
Six professors at Virginia's public universities argued that the
law violated their free-speech rights by barring access to all
sexually explicit information on line that could be relevant to
research or teaching. The court, however, ruled that the state
could control the work-related speech of the professors as
employees, including their access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, better options exist. Filtering software can
protect children from on-line pornography more effectively than a
law that infringes on the rights of adults. Similarly, Virginia can
prohibit state employees from using office computers for
non-job-related purposes, without resorting to a content-based
distinction that hurts free speech and limits the legitimate use of
computers by educators.

MAKING BOOK ON IMPEACHMENT 
BILLIE JEAN KING GETS ASHE AWARD 
VOCAL AUDIENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By JAMES BARRON WITH CHARLES STRUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   How will William Rehnquist's book about impeachment sell now
that the Senate trial is over?
</P>
<P>
   The monthlong impeachment proceeding provided the chief justice
with something that other authors only dream of: day-to-day
exposure on national television, which might be second only to an
endorsement from Oprah Winfrey in helping to sell a stolid volume
like Rehnquist's book, ``Grand Inquests: The Historic Impeachments
of Justice Samuel Chase and President Andrew Johnson.'' (Published
in 1992, it was reissued by William Morrow in December as a
paperback.)
</P>
<P>
   The end of the trial gave ``Grand Inquests'' a boost. Between
Friday and Sunday, ``Grand Inquests'' climbed to 572nd from 712th
in the sales rankings reported by the online bookseller Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist's book was 53rd on Barnes &AMP; Noble's online sales chart
at the end of January. By last week, it had dropped off the chain's
list of 100 top-selling titles; calls to Barnes &AMP; Noble's corporate
headquarters to see how ``Grand Inquests'' was faring were not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, sales of other books that appealed to
impeachment-minded readers had already slackened off as the trial
drew to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the impeachment referral by the independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, slipped noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   Released by three publishers in September, the Starr report is
no longer the hot seller it was in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The 336-page version from Prima Books was 20,023rd in
Amazon.com's rankings on Sunday. The 421-page volume from Public
Affairs Press was 37,918th, and the 523-page paperback edition from
Pocket Books was 56,685th.
</P>
<P>
   Profiles in Courage
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I tried to get my hit on the weekends or maybe for
10 minutes and see if there's anything new,'' Billie Jean King said
the other day. She was talking not about a tennis match but about
the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I watched a lot more and thought this was not
very productive for my life,'' she said. ``It started to become
very repetitive. I thought, `I get the picture, it's going to take
forever, it's going to be a war between Democrats and Republicans,
and that's not a healthy situation.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King was in New York to attend Monday night's ESPY Awards at
Radio City Music Hall, where she received the Arthur Ashe Award for
Courage for leading the effort to improve the status of women in
professional tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. King recalled talking with Ashe several years ago when both
were commentators for HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a lot of time talking about how we wanted to make
tennis more hospitable,'' she said. `We were born in the same year,
but I was discriminated against because of my gender and he because
of his color. One time I asked him, `What's the most difficult
thing for you?' He said, ``Most people would think it's HIV, AIDS
or my heart, but it's really being a black man. Every time I walk
out the door, I know my day could be difficult because of
prejudice.'''
</P>
<P>
   A Sing-Along
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The house lights dimmed for the second act of ``Babes
in Arms'' at the City Center over the weekend, the band struck up
``Where or When,'' and _in a first for the six-year-old Encores
series of revivals _ the audience began to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Fisher, the music director, said he wasn't sure what he was
hearing. Only later did he learn that audiences at two of the five
performances were so swept away by the melancholy Rodgers and Hart
tune that humming broke out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at center stage,'' said Fisher, who conducts an onstage
ensemble. ``I hear the band so loudly that it's hard to hear
anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I stood, I heard giggling a few bars into it,'' he
said. ``Apparently, people began to hum, stopped, giggled, and as a
group decided to go for it with everything they had.''

EDITORIAL: CLOSING IN ON THE GUNMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   Last week's federal jury verdict against firearms manufacturers
for negligent marketing and distribution practices marks an
important turning point in the fight against gun violence. The
Brooklyn jury found 15 of 25 gun manufacturers named in the lawsuit
negligent and found that nine of them were collectively liable for
three of seven shootings with illegally obtained handguns, even
though it was not proved what brand of gun had been used in a
particular shooting. In effect, the jury said the companies had
allowed the guns to fall into the wrong hands, thereby putting the
industry on notice that it can be held accountable for violence.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmakers are claiming vindication because the jury imposed
no damages for six of the seven shooting victims. But the industry
knows it is in big trouble. There is growing evidence linking
industry practices to illegal trafficking in guns, and five large
cities have already filed suit against the industry to try to
recover their considerable costs of mopping up after gun violence.
These suits are based on the so-called ``negligent-marketing
theory'' used in the Brooklyn case as well as a more conventional
product-liability theory that argues that manufacturers have made
their product ``unreasonably dangerous'' by failing to incorporate
feasible safety devices.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the verdict, the gun lobby was so nervous it had
begun appealing to gun-friendly state legislatures to pass measures
aimed at blocking lawsuits. The industry has lavished millions on
high-pressure lobbying tactics to preserve its unique exemption
from government safety regulations _ all the while trying to
prettify that exemption by calling it a constitutional right. The
gun lobby knows that the political muscle and money it deploys to
control lawmakers will not work in a courtroom. That is why it is
trying so hard to shut courthouse doors.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say whether anti-gun lawsuits will be able to
replicate the success of the tobacco litigation. But a responsible
industry would not resort to a desperate court-blocking strategy.
It would instead be concentrating on designing products with
effective safety locks, and on fighting illegal trafficking, for
example by requiring dealers to limit gun purchases to one a month
for each individual customer.

EDITORIAL: THE FOREST SERVICE'S NEW DEAL  (fb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   From the day he assumed control of the U.S. Forest Service two
years ago, Michael Dombeck made clear that his first priority would
be the conservation of natural resources as opposed to their
exploitation. He said he wanted to trim the annual timber harvest,
protect watersheds and restore wildlife habitat _ heretical
thoughts in a federal agency that historically has been far more
interested in harvesting trees than in acting as a responsible
steward of the American landscape. Given the obstinate attitudes of
the logging industry and its obedient friends in Congress,
conservationists gave him little chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two weeks, however, Dombeck has begun to make good
on his promises in important ways. First he announced a ban on
mining along the 100-mile Rocky Mountain Front, one of the richest
wilderness areas in the lower 48 states. Then last Thursday he
announced a long-awaited 18-month suspension of the construction of
new logging roads in much of the undeveloped back country of the
national forests. The move would effectively put 33 million acres
of national forest _ one-sixth of the total _ off limits to
logging. The newly protected acres include critical spawning
grounds for fish and habitat for animals that need unbroken
wilderness to survive. At the end of the moratorium, Dombeck will
unveil a permanent national plan governing road-building policy
throughout the 192-million-acre system.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists were generally but not completely happy with
Dombeck's plan. About 15 million roadless acres were not protected
by the ban, including large tracts in the Pacific Northwest and the
Tongass National Forest in Alaska. Dombeck's explanation is that
most of these areas are covered by newly drawn plans that have yet
to prove their worth and, in some cases, are under appeal in the
courts. That is true. It is also true that including the Tongass
would have infuriated Alaska's congressional delegation and other
influential Western senators who underwrite Dombeck's agency and
who are already incensed by his departures from Forest Service
orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The Tongass in particular deserves better. The latest forest
plan allows for an annual ``cut'' of 267 million board feet a year.
That is more than double the 1996 cut, and could require 1,100
miles of new roads. Meanwhile, Alaska's congressional delegation is
placing heavy pressure on Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman to
make a sweetheart deal with Louisiana Pacific, an aggressive
logging company that is demanding millions of board feet at
subsidized prices. Glickman, who is Dombeck's boss, should tell
Louisiana Pacific to go away.
</P>
<P>
   But the only sure way to sustain what is left of these
magnificent old-growth forests is for Dombeck to put them off
limits to new roads when he unwraps his final plan in 18 months.
That would make a good policy even better.
</P>

SIGNS POSITIVE THAT NFL WANTS L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When the NFL's expansion committee meets today in
Atlanta, neither of the two groups seeking a franchise for Los
Angeles, the Michael Ovitz/Carson team nor the Ed Roski/New
Coliseum squad, will be in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptic would say that's a bad sign. It's hard to score
touchdowns when you aren't allowed on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But if one is to believe the NFL, this is the clearest sign yet
the league is serious about returning to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   While the committee will receive updates and discuss the Ovitz
and Roski proposals, it will also deliberate its own alternative _
selecting a site somewhere in L.A., assisting in stadium
construction, and then opening up the bidding for a franchise to
all comers.
</P>
<P>
   That is the model the league used to return a franchise in
Cleveland. Working with city officials who contributed $166 million
to a new stadium, the league spent $54 million to help finance
construction and assisted with private seat-license sales. Al
Lerner won the bidding for the Browns franchise at $530 million,
which included paying the NFL back its $54 million.
</P>
<P>
   If the league's criteria were merely a new stadium, oodles of
public money and a well-heeled owner, then the NFL would already
have handed a franchise to Houston and businessman Robert McNair.
The Houston proposal has been complete and in hand for more than
six months.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. is important enough, league sources say, to consider the
Cleveland option and commit to it as early as mid-March, when the
league owners hold their annual meetings in Phoenix. That decision,
they add, wouldn't necessarily preclude Ovitz or Roski as owners or
Carson or the Coliseum as the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance (in L.A.) is to do it right and eliminate the
risks,'' said Roger Goodell, the NFL's vice president of
development. ``There's been a high degree of frustration in the
L.A. market and we've taken a (public relations) hit in the
process. We need to do this one right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing we should vote for is a plan with holes,'' said
Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner who is on the
expansion committee. ``And at the end of the day, the biggest issue
usually is the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has every right to be as skeptical of the league as
it was of Georgia Frontiere and Al Davis. The NFL did nothing to
stop the Rams from leaving, never wanted the Raiders to come, and
did very little up to this point to fill the void they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   The league says it has the best interests of L.A. in mind, but
the push for the Cleveland option raises several other questions:
</P>
<P>
   __ Is the league actually saying that Ovitz and Roski can't pull
this off?
</P>
<P>
   Ovitz's personal worth has been estimated at $250 million to
$500 million. But much of the $138 million settlement he received
upon leaving Disney _ he was hired as the company's president but
fired a year later _ came in stock options with limits on when and
how they could be cashed.
</P>
<P>
   Precious little information regarding the financial strength of
his ownership group has been available. Carson Mayor Peter Fajardo
expected a position paper detailing all revenue and equity shares
last September, but he's still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   An Ovitz NFL-presentation document obtained from Carson
officials included no equity breakdown, alluded to Ovitz ``or an
affiliate'' as principal owner, and did not include stockbroker Ted
Forstmann. Ovitz spokesman Peter Levin said Forstmann is still of
the group but declined to answer any other specific questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very closely with the league in shaping our
proposal,'' he said. ``We have made what we consider to be a sound
proposal and it's been the same proposal from the beginning. And
we're not comfortable elaborating (on it publicly).''
</P>
<P>
   The net worth of Roski, the Kings' co-owner who is building The
Staples Center, is estimated at $400 million to $700 million. But
NFL concerns that he is overextended led him to take on billionaire
Eli Broad as a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want anyone thinking there was an equity
restraint,'' said New Coliseum vice president John Semcken. ``We're
not trying to encourage anyone raising the (franchise fee number),
but we wanted the league to know it can be covered.''
</P>
<P>
   A league source said the committee considers worse-case
scenarios in awarding franchises and the biggest fear is that the
cost of building a stadium and buying a team in L.A. could be too
much at one time for any group.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL builds the stadium, he said, it can remove that
potential problem. It would also be involved in selling name rights
to the facility and PSLs, and balance those figures into stadium
costs. The NFL considers PSL revenue projections of both groups
(Carson $75 million, Coliseum $100 million) to be too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   __ Is the league stalling because it knows expansion fees are
only increasing?
</P>
<P>
   The Browns' franchise value has been set at $476 million, and
the Redskins and their stadium just sold for $800 million. Both
L.A. groups are speculating that the franchise fee will be $500
million. But if the NFL delays naming an owner for a year, that
price could increase by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the Phoenix Cardinals are seeking public money for a new
stadium. Any decision in March tied to a dollar figure could impact
how much state and city officials are willing to spend to keep the
Cardinals happy.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of value inflation, Philips Electronics has
offered $150 million to $180 million for naming rights to a new
arena in Atlanta, dwarfing the $100 million Staples is paying (over
20 years) to name the new Kings and Lakers downtown arena.
</P>
<P>
   __ Is this the NFL's way of getting more public money, its
favorite kind, and creating new competition?
</P>
<P>
   Carson's proposed investment has been capped at $180 million.
The New Coliseum says its proposal includes in excess of $300
million of public money, but the league does not agree with the
Coliseum's math. Much of the public money in the Coliseum proposal
comes in the form of already-completed investment.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is getting much greater public investment in new
stadiums in other cities _ Pittsburgh ($147 million), Cleveland
($166 million), Detroit ($180 million), Nashville ($292 million),
Seattle ($300) and Cincinnati ($404 million). Connecticut will
spend $375 million to build the Patriots a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL plan would encourage Hollywood Park and Inglewood to
renew its bid to build a stadium adjacent to the race track and
casino.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has always liked the idea of a stadium next to Dodger
Stadium. Dodgers President Bob Graziano said the team and Fox
officials will continue to support the New Coliseum as requested by
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan until it hears otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   League sources say its plan doesn't preclude Ovitz or Roski as
the prospective owner or either Carson or the Coliseum as the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think they have the leverage to ask for a decision
now, and would prefer we pick them now, they would rather get a
franchise (anyway) than not,'' said a league official. ``And we
would probably continue to develop the sites until we were
convinced there's a better one.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Is it stalling because it wants the pending lawsuit, over who
owns the NFL rights in L.A., involving Al Davis and the Raiders,
settled before moving ahead?
</P>
<P>
   Davis has been and remains the NFL original wild card and the
case isn't scheduled to begin until this summer.

RAPE SUSPECT WHO SPARKED POLICE SHOOTING STRIKES AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
  (See related NY-SUSPECT-SHOT, NY-SUSPECT-DIAZ, NY-SUSPECT-COPS) 
 (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two women were sexually assaulted over the weekend by
the same rape suspect four police officers were looking for on the
night they shot and killed an unarmed West African immigrant
earlier this month, police said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday morning, two women, ages 22 and 25, were going into
a building in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan when a
man with a gun followed them into the elevator, said Capt. John
Creegan, commander of the major crimes unit of the Bronx
detectives.
</P>
<P>
   The man then used a purse to hold the door open so that the
elevator could not move, sexually assaulted the women and robbed
them, Creegan said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect has now raped or robbed 39 women since 1993, Creegan
said. The police felt the same man is responsible because of the
similarities of the attacks; the suspect typically follows women
into their buildings and is not afraid to attack women who are not
alone, Creegan said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, four officers belonging to the Bronx Street Crimes
Unit were seeking the suspect when they encountered Amadou Diallo
and shot him to death in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   A Bronx grand jury on Tuesday is expected to begin hearing
evidence against the four officers involved in the shooting _
Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy.
Lawyers said the officers probably would not be called until next
week and that the jurors are likely to hear first from medical
examiners, ballistics experts and any possible witnesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also Monday, as Diallo's body was returned to Guinea, religious
leaders and outraged citizens in New York and Washington held
another day of rallies and prayers Monday to call once again for an
end to police violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,500 people jammed the Abyssinian Baptist Church in
Harlem to hear the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III offer prayers not just
for victims of police violence but also for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and the police. In Washington, about 400 civil rights advocates
marched from the White House to the Capitol carrying signs
denouncing the shooting of Diallo and chanting ``enough is
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Butts urged the overflow crowd to work together to ``root out
the evil that permeates our city,'' then read a list of dozens of
people killed by New York City police officers since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Though the audience was mostly black and mostly female, there
were a smattering of yarmulkes and Asian faces in the crowd. The
head of the Central Conference of American Rabbis, Paul Menitoff,
spoke at the three-hour service, as did the general secretary of
the Islamic Leadership Council, Shaykh Abd'Allah Latif Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Mim Warden, who lives on Manhattan's Upper West Side, said she
went to the service after hearing about it at her synagogue because
she felt she needed to take a stand for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If what I say in synagogue isn't acted out, then my belief is
not made real,'' Ms. Warden, 63, said.

FTOREK MAKES STATEMENT AS DEVILS BATTLE TO A TIE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The first period was not even halfway
through Monday when Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek called for a
timeout. Gathering the Devils together, Ftorek calmly addressed the
team and delivered a message that has been slow to get through.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils again seemed on foreign ground in front of the home
fans, stumbling to a quick two-goal deficit, and when the second
goal came, Ftorek had seen enough and stopped play. But before the
period was over, the Devils had erased the Toronto Maple Leafs'
lead, and in the end, they recovered to forge a 3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had to hang on just to get the one point as they were
outshot by 31-22. They survived a scare in the final minute of
regulation when Aleksandr Karpovtsev fed Sergei Berezin just
outside the left post and Berezin blasted a shot that Martin
Brodeur turned away. With 3:20 left in overtime, Brodeur again came
up big, trapping the puck against the outside of his skate as
Ladislav Kohn hacked away at it.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams went a man down at 9:48 of the third period, a swap
that the Devils were not pleased with. Randy McKay was battling in
front of the net with Dimitri Yushkevich, with both players
tumbling into the crease. As McKay tried to get to his feet with
Tie Domi banging him around, Kris King grabbed McKay's left arm and
held it. Domi, like a professional wrestler in a tag-team match,
grabbed McKay's head with both hands and pinned it backwards over
the crossbar of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   When the officials separated the two, both players were assessed
two minute penalties, Domi for roughing and McKay for goaltender
interference. Scott Stevens and Igor Korolev then followed them to
the penalty box, both for slashing just 31 seconds later. But
neither team was able to mount a credible threat and the penalties
were all killed off.
</P>
<P>
   In its first game since closing down the long-time home ice at
Maple Leaf Gardens, Toronto seemed to be making itself at home at
Continental Arena. The Devils have done little to exert a home-ice
advantage at the Meadowlands, enduring a five-game winless streak
here until besting the Carolina Hurricanes on Saturday. Currently
in a six-game homestand, their longest of the season, the Devils
started it with a 3-2 loss to the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils took their first lead of the night at 1:41 of the
second period on a power-play goal by Jason Arnott. The Maple Leafs
nearly cleared the puck, but Scott Niedermayer was able to keep it
in, lunging and hacking the puck back into the corner, where Patrik
Elias retrieved it and found Arnott floating toward the net. Arnott
was able to trickle it through the pads of Curtis Joseph for a 3-2
lead. But the Maple Leafs, outshooting the Devils by 14-4 in the
second period, tied the score with one minute remaining when Garry
Valk fired from the left circle and beat Brodeur to the far post.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs built a 2-0 lead, scoring a pair of goals 1
minute and 1 second apart. First, the former Devil Steve Thomas
rushed the left side of the ice, leading Bryan Berard with a pass
in front that was just out of reach of Scott Stevens and Sergei
Brylin, and Berard slipped the puck under the pads of Martin
Brodeur. Then, Ladislav Kohn carried the puck in and slipped it to
Derek King, who faked his way past Sheldon Souray and bounced a
short shot from the left circle through Brodeur's pads at 9:04 of
the period.
</P>
<P>
   But 30 seconds after a timeout, the Devils began to assert
themselves as Arnott crunched Dimitri Yushkevich into the boards..
Then, at 15:54, Berard slipped as he retreated into his own zone
and Bombardir whisked past him and charged the net, firing a shot
that was stopped by Joseph. Joseph again denied the Devils on a
rebound attempt by Brian Rolston, but when the puck came free, Jay
Pandolfo reached as he dove forward and banged the puck past
Joseph.

WINDSWEPT FIRE AT CHURCH KILLS THREE FIREFIGHTERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: Updates with officials saying fire suspicious, minor editing
thruout) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN and BILL TEETER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Texas _ The roof of a small, blazing church crashed
onto three firefighters Monday, burying and killing them in the
flaming debris as others scrambled off the collapsing structure.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ two off-duty Fort Worth firefighters working with
suburban volunteer fire departments _ were found about an hour
later at the rear of the gutted church, not far from the sanctuary
and pulpit of the Precious Faith Temple in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Four other firefighters were injured, none seriously, in the
blaze that officials Monday night were describing as
``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It possibly could be arson, but it's still too early to draw
that conclusion without a doubt,'' said Tom Crowley, spokesman for
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, one of several
agencies investigation the fire. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 3 p.m., mourning colleagues removed their helmets
as the bodies of Brian Collins, 35, Phillip Dean, 29, and Garry
Sanders, 20, were carried from the smoldering ruins. Collins and
Dean, close friends who once worked at the same station in Fort
Worth, both leave pregnant wives. Lake Worth is a suburb of Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of, if not the, worst disasters for firefighters in
Tarrant County history.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the fire apparently started in a wood-frame
storage building built onto the church at 3204 Roberts Cut Off Road
northwest of Fort Worth and spread into the attic. No cause had
been determined, but an arson-trained dog was sniffing through the
debris Monday night for accelerants.
</P>
<P>
   The dog ``hit on several areas'' in the charred remains of the
storage area that may have contained accelerants used to start the
blaze, Crowley said. He said the ATF is offering a $10,000 reward
for information leading to the ``arrest and conviction of any
subjects involved.'' &QL; 
.MDNM/ According to Crowley, church officials told authorities
there were no fire-causing substances, such as gasoline, kept in
the storage area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And there were no electrical utilities in the area that could
have sparked the blaze, said Randy Renois, Tarrant County's fire
marshal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our investigation,'' Renois said, ``the fire is
turning up to be suspicious.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late last night, fire marshals and arson investigators,
including ATF agents, were scouring the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which the wind-swept blaze went from fairly
routine to deadly _ just seconds _ cast a palpable pall over the
men and women in bunker gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing is always in the back of your mind when you
go,'' volunteer firefighter Herbert Cartwright said, sitting on the
side of his red truck and coughing from smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the fire hall at suburban River Oaks was crowded
with counselors, ministers, firefighters and their families. To
give the volunteers some time off, other area fire departments
agreed to cover emergency responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just grief-stricken right now,'' said Chris Martin,
a firefighter and paramedic with the River Oaks department.
</P>
<P>
   Of the injured firefighters, two remained in the burn unit at
Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. They were identified as Joe
Hamilton Jr., 24, and Andrew Ailara, 29. Both were in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two others were treated at area hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials did not explain why firefighters entered the
church to battle the blaze, which was visible to witnesses who
stepped outside about 10:45 a.m. as the first fire trucks arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Worth Lt. Kent Worley said the wind, with gusts of 30
mph, was likely a major factor in the flames' rapid spread. Fifteen
minutes after the first crews arrived, the roof caved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears from looking at the building that the fire got up
into the attic and the wind pushed it through the attic very
quickly,'' Worley said. ``The roof came down on them very quickly,
probably at the moment they were going to change tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   As two crews of volunteer firefighters arrived, dense smoke
poured from the building and flames were slightly visible,
Cartwright said. A 17-year volunteer, he was among firefighters who
went into the church through a back door, spraying water, while
another crew burst into the front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``pitch black'' inside, and even over the roar of fire
and water, he said he heard the roof begin to give way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the beams beginning to let go'' and men
scrambled for the exits, dragging water hoses as they went,
Cartwright said.
</P>
<P>
   When Cartwright emerged, his jacket had begun to curl from the
heat, and all he had left of the fire hose was the nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky is all,'' he said, rubbing his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people from the surrounding neighborhood and two strip
shopping centers watched in horror as the roof began to buckle with
firefighters on top.
</P>
<P>

HORRY OUT OF HOSPITAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Los Angeles Lakers forward Robert Horry was
discharged from the hospital Monday, 24 hours after being diagnosed
with an irregular heartbeat, and he could be playing again as soon
as tonight's game against the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   After experiencing chest pains Sunday, Horry spent the night at
Centinela Medical Center, where he underwent a battery of tests
under the supervision of team internist Dr. John Moe, and his heart
was monitored constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the tests came back within the range of normal,'' and
Horry's heartbeat has returned to normal, Lakers spokesman John
Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Horry is wearing a heart monitor and his heartbeat will be
measured when he participates in today's shootaround. If all goes
well, he will be cleared to play tonight. ``They're looking for any
irregularity in the next 24 hours,'' Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors could not determine the cause for the irregular
heartbeat, though it could be related to Horry's recent bout with
an upper respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Horry's discharge was greeted with relief by the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been hoping and praying that nothing would be wrong
with it,'' coach Del Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   The experience put a scare into coaches and teammates, who
couldn't help but think of Hank Gathers of Loyola Marymount and
Reggie Lewis of the Boston Celtics, both of whom had heart
conditions and died playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put your heart under a lot of stress to do this work,''
Harris said, ``and that's always in the back of your mind. . . .
Even though the guys were concerned about Robert first of all, I'm
sure everybody kind of checked their own hearts to see how they
were working. It's only natural.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Ouch report: Shaquille O'Neal did not practice with the team
but went through a workout to rehab his strained groin and is
expected to start tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Fox was sent home with an upper respiratory infection but
could be available for spot minutes off the bench.

WINDSWEPT FIRE AT CHURCH KILLS THREE FIREFIGHTERS
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: Updates with officials saying fire suspicious, minor editing
thruout) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS VAUGHN and BILL TEETER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Texas _ The roof of a small, blazing church crashed
onto three firefighters Monday, burying and killing them in the
flaming debris as others scrambled off the collapsing structure.
</P>
<P>
   The victims _ two off-duty Fort Worth firefighters working with
suburban volunteer fire departments _ were found about an hour
later at the rear of the gutted church, not far from the sanctuary
and pulpit of the Precious Faith Temple in Lake Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Four other firefighters were injured, none seriously, in the
blaze that officials Monday night were describing as
``suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It possibly could be arson, but it's still too early to draw
that conclusion without a doubt,'' said Tom Crowley, spokesman for
the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, one of several
agencies investigation the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 3 p.m., mourning colleagues removed their helmets
as the bodies of Brian Collins, 35, Phillip Dean, 29, and Garry
Sanders, 20, were carried from the smoldering ruins. Collins and
Dean, close friends who once worked at the same station in Fort
Worth, both leave pregnant wives. Lake Worth is a suburb of Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of, if not the, worst disasters for firefighters in
Tarrant County history.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the fire apparently started in a wood-frame
storage building built onto the church at 3204 Roberts Cut Off Road
northwest of Fort Worth and spread into the attic. No cause had
been determined, but an arson-trained dog was sniffing through the
debris Monday night for accelerants.
</P>
<P>
   The dog ``hit on several areas'' in the charred remains of the
storage area that may have contained accelerants used to start the
blaze, Crowley said. He said the ATF is offering a $10,000 reward
for information leading to the ``arrest and conviction of any
subjects involved.'' .MDNM/ According to Crowley, church officials
told authorities there were no fire-causing substances, such as
gasoline, kept in the storage area.
</P>
<P>
   And there were no electrical utilities in the area that could
have sparked the blaze, said Randy Renois, Tarrant County's fire
marshal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through our investigation,'' Renois said, ``the fire is
turning up to be suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last night, fire marshals and arson investigators,
including ATF agents, were scouring the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which the wind-swept blaze went from fairly
routine to deadly _ just seconds _ cast a palpable pall over the
men and women in bunker gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of thing is always in the back of your mind when you
go,'' volunteer firefighter Herbert Cartwright said, sitting on the
side of his red truck and coughing from smoke inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, the fire hall at suburban River Oaks was crowded
with counselors, ministers, firefighters and their families. To
give the volunteers some time off, other area fire departments
agreed to cover emergency responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all just grief-stricken right now,'' said Chris Martin,
a firefighter and paramedic with the River Oaks department.
</P>
<P>
   Of the injured firefighters, two remained in the burn unit at
Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. They were identified as Joe
Hamilton Jr., 24, and Andrew Ailara, 29. Both were in good
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two others were treated at area hospitals and released.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials did not explain why firefighters entered the
church to battle the blaze, which was visible to witnesses who
stepped outside about 10:45 a.m. as the first fire trucks arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But Fort Worth Lt. Kent Worley said the wind, with gusts of 30
mph, was likely a major factor in the flames' rapid spread. Fifteen
minutes after the first crews arrived, the roof caved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears from looking at the building that the fire got up
into the attic and the wind pushed it through the attic very
quickly,'' Worley said. ``The roof came down on them very quickly,
probably at the moment they were going to change tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   As two crews of volunteer firefighters arrived, dense smoke
poured from the building and flames were slightly visible,
Cartwright said. A 17-year volunteer, he was among firefighters who
went into the church through a back door, spraying water, while
another crew burst into the front of the church.
</P>
<P>
   It was ``pitch black'' inside, and even over the roar of fire
and water, he said he heard the roof begin to give way.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the beams beginning to let go'' and men
scrambled for the exits, dragging water hoses as they went,
Cartwright said.
</P>
<P>
   When Cartwright emerged, his jacket had begun to curl from the
heat, and all he had left of the fire hose was the nozzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky is all,'' he said, rubbing his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people from the surrounding neighborhood and two strip
shopping centers watched in horror as the roof began to buckle with
firefighters on top.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were five or six of them up there cutting holes in the
roof,'' said David Simpson, owner of DFW Electronics, down the
street from the church. ``You could just watch the roof begin to
fold in and guys jumping off.''
</P>

ST. JOHN'S FLOORS PROVIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The interest in St. John's has risen so high that the
competition for tickets outside Alumni Hall on Monday night was
greater than the competition between the teams inside.
</P>
<P>
   The fans who did grab the few tickets available for sale in the
parking lot saw Reggie Jessie trying no-look, spin-around passes,
Albert Richardson careering through the lane like an out-of-control
taxi and all of it working just fine. This is what total domination
looks like when even the most absurd of St. John's shots are
falling, it is doing all the rebounding and the Providence Friars
are struggling to stay in the building.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Storm, ranked 10th in the nation, gave a clinic on
tuning up for the post-season, demolishing the Friars, 104-70, and
moving to 21-6 overall and 12-3 in the Big East with three games to
go in the regular season. It was the first time a St. John's team
had hit the 100-point mark against a Big East opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Friars are 14-11 and 7-8 and seem destined for a berth in
the National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a team that has a final-something look _ a Final Four,
or final eight look,'' Providence Coach Tim Welsh said of St.
John's. ``They're hard to play because they've got so many answers.
You help out on one guy, and they move the ball. In a nutshell, it
was a domination.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. John's victory was so complete that even the normally
loquacious players, who always seem to have some constructive
criticism for each other at the foul line, were silent.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's scored 18 straight points in the first half as part
of a 28-2 run that displayed everything it can do so well. That
nine-minute span should be preserved behind glass, to be broken
only if St. John's needs it in an emergency during the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like this, nobody can beat us,'' said Tyrone Grant,
who was honored in his last game at Alumni Hall as the senior who
contributed the most to the basketball program. ``Somebody was
yelling `Sweet 16' and I looked at him like he was crazy. We are
not settling for the Sweet 16.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense during the game-breaking run, the Red Storm broke
Providence's pressure defense. When the Red Storm was on defense,
Erick Barkley (9 points, 6 assists) stayed so close to Providence's
Corey Wright that he seemed to be peering into Wright's pores. On
one play, Barkley stripped Wright of the ball and tossed an outlet
pass to Bootsy Thornton (15 points) for a layup.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Artest (16 points) showed two head fakes before easing in a
layup and Thornton hit Richardson (14 points) with a pass in the
low post for an easy lay-in.
</P>
<P>
   Grant (12 points, 7 rebounds) hit a bank shot and Barkley had a
pull-up 3-pointer. Lavor Postell didn't score during the run, but
he was the team's high scorer with 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what this team can do when they're making stops on one
end and then running and passing,'' Coach Mike Jarvis said.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's was doing all of that, and then some. St. John's shot
50 percent from the field and held Providence to 41.8 percent, with
Artest's defense limiting the Friars' Jamel Thomas to 7-of-17
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had 24 assists (on 39 field goals) and just 12
turnovers and, as usual, the Red Storm dominated the boards, 50-32.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, who believes something can be learned from even a
seemingly flawless victory, will likely try to find something to
improve upon after this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to play a game where you shut out the opponent and
you don't have any turnovers,'' Jarvis said, raising the bar just a
little higher. ``Coaches are never satisfied. That's why we're
coaches.''

EDITORIAL: AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR THE SUBWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Feb. 16:
</P>
<P>
   New York City's economy could not function without the subways.
Yet for hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers in the Bronx,
Brooklyn, Manhattan's East Side and Queens, ``rapid transit'' is
notoriously slow, infrequent or a half-mile hike away. Even when
it's accessible, riding it at rush hour sentences straphangers to
levels of overcrowding that the Regional Plan Association describes
genteelly as ``elbow to rib.'' The association's remedy is
MetroLink, a plan that makes a compelling case for the first major
expansion of the subway system since the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades ahead, the city could gain hundreds of thousands
of jobs. Motivated by a desire to see them materialize and to help
people reach them, MetroLink would resuscitate the partially built
Second Avenue subway. This line would run from the Bronx south
through Manhattan and on to Brooklyn's Atlantic Terminal, where it
would connect to the Long Island Rail Road. The Second Avenue line
would also intersect underused rail lines, along which four new
subway routes would be created to give residents in the Bronx,
south Brooklyn and southeastern Queens express service to
Manhattan. One route would give midtown and Wall Street business
travelers a one-seat ride to Kennedy International Airport. Over
all, MetroLink, which calls for 19 miles of new tunneling, would
improve service for 250,000 rush-hour riders.
</P>
<P>
   MetroLink's unveiling has provoked grousing by state and city
officials and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. They do
not disparage the vision but assault its $13 billion price tag. But
their lukewarm response should not derail efforts to make the
transit investments essential to the city's economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   New York spent $1.57 billion a year on subway and commuter rail
investments from the mid-1980s to mid-1990s. In the same period,
Tokyo spent $16.25 billion a year, Paris $1.63 billion and London
$1.08 billion. Per capita annually, New York invested $81. That is
close to London's $87, much less than Paris' $153 and a fraction of
Tokyo's $511. Selecting rapid-transit projects that spur the
economy and complement 21st-century residential realities is far
more important than new sports stadiums.

DOG OWNER LIVES OUT CHAMPIONSHIP DREAM
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PALMDALE, Calif. _ For more than 15 years, Stephanie Archuleta
has dreamed of taking a dog to the Westminster Kennel Club dog
show.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she got her wish with a blond cocker spaniel named
Mishka, who not only got into America's most prestigious dog show
but came home with a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done probably 65 shows last year,'' said Archuleta, a
professional dog handler. ``But going to the Westminster was a
dream come true. An absolute once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It was
just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1877 by a group of New York businessmen _ its
organizers call it America's second-oldest continuous sporting
event, after the Kentucky Derby _ the Westminster show accepts only
dogs that already have earned championship titles.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2,500 dogs are accepted to compete and, on average, all
slots are filled in less than 10 minutes from the opening of
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Mishka, a 3-year-old whose official American Kennel Club name is
Champion Laramo's Handsome Dancer, is owned by a Columbus, Ind.,
couple, Nancy Foley and Ken Feller.
</P>
<P>
   But he lives in a kennel at Archuleta's Palmdale home north of
Los Angeles, which dog handling fees have helped pay for. Mishka
gets good care: on Friday, two days after he returned from New
York, he went in for a tonsillectomy _ something not commonly done
on dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta takes Mishka from coast to coast competing in shows,
and he wins just about every show he enters _ so many that
Archuleta has lost count. She does all his trimming and grooming
herself.
</P>
<P>
   Mishka earned not only an American Kennel Club championship
title but a Canadian Kennel Club Championship title.
</P>
<P>
   In the Westminster show _ held at Madison Square Garden _ Mishka
competed against cocker spaniels in the ASCOB category _ any solid
color other than black. He came out first, meaning he best met the
standards for what the breed should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mishka is a 100 percent-plus show dog,'' said Archuleta. ``A
once-in-a-lifetime dog. I'm just glad I had the opportunity to take
him there.''
</P>
<P>
   Archuleta became interested in showing dogs nearly 15 years ago
when she purchased her first purebred cocker spaniel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to know everything there is to know about the
breed,'' said Archuleta. ``Being in the world of purebreds, you
meet other people who show their dogs and AKC breeders. I just
learned grooming and showing from being their and experiencing it
all. It's become a passion of mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her first purebred, Archuleta has brought more than 50
dogs owned by other dog enthusiasts to champion status. She has
shown dogs throughout the country and gained a fair amount of
recognition for her achievements.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was how I became Mishka's handler,'' Archuleta said. ``I
knew the owners and they knew me from shows and they approached me
and asked me to handle Mishka.''
</P>
<P>
   Mishka is the father of four other champions, and Archuleta
handles them as well. She is working with them all in hopes of
taking another dog to Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all great and I hope that they will do as well as
their father,'' Archuleta said. ``It's hard to say. It takes a very
special dog to make it to Westminster but we just keep working at
it and hoping.''
