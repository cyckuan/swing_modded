INDIANS CRUSH YANKEES, 11-0

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Hideki Irabu should take some solace in the fact
that he went nearly three months of this season without being
routed. But when he absorbed the inevitable beating on Sunday
night, it was a rather spectacular event.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians blasted five home runs, four of more than
400 feet, and pounded the Yankees, 11-0, the most one-sided defeat
this season of the team with the game's best winning percentage
(.735). It was the Yankees' worst loss in a shutout since a 12-0
pasting by the California Angels on Aug. 27, 1988. The Indians'
Bartolo Colon allowed three hits in eight innings, striking out 10.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu lasted three innings, his shortest outing of the season,
allowing five runs that pushed his earned run average to 2.19 from
1.68. If this was, indeed, an All-Star Game audition for Irabu
(6-3), throwing in front of Cleveland and American League Manager
Mike Hargrove, Irabu did not exactly distinguish himself.
</P>
<P>
   None of the Yankees did, a truth reflected in their body
language. Chuck Knoblauch, pinned in a minor slump, shaking his
head in disgust after grounding into a doubleplay. Derek Jeter
smashing his glove against the ground after botching a would-be
double-play grounder. Paul O'Neill angrily waving his arm at an
ESPN cameraman to aim his lens at something other than the sullen
Yankees in their dugout. They figure to be in a collective foul
mood Monday, when they open a week in which they will play four
games against the Atlanta Braves and three against the Mets at Shea
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu was consistent in his first 11 starts, never permitting
more than three runs, never giving up more than one home run, and
he was armed with extra reason to beat the Indians, besides the
possibility of nailing down a spot on the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   After Cleveland knocked him around a bit last year, David
Justice, the Indians outfielder, sniffed that he did not understand
the hype, that Irabu was not anything special. One person in the
Yankees' organization predicted that if Irabu had the chance,
Justice might find a fastball planted in his ribs on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   It would not have been a bad night to get hit by Irabu: He
simply did not have a good fastball, a pitch he relies on. Irabu
cut short his pregame warm-up; when he walked in, Colon was still
throwing in the Indians' bullpen, even though Colon had to take the
mound first. Irabu's fastball, typically 93 to 95 miles an hour,
was usually clocked from 86 to 88 mph on Sunday night, and only a
few times did he break 90 mph.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians swung at and missed just one of Irabu's first 39
pitches. He was ripe for the picking, and oh, did they ever hit him
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Cleveland's Manny Ramirez engaged his teammate
Jim Thome in a contest of strength in batting practice, and they
took turns crushing moon shots all over the stands at Jacobs Field
_ fine preparation for Ramirez's at-bat in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu threw a fastball on a 3-2 count, Ramirez swung and the
sound he made while making contact probably sickened every pitcher
within earshot. Chad Curtis, playing center field for the Yankees,
raced back to the fence in right-center, launched himself above the
wall, glove extended _ and the ball carried over his head by a good
30 or 40 feet, landing some 15 or 20 rows into the stands.
Estimated distance: 421 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu tried three straight fastballs against the next batter,
Mark Whiten, who fouled off the first two and made that same awful
sound on the third. Curtis raced back directly to the center field
fence, braced himself for a monumental leap _ and didn't bother.
The ball carried over his head by 20 feet or so, landing halfway
between the pitcher's mound and the plate in the Cleveland bullpen.
Estimated distance: 419 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Two runners were on base with one out in the third inning _
including Justice, who was walked twice by Irabu _ when Ramirez
strolled to the plate and picked out a fastball. Whock. Curtis
raced back directly to the center field fence, braced himself,
leaped _ and the ball dropped just over the wall. Estimated
distance: 401 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu threw 70 pitches in the first three innings and the
Yankees were losing, 5-0, and it was a good time to give Irabu the
rest of the night off and let him get on with his life; he didn't
have it.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Holmes relieved in the bottom of the fourth, and the
first batter for Cleveland was Travis Fryman. A fastball, a hard
swing. The beastly sound. Curtis began racing back to the wall, and
stopped, looking up. Fryman's monster drive crash-landed behind the
decorative row of trees in right-center, a 439-foot shot, and
Cleveland finished with 2,058 feet in home runs when Shawon Dunston
hit a sub-400 foot homer in the eighth inning. &QL;

JACKSON MAKES IT OFFICIAL: HE WON'T COACH BULLS NEXT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phil Jackson has officially informed the Chicago Bulls that he
will step down as head coach, the first step in what could become
the dismantling of the National Basketball Association's reigning
dynasty. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During Jackson's nine-year tenure as coach of the Bulls, the
team gained unprecedented global popularity and dominated the NBA,
winning six championships in the last eight seasons. Chicago won
its sixth title with a Game 6 victory over the Utah Jazz last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had feuded in recent seasons with the team's owner,
Jerry Reinsdorf, and general manager, Jerry Krause, and his shaky
status with the Bulls had been linked to the futures of their
superstars, Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, who can both become
free agents. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Jackson's agent, Todd Musberger, said on Sunday night that
Jackson had met privately with each of the players and that their
decisions regarding whether to stay with the team next season would
be made independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been such a great run,'' Musberger said. ``Phil has
been such a great ambassador for the game and for Chicago. I hope
that when Chicago wakes up to the news after mourning just a little
bit, they will step back and feel great pride in his
accomplishments and all the entertainment he provided. He won with
grace and dignity and Phil goes out that way, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for Krause and Jordan on Sunday night were not
returned. Jackson could not be reached for comment. In the days
following the Bulls' conquest of the Jazz, Jackson spoke of an end
to the team's championship run, and Pippen insisted that he would
not return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Phil never wants to feel responsible for keeping
somebody out of the game,'' Musberger said. ``He has had a series
of private conversations with the players, and all of the
principals, Michael, Scottie, Dennis Rodman, will make their
decisions on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on this past season, they all understood that there may
come a time when each might have to make an individual decision
that took them in a course that varied from other guys. Nothing
that Phil has done is being done in an effort to force anybody else
to do something, and the same is true of the players' decisions.
They are going to do what is best for them and they fully support
Phil in doing what is best for himself.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Musberger said that Jackson met with Reinsdorf and Krause last
week and that Reinsdorf offered Jackson an opening to return. But
the offer came after an often acrimonious relationship had
deteriorated to the point that Jackson felt comfortable in walking
away from the best team in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds for the decision were sown a year ago, when similar
speculation ended with Jackson accepting an offer to return for one
more year.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really have to do is go back a year ago and realize
that we were met with opening remarks from the Bulls that if they
did a deal with Phil for the '97-'98 season, that it would be the
last deal that they would do and would be for one year,'' Musberger
said. ``We took their word for it and never expected any other
outcome.''

GROUP ACCUSES THEME PARK OF `DANGEROUS' SECURITY PROBLEMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By SHERRY JOE DAVIS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; VALENCIA, Calif. _ Church administrator Tim Mossholder got the
ride of his life at Magic Mountain recently. But it wasn't the ride
he paid for _ and he hopes he never has to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   Mossholder, his wife and their three young children were among
more than 1,400 members of the Southern California Foursquare
Churches who were at the theme park 25 miles north of downtown Los
Angeles last month when 60 sheriff's deputies and a helicopter were
called in to quell an unruly crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The parishioners said that rowdy teens swept through the roller
coaster park May 30, fighting, trampling visitors, smoking
marijuana and cutting into lines for rides.
</P>
<P>
   In a six-page letter last week to park officials, Mossholder
said security was ``woefully and dangerously inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tense environment. It was a violent environment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Mountain officials deny the incident was as violent as it
appeared to Mossholder and insist they have adequate security to
deal with problems.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is one of a series that have forced park officials
to re-evaluate and increase security measures in and around the
260-acre park in recent years. In April, a 15-year-old Fontana,
Calif., youth was fatally shot. Five years ago, hundreds of teens
rioted after being denied admittance to a rap concert in the park,
causing more than 40 injuries and thousands of dollars in damage to
local businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the park safe for visitors _ while maintaining an open
atmosphere of fun _ is an ongoing concern for park officials, say
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and area leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Mountain sends its security guards to anti-gang
conferences, and park managers meet regularly with sheriff's
officials to review security policies. Later this month, for
instance, both sides will review their handling of the May 30
incident, said Lt. Carl Deeley of the Santa Clarita Valley
sheriff's station.
</P>
<P>
   There is some progress to show for their efforts. During the
past two years, crimes have dropped in the park. From June 1996 to
May 1997, there were 76 serious crimes, compared to 62 serious
crimes for the same period the following year. Serious crimes
include homicide, aggravated assault and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Deeley, who oversaw the emergency response during the May 30
incident, said the park is one of the safest around.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do an excellent job,'' said Deeley, a 20-year veteran of
security operations throughout the country. ``Magic Mountain is the
best I've seen in the way they enforce the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Theme park consultant Dennis Speigel said Magic Mountain's
troubles are a result of its teen-age clientele and location in a
culturally diverse metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Mountain does almost 3million people or more a year.
You're going to get a couple of bad apples,'' said Speigel,
president of Cincinnati-based International Theme Park Services.
``You get these types of problems in bigger, cosmopolitan
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   He said amusement parks are not immune to the problems facing
larger society.
</P>
<P>
   ``When kids bring guns to schools and shoot students and
teachers in a very structured environment, I can see why it happens
in theme parks,'' Speigel said.
</P>
<P>
   Park problems tend to occur on crowded days, said Jan Heidt,
mayor of neighboring Santa Clarita, who tried to persuade Magic
Mountain to carry anti-gang messages on its in-house television
system after the April 1993 melee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the circumstances are always the same, and the No. 1
factor is that the park is overcrowded,'' Heidt said. ``I don't
think their public relations can stand any more of these incidents,
particularly with summer coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Park spokesman Andy Gallardo said while the park had an unusual
number of visitors May 30, security guards were able to control the
crowd. Deeley said there may have been as many as 30,000 people at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies arrested 11 people and helped move out visitors,
shutting down the park about an hour before its usual closing time.
</P>
<P>
   Security efforts have been beefed up since the incident. The
park has doubled its security staff, employed law enforcement
officials to help screen crowds for potentially troublesome
visitors, added lights and security towers in the parking lot and
increased the number of closed-circuit televisions in and around
the park.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they have apologized and offered to refund the
church group's discounted $20 tickets. But they say the incident
never reached the level of violence described by Mossholder and
other church members.

   &LR; ``He had a very unpleasant experience in our park, and we'e
extremely sorry for that,'' Gallardo said. ``But if any of these
accusations are true, someone would have gone to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   Several members of the Southern California Foursquare Churches
have a different view.
</P>
<P>
   Mendy DeMoss, a youth leader with Trinity Church in Burbank,
said she and fellow parishioners were swept into a mob of
teen-agers shouting gang affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were terrified and running,'' said DeMoss, who had two
teen-age girls with her. ``I put my arms around them and told them
everything was going to be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   DeMoss said the park was so crowded that it reminded her of the
congestion immediately following a Los Angeles Dodgers game. She
said she saw no security guards until she and the girls reached the
park's entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were unprepared for the situation,'' DeMoss said. ``I
thought someone was going to get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Youth pastor Louie Reed, who brought 30 to 40 teen-agers from
the Monterey Park Christian Center, said he will not return to
Magic Mountain. He said security guards were hard to find, so busy
were they pursuing rowdy teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did see security trying to find some of them, but it was too
much, and they were overloaded,'' Reed said. ``We're not going
back. I can't ensure their safety. What I saw was not good and was
dangerous. It was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gallardo said the park did respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption that security officers did not do anything
about (complaints of fights) is ludicrous,'' he said. ``We turn
away people everyday, and we will not hesitate to throw people out.
That all goes down to our zero-tolerance policy for misbehavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Mossholder said park officials are spinning the day's events to
put Magic Mountain in the best light. He said church members will
avoid the park until officials can guarantee visitors' safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officially, they have not yet acknowledged that anything
happened in the park,'' Mossholder said. ``Their official statement
is woefully lacking and misinterpreting the facts of the day. It
was atypical. It was not a typical day.''

MUTINY'S MASTERY OF BURN CONTINUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Injuries are piling up, the minor-league roster is
being plucked almost weekly, and the offense has been, well,
offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even the worst team in Major League Soccer is landing
punches on the Dallas Burn.
</P>
<P>
   Short two of its own stars because of the World Cup, Tampa Bay
(4-12) has earned half of its season victories against Dallas (8-7)
after last night's listless 1-0 victory at the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The paceless contest played on an oven-hot field saw neither
team truly assert itself until Tampa Bay's Steve Ralston found
former SMU player Alan Prampin for the 50th-minute game winner.
Prampin slammed in Ralston's rolling cross along the left endline.
</P>
<P>
   In the 55th minute, forward Dante Washington (severe ankle
sprain) became the eighth Burn starter to be sidelined recently
because of injury or yellow-card accumulation. Tampa Bay's Chris
Houser ran over Washington's ankle on a collision that sent both
out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Heat-related cramps and fatigue slowed the action on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a blow dryer out there,'' Prampin said. ``It took
a toll on both teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Washington left Damian as the Burn's only playmaker,
and the Tampa Bay defense collapsed on him each time down the
field. The Burn's best scoring try came, though, before Washington
went down.
</P>
<P>
   In the 43rd minute, Damian's corner kick found Ted Eck from 12
yards out. Lying face-up over the goal line, defender Jan
Eriksson's right foot blocked Eck's header by an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Damian's five attempts missed wide or high, and the
fifth was saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had guys who could barely stand up out there,'' Burn coach
Dave Dir said. ``We only had the same 11 guys we had in Chicago \Ra
1-0 loss\S. We gave everything we had, but to be honest, it wasn't
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay was without Frankie Hejduk and Roy Wegerle, both of
whom are at the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been taking a lot of hits, but I don't think the Grim
Reaper's here yet,'' said Dir, whose team has lost five of seven
matches. ``We're gonna find out who has character on this team, and
whoever doesn't will have to go. It's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Burn, it was a lineup that shouldn't have been. Reserve
forward Mickey Trotman was making his first MLS start, and defender
Richard Farrer was forced back into action prematurely with a groin
pull.
</P>
<P>
   In for Washington was Juan Sastoque, an MLS Project-40
developmental program player. Burn farmhand Chad Brown, summoned
this weekend from New Orleans of the A-League, logged 16 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just an ugly game,'' Dir said. ``Injuries aren't why we
lost. It's not an excuse, just a fact. \RTampa\S didn't play any
better. They beat us down the field once.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks with MLS about replacing marquee Burn midfielder Alain
Sutter (hip sprain) are ongoing. Sutter's 10-game absence has taken
a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys we've got injured, we might not get back,''
Dir said. ``This is the team that has to play better, or they're
not going to win a lot of games.''

CELL PHONE USER SUES OVER DISCONNECTION DURING CARJACKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
 
  
By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- When Marcia Spielholz realized that her BMW was
about to be carjacked, she reached for the only weapon she had: her
cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   All she wanted was a 911 operator.
</P>
<P>
   All she got was a staccato ``beep-beep-beep'' indicating that
her call was not connecting. Over and over.
</P>
<P>
   With no one to head off the bandits at the pass, Spielholz was
cornered south of Beverly Hills, approached by two men. One of them
shot her in the face.
</P>
<P>
   She survived the 1994 incident and has filed three lawsuits
against L.A. Cellular.
</P>
<P>
   Spielholz contends that in the interest of larger profits,
cell-phone service providers allow dangerous gaps in service that
can cause unwanted disconnections, higher bills and _ in the most
extreme cases _ a busy signal when someone's life is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``She relied on the advertising that said a cellular phone would
protect her,'' Spielholz's attorney Mark Hiepler said. ``But these
phones are sold to make money, not save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   An L.A. Cellular spokesman denied Spielholz's allegations. He
said the phone company works as hard as it can to provide
uninterrupted service but is often challenged by the limitations of
radio-based communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a dynamic system that's virtually impossible to
predict,'' said Steven Crosby, who is L.A. Cellular vice president
for external affairs. ``It's like watching the ocean _ you have
high tides, low tides and waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosby maintains that the phone industry should not be held
liable for random attacks like the one on Spielholz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a horrible situation, but we couldn't have prevented
those two thugs from following her,'' he said. ``A phone, a cop, a
suit of body armor _ sometimes nothing can stop terrible things
from happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Speilholz, formerly an attorney with MGM, is recovering from her
14th reconstructive surgery and could not be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever was caught for the carjacking. One of Spielholz's
lawsuits is scheduled to return to Los Angeles Superior Court on
July 16. The court file, already in its third thick volume,
explains her urban nightmare in detail.
</P>
<P>
   After her car was bumped by a black Nissan on Dec. 4, 1994,
Spielholz claims she was chased for 10 to 12 minutes, dialing 911
frantically as she weaved through Beverlywood, just north of the
Santa Monica Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police Capt. John Trundle said in court declarations
that there was an airborne helicopter in the area that could have
made it to her car in less than two minutes if she had reached an
emergency dispatcher.
</P>
<P>
   But the call couldn't get through, because L.A. Cellular's
32,000 square miles of coverage in Southern California was less
like a blanket and more like Swiss cheese, Hiepler claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly, L.A. Cellular willfully and intentionally chose
not to disclose this life-threatening information to its own
customers, and potential new subscribers, out of a desire to
maximize profits,'' Hiepler said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Crosby and Steve Carlson, executive director of the
Cellular Carriers Association of America. Cellular phone companies
make a point in their advertising of saying that connections might
be interrupted anytime, anywhere for a variety of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the lawsuit is Spielholz's contention that the
phone companies could provide blanket coverage if they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Spielholz said cellular phone companies each set up separate
transmitters and might have saved her from injury if they worked
together to route emergency calls to the strongest transmitter
available.
</P>
<P>
   Carlson said the theory is flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a technological standpoint it absolutely doesn't work,''
Carlson said. ``With digital phones you have several companies with
completely different technologies. They just don't mix and match.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission, which regulates the
cellular phone industry, has taken written arguments from both
sides and is currently looking into this ``strongest signal'' issue
for 911 calls. The agency will determine whether cellular telephone
companies should be required to pick up 911 calls regardless of
whether they come from one of their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Spielholz's personal injury lawsuit is set for trial in October,
but she doesn't plan to end her fight there.
</P>
<P>
   While she lobbies state and federal legislators for new laws to
protect cellular phone owners, Spielholz and her team of attorneys
filed a class-action lawsuit in February, claiming the gaps in
coverage are also taking a financial toll on cellular phone users.
</P>
<P>
   With cellular phone companies rounding up to the nearest minute,
even after a five-second call, they actually profit from
disconnections, Spielholz claims.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, L.A. Cellular attorneys claim the complaint
doesn't belong in state court and should be decided by Federal
Communications Commission officials instead.
</P>
<P>
   Spielholz's lawyer pledges to continue the fight no matter the
venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't in a canyon, she wasn't on a hill. She wasn't under
a building or out of their coverage area,'' Hiepler said. ``When
you're in the heart of the city you have a right to expect your
phone to work.''

JANZEN'S 2ND CROWN SIMILIAR TO '93 TRIUMPH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Some sequels lose their luster because they
stray too far from the original plot line. Not so in the case of
``Lee Janzen, U.S. Open Champion II''.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, who rallied from a five-stroke deficit in yesterday's
final round to hoist the Open trophy for the second time in five
years, leaned on elements at the Olympic Club that were crucial to
his 1993 triumph as well.
</P>
<P>
   He vanquished the same foil, Payne Stewart, and did so with a
timely chip-in and a fortunate encounter with a tree. Dig up the
script from Janzen's victory at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield,
N.J., and you'll also find a chip-in during crunch time. Not to
mention a flirtation with some thick branches that worked to
Janzen's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The fresh plot twist yesterday proved to be a big one, however.
Instead of holding off Stewart down the stretch, as he did five
years ago, Janzen authored the third-largest comeback in Open
history.
</P>
<P>
   Down five strokes to start the round, Janzen immediately dug
himself a deeper hole with consecutive bogeys at Nos. 2 and 3. That
put Janzen seven strokes in arrears with 15 holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, I didn't think I could win. But I had to suck
it up and go on. I knew if I gave up there, I'd be upset with
myself,'' said Janzen, who went on to record four birdies and 11
pars during a closing round of 68. ``So I kept plugging away and,
somehow, I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart helped open the door by backsliding with a five-bogey,
one-birdie round. A wire-to-wire leader through 54 holes, Stewart
coughed up the lead for the first time in the tournament with a
bogey from the rough at No. 13, then squared matters again with a
15-foot birdie putt at No. 14.
</P>
<P>
   With the players tied, Janzen headed to the 17th tee box, where
he had taken a bogey and two double bogeys in the first three
rounds. This time, Janzen found the fairway and salvaged par.
Moments later, Stewart pushed a 7-iron approach from the 16th
fairway into a greenside bunker and took bogey.
</P>
<P>
   When Janzen parred No. 18 to finish the tournament at even-par
(280), he held a one-stroke lead as Stewart played the final hole.
Given one last chance to force a playoff, Stewart's 20-foot birdie
putt slid left at the last moment and Janzen had become the 18th
player in history to win multiple Open titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I bring out the best in Lee Janzen,'' said Stewart,
who lost by two strokes in the 1993 Open. ``There was nobody in
contention who shot under par in the final round except for him. He
deserves to be the champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen got his first inkling that the tournament could be
heading in his direction when his tee shot at No. 5 stuck in a
tree. Told by spectators of his fate, Janzen made a U-turn toward
the tee box and hit his third shot. Before he could get there, a
gust of wind nudged his ball out of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   Given a chance to play his original tee shot, Janzen hacked out
of the deep rough and airmailed the par-4 green with his third
shot. But he discovered his ball sitting up in the rough and
chipped in for par from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart called it ``an all-world par ... maybe the greatest par
in the history of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen thought of something else. In the final round at
Baltusrol in 1993, he had survived an errant shot that somehow
skittered through the branches of a tall tree and salvaged par on
the 10th hole. He had also chipped in for birdie at No. 16 to break
a deadlock with Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started thinking, `Payne Stewart, a chip-in and a ball in
the tree. Where have I seen this before?' '' said Janzen, who went
on to repeat the Baltusrol outcome by draining three birdie putts
from six feet (No. 7), eight feet (No. 11) and five feet (No. 13).
Combined with a 20-footer at No. 4, they proved to be enough to
bring Janzen back from 4-over to even-par within a 10-hole stretch.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be more than Stewart could handle. The only
player with an under-par total through 54 holes, Stewart remained
in red numbers until his drive at No. 12 rolled into a sand-filled
divot in the fairway.
</P>
<P>
   After a lengthy deliberation, Stewart hit a 9-iron into a
green-front bunker and was told by U.S. Golf Association rules
official Tom Meeks that he had taken too long to play his shot and
would be assessed a one-stroke penalty if a similar delay occurred
during his round. The news, said Stewart, ``did not sit well'' and
he responded on the next hole by knocking a 5-iron over the green
at the par-3 13th hole, setting up the bogey that gave Janzen his
first lead of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen took care of matters thereafter. He hit his final 10
fairways and his last eight greens in regulation to seal the
victory. And he cried during his acceptance speech, just like at
Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a dream of mine to win the U.S. Open the first time,''
Janzen said. ``Since then, not a day has gone by that I didn't
dream about winning it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the sequel is complete, with a familiar final scene: Janzen
over Stewart. Just like in Baltusrol.

MARINERS CAN'T SEEM TO MAKE DECISIVE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ What the heck. The Mariners were never a spring kinda
team anyway.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting they are capable of fall ball, either. They
are, however, 1-0 this summer.
</P>
<P>
   As the old baseball sage, Chairman Mao, once observed, the
journey back from a thousand losses begins with a single step.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's step was the winning of a series. The 10-5 victory gave
them a 2-1 weekend conquest of the Oakland A's. In recent years,
taking a series from the A's at the Kingdome would have been a rank
disappointment, like allowing Peter McNeeley to lay a glove on the
champ.
</P>
<P>
   These days, of course, the Mariners are hanging from the ropes,
squinting through swollen eyes hoping to spot the difference
between the ref and the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners connected Sunday. They also have lost a lot of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have redefined rock bottom,'' said Alex Rodriguez, ``by
underachieving so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner shortstop had just completed a 4-for-5 afternoon and
stole his 18th base, so you can tell momentary success died not
obscure the enormity of the task.
</P>
<P>
   Two small things take fresh measure of the plight of the Rock
Bottoms:
</P>
<P>
   With seven wins, including Sunday's resolute effort following
injury, Billy Swift is the starting staff's leading winner.
</P>
<P>
   And to replace a third baseman who leaks more than either George
Karl or Ken Starr, the Mariners' only viable option was to call up
a 34-year-old journeyman minor leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   No disrespect to Rico Rossy, who filled in well Sunday in his
first start at third replacing Russ Davis, but the guy has 236
major league at-bats in a 13-year pro baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rossy call-up is, apparently, the only kind of move the
Mariners are able or willing to make. Bad as the season has been _
Sunday was the 12th win in the last 38 games _ it is the inability
to do anything substantive to stop the free fall that is most
annoying to Mariner fans.
</P>
<P>
   Beset by age, injuries, heavy contracts, a ravaged upper farm
system, an ownership-imposed salary cap, the Randy Johnson mess and
below-average years for numerous players, the Mariners have nowhere
to go for help. A handful of untouchables on a roster with a
preponderance of unloadables is the worst possible fix to be in for
a team with big expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Even a Johnson trade near next month's trading deadline will by
then bring only prospects instead of the immediate help that would
have come in a trade last month or last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what it is like to break the emergency glass and find no
fire alarm behind it, Lou Piniella smiled wanly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't want to talk about that,'' said the Mariner
manager, more resignation than rancor in his voice. After many
years as an employee of George Steinbrenner as well as Marge
Schott, Piniella is far too adroit in the matter of house politics
to spill for publication his view of the Mariner paralysis.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite this turgid state of affairs, more than 115,000 fans
forsook the weekend's atmospheric glories to come inside and watch
the Mariners twist in the wind against one of baseball's most
unglamorous teams. Say what you will, Seattle fans no longer know a
bad team when they see one. The Mariners are off more than 150,000
from last year's record attendance pace, the American League's
second-biggest drop behind the Chicago White Sox, but have played
badly enough to have lost half a million, particularly given the
absence of substantive change.
</P>
<P>
   They have become the baseball equivalent of Baylor football _
about two touchdowns behind Texas _ but most of the fans have hung
in. They don't even boo much when the bullpen stirs.
</P>
<P>
   Has somebody decaffeinated the local coffee? Or have the
season's results been so dispiriting that the the Kingdome has
become a giant Prozac pill?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, as Rodriguez suggests, the fans are aware of something
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the law of averages,'' he said. ``We have too many good
players for this. If everybody in the clubhouse stays on an even
keel, things can turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, our problems aren't from a lack of intensity. In
fact, it may be too much intensity. Everybody's trying so hard, it
creates its own problems.''
</P>
<P>
   One guy with few problems is the oft-injured Swift, a
36-year-old spring-training pickup who in his last six starts has a
5-1 record with an ERA under 2.00. Blasted out of his last start by
a comebacker that nearly went through his upper chest, Swift
betrayed no ill effects, but remained a little bewildered by his
status as ace by default.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me,'' he said, ``but not so good for the rest of
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would have said if he were told in spring training
that by Father's Day Swift would have been his big winner, Piniella
said, ``I would have begged to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Turns out Piniella has done his begging elsewhere, to no good
end. Absent outside help, beating the Irans of baseball is one way
to get reintroduced to the law of averages.
</P>
<P>
   A major-league team cannot ride long the twin Clydesdales of
Billy Swift and Rico Rossy.
</P>

JANZEN CAPTURES U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When the final scores were posted Sunday at The
Olympic Club, all the red leaderboard numbers had been tossed
aside. The 98th U.S. Open turned into Men in Black, the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Victory went to a par-shooter, a boyish-looking guy actually
dressed conservatively in blue and gray, a player who has done this
before.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen withstood the test of something alien to most golfers
_ four-inch rough mixed with ultimate pressure. When a week of
nonstop pars and bogeys was over, he had beaten three-round leader
Payne Stewart by a stroke to claim his second U.S. Open title in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen didn't so much tame the Open, this time played across the
street from the Pacific Ocean, as ride it out like a wild wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Olympic Club really won,'' Stewart said. ``Only
one person was even-par for the tournament. I think this club stood
up to the challenge of the Open championship.''
</P>
<P>
   As did Janzen. It wasn't a Billy Casper comeback, but the
Minnesota native earned his eighth PGA Tour victory, and first in
three years, by rallying from seven strokes off the pace over the
final 15 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a 2-under 68, Janzen was one of just six players to
break par Sunday, and the only one in contention. Still, this Tony
Robbins TV pitchman and disciple had his comfort zone shaken
slightly when he bogeyed two of his first three holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I could win, but after I got a birdie on four I
felt much better,'' he said, getting emotional in the trophy
presentation. ``Somehow I did it. There hasn't been a day gone by
that I haven't thought about winning it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pocketing a check for $535,000 and finishing with a 280 total,
the 33-year-old Janzen became the 15th different victor in the past
15 majors, as well as the 18th player to win the U.S. Open more
than once. His career earnings now total $6,241,113.
</P>
<P>
   On a stuffy, overcast day in the Bay Area, Janzen used a little
magic, but mostly undying resilience. He stuck a ball in a tree on
the fifth hole, was ready to concede to a two-stroke penalty and
watched as a gust of wind shook it free. He chipped in from the
greenside rough. Instead of a double bogey and maybe certain
defeat, he parred. Mother Nature should get a cut of his winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how good that felt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen caught and passed a struggling Stewart on the backside
with birdies at 11 and 13, settled into a momentary tie with the
man in the knickers and prevailed by parring his final five holes.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a scoreboard watcher, Janzen purposely shielded his
eyes from all the posted black numbers over the final six holes,
determined to keep his focus. Walking off the 18th, he finally
found out where he stood. The crowd erupted with a roar as the
greenside scoreboard flipped over, indicating that Stewart had
dropped a shot on 16.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Stewart had a 20-foot birdie putt on the 18th to
tie and force a Monday playoff, but it narrowly missed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nice choke,'' a fan yelled after the shot curled to the left.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, however, didn't flinch or even glance in his
detractor's direction. He remained outwardly philosophical rather
than downcast sitting in a crowded room full of reporters,
readdressing his failure and 1-over 281 effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to change my life,'' he said. ``I'm
disappointed I didn't win, but I didn't play well enough to win.
Life goes on. I hit six fairways, Lee Janzen hit 12. I hit nine
greens, Lee Janzen hit 14. Bingo. That's why I didn't win the golf
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, winner of the 1991 U.S. Open and 1989 PGA Championship
but a very average player since, had been terrific over the first
three rounds at the Olympic. But all he could do was hang on until
the 12th. Then a sand-filled divot put a big hole in his game.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a tee shot down the middle, only to have it stop in
a repaired divot. Most players have asked that their fairway divots
remain untouched, with the sand and fertilizer mixture used as fill
actually serving as mini bunkers. Or that they receive a free drop
from the broken ground.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart sent his second shot into a true bunker right of the
green and he bogeyed. His outright lead was gone for good.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Janzen also outdueled Stewart in the final round to win
the U.S. Open at Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield, N.J. There
were other similarities in his victories. Both offered clutch
chip-ins and miracle plays involving trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where have I heard this before?'' Janzen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I bring the best out of Lee Janzen,'' said Stewart,
who as runner-up accepted a check for $315,000.
</P>
<P>
   No one else was within three strokes of the top two finishers.
Bob Tway shot a final-round 73 and finished in third at 4-over 284,
good for $201,730.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lehman, considered the best player never to win a major,
played in the final group with Stewart but couldn't get going in
the final round, slicing his first shot into the trees. Lehman shot
a final-round 75 and a 6-over 206 total.
</P>
<P>
   He now has finished tied for sixth, third, tied for second and
third in the past four U.S. Opens, shooting over par in each of his
Sunday rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The momentum never got going in our group,'' Lehman said. ``It
was uncomfortable. I'm really disappointed because I know I was
right there knocking at the door again.''

<P>
   On Father's Day, Janzen ended a four-year victory drought. He
had started to question when his next win might come. He had had
the luxury of winning eight tournaments over a four-year span, then
nothing. He had grown impatient, especially after blowing the
Players Championship this year and the Greater Vancouver Open in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   As he gripped the silver trophy tightly, with his wife and young
son nearby, all the doubts about his game had disappeared as
quickly as the red numbers on the Olympic scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win the trophy that I wanted to win more than any other
trophy, for the second time is just ... it's too much,'' he said.
``To win the U.S. Open twice, you can't do anything better than
that, as far as I'm concerned. That's the best I can do.''

MARINERS RALLY TO BURY OAKLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Stop the presses. Phone Beijing, or at least the Elias
Sports Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in front of a Fathers Day crowd of 37,665, the Mariners
ended a streak that was beginning to threaten the longevity of the
Kennewick Man. They recorded a come-from-behind victory, 10-5 over
the Oakland A's, something they hadn't done since May 12 in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was that this year?'' joked reserve infielder Jeff Huson.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it wasn't a rally from a five-run deficit. It came after
Seattle trailed 3-2 in the fifth inning. But it was the Mariners'
first comeback win in 38 games, or since the one day this year they
have been over .500.
</P>
<P>
   In this go-figure season, it made sense that a fellow named Rico
Rossy was the ignition that led to eight unanswered Mariner runs,
bringing them their first series victory after six consecutive
failures in June.
</P>
<P>
   That's Rico Rossy, who is not a California varietal, but a
34-year-old utility infielder who hadn't played in a big-league
ballpark since 1993. Called up from Tacoma and inserted into the
troublesome third base spot, Rossy homered to left to tie the game
at 3-3 in the fifth, and soon the M's were cruising.
</P>
<P>
   Rossy probably shouldn't get too comfortable _ Huson says the
sprained finger that kept him from starting is almost healthy _ but
then, Rossy is used to that.
</P>
<P>
   Signed originally by Baltimore in 1985, he spent time in seven
minor-league cities before finally making it to Atlanta in 1991. He
got a single at-bat with the Braves and struck out.
</P>
<P>
   He was traded to Kansas City before the '92 season and had 235
at-bats in two seasons, hitting a combined .216. Power is not his
calling card; he had three major league homers before his shot
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a matter of time and opportunity,'' Rossy said.
``Don't throw it away, don't waste it. I'm not going to get another
one, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his 56 games in Tacoma, 51 were starts at shortstop, but
Rossy has spent some time at third. He hit .409 in spring training
for the M's this year but fell victim to Huson's versatility and
experience and was sent out.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russ Davis fighting fielding problems and Huson's
finger injured last week in Anaheim, the Mariners called up Rossy
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always think of ways they could use me up there in a
certain fashion, but it doesn't happen,'' Rossy said. ``If I was
going to go through a whole year down there again, then turn 35
(next February), it would be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   It must have been tough, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play winter ball every year,'' said the native Puerto Rican.
``That has a lot to do with staying in the game. If I'd been one of
the guys who goes to another job in the offseason, I might have
said, `Don't go back.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most veteran guys on a veteran team, Rossy still was
struck by the moment Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured after 12 or 13 years of playing this game, I wasn't
going to get butterflies,'' he said. ``But everybody gets them.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day when Edgar Martinez hit the Mariners' 119th homer of
the season and Alex Rodriguez had four hits, it was left to one of
the other club old-timers, Billy Swift, to swatch together the
pitching victory.
</P>
<P>
   After a start in Anaheim truncated by a line drive off his
chest, Swift didn't have quite the devilish sinker he usually
throws _ only five of the 19 outs he recorded came on groundouts _
but he was resourceful enough to last for 111 pitches and earn his
club-leading seventh victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a lot of breaking balls, changeups, cut fastballs,''
Swift said. ``My control (four walks and a hit batter) was the only
thing that bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just gets it done,'' catcher Dan Wilson said..
</P>
<P>
   The most pivotal pitch Swift threw all day, however, was a
sinker. Ahead 2-1 in the third, Swift was in major trouble after
Rodriguez failed to glove a liner for an error, allowing the A's to
load the bases with one out and ex-Mariner Mike Blowers at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   At a point when Blowers could have broken the game open, he
tapped a sinker back to the mound, and Swift started a 1-2-3 double
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big turnaround,'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   In the big picture, M's fans can't yet project anything like
that. Monday night, Seattle returns to interleague play with four
straight against the sizzling San Diego Padres, first two of which
are at the Kingdome.

PERISHO'S OUTINGS LIKELY TO FORCE RANGERS HAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Rangers expect second baseman Mark
McLemore to be reinstated from the 15-day disabled list today.
</P>
<P>
   That will require a roster move.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Matt Perisho likely simplified the Rangers'
impending decision.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho, whom the organization recalled Tuesday from Triple-A
Oklahoma, failed to complete the third inning for the second time
in as many starts during last night's 10-7 loss to the Angels at
Edison International Field of Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped the Rangers 2 1/2 games back of the American
League West-leading Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates declined to discuss the impending
move until meeting this morning with general manager Doug Melvin,
but Perisho's days appear numbered. Perisho, who surrendered 10
runs (nine earned) on 10 hits and five walks in 2 2/3 innings,
likely will be optioned to Triple-A Oklahoma today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the situation with my brutality on the mound the past
week,'' Perisho said, ``I would think the move is rather obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates plans to start right-hander Todd Van Poppel on Thursday
against the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix and expects injured
left-hander Darren Oliver to rejoin the rotation and start Friday
against the Giants in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves only the bullpen as an alternative for Perisho, and
the organization views the 23-year-old pitcher better served by
pitching in the RedHawks' rotation than being utilized in long
relief by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho helped put the Rangers at a 10-run disadvantage during
his 87-pitch appearance, and the Angels sent 21 men to the plate
during the second and third innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really baffled by what happened,'' said Perisho, whose
earned-run average rose from 23.14 to 27.00. ``The preparation was
there. The attitude was there. The commitment to the pitches was
there. I just didn't get the results.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers right-hander Al Levine did.
</P>
<P>
   Levine, who threw 50 pitches Saturday during three innings of
relief, gave the Rangers 3 1/3 scoreless innings yesterday and an
opportunity to chip away at the Angels' lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the ballgame planning not to use Levine,'' Oates
said. ``I asked Boz \Rpitching coach Dick Bosman\S to call and see
if Levine could give us anything. He got up and said he could give
us a couple of innings. Little did I know he would give us 3 1/3.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not fair to him. I don't want to do that to him. I
appreciate a pitcher's arm. It's the only way he has to make a
living.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine's performance this season and the continual struggle by
the rotation, though, might merit a start for the right-hander
sometime in the future, Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that during the ballgame, and I had plenty of
time to think,'' Oates said. ``I like Al where he is. We've talked
about how important that long man is and how he can help you in
other areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, it might not be as farfetched as you thought with
what I'm seeing. Today? No. Tomorrow? Probably not. Two weeks from
now? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine threw 69 pitches during a 4 2/3-inning appearance Tuesday
during the Rangers' 9-7 defeat to Oakland at The Ballpark in
Arlington, and at least one Rangers teammate suggested the
possibility of starting to Levine within the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been thrown at me before,'' Levine said. ``If it happens,
fine. If it doesn't, I'm happy where I'm at. I'll take the ball
whenever.''

US SOCCER QUEST COME TO ABRUPT END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; LYON, France _ They never saw themselves going out this way.
Not with a whistle blowing and scarlet-clad Iranians leaping off
the bench and hugging and kissing and weeping and thanking the
heavens. Not with one match left to play. Not two-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years,'' midfielder Cobi Jones said Sunday night after a
2-1 loss to Iran knocked the US soccer team out of the World Cup
before most of the world even knew it was here. ``And it's over in
a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans knew they had no chance of winning this
quadrennial kickball tournament. The London oddsmakers had them at
150-1, down with the rest of the ``minnows.'' Their own federation
president said before they even crossed the Atlantic that it was
unrealistic to expect the US to make it to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   But two-and-out? Never. ``We figured we could get a point
against Germany,'' midfielder Tab Ramos was saying, as his
blazer-clad mates filed past him, tight-lipped and red-eyed, to the
bus. ``We figured we could get three points against Iran. Then we'd
play Yugoslavia and see what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when less was expected, the Yanks had
overachieved. They had made it to the second round and lost by one
goal to eventual champion Brazil. The draw was tougher this time
and they were playing overseas and yet ...
</P>
<P>
   They never thought they would lose Sunday night. Iran had not
been to a World Cup in 20 years. The sport had gone moribund there
for nearly a decade after the Islamic revolution and during the war
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians had needed a miracle even to qualify. They had been
through three coaches since November. They had lost by six goals
last month to Rome's club team, which was only supposed to be a
sparring partner. They did not expect to win a match here. All the
Iranians hoped for was to lose with honor. ``If we die,'' coach
Jalal Talebi said, after they'd lost their opener to Yugoslavia,
``we die standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans ever thought it would be easy. They knew
how much beating Uncle Sam meant back in Tehran. They knew the
Iranians would play themselves into the ground. But the Americans
thought that if they loaded their lineup with attackers and kept
coming, coming, coming, they would win.
</P>
<P>
   So they came with guns blazing. They controlled the ball for 34
minutes, 20 of them in the attacking zone. They took 27 shots.
Brian McBride hit the crossbar. Claudio Reyna hit the right post.
David Regis hit the left post. Frankie Hejduk nearly blew a hole
through the keeper's gut from sawed-off shotgun range. Nothing. Not
until 87 of the 90 minutes had ticked down and Iran was already up
by two goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we didn't win that game,'' Ramos said, shaking
his head. ``I don't remember a game with so many chances and
scoring just one goal. The ball just didn't want to go in the back
of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for lack of audacity, or lack of sweat. ``We did what
we set out to do,'' coach Steve Sampson said. ``Attack and get
behind them. We played to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It came down, the Iranians agreed, to the bounce of the ball.
``You deserved to be a winner, too,'' coach Jalal Talebi graciously
told Sampson. ``But at the end of the day there can be only one
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans never dreamed it would not be them. Even though
they had struggled to qualify for the tournament, they had
developed a reputation for winning the important match _ or at
least not losing it. They had played down a man for much of a
qualifying match against Mexico in Mexico City's foul thin air and
managed a scoreless draw. They had beaten the Canadians by three
goals in Vancouver to get here. They figured they could win Sunday
night, even if the ball wasn't bouncing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams know how to win at this level,'' defender Marcelo
Balboa was saying. ``And we're a good team, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   They are still not good enough to get a result, even after three
consecutive trips to the World Cup. Getting a result is a soccer
term for extracting exactly what you need out of a match. Three
points, one point, or zero points with only one goal allowed. The
countries that win World Cups _ the Brazils, the Germanys, the
Italys, the Argentinas _ know how to get a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game where if Germany was down, 1-0, they
win, 2-1,'' mused playmaker Reyna. Indeed, the Germans were down,
2-0, to Yugoslavia Sunday afternoon with 16 minutes to play in the
broiling heat with an aging team at Lens. They managed a 2-2 draw.
They got a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, down, 1-0, lost, 2-1. So they'll fly to Nantes
Monday and sit around a seaside hotel for three days and wait to
play a match that will mean something in Belgrade but nothing in
Boston. They've canceled next weekend's just-in-case hotel
reservations in Montpellier and Toulouse. Come Friday, they'll put
on their blue blazers and neckties and fly home to a country that
will be watching baseball and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be 16 countries leaving here next week and we'll be
one of them,'' striker Roy Wegerle was saying, as Iranian drums
banged and cymbals clanged outside the Stade Gerland. ``No
disaster. It's life.''

JANZEN SHUTS OPEN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ They saluted Jack Fleck, Billy Casper, and Scott
Simpson as somewhat unlikely winners of the US Open at The Olympic
Club, now they have a picture of Lee Janzen to hang on the
clubhouse wall. He didn't beat Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer, or Tom
Watson as did his predecessors, but he seized the opportunity
Sunday to shoot a round for the history books and dash Payne
Stewart's dreams.
</P>
<P>
   It started off looking like a runaway, a romp by Stewart to his
second US Open championship. After three holes Sunday, Stewart's
lead was five shots and it seemed it would be a day void of
excitement. Then reality started to sink in and Janzen became a
tiger.
</P>
<P>
   After Stewart registered his first bogey at the fourth hole and
slid a putt past the cup on No. 7 for a second bogey and a
front-nine 37, the door was open. Janzen overcame two early bogeys
that left him seven shots astern and played the final 15 holes 4
under par to win his second US Open on a level par tour of
73-66-73-68_280. Isn't even what Watson predicted would win it
before the flag went up?
</P>
<P>
   Whether The Olympic Club setup was too severe, it certainly
demanded precision and a few bounces. Janzen got them when he
seemed to require them to remain in the hunt. Stewart played the
final 15 holes 4 over for a 74_281 finish. Bob Tway (73_284) ended
up third and Nick Price (73_285) was fourth. Paul Azinger went out
early and made eight birdies to shoot 65_289, while British Open
champion Justin Leonard carded just five birdies in four rounds,
finishing 14 over.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament came down to the 18th hole and Janzen was already
safely in the clubhouse. ``It was a dream to win another US Open,''
said Janzen, who added this triumph to his one at Baltusrol in
1993. ``There hasn't been a day that's gone by when I haven't
thought about winning it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart looked at the statistics and saw he had hit six
fairways, Janzen 12. Stewart hit nine greens, Janzen 14. ``That's
why I didn't win,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen began his move when he sank a treacherous right-to-left
putt from 20 feet with a 2-foot break on the fourth. He birdied the
seventh (sand wedge, 6 feet), then the 11th when his ball bounded
left off a hill and he holed an 8-foot putt. When he made another
right-to-left putt for birdie on the par-3 13th (5-iron, 5 feet) ,
he was there. Stewart's problems became compounded on the par-4
12th when his tee shot landed in a sand divot in the middle of the
fairway and he took two putts from 10 feet for a bogey. Stewart has
campaigned with the PGA Tour and United States Golf Association on
this issue, stating divots should be considered ground under
repair. That's where Janzen, three groups in front, overhauled him.
After making a birdie on the 14th (9-iron, 15 feet), Stewart
bogeyed out of a bunker on the par-5 16th. Stewart's second shot on
the 18th left him above the hole with a scary downhill putt. He had
to sink it to force a playoff and he saw it go past the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He led the tournament the whole way, and he slept on the lead
every night,'' said Janzen. ``I know how hard that is. He's got
some courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was a realist. ``I didn't go out and do what I had to do
to win the golf tournament,'' he said. Janzen's round was saved
when he hit his tee shot into the trees to the right of the No. 5
fairway. He couldn't find it but as he was walking back to the tee
to hit a provisional, the wind picked up the ball fell out of a
tree. ``I was thinking double bogey,'' Janzen said, ``and I chipped
in for par.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bogeys in Janzen's round were on the second hole, when
he flew an 8-iron second shot over the green and required two putts
from 25 feet, and the par-3 third, when his 5-iron bounded over a
bunker and he wound up sinking a 3-footer for a four. Then he
played the next 15 holes superbly and sat around watching the
television monitors. Stewart's putt on the 18th had to go in but
nobody in the final 15 groups had made a birdie on the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thinking about winning when I teed off,'' said
Janzen, ``and when I bogeyed two and three I just thought about
hitting good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's slide after leading for three days left him limp, but
in praise of The Olympic Club, where Hogan, Palmer, and Watson also
saw their dreams go by the boards. ``The golf course won,'' said
Stewart. ``Only one player in the whole field shot even par. I
thought the golf course lived up to its reputation. I kept trying.
I didn't quit, but I didn't play well enough.''

US GETS KICKED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ Iran remained composed in the highly charged
atmosphere of Stade Gerland, withstanding the pressure of a
must-win situation against an aggressive US team, to eliminate the
Americans, 2-1, Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians were superior technically, allowing them to use a
counterattacking strategy that paid off after early forays by the
United States failed.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid Estili scored first with a 40th-minute header and Mehdi
Mahdavikia converted a breakaway in the 84th minute as Iran gained
its biggest victory ever, and not only because this was the
country's first World Cup finals win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're elated,'' said Mahdavikia, a 20-year-old striker for
Pirouzi, Iran's most popular club. ``In the locker room we were all
crying. When I scored, I thought about my people. I think in Tehran
at the moment the people are in the streets, as they were during
our final qualification match.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which suffered its earliest World Cup finals
elimination since 1934, changed formations and tactics after an
opening 2-0 defeat against Germany. Coach Steve Sampson went to a
3-5-2 alignment, adding more experience and offensive orientation,
and the move nearly worked.
</P>
<P>
   But though the US hit the crossbar once and the post twice, Iran
had three other clear chances, including a controversial one by
Asian player of the year Khodadad Azizi in the 21st minute. Azizi,
one of three Germany-based Iranian professionals, broke past Thomas
Dooley and appeared to be fouled by goalkeeper Kasey Keller on the
edge of the penalty area. Keller could have been ejected and Azizi
awarded a penalty kick, but Swiss referee Urs Meier allowed play to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   This was a well-played game, wide open, with both teams eager to
go at the goal. After a pregame exchange of gifts and a group
photo, there was little excessively rough play or professional
fouling, except by the US' David Regis.
</P>
<P>
   There were spirited political protests against the Iranian
government in the stands, despite a FIFA directive against such
manifestations. But Iran, the last team to qualify for France '98,
exhibited the poise necessary to counter a hard-charging team such
as the US.
</P>
<P>
   ``They dominated the game most of the time,'' Iran coach Jalal
Talebi said of the US. ``Technically and tactically, they had it
over us. I congratulate Mr. Sampson; he deserves to be a winner. We
had fewer chances but we scored the goals and you did not, and that
is the only reason we won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very sensitive game and we knew they would be
playing hard and coming for the win. There was a lot of pressure on
our players and we were so excited. There were many things in the
media which made this match big and it was a little difficult to
get our nerve and play as well as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran, which will meet Germany in its final first-round game in
Montpellier Thursday, moved smoothly from defense into attack on
its first goal. Javad Zarincheh advanced from a deep position while
Ali Daei held possession. Zarincheh played a combination with Karim
Bagheri, then sent a soft cross to Estili, who was unmarked 15
yards from goal. Estili, who had played for Talebi in Singapore and
with Bahman in Iran, leaped to head into the far left corner of the
net in the 40th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The goal concluded the simplest of maneuvers. Zarincheh played a
short pass to Bagheri, then curled away from the goal, and defender
Dooley, toward the corner flag. Bagheri returned the pass
perfectly, and Zarincheh it chipped back toward the penalty arc. US
players, including Claudio Reyna, were drawn toward the end line by
Zarincheh's maneuver and caught flatfooted as Estili advanced.
Keller dove to his right but had no chance.
</P>
<P>
   The US had threatened, aggressive attacking from the start with
two forwards _ Brian McBride and Roy Wegerle _ plus Frankie Hejduk
and Cobi Jones on the wings, and the Tab Ramos-Reyna combination in
midfield. Joe-Max Moore added an attacking mentality in defensive
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   McBride nearly made the move pay off early as he headed a Ramos
free kick off the bar in the third minute.
</P>
<P>
   Reyna benefited from the changes, especially from Ramos's
playmaking, but failed to provide much substance, at least until he
slotted a shot off the right post in the 37th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did what we set out to do from the beginning, which was to
attack and get behind them,'' said Sampson, who could be coaching
the US for the last time when it meets Yugoslavia in Nantes
Thursday. ``We played to win and we took risks in order to get the
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The US played more patiently at the start of the second half,
using slow buildups to set up McBride as a target man and moving
Dooley into midfield. Preki entered in the 12th minute, with Ernie
Stewart, and quickly disconcerted the Iran defense. Reyna had a
close-in shot headed away by Khakpour and was wide with a scissors
kick. Dooley moved in for two headers near the goal area.
</P>
<P>
   Regis volleyed a Preki pass off the left post in the 28th
minute. And Iran soon began making changes. Azizi, carried off on a
stretcher after a hard tackle by Regis midway through the half, was
replaced by Ali Reza Mansourian.
</P>
<P>
   Iran struggled without its midfield leader and withdrew further
into a defensive shell, hoping to counter with Daei. The strategy
paid off as Abedzadeh blocked a Hejduk point-blank shot in the 34th
minute of the second half. Two minutes later, Daei held off Eddie
Pope, then laid off to Mahdavikia, who dribbled from the halfway
line, until Keller committed. Mahdavikia slotted the shot past
Keller's left hand.
</P>
<P>
   Daei nearly gave Iran a three-goal edge when he powered through
the gambling US defense and shot off Keller's hand, then had his
follow cleared off the line.
</P>
<P>
   The US went into all-out attack, and Preki sent a corner across
the goal mouth for McBride to head. Substitute Naim Saadavi stopped
the shot on the goal but could not clear it and Meier signaled the
score, then added three minutes of injury time. But the US could
not capitalize.

7TH INNING IS `BACKBREAKER' FOR OAKLAND 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Don't expect the A's to be very wowed by the Giants as
the two Bay Area teams square off over the next four days, first in
Oakland and then across the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have nearly the talent we have,'' former Giant
Kevin Mitchell said Sunday. ``They've got guys on that team I
haven't even heard of. But they've got a better record than we do.
I give Dusty (Baker) a lot of credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's (33-40) dropped two of three this weekend in Seattle,
losing 10-5 to the Mariners Sunday, but finished up their road trip
3-3 and have won six of their past 10. The Giants (44-32) have lost
eight of 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area says now we have a little rivalry going, so I'm
quite sure we'll be up for beating them, like they'll be trying to
get back on track,'' the A's Rickey Henderson said. ``But it's not
like it will be something extra, like the World Series. It won't do
a thing for bragging rights. If we beat them, that's probably more
satisfying for us, because they're in the race and we're trying to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The players downplay the rivalry, but there's no denying the
games at the Coliseum the next two nights will have more
electricity than most games in Oakland this year. Large crowds give
games a different feel, especially when it comes to crowd-pleasing
antics such as those Henderson unleashed Sunday in the first.
</P>
<P>
   He led off the game with a walk and then stole second. Catcher
Dan Wilson's throw skipped into center field, so Henderson scooted
down to third, reaching the bag just as Ken Griffey Jr.'s throw
arrived. The ball hit Henderson's shoulder and bounced away, giving
Henderson time to race toward home plate, despite being winded.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a classic Rickey Run,'' Henderson said. ``I didn't
want them to throw the ball around like that. It's the way to go,
running like that to try to make something happen. But when the
ball hit me in the shoulder, I was tired already. Ron Washington
said `Go!' I said, `Go?' One more base, I wouldn't have made it.''
</P>
<P>
   It mostly went downhill for the A's after that. Starter Mike
Oquist (4-4) gave up two runs in the second, but the A's came back
with single runs in the fourth and fifth to take a 3-2 lead. Then
Oquist got wobbly.
</P>
<P>
   He started the fifth by leaving a pitch up to No. 9 hitter Rico
Rossy, and that led to a solo shot to tie the game. Later in the
inning, after a couple of singles and a Griffey sacrifice fly,
Oquist left another pitch up, this time to Edgar Martinez, and
after a two-run homer it was 6-3 Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last two outings, I just haven't thrown the ball well,''
Oquist said. ``I was throwing well until the fifth. It was just two
pitches: They were right down the middle, belt high. They're going
to get hit. I don't know if it's my concentration level or not.
I'll get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's had thoughts of getting the game back, given the
wretched state of the Seattle bullpen, but two Jason Giambi
throwing errors in the seventh helped unleash another four-run
rally. T.J. Mathews' leadoff walk didn't help much either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate we had the one bad inning defensively,''
Giambi said. ``It kind of put a damper on a comeback.''
</P>
<P>
   So even when the A's scored twice in the eighth, getting a
run-scoring double from Miguel Tejada and an RBI single from Ryan
Christenson, it was hopeless. That A's lost out on a chance to
finish the trip with a winning record, building on their strong
start in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seventh was the back-breaker,'' manager Art Howe said.
``That's the one that took us out of the game. But we played .500
on the road trip. That's what you shoot for. It's a step in the
right direction.''

ADMINISTRATION TO CONDUCT TOBACCO SURVEY ON YOUTH SMOKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With a mammoth anti-smoking bill rebuffed in the
Senate, the Clinton administration is seeking to raise public
indignation against tobacco companies by publicizing which ones are
the most successful in marketing their brands to underage smokers,
an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the White House would announce on Monday that
the Department of Health and Human Services will conduct an annual
survey of smokers to determine the most popular cigarette brands
among youths ages 12 to 17.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will be conducted as part of the annual National
Household Survey on Drug Abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan, which was first reported in Monday's Washington
Post, was the administration's first new initiative on smoking
since the Senate failed to muster enough votes last week to halt
debate on the comprehensive anti-smoking bill the administration
favored.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat of the bill left the administration scrambling to
find ways to revive Clinton's campaign to reduce smoking,
especially among children under age 18.
</P>
<P>
   The bill's failure in the Senate was in large measure attributed
to a multimillion-dollar advertising blitz conducted by the tobacco
companies that generated public pressure on the Senate not to
support the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's new plan had been one of the provisions of
the failed anti-smoking bill. The bill, however, would have imposed
significant financial penalties on cigarette companies that failed
to reduce their sales to young smokers by 30 percent over five
years, and 60 percent over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the administration is hoping that the publicity
surrounding the survey will create enough public pressure to force
lawmakers to reconsider a new anti-smoking measure.  &QL;

GALLERY SHARES LEHMAN'S PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The allure of the U.S. Open, as articulated by
Paul Azinger, is that ``it's the peoples' tournament,'' embracing
the top professionals and any Tom, Dick or Harry who catches fire
during the qualifying process.
</P>
<P>
   The most egalitarian of golf's four majors had a clear-cut
peoples' choice during Sunday's final round at the Olympic Club's
Lake Course. Anybody grinding for that next paycheck, next
promotion, next sale or next break couldn't help but align himself
with Tom Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous gallery that gathered around the first hole shortly
after high noon was firmly behind Lehman, trying to push him over
the top by the sheer force of its cheers of ``Go, Tom,'' or ``This
is your year, Tom.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman felt the fans' passion, and by the end of the day they
would share his pain. You'd think after four straight years of
losing a U.S. Open on the last day, Lehman and his legions of fans
would be desensitized to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   But, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for the fans,'' Lehman said. ``I feel like they
were really pulling for me and I didn't give them what they
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Lehman didn't have the lead stuffed in his pocket like
a dollar bill on the final day this time, and then lose it
somewhere over the last few holes. This time victory eluded him
like a George Washington swept up in the wind. Lehman gave it chase
but every time he lunged for it, another gust got there first and
it flitted further from his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman bogeyed the first hole and the ninth and couldn't birdie
any in between on his way to a 5-over-par 75 that left him tied for
fifth place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I lost it,'' Lehman said. ``I just didn't win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did Payne Stewart, who began the day with a four-shot
advantage over Lehman and Bob Tway. He extended his lead to seven
after three holes but scrambled thereafter and bogeyed three of the
final seven holes to create an opening that a fast-closing Lee
Janzen (68) barely slid through.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen won his second U.S. Open championship while sitting in
the clubhouse when Stewart's bid for a birdie and a playoff slid
inches past the cup on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   You could say Lehman also lost this tournament by inches.
Because even though he finished six strokes behind Janzen and five
in back of Stewart, it likely would have shaped up as a different
day altogether if not for an 18-inch putt Lehman botched for par on
the first hole.
</P>
<P>
   It was an inexplicable gaffe on the easiest par-5 on the course.
And for Lehman, who was nervous to begin with, the three putt _
only the third he made all week _ was like adding hyper to his
tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``You step up to the first tee, you're nervous, let's face it,''
Lehman said. ``And when you miss a putt like that, it unsettles you
even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman stayed outwardly calm and it looked like the tide might
turn when, on the par-4 fourth hole, Lehman one-putted for a par
while Stewart was two-putting for a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   But that was as good as it would get on a day when Lehman didn't
seem at one with his putter, taking 32 strokes with his flat stick
or four more than he needed while fashioning his third-round 68.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Lehman couldn't get his drives and tee shots
to stay on the sloped fairways that the sun had baked until were as
hard as the crust on week-old sourdough bread. He missed seven
fairways and then, to add ire to irritation, hit only 10 greens in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I managed to hit just enough bad shots to struggle all day,''
Lehman said. ``I never got any momentum going from the very first
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Every golfer has days like that. Janzen had one, himself, in
late March when he took a lead into the final round of the Players'
Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., and shot his way out of
contention with a seven-over-par 79.
</P>
<P>
   After he accepted the championship chalice on the 18th green
Sunday, Janzen, in a voice cracking with emotion, said the wins,
when they come, erase all the bad shots and bad rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say that,'' Lehman said, smiling weakly, standing well
up the hill from the hoopla on 18, ``when he has won (the U.S.
Open) twice.''
</P>
<P>
   From Lehman's vantage point, he can focus on his four
consecutive final-round U.S. Open disappointments or zero in on the
memories of the last U.S. Open he played here, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was an assistant pro at Wood Ranch at the time, after
having failed in his first, second, third and fourth attempts to
keep his PGA Tour playing privileges.
</P>
<P>
   That was one British Open championship, two Ryder Cups and a few
million dollars ago.
</P>
<P>
   So it didn't sound at all like one man's self-delusion when
Lehman said, before heading home to Scottsdale, Ariz., ``I'll get
it right. I usually find a way to get it right.'' &QL;

GIANTS CAN'T SCORE A WIN AGAINST BROWN 
BY HENRY SCHULMAN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let the record show that at 2:54 in the
afternoon, on the 21st day of June in the year 1998 A.D., in the
city of St. Francis, the Giants finally scored a run at home
against pitcher Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Hamilton crossed the plate on a Barry Bonds groundout to
end a 32-inning goose-egg streak against the gangly right-hander,
but it was not nearly enough. Then again, in seven games against
the Padres over the past 10 days, nothing the Giants did was
enough.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego won six of the seven, taking Sunday's series finale at
3Com Park 5-1 on a bad day for Orel Hershiser. The Padres left no
doubt who rules the National League West as they left town with a
51/2-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   When the games against San Diego began, the Giants to a man said
they could not use Jeff Kent's injury as an excuse, that they had
to keep plugging and find a way to win. After the Padres left town
with three wins in four games, the Giants were forced to admit that
they were severely handicapped without Kent, their cleanup hitter,
and J.T. Snow, their regular first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's pretty obvious,'' catcher Brent Mayne said.
``But that's baseball. What are you going to do? At this point,
you've got to think (the Padres) are a better team. They came in
and beat us up pretty good. But they're healthy. They've got all
their guns. The thing we've got to do is keep battling until we can
get the machine going again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason to panic or get weird about this. There is
more than half the season to go. Who knows? Maybe next time we face
them they'll be down a man.''
</P>
<P>
   That won't come until September 7-9, when the Giants travel to
San Diego for their last three meetings of the season. Manager
Dusty Baker and Co. know that between now and then they must shave
some or all of their 51/2-game shortfall. The Giants already have
bridged a 61/2-game deficit this season. The question is, can they
do it again? Even a good thoroughbred rarely closes twice in the
same race.
</P>
<P>
   Baker thought the question was silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we have a week left in the season,'' he said.
``We're still due for a couple more good streaks and a couple more
bad streaks. Last year, we were six games up or so at the break and
the Dodgers caught us, and we passed them gain. The race isn't over
today. The race isn't over until October 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They played better than us,'' Baker said. ``Maybe with the
situation we're in, they're a better team now. That's the key word:
now. We're without a couple of big horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Clydesdales or miniature ponies, it doesn't matter. If they don
a Giants' uniform, they have no chance against Brown, who missed
his sixth complete-game victory against San Francisco by one
batter. Nevertheless, he scattered seven hits, walked one, struck
out nine and improved to 6-0 with a 0.58 lifetime ERA against the
Giants. At 3Com, he is 4-0 with a 0.25 ERA and a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have an explanation for it,'' Brown said. ``I don't
know if it's timing, or if I'm just lucky enough to have good stuff
when I face them. But as long as we're doing well I don't care.
That's not the kind of thing you want to analyze.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, already leading 1-0, scored three runs off Hershiser
in the third inning on a walk to Quilvio Veras, a Steve Finley
triple past a diving Charlie Hayes at first, an identical smash by
Tony Gwynn for a double and a two-out infield single by catcher
Carlos Hernandez. Hershiser did not return for the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-0 lead is tantamount to running up the score when Brown
faces the Giants, especially with their makeshift lineup. The
Padres, however, made it clear that they played well enough to win
no matter who was missing from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure you suffer anytime one of your key players is out. It
sure takes something away,'' Brown said. ``But we've had players
out too. Cammy (Ken Caminiti) has been hurt a lot, and Tony (Gwynn)
has been down with his leg. That's the case with any team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key over the course of the season is who gets over
injuries the best,'' he said, ``who steps in for them and who makes
it through the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it's advantage Padres.

ANGELS DEFEAT RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The tip of Jason Dickson's right index finger was a
concern to Angels manager Terry Collins before Sunday's game
between the Angels and Texas Rangers. Dickson has a crack in the
bone of the finger, but Collins' fears proved unfounded as the
Angels pitcher retired the first 11 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone should have been worried about his pitcher, it was
Rangers manager Johnny Oates, who threw former Angel Matt Perisho
and his 23.14 ERA in a matchup of the AL West's top two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Perisho was battered for 10 runs in 22/3 innings as the Angels
beat the Rangers 10-7 before 32,914 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson got help from three Angels relievers, including Troy
Percival, who earned his league-leading 23rd save.
</P>
<P>
   The win moved the Angels 2{ games ahead of the Rangers, their
biggest division lead since a three-game edge over the Mariners on
Sept. 17, 1995. All it took was winning 18 of 21 games, which the
Angels have done, starting with a victory over the Twins on May 31.
Most recently, the Angels have completed a 10-game stretch against
the Mariners and Rangers, going 8-2 and taking over first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just playing to our capabilities,'' Percival said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely showed we're a team to contend with,'' Dickson
said. ``We've come out and won the close games and also pounded 'em
into the ground. It sends a message.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We said going into the first of seven against Texas that these
were very big,'' Collins said. ``Our guys have played absolutely
great baseball. Every guy has a piece of it. You can't win with two
or three guys. We've gotten something from everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Dickson's contribution was the most notable, but not
unexpected considering the way all the starters have pitched
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson suffered a nondisplaced fracture of his right index
finger last Wednesday while swinging at bat during pitchers'
batting practice. But the injury wasn't serious enough to keep him
from getting his seventh victory in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson (8-4) gave up four runs and seven hits in six innings.
He struck out six and walked only one. But he isn't about to allow
himself to feel too good about things.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start to think, `Yeah, I'm throwing the way I want to,'
the game steps up and bites you in the butt,'' Dickson said. ``You
have to stick to the basics. Sometimes it helps to keep things
really simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Dickson's performance Sunday was made easier thanks
to Perisho's troubles. The Angels scored five runs in both the
second and third innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Darin Erstad's three-run double got the Angels on
the scoreboard. Perisho made things tougher on himself by walking
three in the inning, including Tim Salmon with the bases loaded to
force in a run.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Perisho gave up four hits, hit a batter and walked
two more. The second walk _ to Damon Mashore _ forced in a run and
forced Oates to finally take Perisho out of the game. After
allowing 10 runs (nine earned) and 10 hits in 22/3 innings
Perisho's ERA rose from 23.14 to 28.80.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, made things ``scary,'' scoring three times
in the fourth and once in the fifth off Dickson. They added two
more runs off reliever Mike Holtz to cut their deficit to 10-6 in
the seventh, and scored another in the ninth to make it 10-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``With their offense, it should be scary,'' Collins said.
``They've scored a lot of runs all season. There's no reason to
think you're going to hold 'em down.''

`SNIPER' GUNS DOWN DAAL, DIAMONDBACKS

   ST. LOUIS _ Where did it come from?
</P>
<P>
   Was it from the grassy knoll beyond the center-field fence? Was
it from Big Mac Land in the corner of the upper deck? Was it from
the top of the Gateway Arch?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows where the sniper was perched.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sniper'' was how Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter
referred to what happened in the sixth inning on Sunday, when his
starting pitcher, left-hander Omar Daal, went down as if he'd been
shot while running from first to third on a double by Andy Fox.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering first day of summer, it was believed to be only
a case of the cramps in both legs, but it was contagious. The
cramps seemed to spread to the arms of relievers Russ Springer and
Clint Sodowsky, who couldn't preserve a lead, as the St. Louis
Cardinals rallied to defeat Arizona, 5-4, at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory signaled a three-game sweep for the Cardinals and
enabled them to climb above the .500 mark at 37-36. Arizona, which
fell to 25-50, moves on to Arlington, Texas, to begin a two-game
interleague series with the Texas Rangers tonight.
</P>
<P>
   With a 4-1 lead _ the result of four runs in the top of the
sixth _ Springer replaced Daal in the bottom of the inning. He
walked John Mabry, the leadoff man, and allowed him to go to second
on a wild pitch. Tucson Rincon High product Tom Pagnozzi then drove
Mabry home with a one-out single.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Springer retired the first two batters, but gave
up a single to Mark McGwire that was hit sharply past third baseman
Matt Williams into left field. Brian Jordan, tied for second with
Chicago's Mark Grace in the National League batting race entering
the game, then hit a two-run homer to tie it at 4. It was Jordan's
second homer of the series.
</P>
<P>
   Sodowsky entered the game in the eighth and gave up a base hit
to veteran third baseman Gary Gaetti. David Howard replaced Gaetti
as a pinch runner and was sacrificed to second by Pagnozzi.
</P>
<P>
   Sodowsky walked pinch-hitter Ray Lankford, and after Willie
McGee's grounder to Travis Lee at first moved the runners up,
Sodowsky walked Royce Clayton. Delino DeShields stepped to the
plate, and Sodowsky uncorked a wild pitch, allowing Howard to score
what proved to be the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Right-handed closer Jeff Brantley took the mound in the ninth
and got the Diamondbacks in order. The third out was Lee, on a pop
to DeShields at second, which served as a bit of revenge for
Brantley, who gave up a game-winning homer to Lee when the teams
played at Bank One Ballpark last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Lee homered off Curtis King to lead off the sixth for
Arizona and tie the game at 1. It was his team-leading 14th of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams singled, Jay Bell walked with one out and Karim
Garcia drove in Williams with an opposite-field single to left.
Gaetti snared a line drive by Damian Miller for the second out and
Daal walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Brady Raggio replaced King and Fox hit a rocket
toward the base of the fence, scoring Bell and Garcia easily. It
appeared Daal might have a chance to score, too, but a few feet
before reaching third, both legs apparently cramped up and he went
down. Raggio then got Devon White on a grounder to short to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough break. Omar was pitching well,'' Showalter
said. ``Our relievers gave up some hits, and the bases on balls
compounded the problem. We've gone through some good points, where
our starters scuffled and the relievers did well, and now it's
going the other way. We can't seem to put anything together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, it's disappointing. But you can either wallow around in
it or keep grinding, which is what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks pitching coach Mark Connor said Springer made some
good pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire just muscled it past Matty and Jordan . . . he's been
hitting everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Sodowsky, Connor said, is overthrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes out of himself a little bit,'' Connor said. ``He's
got good enough stuff. He just needs to let it take over, trust it
in the strike zone. We keep telling him that. It has worked
sometimes, and other times, you have this type of situation.
Hopefully, he can develop some more consistency.'' &QL;

MARTINEZ, RED SOX MASTER DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ For all the pleasure he took in the
restored splendor of his own performance, there was a sorrow that
tugged at Pedro Martinez's heart with every pitch he made during
Sunday's 3-1 Red Sox win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   As he felt the magic and the power coursing through his own
right arm while allowing Tampa Bay just one hit in eight innings _
Miguel Cairo hit a hanging curve-ball for a run-scoring triple in
the fifth _ Martinez could not help but think of the damaged right
arm of his older brother, Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being the ace of the Dodgers' staff, Ramon Martinez is
an idol, inspiration, and spiritual adviser to his younger brother.
So imagine the dread Pedro Martinez felt when his brother called
him this weekend to tell him that he had decided to undergo
season-ending surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why every time I go out there and go through one
inning,'' Martinez said, ``I pray to God to keep me healthy for the
next inning, for the next pitch, and I pray for my brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother came to my mind out there. Every pitch you throw,
it's up to God. One pitch, and you could be through.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first fastball he threw while warming up in the bullpen
Sunday, Martinez knew that the afternoon had a chance to take on an
uncommon aura. He had spent part of the morning napping on the
clubhouse couch, having mistakenly arrived earlier than needed. But
whatever dreams he may have had on the sofa were eclipsed when he
took the mound.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Quinton McCracken, the first batter he faced,
overpowering him with fastballs. He ended the first inning by
striking out Wade Boggs, who rarely whiffs, with a vicious fastball
that dived over Boggs's shoetops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he was so calm, so under control, reminded me of the
way he was when he threw nine perfect innings against San Diego,''
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan said, recalling Martinez's 1995
flirtation with perfection that ended when Bip Roberts led off the
10th with a double. ``By the second inning, I knew we had something
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Devil Rays paraded back and forth, from dugout to home
plate, before Boggs drew a walk with two outs in the fourth, the
first Tampa Bay base runner. The next batter, Fred McGriff, looked
pitiful, striking out on changeups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those changeups were unfair,'' catcher Scott Hatteberg said.
``He had the kind of stuff today, I'm glad I was catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sorrento, who hit two home runs in the four-game series,
drew a full-count walk to open the fifth, after barely fouling off
the previous pitch. Martinez struck out Mike DiFelice, one of his
six strikeouts on the afternoon, to bring up Cairo, a 24-year-old
Venezuelan.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who threw almost exclusively fastballs and changeups,
got ahead of Cairo 0-and-2, the second strike a breaking ball. He
tried throwing another curve past the Devil Rays infielder, but
Cairo launched a drive into the left-center-field gap, out of reach
of left fielder Troy O'Leary, for the triple that scored Sorrento
with Tampa Bay's only run.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mistake, one hanging curveball, and I gave up a base
hit,'' Martinez said. ``Sometimes one mistake is all it takes to
win or lose a ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Red Sox had scored all the runs Martinez would need
off Devil Rays pitcher Jason Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, the Red Sox loaded the bases when Mo Vaughn and
O'Leary singled and John Valentin was hit by a pitch. Hatteberg
popped out, but rookie Lou Merloni hit a two-run double off the end
of his bat, which broke on impact, the ball carrying past third
baseman Boggs into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always want to give Pedro a lead,'' said Merloni. ``If
it's nothing-nothing in the seventh, sometimes a team thinks it can
steal one off him.''
</P>
<P>
   With Nomar Garciaparra hitting a solo home run in the third,
there would be no larceny on this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Cy Young Award winner,'' Boggs said. ``That says it
all. A 97 mile-an-hour fastball, an 82 mile-an-hour changeup.
That's a pretty big disparity in pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in his last inning, Martinez was still hitting the radar
gun at 94 and 95 m.p.h., according to Kerrigan. Even so, manager
Jimy Williams, mindful that Martinez had thrown 121 pitches on top
of the 140 he threw in his last start, lifted him for closer Tom
Gordon, who gave up a one-out single to Dave Martinez in the ninth,
then retired Boggs and McGriff for his third save of the series,
fourth in five games, and 23d of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had no quarrel with being lifted. Nor did he lament the
loss of a no-hitter, which he has never thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there too many times _ seventh inning, sixth inning,
ninth inning _ and never gotten it, for me to be disappointed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as he would later add, he felt blessed just to be able
to pitch. If only Ramon could say the same.

AMERICANS WINNERS, BUT NOT ON THE FIELD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LYON, France _ So, what do you say to an Iranian wearing face
paint and a green Harpo Marx wig, who is bouncing up and down and
blowing a toy whistle in your ear?
</P>
<P>
   Congratulations. See you in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   We keep hearing that the day will come when the United States
will win the World Cup. But that won't happen in four years or
eight years, and if we keep taking backward steps like the one we
took Sunday night under the lights of Stade Gerland, it is a good
bet the Cardinals will win the Super Bowl before Americans are
declared the global champions of kickball.
</P>
<P>
   If you missed it, Tehran newspapers have the story. It's
banner-headline news.
</P>
<P>
   ``IRAN 2, SATAN 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Shut out by Germany, the U.S. needed to beat Iran to avoid
first-round elimination. Five hours before the match, at a lavish
reception, U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg stood
on the terrace of the four-star Ville Florentine Hotel that
overlooks the red-tiled roofs of this charming city, the
third-largest in France. Rothenberg appeared upbeat. He sounded
confident.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. had been no match for the Germans. But the Iranians
aren't in the same class. Iran was the last of 32 teams to qualify
for the World Cup. Jalil Talebi is the team's fourth coach in seven
months, breaking the record of managerial impatience formerly held
by George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   One of the party guests swirled his glass of Beaujolais and
posed a small-talk question. So, Alan, what do you want to see
tonight? The U.S. was starting five different players, half the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see us kick their (. . .)!'' Rothenberg bellowed.
Everyone laughed, including the host, who added, ``A Holland-South
Korea result'' _ Holland won, 5-0 _ ``would be acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   How about a one-goal win? Or a face-saving tie?
</P>
<P>
   Didn't happen. The U.S. couldn't find the net, and it was there,
right in front of our lads, so open-mouthed at times it appeared to
be yawning. Our guys came out shooting. Brian McBride fired a
header three minutes into the match. The ball bounced off the
crossbar. Claudio Reyna took a turn. A ricochet off the post. David
Regis shot. Dang. Off the post again.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the French National police, who frisked each of the
44,000 spectators entering the stadium, had discovered what little
luck the American team had, and confiscated it.
</P>
<P>
   In all, four shots struck iron, and bounced away. It was like
watching Kevin Butler, in a slump, trying to make field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. trailed, 2-0, before McBride scored America's first
World Cup goal. It came after almost three hours of trying.
</P>
<P>
   Outscored, 4-1, in two losses, America has done little to earn
the respect it seeks in the soccer world. But its appearance here _
the U.S. still has a game left on Thursday against Yugoslavia _ has
not been a complete waste of time and money.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have been good ambassadors. Before the game, they
exchanged gifts with the Iranians. The teams broke with tradition
and posed for a group picture, the players in white and red all
smiles, arm in arm, like a snapshot of college fraternity brothers.
</P>
<P>
   American and Iranian fans also celebrated the sport, together,
treating one another better than some Arizona State and UA fans do.
</P>
<P>
   This score will fade from memory, hopefully. But I won't forget
those around me in Section A.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you, please?'' the woman, an Iranian, asked politely in
halting English, offering her camera. As I looked into the
viewfinder, she positioned herself between two strangers from a
country far away and far different from her own. One sported a red,
white and blue Mad Hatter's hat. The other wore the Stars and
Stripes like a shawl. Before clicking the shutter, I didn't have to
ask them to smile. &QL;

JANZEN PUTS IT TOGETHER 
BY C.W. NEVIUS
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Well, that's it. If you don't understand the
crushing pressure of the stretch run at the U.S. Open now, I am
afraid we are going to have to revoke your viewing privileges.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen and Payne Stewart staggered down the clipped green
fairways of the Olympic Club Sunday afternoon, looking like two men
holding their breath. They came stylishly out of every shot to an
elegant follow-through, but if you looked closer you could see they
were squinting so hard that they appeared to be playing in a
sandstorm.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, they stood on the 18th green for the trophy
ceremony, each fighting back tears, and you'd have been hard
pressed to tell which one was the winner. For the record it was
Janzen _ again.
</P>
<P>
   He'd beaten Stewart five years ago for the Open title at
Baltusrol, and he did it again Sunday, holding his game together,
getting a couple of nice little breaks and managing to concentrate
when nearly everyone around him was springing tiny, disastrous
leaks in their swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to suck it up,'' said Janzen, who bogeyed the third
hole to go to five strokes behind the leader. ``I just knew that if
I gave up, I would be really upset with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   And then Janzen's voice trailed off, and he had to go through
another spell of staring at his shoes and blinking hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he mumbled. ``I can't help myself.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all right. Because you don't win the Open, you survive it,
and then you look around to see where you are. You raise the club
high above your head, let it flash down at the ball and then you
hope to God that something good happens when the ball hits the
earth again.
</P>
<P>
   There are no guarantees. We struggle to explain how things can
go wrong in the thatch and greasy greens, but Olin Browne, who
limped home in 15 over par and then staged a mini-victory dance on
the 18th green, may have put it as well as anyone Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever try to light one of those big white-headed kitchen
matches with your thumbnail?'' asked Browne. ``Pretty cool when you
do it, right? But sooner or later you are going to get a piece of
phosphorus under your fingernail and it is going to burn the crap
out of you. That's a good analogy for the Open.''
</P>
<P>
   When we look back at this one, a pretty good case could be made
that Stewart, who lost by a single stroke, saw the big silver cup
slip away when he hit a drive to the exact center of the 12th
fairway and discovered that he was stuck in the world's tiniest
sand trap.
</P>
<P>
   In a world-class bad hop, Stewart's ball had come to rest in a
divot, which the USGA has ruled should be filled with sand every
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said this before,'' said Stewart. ``If they are going to
come out and try to repair something, that's ground under repair. I
think you should get a drop.''
</P>
<P>
   Yep, and a lot of people thought the 17th hole was unplayable as
a par 4 and that the 18th green was unputtable when the pin was
placed at the top of the Olympic Club ski jump.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart had trouble shoveling it out of the sand, put the ball
in another, honest-to-goodness, sand trap, got it out, missed a
putt and suddenly he was a stroke behind Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   What are you going to do? That's the Open. And, the members will
be telling you proudly for the next 10 years or so, that's the
Olympic Club's Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you come right down to it,'' said Stewart, ``it was the
Olympic Club that really won. There was one person at even par for
the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, frankly admits he couldn't stand the tension. He says he
quit looking at the leader board down the stretch because watching
too many players would have cluttered his mind to the breaking
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing the golf part is easy,'' he said, ``because we have
done it so many times. When I got to 11 and I knew I had a chance
to win, I just kept telling myself `This is the U.S. Open. It only
takes one shot. Lose focus on one shot and you could lose.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, we can say that Janzen won because of a steady,
gutty effort, a couple of kinks in Stewart's swing and at least two
sensational breaks. On 11, the ball hit the deep, terrible rough
but magically hopped back out to safety. And better yet, on the
fifth hole, Janzen's ball disappeared into a tree, sat up there for
a minute, then fell down to where he could play it. There's no
accounting for it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is something else to the Open, that always seems to
find a way to come true. There's almost always a lovely symmetry to
the conclusion, a nice little wrap-up that saves this sometimes
stuffy game from terminal snootiness.
</P>
<P>
   As Janzen spoke at the post-tournament press conference, his
wife, Beverly, and son, Connor, sat at his feet. Janzen struggled a
little after his first Open win, and there were lots of
explantions, from a change in golf clubs to a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   But as he said on Friday in a low-key press conference, he
thinks the real reason was the birth of Connor, soon after the
Open. The whole family was trying to travel the tour together, and
they weren't getting much sleep. Janzen didn't win, but he doesn't
hesitate when asked about his biggest thrills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being a father,'' he said. ``I can't think of anything
better.''
</P>
<P>
   And, when a reporter asked how old his son was, Lee and Beverly
exchanged a look, remembering where they were five years ago in a
U.S. Open champion's press conference and all the things that have
happened since.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's almost 5,'' Janzen said, and by then he almost had the
blinking completely under control.

OLYMPIC CLUB REAL WINNER IN THE END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a line you'd never expect to see in the 1998 players'
guide, written by the U.S. Golf Association and focusing on the man
in knickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``... he became known on tour for wearing his plus-2s and a
habit of choking in the closing stages of a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   At Payne Stewart's request, the line will be deleted in all
forthcoming editions. But there is a difference between a man's
biography and his reputation, and the latter is never so forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the temptation.
</P>
<P>
   You can look at the scorecard and see that Stewart gave away
four shots on Sunday. He bogeyed three of the final seven holes. He
joined Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson, a dubious foursome
that has blown Sunday leads at Olympic.
</P>
<P>
   Choking. There is no uglier word in competition. But this was no
Greg Norman. This was no hideous meltdown. And as much as Sunday's
crab-stagger will be perceived as Stewart swallowing a grapefruit,
that's not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed? Yeah, I'm disappointed,'' Stewart said. ``But
I'm going to hold my head up. I played good this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Stewart did nothing different on the final seven holes
than he did all week. He simply ran out of breaks, and it was never
more evident than a wonderful tee shot that somehow landed in a
place more beach than divot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first fairway I hit in a while,'' Stewart said. ``And sure
enough, I was in a bunker, a sand divot on No. 12.''
</P>
<P>
   Next hole, another bogey sprouted when his approach landed in
the deep rough, complicated by a clump right behind his ball. The
only moment resembling a gag was an awful putt he yanked on No. 16,
one that cost him a playoff. But that was prefaced by a birdie on
No. 14, followed by a courageous effort on the final hole in which
the ball squirted away as if allergic to the cup.
</P>
<P>
   No, Stewart didn't choke. Lee Janzen won. Sometimes it's that
simple. If anything, be thankful that some competitive drama
finally emerged from an event that plodded along for three days.
And more than anything, remember what this tournament was all
about.
</P>
<P>
   The real history occurred earlier in the day, when Casey Martin
motored up the 18th fairway, stepped out of his cart and received a
standing ovation. He shot a 72 on Sunday, finishing 11 over par in
his first major. Once a pariah, he is thawing the frozen hearts of
his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of them. On his way to the interview area, Martin
crossed paths with Jack Nicklaus, a legend who likened golf carts
to the bubonic plague. Martin said hello, testing the waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed uncomfortable,'' Martin said. ``But he was gracious.
He said `Hi' and went on his way.''
</P>
<P>
   How nice.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin's tee time was so late that his cart needed
headlights. On Saturday, his dying leg hurt so much that he cut off
interviews in midstream. On Sunday, he missed his goal, failing to
qualify for the Masters. But he finished in 23rd place, 20 slots
higher than Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering where he was 10 months ago _ he could barely walk
from room to room _ it's such a victory,'' said his mother,
Melinda. ``It's so heartwarming, seeing all the strife we had to go
through. The cart was a non-issue, and all I heard was cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Martin prevailed like no other in man the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt our tour could've kept this from going to the courts,
could've stopped the whole process,'' Stewart said. ``Because the
game is bigger than that. Let him play.''
</P>
<P>
   And while we're at it, let Stewart off the hook. He dominated
for three days before the course found him, as it did everybody.
But even when his lead disappeared, he kept fighting, scratching,
hoping. Until he found a reality shared by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the golf course won,'' Stewart said. ``I'd say the
golf course lived up to its reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some will say the same about Stewart. Sorry. In the end, he was
simply prisoner to fate. And a piece of real estate destined for
revenge.

A VICTORY FORGED BY WILLPOWER 
BY TIM KEOWN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After finishing the 13th hole, Lee Janzen
started walking the Olympic Club fairways like General Patton. His
eyes were fixed straight ahead, and his head never moved. He didn't
look like he was playing a round of golf; he looked like he was on
his way to make an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   You knew right then Janzen was on his way to his second U.S.
Open championship. You knew it because winning was the only thought
he allowed to invade his consciousness. He wasn't just approaching
his ball, he was stalking it, treating it as if he were afraid it
might get away.
</P>
<P>
   You also knew Janzen would win for another reason: After three
days of blissful good fortune, events were beginning to conspire
against Payne Stewart. As Janzen approached the 15th green, the
manual scoreboard changed Stewart's score to even par for the
tournament and 3-over for the day. This brought Janzen into a tie
for the lead, and it tripped several reactions.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd around the 15th went crazy. Steve Stricker, Janzen's
playing partner, looked up at the board, laughed, then dropped his
head in exaggerated amazement.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like Stricker saw all of this coming, too.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen's reaction was straight out of ``Rio Lobo'': He marched
toward his ball and looked straight ahead. To him, the scoreboard
didn't exist. Stewart didn't exist. His world consisted of his ball
and the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 13th hole, I decided I wasn't going to look at the
board _ no matter what,'' Janzen said. ``The last thing I wanted to
do was look up at the board and see that I had a lead. I didn't
want to get it in my mind that I had to protect a lead. I just
wanted to play every hole the way I'd been playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen finished the tournament at even par, and he beat Stewart
by one stroke. To get an idea of the kind of charge he put on over
the final 15 holes, consider this: After the first three holes, he
was seven strokes behind Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Being seven strokes behind with 15 to play is like being down
four runs in the bottom of the ninth with one out and nobody on
base. Seven strokes is a lot to make up, in part because it takes a
joint effort: Janzen had to get it together, and Stewart had to
come apart like a cheap shoe.
</P>
<P>
   As Janzen approached the fourth tee, the U.S. Open looked like a
done deal. Stewart was bouncing his way through the course,
knickers billowing in the wind, and everybody else was trying to
make enough shots to finish with dignity. The fans following
Stewart and Tom Lehman were actively rooting for Lehman, for no
other reason than to coax some drama out of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After the first three rounds, rooting for Stewart was the
equivalent of rooting for Microsoft: It only felt good if you had a
stake in it.
</P>
<P>
   And although he would never admit it, there's a good chance
Stewart _ in the pre-dawn quiet of his own head _ started Sunday
morning with a look at his closest challengers and a confident nod.
</P>
<P>
   With a four-stroke lead, Stewart couldn't have looked at the
group consisting of Lehman, Bob Tway and Janzen with anything
approaching fear. Nick Price might have sent a little shiver
through him, but the others don't have a strong recent history of
late challenges or final-round heroics. To a man, the others are
known for what they used to do, or how well they finish second.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen tore Stewart's heart out at the '93 Open, when he chipped
in a wondrous shot to win by a stroke at Baltusrol. He hadn't
approached those exploits since. He hadn't attended a trophy
presentation of any kind in three years. His round of 66 on Friday
seemed likely to be his shining achievement for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Especially after falling seven down after the first three holes.
</P>
<P>
   And even more especially after his tee shot on the fifth hole.
</P>
<P>
   After a birdie on No. 4, Janzen hit a ball nobody could find. He
couldn't find it, his caddie couldn't find it, the course marshals
couldn't find it. It was Saturday morning at Lodi Muni _ everyone
looking for a lost ball. Finally, a fan with binoculars found it
lodged in a cypress tree. Janzen dutifully walked back toward the
tee, holding a new ball and absolutely zero hope, when a gust of
wind blew the ball out of the tree.
</P>
<P>
   There is good fortune, and then there is finding a winning
Powerball ticket in a Laundromat. Instead of teeing off with a
one-stroke penalty for a lost ball _ in effect, Janzen's second tee
shot would have been his third shot at a par-4 hole _ he got to
take his second shot from the rough. He ended up chipping in from
behind the green to save par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking at a ball struck in a tree, where I would have
been lucky to make double (bogey) to somehow making par,'' Janzen
said.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen accepted his trophy with tears running down his face. His
family _ several generations, it appeared _ stood off to the side,
and there wasn't a dry eye among them. Janzen was humble and
disbelieving, presenting the opposite image from the one he showed
on the course.
</P>
<P>
   The stoicism crumbled, replaced by a cry-fluttered voice and a
few failed deep breaths. ``I recall I was the same way last time,''
Janzen said. ``Can't help myself.''
</P>
<P>
   His reaction was something of a surprise _ maybe the only one of
the afternoon. If you looked closely, you could see the rest of it
coming.

NBA SUMMER OF DISCONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For two years, the Suns have been aiming toward this summer,
laying plans to put the final pieces of a championship contender
together through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why the club probably won't be involved in
Wednesday's draft, unless there's a trade.
</P>
<P>
   But after the draft, the Suns and 28 other NBA teams could be
sitting idle through a long, hot summer of labor negotiations
centered on free agency, character issues and how the league and
players will split up a revenue pie fattened during the Michael
Jordan era.
</P>
<P>
   It could mean the Suns' blueprint for the future will collect
dust.
</P>
<P>
   The league's owners have indicated their intention to lock out
their players on July 1, stopping all transactions and virtually
shutting down league business until a new collective bargaining
agreement can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   The first indication that an impasse might be avoided surfaced
late last week after USA Basketball, which is closely aligned with
the NBA, announced that a team of league players selected to
represent the United States at the World Championships in Athens,
next month would be replaced by college or Continental Basketball
Association players.
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Players Association, the union that
represents NBA players, has asked the league for a no-strike,
no-lockout agreement that would allow league business to continue
while negotiations go on this summer. That would allow NBA players
to remain on the World Championships team. However, league sources
said it is unlikely that any player transactions would be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Another negotiating session, which might provide some answers,
is scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   Still, owners and players appear to be dug in and willing to
lose regular-season games for the first time in league history
because of a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference during the NBA Finals, Commissioner David
Stern made it clear that owners are prepared to lock the players
out right into the season if necessary. Asked how many owners were
willing to interrupt the season, Stern answered:
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't comment directly on that, other than to say that
the owners voted, 27-2, to open up the collective bargaining
agreement. And I think that speaks pretty articulately to the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's the fight all about?
</P>
<P>
   It's fairly simple on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when the players and owners reached a six-year
collective bargaining agreement, the owners agreed to give the
players no more than 52 percent of total revenues from the league.
They had hoped it would be closer to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement included a clause that would allow the owners to
reopen the agreement if the players' cut of revenues went above 52
percent. According to the owners, players received 57 percent from
last season _ more than a billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   So the owners propose eliminating exceptions to the league's
salary cap, creating a so-called ``hard cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Under such a plan, each team would have a limit on how much it
could pay players, with few if any exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The most important and expensive of these exceptions is the
so-called ``Larry Bird exception.''
</P>
<P>
   It allows a team to pay its own free agent as much as the player
and team agree upon, without regard to the salary cap, if that
player has been with the same team for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   It's been expensive for owners, but it also has paid benefits.
Because of the Bird exception, many of the league's best players
have remained with the same club throughout their careers. Michael
Jordan has never played for a team other than the Chicago Bulls.
Larry Bird spent his entire playing career with the Boston Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter in the long run if all we have is a sport
that's running large losses, raising ticket prices and generally
viewed as not a very good citizen over time,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners contend that as many as a dozen NBA teams lost money
last season. The players don't believe it, and there is
disagreement over just what total revenues entail.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is rookie salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In the last agreement, a three-year rookie salary scale was
implemented to provide more money for proven veterans and bring
down astronomical salaries for players new to the league.
</P>
<P>
   The owners don't like the system because the have-nots are
either developing players for the better, higher grossing clubs, or
they must pay far more than they can afford to keep the players.
</P>
<P>
   Owners want a rookie scale of up to six years, or perhaps a form
of restricted free agency until a player has been in the league for
a given number of years. Players and agents have indicated they
might be willing to compromise, but only if the Bird exception
stays.
</P>
<P>
   The final point of contention is ``character issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Some owners, such as Utah's Larry Miller, have indicated this is
more important than any of the financial issues. They're troubled
by an already shaky league image tainted further by the Latrell
Sprewell coach-strangling incident and numerous charges related to
marijuana _ a drug that is not banned under the current collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It could all add up to a very long summer.

JANZEN OVERCOMES PAYNE 
BY PAT SULLIVAN
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-SFCHRON   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Olympic Club finally got its man Sunday. No
more quibbling, please, about the ``wrong'' golfer winning the U.S.
Open again, not when his credentials read: ``two-time U.S. Open
champion Lee Janzen.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, 33, who won the 1993 U.S. Open but had been winless on
tour since 1995, used steel-trap thinking as well as the clubs in
his golf bag to shoot a 2-under-par 68 to finish at exactly
even-par, 280, and beat Payne Stewart by a stroke in a rematch of
their final-round duel in '93 at Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   Over the final five holes, after Janzen had pulled to within a
stroke of the lead, he had the discipline to keep his eyes off the
leaderboard and his mind on business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to know how I stood,'' he said. ``I was going to
play my game the rest of the way in. I didn't want to think if I
got lucky and got ahead. I didn't want to play safe. I just wanted
to hit good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   With 25,000 watching, he had the golf game to finish
par-par-par-par-par, and isn't that what the U.S. Open is about? At
one particular hole, the annoying, sloping, 468-yard, par-4 17th _
the hole members play as a par-5, and Janzen had played in 5-over
par the previous three rounds _ he pulled off a pure Lee Janzen
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In '93, his long-iron play was critical to his victory. This
time it was, too. He pulled a 3-iron from his bag and rifled a
200-yard shot on a straight line, grabbing the tournament _ and the
front of the green _ by the throat.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Janzen was seven strokes off the lead after a bogey
at No.3, but he never wavered in his strong thinking, not when his
ball found the rough, not when he had some luck, like his
``member-bounce'' approach shots to No.11 and No.13 and his 4-wood
tee shot obligingly falling out of a tree after several minutes on
No.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't count myself out, but I wasn't thinking about
winning, either,'' Janzen said of that early stretch of holes.
</P>
<P>
   After he won, he said, ``I feel complete satisfaction. I went
out and played my absolute best in the championship I love most.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, 33, from Orlando, Fla., has had a solid if unflashy
career as a tour pro. In nine years, he has now won eight times.
But it is the two U.S. Opens and the 1995 International and 1995
Players Championship, both on tough courses, that stand out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because I won a U.S. Open on a very difficult course,
you just get in your mind that you can play tough courses,'' he
said. ``After that I felt more comfortable on tough courses. The
Players Championship is incredibly hard conditions. Winged Foot
last year (PGA Championship) was very tough, and I had a good
tournament (tie for fourth). It only gets better as time goes by.''
</P>
<P>
   Much like Hogan had to sweat out Fleck's finish in 1955, Janzen
had to sit and watch Stewart's. Janzen waited in the locker room,
his wife, Beverly, close by. Stewart had a 20-foot putt from above
the cup at the 18th to reforge a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could barely stand to watch,'' Janzen said. ``If he makes
it, we're playing off. If he misses it, I've won the tournament.
I'm watching it roll down there. I thought, three or four feet from
the hole, it was going in.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's putt curved left just short of the cup. When it did,
Beverly gave Janzen a long hug and a quick kiss. Then he went out
to the 18th green for a tearful acceptance speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``There hasn't been a day that has gone by that I haven't
thought about winning the U.S. Open again,'' Janzen said. ``This
erases all the bad Sundays, all the missed cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Stewart, he said, ``I know how hard it is to sleep on
that lead. He's not going to take home the trophy, but he deserves
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who had led the tournament since Thursday, was
matter-of-fact in defeat. ``First off, you've got to give Lee
Janzen all the credit. He's in the third-to-last group and shoots a
68. ... He deserves to be the champion today.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what it all boils down to, I think, is that the Olympic
Club really won, because there was one person even-par for the
tournament. So I think this golf course stood up to the test of
holding an Open Championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart was the better-known player starting Sunday's final
round with a four-stroke lead, but he also was no Ben Hogan, Arnold
Palmer or Tom Watson, the threesome of famous runners-up in the
Olympic Opens of 1955, 1966 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the third-round leaders teed off in early
afternoon, Masters champion Mark O'Meara, a friend and neighbor of
Stewart's in Florida, completed a round of 1-under 69. ``Yes! I
broke par. Yes! With a double (bogey) on 17,'' he said after coming
of the 18th green to complete a tournament that went 70-76-78-69 _
293, good for a tie for 32nd.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, a five-time winner at Pebble Beach who broke through
for his first major victory this year at Augusta, said he left
Stewart a note of encouragement Sunday morning. ``After the second
round my wife saw him and said, `Let's keep the majors in Orlando.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Even (par) or 1-under should be good enough for Payne today,''
O'Meara predicted.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been, with breathing room, except for one thing:
Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart never settled into a rhythm. His opening drive
sailed into the gallery on the right side of the first fairway,
and, for starters, he had to forget about making birdie at the
tournament's easiest hole.
</P>
<P>
   At the 609-yard 16th, Stewart drove through the fairway and into
the rough, found a bunker with his third shot and made his fifth
bogey of the round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I scrambled pretty well today,'' Stewart said. ``But I didn't
play good enough to win today, and I got beat by an outstanding
golfer.''

A NATURAL FINISH    
 WIND-AIDED SHOT NETS JANZEN OPEN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ There was no reason to believe that Lee Janzen
would win another U.S. Open, especially the 98th version.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen opened this national championship with a 3-over 73 on
Thursday and matched that score in Saturday's third round. Even
though he did get to 66 in between, the guy couldn't make it past
the 17th hole, where he had made a bogey and two doubles during
those three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   If that weren't enough, Janzen began Sunday's final 18 holes
with bogeys at Nos. 2 and 3, tumbling 7 shots off the pace. Even
the mild-mannered Floridan knew it didn't look good.
</P>
<P>
   But the Olympic Club is golf's version of ``The Twilight Zone,''
and Payne Stewart, who led through the first three rounds of the
Open, was visited by the ghost of Rod Serling late Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson, who had carried
leads into the final round of the Open here, Stewart ended up going
from winner to runner-up in the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   History will show that Janzen's 2-under 68 on a relatively calm
day earned him a 1-shot victory over Stewart, who never got it
going on his way to a 74. But the real story, the eerie truth, is
that this U.S. Open swung on two most unlikely of shots.
</P>
<P>
   The first came early in Janzen's round, when he hit an errant
drive into the trees at the fifth hole. The ball didn't come down,
and Janzen was on his way back to the tee to take a penalty and hit
his third shot when . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``A gust of wind came up and blew it out of the tree,'' Janzen
said, smiling at the recollection. ``I really thought I was going
to make double (bogey) there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he made par by chipping in from 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The second strange occurrence befell Stewart after he pummeled
his drive down the 12th fairway. The ball settled in a sand-filled
divot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first fairway I had it in in a while, and sure
enough, I'm deep in the divot. Smack dab in the middle of the
sand,'' said Stewart, who pushed his second shot into a bunker and
made bogey.
</P>
<P>
   Take those breaks out of it, and Stewart might have broken the
fourth-round jinx that has cursed this Open course since 1955. But
Janzen was the only player in the field to equal par, as his 280
total earned him $535,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complete satisfaction,'' was the way Janzen described his
second victory in the Open, which joins the title he captured in
1993 at Baltusrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played my absolute best in the tournament that means the
most to me. It's just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   If the eerie conclusion was not enough, there also was the deja
vu factor: Janzen beat Stewart in '93.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about it earlier, but late in the round, I
thought, `Payne Stewart, ball in the tree, chip-in. Where have I
heard this before?' '' said Janzen, who broke a three-year drought
for his eighth victory.
</P>
<P>
   His reference was to a shot he hit between the trees at the 10th
hole at Baltusrol, where he made another impossible par before
chipping in at the 16th hole to beat Stewart by 2 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is, (the Olympic Club) lived up to its
reputation,'' said Stewart, who almost forced a playoff on the
final hole when his 18-foot birdie putt from above the cup just
died left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only one guy managed to shoot par, and Lee gets all the
credit. I didn't play well enough to win, and I got beat by an
outstanding round of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   There were others who also came up short, like Bob Tway, whose
73 got him to third place, 4 shots off the pace, and Nick Price,
who also shot 73 but finished 5 strokes back.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest disappointment was Tom Lehman, who was
playing in the final group of the Open for the fourth straight
year. The Scottsdale pro didn't have a birdie on his way to a 75
that pushed him back into a tie for fifth place, 6 back.
</P>
<P>
   But there were also some winners who didn't get to hold the
coveted silver cup.
</P>
<P>
   They included U.S. Amateur sensation Matt Kuchar (74, 9 over),
who celebrated his 20th birthday by earning his way into next
year's national championship. The top 15 finishers and ties earn
Open exemptions, and Kuchar finished in a tie for 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin, who rode his way into Open history this week, also
played well. He closed with a 72 that left him 11 over and in tie
for 23rd.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen also made history by becoming the 18th player to win two
or more national championships. His comeback from 5 shots down
entering the final round was the biggest rebound since Johnny
Miller rallied from 6 strokes off the pace to win the 1973 Open at
Oakmont Country Club in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (winning Open No. 2) elevates what I've done to a
whole new level,'' said Janzen, 33, who caught and passed Stewart
with four birdies and a crucial par save at the 17th hole.
</P>
<P>
   Even his peers are starting to understand Janzen's impact on the
Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is becoming a U.S. Open specialist,'' Price said of
Janzen's ability to hit tight fairways, withstand the pressure and,
of course, play par golf.

ROOKIE'S FINAL SHOT SERVES MERCURY THEIR FIRST LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As quick as Coach Cheryl Miller was to take blame for the
Mercury's first loss of the season, her players offered absolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost because we let them back into the game,'' said guard
Bridget Pettis, not because Miller failed to call a full timeout
during the final 30 seconds of a 72-71 Charlotte victory Sunday at
America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Miller pleaded poor clock management in a rapid-fire finish _
``It was going too fast to breathe,'' said Toni Foster, then on the
bench _ after a Mercury 20-second timeout at the 36.1-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie point guard Christy Smith scored her only points on an
almost uncontested layup with 24.7 left to put the Sting ahead,
70-69, for the first time since 4-3. Instead of taking a timeout to
set up a final shot, the Mercury raced upcourt and scored on a
Pettis layup at the 14-second mark.
</P>
<P>
   That left Charlotte (4-1) enough time to set up rookie Tracy
Reid for a 16-footer that the two-time All-America from North
Carolina buried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a position like that before,'' said Reid,
who bumped her short pro career scoring high to 21 points. ``It was
exciting that my teammates had confidence enough in me at the end
to take the last shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The final two seconds slipped away without Phoenix (3-1)
responding. Charlotte won for the first time in three tries here
and took a 3-2 series lead over the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take full responsibility,'' Miller said. ``I cost our team a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   She took the rap before her players in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a crowded room with an elephant and nobody's
talking about the elephant, you might as well address it.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran Mercury, just 2-of-13 from the three-point line,
know better. With a game-high 11-point lead, less than 6:30
remaining and a crowd of 13,503 screaming for the kill, more is
responsible for the loss than a timeout not called before a
successful possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us are taking the blame for that game,'' said Michele
Timms, who admitted to letting Smith ``walk to the basket'' for her
bucket instead of at least forcing the former Arkansas star to
convert from the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a five-minute patch where they scored on every
transition. And you have to give credit to Charlotte. They're by
far the best of any team we've played so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicky Bullett hit two of four free throws and a 13-foot jumper
and Reid two free throws in the Sting rally from 66-55 down, but
the shots that truly set up the closing seconds were three-pointers
by 6-foot-2 Andrea Congreaves at 2:27 and 42.1.
</P>
<P>
   The second of those closed the gap to 69-68 and rewarded
Charlotte for its perseverance with a genuine chance to steal the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Congreaves scored 12 points in a season-high 23 minutes because
of a lineup shuffle to cover an early first-half injury to center
Rhonda Mapp (torn tendon/left foot).
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix power forward Toni Foster missed the final 6:53 after
suffering a right hand sprain.
</P>
<P>
   At 66-65, Phoenix executed well enough on both ends to put its
leading scorer, Jennifer Gillom, on the foul line for three
consecutive possessions. But Gillom made just half of her six
tries, which Congreaves erased with her second three-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Houston (5-0) is next at 7 p.m. Wednesday.
The battle of unbeatens angle is gone, but the game is important if
the Mercury is to keep pace with its new Western Conference rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can cry about this for about 24 hours, then we have to let
go and start focusing on Houston,'' Timms said.

IRAN WALKS OVER U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Claudio Reyna didn't know what to do. So he stood there for a
moment, watching the mayhem around him, then knelt on the turf at
Stade Gerland, disbelieving all he saw.
</P>
<P>
   What had started so promisingly ended in the cruelest manner
imaginable, the United States' World Cup dream slipping away in a
stunning 2-1 loss to Iran, and much of the credit --- or blame, as
it were --- rested on Reyna's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   For so long the future of American soccer, Reyna turned out to
be a dud when it most mattered, and that --- as much as anything
else --- proved the Yanks' undoing in France.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't horrendous Sunday night, when the United States became
the fifth squad eliminated from second-round consideration, but his
lax defending wasresponsible for the only goal in the match that
mattered, and his supposed prowess in orchestrating an attack never
materialized, neither in the 2-0 loss a week ago to Germany nor in
this clash, the one the Americans had been expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   There were myriad reasons that they didn't, including the old
standard, the one dealing with finishing chances. Despite owning
huge portions of play, despite creating at least a half-dozen
outstanding opportunities, Sampson's Army put just one goal away, a
Brian McBride header in the waning minutes that halved the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   It was too little and far too late, although the U.S. continued
to hammer away at the Iranian goal until Swiss referee Urs Meier
finally ended it after nearly 31/2 minutes of injury time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four years is gone in a week,'' noted Cobi Jones.
``That's difficult to take.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely disappointing,'' said goalkeeper Kasey Keller.
``We played so well, we hit post like five times or whatever it
was. It just wasn't going to happen for us today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' best shots ripped into the woodwork, three of
them --- ``It was like the post had a magnet in it,'' quipped
McBride --- but that's not good enough, and the end result, to the
delight of the largely Iranian audience, was the most devastating
loss the United States has suffered in the sport since coming of
age in the early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson, the U.S. coach, doesn't agree. He lauded his
team's play, spoke of the progress the Yanks have made and are
still making, and made certain everyone knew how proud he was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very proud, and very disappointed at the same time,''
he said. ``I will never be happy with a loss, but I was very happy
with the effort and the style with which we approached the game.''
</P>
<P>
   It had begun pleasantly enough, with handshakes and flowers and
both sides --- the Americans and Iranians, supposed mortal enemies
--- getting together for an integrated team photo. But there seemed
an air of desperation to the U.S. lineup: Sampson made five changes
from the Germany match, sending forward Eric Wynalda and
midfielders Ernie Stewart, Chad Deering, Brian Maisonneuve and Mike
Burns to the bench. He dropped his 3-6-1 formation for a more
offensive 3-5-2, with McBride and Roy Wegerle as forwards, Tab
Ramos in Stewart's spot, Frankie Hejduk in Burns', and Joe-Max
Moore playing behind Ramos and Reyna.
</P>
<P>
   It led to a strong start, with McBride hitting the crossbar with
a header just three minutes in. Once Iran got its bearings, the
match was played primarily between the boxes, with winger Mehdi
Mahdavikia's dominance on the right side the key element to the
clash.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was the Americans who should have surged ahead, if not
on McBride's shot, then on a 25-yard blast from Reyna that slammed
against the base of the right post in the 33rd minute. Instead, it
was the Iranians who took charge, just four minutes before the
half, when Reyna left Hamid Esteli alone in the box.
</P>
<P>
   The play developed on the right, with Mahdavikia --- hemmed in
by Moore and Jones --- sending the forward to Javad Zarincheh,
whose cross found Esteli about nine yards out. His looping header
to the left side of the net left Keller no chance.
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, until at least midway through the second
half, the Americans offered little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost our patience (after the goal),'' said Reyna, who
blamed miscommunication on the poor marking of Esteli. ``We had the
speed to get behind them, and we couldn't do it. Mentally we lost
it. We lost control of the game, and we lost the calm we had before
the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   That was Reyna's fault. He's responsible for picking this team
up, for guiding it through the tough spots and picking apart
opposing defenses. And while he continues to show promise, as he
has since his early teens, he's not fulfilled that promise, not
yet.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' attack returned not because of his work, but
because, desperate as the minutes ticked away, they finally threw
all they had into going forward. It led to some fine chances --- a
David Regis volley hit a crossbar, and Iranian goalkeeper Ahmad
Abedzadeh made a point-blank stop of Hejduk --- then exacted a
heavy price. Mahdavikia took advantage of space in U.S. territory,
racing in to latch onto an Ali Daei through ball and bear down on
Keller in the 84th minute. His shot glanced off Keller's fingertips
en route to the lower-right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Daei nearly made it 3-0 --- Keller stopped
one shot, and Regis knocked another off the goal line --- before
McBride's goal a minute after that.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Yanks joined Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Jamaica and
Japan on the boat home with one match, Thursday against Yugoslavia,
still to go. Whether that game will bring an end to Sampson's reign
remains to be seen. He was asked afterward if he intended to
resign, given his team's failure in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step down? Voluntarily?'' he replied. ``You've got to be
kidding. I couldn't have done anything better tonight. Our team was
prepared well, the team played well. They just couldn't finish
their chances. There's nothing --- not one thing --- that I
would've done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't have, for instance, brought on Wynalda, the
Americans' all-time scoring leader, when a goal was sorely needed.
Several players questioned that decision --- ``You need someone to
score goals, and he's somebody who can score them for you,'' Keller
said --- but Wynalda was mum.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians, whose celebrations Reyna had watched when the
final whistle blew, weren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the greatest game we've ever played,'' said
Mahdavikia. ``Our people were expecting us to win this game, and we
gave it to them. I'm sure they're very happy. I'm sure they're
celebrating. I wish you could go to Teheran and see what's
happening over there right now.''

LEYRITZ GETS HIS WISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Jim Leyritz is out as the Red Sox'
righthanded designated hitter, former Dodger Billy Ashley is in,
and three members of the San Diego Padres, none of whom are at the
top of anybody's wish list, are headed East as a result of the
trade finalized Sunday by Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz and a minor league outfielder, Ethan Faggett, were
traded to the Padres for two pitchers, middle reliever Carlos Reyes
and relief prospect Dario Veras, both righthanders, and
switch-hitting minor league catcher Mandy Romero.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, who was the only Red Sox position player with a World
Series ring, said Sunday night he thinks the club may come to
regret the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not show up now,'' Leyritz said, ``but somewhere down
the line, they're going to miss me being there. When it comes down
to crunch time, hopefully those kids will come through for them. I
know I would have. I've been there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of their catchers goes down, who's going to catch for
them? Billy Ashley? Mandy Romero?''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7-inch Ashley, a prodigious power hitter in the minor
leagues who failed several trials of varying lengths with the
Dodgers, was batting .297 with 10 home runs and 45 RBIs in 50 games
with Triple A Pawtucket. Ashley, 27, is expected to be in uniform
for Monday night's game with the Phillies at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, whose arrival date is not yet known, will join the big
league club, while Veras and Romero will go to Pawtucket. When
Reyes arrives, the Red Sox almost certainly will send rookie Brian
Barkley back to Pawtucket, leaving Ron Mahay as the only lefty in
the Red Sox bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Ashley is a young slugger with outstanding power, the
kind of light-tower power fans like to see at Fenway Park,''
Duquette said. ``Billy Ashley is a competent major league player,
and we now have 25 guys going in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked Leyritz's bat on our ballclub, but we also like the
other combination of younger players we have in Ashley, Veras,
Reyes, and Mandy Romero.''
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy at his limited role with the club, Leyritz had asked to
be traded after Duquette refused to pick up his $1.9 million
contract option for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trading Leyritz,'' Duquette said, ``reinforces the team
concept and commitment every player makes to the other players on
the roster ... To have good chemistry, everybody has to make a
sacrifice to be a part of the team ... Jim Leyritz was not
satisfied with his role on this team. We thought it best for the
ballclub, with the season it has going, to make a change that
allows him to pursue his goals with another ballclub.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, who drove home to Fort Lauderdale after Sunday's game
and plans to join the Padres in time for their game Monday night in
Seattle, vigorously took exception to Duquette's implication that
he was not a team player. Manager Jimy Williams told him Sunday,
Leyritz said, that he didn't want to lose him, as did veterans Mo
Vaughn, John Valentin, and Jim Corsi in the last several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you personally that Jimy Williams spoke to me this
afternoon and said, `I didn't want the trade to be done, I really
don't want to lose you. I know you how feel but I didn't want to
lose you,''' Leyritz said. ``John Valentin told me that he hated me
when he played against me and didn't think he'd like to play with
me, but that I was a great guy and didn't want me to leave. Until
the last three days, I never knew how much these guys liked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz charged that the trade would never have happened if
Duquette had honored the pledge he made to Leyritz last November,
when he acquired the 34-year-old veteran and outfielder Damon
Buford from the Texas Rangers for pitchers Aaron Sele and Mark
Brandenburg and catcher Bill Haselman.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Leyritz said, Duquette told him that the Red Sox
planned to use him to catch between 80 and 90 games, as well as use
him as a righthanded DH and to give occasional breathers to
Valentin at third and Vaughn at first. But Leyritz was told at the
end of spring training that he would not be in the catching mix,
was behind the plate for just one game this season, and never
played another position in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Dan can look somebody in the face _ and I know he can,
because he lies right through people _ and say that he traded Aaron
Sele for a close-to-$2 million catcher/utilityman who would never
play in the field for two months, then he's a bigger man than me,''
Leyritz said. ``Also a huge liar.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't trade Aaron Sele and Bill Haselman for a platoon
outfielder (Buford) and a platoon DH. That doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is Dan made a commitment to me that he didn't
communicate to his manager. And now he's trying to smear me. I
think Dan knows he made a mistake. Whether he's willing to admit
it, I don't know. If I were in his position, I wouldn't admit it,
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said Sunday night, ``in fairness to Leyritz,'' that he
had expectations of a more expanded role until rookie Jason Varitek
wrested the catching job away from him in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   While several Sox players privately questioned the wisdom of
giving up a veteran righthanded bat when the team is already short
in that area, Duquette claimed that Ashley can fill Leyritz's role,
citing Ashley's slugging percentage and on-base average against
lefthanded pitchers that virtually mirror Leyritz's.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz, who did not play Sunday, batted .287 in 52 games with
the Red Sox. With eight home runs, he was tied for fourth on the
club with Valentin, and he drove in 24 runs. He became an instant
fan favorite on the team's first weekend at home, when he hit three
home runs in two days against the Mariners, including a game-tying
homer in the bottom of the ninth, then eight days later hit a home
run in the bottom of the ninth to tie a game against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   He finished April with a .346 average and five home runs, but
hit just three homer thereafter, the last on May 28. After a
three-hit game in Kansas City May 8, Leyritz batted just .215 in
his last 23 games and drove in just nine runs as his playing time
dwindled.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, meanwhile, has been the team's hottest hitter in
June, batting .400 (16 for 40) in 13 games, including Sunday's 0
for 5.
</P>
<P>
   Leyritz said he would have accepted his reduced role if Duquette
had picked up his option. ``Pick up the option, call it a wash,''
Leyritz said. ``But they didn't even consider it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he was traded to the Padres, who are in first place in
the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who was I traded for?'' Leyritz said. ``Ask Dan Duquette this:
Is he trying to win a World Series, or is he trying to win in the
future?''

   LYON, France _ Hostage situations, Great Satans, fatwahs, and
negative stereotypes were forgotten when hundreds of Iranian and US
supporters converged in what became a spontaneous celebration in
Place Bellecour in the city's center just after noon Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   There was little antagonism between the groups, mostly friendly
bantering. One American with his face painted red, white, and blue
and holding the flags of both countries, posed for pictures with
equally exuberant Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   Afsaneh, a 33-year-old architect who would not divulge her last
name, displayed a handmade, heart-shaped sign with stars and
stripes on one half and Iran's green, white, and red on the other.
Afsaneh said she resided in the US and England after leaving Iran
in the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people of Iran and the people of the US are not against
each other,'' she said. ``This war was between the politicians.
Iranian people don't hate Americans and, from living in the US, I
found that nobody in America hates Iranians. The people of the two
countries should love each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Iranians were ex-patriates, like Afsaneh. Some
sympathized with the National Council of Resistance of Iran, which
complained that the French government denied visas to prominent
exiles such as Moslem Eskandra Filabi, a super heavyweight wrestler
who competed in the Olympic Games, or Bahram Mavedat and Hassan
Nayeb-Agha, members of Iran's team in the 1978 World Cup in
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   The National Council of Resistance of Iran planned to protest
against the Iranian government by supplying the traditional ``lion
and sun'' flag instead of a flag with the symbol for Allah.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of factions, Royalists, Islamists, others, but
today we are supporting Iran together,'' said Hamid, 38, a
financial analyst residing in Chartres. ``We are here for the
sport, to support the team and not the regime. But choosing the
flag could divide Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the game is a tie, because otherwise the regime could
use it to justify what they have done. A tie means that freedom and
democracy win. The US and Iran are drawing closer together
economically. The current regime realizes that the fanaticism
cannot work over a long period. Things must change in Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Stade Gerland, there was a large group of Americans,
attracted by a brew pub. Members of Sam's Army, the US supporters
group, have set up headquarters at Ninkasi, named after the
Somalian goddess of beer, according to owner Christophe Fargier.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the images of Iranians have held up,'' said Jason
Wharton, a soccer coach from Abilene, Texas. ``We were told the
Iranians were crazy, bloodthirsty people. But when they played
Yugoslavia they showed they were great sportsmen, always helping up
the other team. I think they should win the FIFA Fair Play award
for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is going to do well in this game. This is a lucky day
for the US. We were lucky Germany came back to tie Yugoslavia.
America is a lucky country and good things happen to us. I've
always thought that if America was ever going to win the World Cup,
we would have to get lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's 2-1 loss eliminated the US from Cup contention,
Wharton may have a different opinion of his country's luck.

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Sometimes the other players on the New
England Revolution call him Tom or Tommy. At other times, he's
referred to by his last name, McLaughlin. And then there are the
occasions when teammates hail him simply by calling out the name of
the college from which he recently graduated, Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McLaughlin is a rare Major League Soccer player, the only
Harvard graduate in the league. The forward was Ivy League player
of the year last season.
</P>
<P>
   Though teammates don't ask him much about Ivy soccer, said
McLaughlin, ``there's always a mystique about Harvard, though.
Really, it's not all that different than some other colleges _ the
difference is that Harvard gets more hype than others as the best
institution. It was a great feeling picking up my diploma from the
place, though.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, an economics major, graduated cum laude on the
strength of his performance in the final two exams of his college
career.
</P>
<P>
   More recently came another examination, this on the field for
the Revolution against Columbus May 22. It was the first game in
which he dressed, and McLaughlin played 22 minutes. He remembers
everything about that game _ from being told by coach Thomas Rongen
to warm up to go in the game, to being told by the coach to move
the ball forward and become the Revolution's No. 3 offensive
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the words, definitely not,'' McLaughlin
said. ``He told me to make things happen. He told me to push the
ball forward. As I recall, I did want to have a shot early, but I
wasn't quite sure what game I'd get in.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin played well and even scored a goal _ or so he
thought. The ball went in after McLaughlin redirected a corner
kick, but McLaughlin was whistled for a foul for obstructing the
Columbus goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we were watching the game footage before a practice,
Coach Rongen showed the play and he said that home teams aren't
supposed to get calls like that, not have them go against them at
least,'' said McLaughlin, who despite having a goal called back
still showed a videotape of the play to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case of the officials trying to protect the
goalkeeper. I was shielding the goalkeeper, something I like to do,
and when the ball came in, it hit my shin and went in. It seemed
the goalie was pulling me down from behind as I was facing Jesse
(Van Sawn), who put the corner kick into play. I tried to hit it
with my foot, but I couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Had McLaughlin's goal counted, it would have cut Columbus's 2-0
lead in half. Instead, it was just another near miss in a difficult
season for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin has found the pace of play in MLS to be far quicker
than the college game. ``The ball is on one side of the field and
the next thing you know it's on the other, so you have to be able
to anticipate play,'' he said. ``And the game is a lot more
physical than college ball, where I was a physical player. In that
game against Columbus, I was tossed around by one guy. There's so
much bumping and pushing, I don't know what a foul is anymore. So
I'm trying to adapt to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The kid from Harvard is still learning.

SAND WAS KICKED ON STEWART 
</HEADLINE>
 OPEN-STEWART-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Olympic Club is on the edge of the Pacific
Ocean's line of low clouds and fog and the result is this part of
The City alternates between too warm or too chilly. By the minute.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that when Payne Stewart stepped to the 10th tee Sunday
afternoon, the weather _ which had been too warm _ suddenly turned
chilly. And perhaps it was only a coincidence that on that hole,
Stewart looked at the leaderboard ``and that was the first time I
took notice of what was happening,'' and Stewart saw that his golf
fortunes suddenly were chilly, too, while that guy a few holes away
_ Lee Janzen _ was warm.
</P>
<P>
   The weather and Stewart kept getting chillier, even though
Stewart was able to scramble for pars on both the 10th and 11th.
This was no way to win a US Open _ backing into it _ and Stewart
had meandered around the front nine, surrendering two strokes to
par, and soon he would pay the price for dallying.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart hit a solid drive down the right side of the 12th hole
``and I was walking down the fairway and I saw it was in a sand
divot.'' Hmmm ... more than a few earlier Stewart drives of this
Open had landed off course ``and I had gotten good lies in the
rough but now I had a bad lie in the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was here that the US Open title, which Stewart seemingly
was attempting to coddle rather than seize, slipped from his grasp.
Different courses attempt to repair fairway divots in various ways,
and the United States Golf Association does it by filling the
divots with sand. But the problem, said Stewart, ``is you don't
know how deep the sand is in the divot.''
</P>
<P>
   So Stewart was in a quandary. His ball had landed ``in three or
four'' sand divots at various stops on the PGA Tour this year, but
now the Open was riding on how he would handle this latest strange
twist of irony, his ball landing cleanly on the fairway but resting
on sand. ``I told myself,'' said Stewart, ```Well, it's a divot.
You have to deal with it. You have to take the good with the
bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart reached for a club, thought some more, and went with a
9-iron in place of his original choice, a pitching wedge. He
clearly was unsure of what to do. His swing _ a half-go with that
9-iron _ looked weak and the result was even weaker, a plop of the
ball into the bunker guarding the right front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, USGA rules official Tom Meeks informed Stewart that
his play had been too slow, and ``Meeks said to me, `You just got a
bad time,''' said Stewart, which is a warning for slow play.
Stewart asked Meeks what would happen if he got another bad time,
and ``He told me it'd be a one-stroke penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this, including Stewart missing a 7-footer for par after
blasting out of the bunker, ``sat well with me,'' he said. ``Here I
am, trying to figure out what to do with this sand divot, and what
kind of shot to play, and after I played it into the bunker, he
gives me the bad time.''
</P>
<P>
   No surprise then that Stewart's next shot, a 5-iron off the tee
to the 186-yard 13th hole, seemed perfectly stroked ``but it rolled
through the green and into the back rough.'' Stewart's adrenaline
was flowing at the divot on 12, Meeks's warning, and how suddenly
the five-stroke lead he once enjoyed had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart also bogeyed the 13th and even a birdie on 14 could not
slow the momentum of this Open slipping away. He found a front
bunker on the 609-yard 16th, taking another bogey, and even an
impressive par on the monstrous 468-yard par-4 17th gave no hint
that Stewart was capable of making up the one shot that would
enable him to tie Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's second shot on the final hole left him 25 feet above
the cup. The putt may have seemed makeable on television but not to
any who had been around the 18th green all day. ``Nobody's made
this putt,'' said one fan. ``They've all been left,'' said another.
``I know, I've been here 11 hours.'' Stewart's putt, while firm,
was also left and never threatened the cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Payne Stewart said he was sure he would sleep well
last night, just as he was sure that The Olympic Club itself ``won
this Open, since only one golfer out there was able to equal par.''
Late afternoon was coming. The Pacific air now seemed very chilly.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Aaron Yates couldn't believe his eyes. Or his
luck.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Honda rider Ben Bostrom and Suzuki rider Mat
Mladin make a broken-field runaway in the first nine laps of
Sunday's American Motorcycle Association Superbike Tour race, Yates
survived a battle of attrition among the leaders by winning the
39-lap featured event of the 75th Loudon Classic at New Hampshire
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   In winning his first Superbike Tour event of the season, and his
first since a victory at Sears Point Raceway two years ago, Yates
capped a calamitous weekend that saw Miguel Duhamel, the AMA
Superbike series points leader, suffer a season-ending double
compound fracture of his left femur during Friday's qualifying
session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two guys who went out in front, they sure made it
easy,'' said Yates, 24, of Milledgeville, Ga., who pocketed a
$10,500 check for the Superbike triumph and finished runner-up to
Doug Chandler in the Pro Honda Oils 600cc Supersport race Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   After he rode his Suzuki for the first nine laps in fourth
place, Yates capitalized on a ruinous turn of events sparked when
Bostrom wiped out on a sweeping, uphill curve in Turn 6 to drop out
of the lead on Lap 9. Bostrom picked up his Honda from the gravelly
runoff area, dusted it off, and reentered the fray to finish
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what initiated it,'' Yates said, when asked about
Bostrom's wipeout. ``But it looked like he was in front of Mat and
must have lost the throttle or something. He stood it up and kind
of went straight off in the middle of the turn into the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   One lap later, Mladin surrendered the lead he had inherited from
Bostrom to runner-up Jamie Hacking when his Suzuki seized. Mladin
rolled it to a stop at the top of the hill just past Turn 8, got
off, and flung it to the ground in disgust. He finished last and
departed the track without comment.
</P>
<P>
   So when Bostrom crashed and fell back to 18th, and Mladin
declared no mas and dropped out along with Thomas Kipp, who crashed
in Turn 2 while running in third place on the same lap Mladin
parked it, Yates realized it was time to stop spectating and start
riding hard.
</P>
<P>
   He did precisely that and wrested the lead from Hacking on Lap
11 to lead the final 29 laps. On each go-round, ``I counted down
the laps and counted up the money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ben had his little thing there, I kind of figured he was
pushing pretty hard there,'' said Yates. ``And then when I saw Mat
coast off the ace, I was like, `Wow, thanks a lot.' They really
handed it to me. I just thought they made it a good day for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Anthony Gobert had a similar feeling when he came
around for the final lap and was startled by the sight of Chandler,
who had been running third at the time, picking his bike up off the
grassy runoff area near Turn 1. Gobert, as a result, wound up third
and pulled within two points (251-249) of Chandler, who departed
NHIS after a tumultuous weekend as the new Superbike Tour points
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Miguel going out, that opens it up quite a bit because he
was dominating the last couple of races,'' said Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'd say this weekend's been ... pretty different.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as far as Aaron Yates was concerned, it was pretty
fortuitous.

DODGERS FIRE RUSSELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Bill Russell, who became the Los Angeles Dodgers'
manager after the 42-year run of Walter Alston and Tom Lasorda, is
out after less than two seasons, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, 49, was fired Sunday after the Dodgers suffered another
loss to the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field, ending 32 years as a
player, coach and manager with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Russell becomes the first Dodgers manager to lose his job since
Charlie Dressen in 1954. He is the first to be fired during the
season since Leo Durocher in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Under Russell this season, the Dodgers struggled, going 36-38
after many projected they would win the National League West.
</P>
<P>
   They were involved in a blockbuster trade on May 15 that sent
catcher Mike Piazza to Florida and sustained several critical
injuries, including top pitcher Ramon Martinez, who is lost for the
season with a torn muscle in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell's firing, which had been rumored since spring
training, happened as the team flew home from a disappointing 2-4
road trip. It included a two-game sweep by the division-leading San
Diego Padres, who lead the Dodgers by 12{ games, the club's largest
deficit in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Russell was in the final season of a two-year $700,000 contract.
Lasorda's name has surfaced as a candidate to replace Russell, but
he denied that Sunday night from his home in Fullerton.
</P>
<P>
   Russell took over the club on July 29, 1996, when Lasorda
stepped down with a heart condition. The Dodgers made the playoffs
as a wild card team, but lost in three games to the Atlanta Braves.
The Dodgers have not had a post-season victory since 1988, when
they won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers missed the playoffs last season despite a
late-season charge against division champion San Francisco. Russell
was criticized for several tactical errors during a September
series with the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He also was viewed as a bad fit after the team was sold last
March from the conservative O'Malley family to Rupert Murdoch's
flamboyant Fox Group.
</P>
<P>
   Russell, who joined the organization in 1966, was built more in
the low-key mold of Alston, who managed the club from 1955-76. But
his first manager in the minor leagues was Lasorda, who helped him
make the transition from the outfield to shortstop, where he played
for 18 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The two were close through Lasorda's 20 years as manager,
together winning four pennants and a World Series. But the
relationship became strained when Russell took over as manager.
</P>
<P>
   The players had become tired of Lasorda's over-the-top style and
welcomed Russell's approach. Russell, however, was not allowed to
choose his own coaching staff, which is common in managerial
changes.
</P>
<P>
   And with pending sale to Fox clouding off-season acquisitions,
Russell also was not given the top relief pitcher that was lacking
during the final months of last season. O'Malley, who sold the team
for $311million, wanted to keep the payroll as trim as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a strong showing in spring training, the Dodgers
continued to underachieve under new management, and a shake-up was
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The firing is believed to be another step in an overhaul of the
organization by Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The trade of Piazza and third baseman Todd Zeile for outfielder
Gary Sheffield, Bobby Bonilla, catcher Charles Johnson and
outfielder Jim Eisenreich was staggering for fans who watched
Piazza have the best five seasons by a catcher in major league
history.
</P>
<P>
   But it also raised the team's payroll from $47million to
$58million. Piazza was seeking a seven-year, $105million contract
and was eligible for free agency at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations stalled in April. Fox feared Piazza would leave
without compensation and made the trade. Since the May 15 trade,
the Dodgers are 15-16 entering a four-game stretch with the Angels.

THE LEARNING COMPANY MAKES BID FOR BRODERBUND 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
The Learning Co. made a $419 million bid yesterday to acquire
Novato-based Broderbund Software, sources said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broderbund's board of directors met yesterday to decide whether
to accept the offer, the sources said. The board's decision was not
known last night, and spokespeople for both companies refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the deal would create a software powerhouse.
Broderbund is one of the pioneers of educational multimedia
software, and its computer games Myst and Riven are among the
best-selling titles of all time.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., based in Cambridge, Mass., has roots in
Fremont, and it maintains an office there. It is locked in a fierce
battle with Cendant Corp. for dominance in the educational software
market, and it has voraciously acquired smaller software firms,
including Novato-based Mindscape in March and San Francisco-based
PF.Magic in May. Earlier this month, it acquired Sofsource, a
publisher of educational and test software, for about $45 million.
</P>
<P>
   The price of $20 a share is 21 percent above Broderbund's Friday
closing price of $16.50. The Learning Co. stock closed at $25
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If approved, the deal is expected to close by August 31.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund strongly hinted last week that it was up for sale.
Rumors that Hasbro was considering buying the company sent
Broderbund's stock up 30 percent over two weeks, and Broderbund
announced that it had hired Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette to
``explore strategic alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Broderbund also announced that its earnings for the
third quarter would fall short of analysts' expectations. It
forecast a loss of 12 to 15 cents per share, or $2.5 million to
$3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since last September, Broderbund has eliminated 135 positions,
all in the Bay Area. It currently employs 1,100 people, 320 of whom
are in Novato.
</P>
<P>
   Although sources said no immediate layoffs would be announced,
many of Broderbund's products overlap with The Learning Co.'s
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's The Print Shop competes with Mindscape's
Printmaster, and the two companies also have competing genealogy
products.
</P>
<P>
   Alma Rodoni, Broderbund group vice president who oversaw the
education, productivity and genealogy business units, would leave
the company, according to sources. Rodoni, who joined Broderbund
when it acquired Banner Blue of Fremont, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But Broderbund's educational titles, including the popular
Carmen Sandiego series and its Living Books division's Dr. Seuss
software, make it a logical choice for a merger with The Learning
Co., according to John Girton of Larkspur-based Girton Capital
Management.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education-wise, there's a nice fit,'' Girton said.
</P>
<P>
   When The Learning Co. acquired Mindscape, company President
Kevin O'Leary declared, ``Our strategy is to be the No. 1 consumer
software company, period.'' With that acquisition, The Learning Co.
became No. 2 in number of software packages sold through stores,
second only to Cendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. _ which employs about 260 workers in Fremont
and Redwood City _ faltered last year, laying off about 50
employees and paring back its product line. Since that time, the
firm has trimmed its debt and gone on a buying binge. In 1997, The
Learning Co. recorded a loss of $475,000 on sales of $392.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund lost $13 million on sales of $192 million last year.
Girton said the company should register close to $300 million in
sales this year, and he noted that it holds $137 million in cash
and short-term investments, which would be substantial assets for a
debt-heavy company like The Learning Co.
</P>
<P>
   Once a high-flyer, Broderbund has struggled in recent years as
the consumer software market grew increasingly cutthroat. During a
period of furious consolidation, Broderbund was the last well-known
maker of consumer software to remain independent.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., then based in Fremont, was bought by
Massachusetts-based Softkey in 1995, and the combined company took
the name of the acquired firm.

   DENVER _ Bill Russell, who became the Los Angeles Dodgers'

fired after less than two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the story hardly ended there Sunday night when Lasorda was
named interim general manager, replacing Fred Claire, and minor
league manager Glenn Hoffman was named to replace Russell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I would do whatever they asked,'' said Lasorda,
who stepped down as manager in July 1996 due to health reasons.
``They want me to do this, and I am ready for the challenge.''

SHAKE-UP FOLLOWS ANOTHER DODGERS LOSS

<P>
   DENVER _ The Dodgers' voyage of the damned ended Sunday with the
club throwing manager Bill Russell and general manager Fred Claire
off the plane at 35,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Russell became the first Dodgers manager fired during the season
since Leo Durocher in 1948, just hours after the team's road trip
ended with an 11-6 loss to the Colorado Rockies. Glenn Hoffman, the
manager at Triple-A Albuquerque, will replace Russell on an interim
basis. Claire, the team's GM since 1987, will be replaced by Tom
Lasorda, also on an interim basis.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who became a club vice president in July 1996 when
retiring as manager after 20 years, was with the Dodgers Class-A
team in Yakima, Wash. on Saturday night. He was scheduled to fly to
Boston on Sunday but returned home after learning of the death of
close friend and former Dodgers general manager Al Campanis.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda drove to Dodger Stadium late Sunday night and was
offered the interim GM's job by former owner Peter O'Malley and new
team president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's last game, played in front of 48,186 at Coors Field,
dropped the Dodgers 12{ games behind first-place San Diego and
reflected the kind of spell they have been under all season.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game that included the loss of shortstop Jose Vizcaino,
whose seriously sprained right ankle made him the sixth front-line
member of the club to be injured this season. Eric Karros hit two
more homers and Chan Ho Park pitched the worst game of his young
career.
</P>
<P>
   Park (5-5), the Dodgers top pitcher a year ago, allowed 10 runs
in just 51/3 innings, including a three-run homer and two-run
single by Dante Bichette. In his last two starts, Park is 0-2 and
has given up 10 runs in 111/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I can say, he was terrible,'' the usually
placid pitching coach Goose Gregson said. ``From the first inning
on he did not make the pitches he needed to make. He was not
throwing hard. He has never really faced adversity before now, but
he's facing it now and he's not doing well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Park acknowledged he pitched timidly, trying not to walk batters
instead of challenging them with his 95 mph fastball. Sunday he was
rarely clocked at 90.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad day,'' Park said. ``And it was not a good
day to have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers already had third baseman Bobby Bonilla in the
hospital, where he is being treated for an intestinal infection. He
was placed on the 15-day disabled list Saturday and will remain
here overnight for observation.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Vizcaino, who was holding together an infield of
third baseman Paul Konerko and second baseman Juan Castro in the
absence of Bonilla and Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   He singled to left with one out in the third but turned his
ankle attempting to steal second. He was carried off on a golf
cart. Vizcaino was taken to the same hospital as Bonilla. Trainer
Charlie Strasser, who remained overnight in Denver, visited Bonilla
while Vizcaino was being examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole scene was just too weird,'' Strasser said. ``I don't
think I've ever seen anything quite like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 21 years with the organization, it is unlikely
Strasser has seen many worse-looking ankles than Vizcaino's. The
doctors said he will be out three to five days, but Vizcaino said,
``It's going to be a long time. That is the most pain I have ever
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bright spots were the two homers by Eric Karros had in
left-hander Bobby Jones' (2-2) first career complete game. Karros,
often critical of the softball atmosphere here, had four homers and
13 RBI in the four-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sound like he likes Coors Field,'' Rockies manager
Don Baylor said. ``But it sure likes him.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros was too preoccupied with his faltering team to care very
much about the homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the last two games after winning the first two,'' he
said. ``That isn't the way it is supposed to work. It must be very
hard for Billy to put up with this with all the other stuff that is
going on. I feel for him.''

 NEWS &AMP; FEATURES SUMMARY No 2457 - JUNE 22, 1998  
<TEXT>
<P>
   1. OUT OF JAIL, CHINA'S WEI JINGSHENG HAS A TOUGH AGENDA By
Philip Caputo, from The New York Times Magazine
</P>
<P>
   HIs arrival in the United States raised hopes that he would
unify the Chinese dissidents and press the case for human rights.
Now, as President Clinton heads for China, Wei Jingsheng, while
still revered, is finding out what a tough agenda that is. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------2. CLINTON'S APPOINTMENT WITH BEIJING IS A
MISTAKE By Robert Kagan &AMP; William Kristol, from The New York Times
Op-Eds
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has argued that once the U.S. stopped
challenging China's human-rights record and withdrew the threat of
economic sanctions, China would ease repression at home. In fact,
the Chinese government has responded by exiling a couple of
prominent dissidents and arresting many others - in sum, by
maintaining one of the world's most repressive regimes. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------3. PRISONER IN KOSOVO By Peter Lippman, from
The Progressive
</P>
<P>
   In March, Peter Lippman became a prisoner in Kosovo, along with
a group of activists from Peaceworkers, a California-based
organization that monitors human-rights abuses and promotes
nonviolent conflict resolution. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------4. REVIVE THE DRIVE AGAINST NUCLEAR WEAPONS
NOW By David Andrews &AMP; Lena Hjelm-Wallen - an Op-Ed from The
International Herald Tribune After a decade of great promise in the
field of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation, the specter of
nuclear weapons is again at the center of attention. The nuclear
disarmament process now urgently needs a new and forceful impetus. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------5. HONG KONG'S YEAR ONE UNDER BEIJING'S THUMB
from Der Spiegel Magazine (English translation)
</P>
<P>
   In subtle and insidious ways, the Beijing overseers are changing
the face of what was one of the world's most dynamic capitalist
economies. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------6. WHAT'S DOING IN ASPEN By James Brooke,
from The New York Times Way to Go
</P>
<P>
   Coloradans sometimes feel they need a visa to visit Aspen. But
behind the intimidating buzz of celebrities and high prices, Aspen
is a magical town where the beauty of the Elk Mountains combines
with an ever more stimulating cultural life. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------7. ALGERIAN SECURITY SERVICES MAY HAVE BEEN
INVOLVED IN THE TIBEHIRINE TRAGEDY By Henri Tincq from Le Monde
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, seven French trappist monks were murdered in
Algeria, two months later, the bishop of Oran, Mgr. Pierre
Claverie, died in a bomb attack. New and disturbing evidence
suggests that the Armed Islamic Group, blamed at the time for the
killings, may not have been solely responsible. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------8. CRUISE CENTRAL By Everett Potter from the
New York Times Way to Go It's full steam ahead in the cruise
business. While some industry pundits point to the film `` Titanic
`` as an ironic booster of sales, that's open to debate. But
icebergs or not, the fact is that travel agents and cruise-only
agents report record bookings, sold-out sailings and inquiries many
months in advance of embarkation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton crams for his trip to China
this week, he must be yearning for those simpler days, not so long
ago, when it was much easier to explain to Americans the
distinction between friends and foes in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   During the first Clinton presidential campaign, the Chinese
government was the menace, run by dictators ``coddled'' by
President George Bush as they oppressed Tibet, threatened Taiwan,
forced abortions and swiped U.S. technology. Then there was Japan,
America's biggest military ally and partner in Asia. Sure, the
Japanese kept out U.S. car parts and computer chips, barriers that
Clinton vowed to smash. But whenever trade quarrels got really
nasty, cooler heads in Washington would remind people that it was
Japan _ market oriented and host to U.S. troops _ that Washington
could count on in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But no one then could imagine the kind of crisis Asia faces
today: economic meltdown. And if you listen closely to the oratory
of Washington before the most important foreign trip of Bill
Clinton's presidency, things sound very different. Tuesday,
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin took to the podium of the White
House to declare that ``China has been an island of stability in
Asia'' _ a savvy, responsible player in the global effort to tamp
down the economic firestorm that started in Asia a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan? The view from Washington these days is that it is
spreading the bubonic plague of the markets _ wild instability _
while refusing to take the cure. When Rubin went to the Oval Office
on Monday night to tell Clinton that the United States had to
reverse policy, spending billions in the currency markets to prop
up the yen, he described it as a desperation effort to save Japan
from itself. Inside the Treasury, his aides have a new title for
Japanese Finance Minister Hikaru Matsunaga: Minister for the
Destruction of the World Economy.
</P>
<P>
   This huge shift in perspective is not universal, of course. Many
in Congress still view China as a security threat, and last week
they kicked into high gear the hearings over whether the Chinese
are exploiting liberalized U.S. commercial export laws to improve
their spy satellites and nuclear missiles. Not surprisingly, the
White House is drafting and re-drafting the remarks Clinton will
deliver in China to make sure he presses the themes of human rights
and nonproliferation.
</P>
<P>
   In calm times this would be a delicate balancing act. But it is
made far more complex by the realities of Asia's economic turmoil.
China may remain America's huge military threat, but it has emerged
in recent months as an equally huge economic ally _ insuring, at
least for now, that crisis does not become catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   And Japan, home to the U.S. bases that keep Chinese power in
check, has become an economic drunk driver. Its steps to deregulate
the economy, reform its banks and cut taxes are widely viewed as
inadequate, and no one even talks anymore about turning Japan into
an engine of Asian recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether you run a country or a company, you better figure out
how to live without Japan for a while,'' says Morgan Stanley Asia
chairman John Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally the Chinese see this an opportunity. In return for a
pledge to hold their currency stable _ which President Clinton is
expected to seek this week, and which is in China's interest anyway
_ they want acknowledgment of China as the new economic leader of
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That's a stretch (China's economy is still a fifth the size of
Japan's) but nothing makes the Chinese happier than when U.S.
officials repeat Rubin's mantra that ``sometime in the next century
China will be the world's largest economy.'' After all, a decade
ago the Japanese thought that trophy would belong to them.
</P>
<P>
   China's constant reminders of U.S.-Chinese cooperation in World
War II, fighting side-by-side against you-know-who, are part of a
campaign to portray China as Asia's leader and America's
indispensable partner. It's no secret why the Chinese insisted that
Clinton only visit China on this trip: They wanted the imagery of
Air Force One flying right past Japan. (To make amends, Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has been invited to visit
Washington in July.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The stars are lined up for them, because Japan is in such
disfavor around the world,'' said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the
Yale School of Management. ``They know that we have no one else to
turn to for managing the economic crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Garten suspects the Chinese have a more specific agenda in mind.
They want to swap continued cooperation for America's commitment to
get them into the World Trade Organization and a pledge to draw
back U.S. support for Taiwan. The Chinese have made no secret of
their unhappiness with a revision of the security treaty between
Japan and the United States last year, which they viewed as part of
a broader effort to contain Chinese military power.
</P>
<P>
   It's never been easy for the United States to maintain an
equilibrium in its relations with Japan and China. One has always
been in vogue, the other out. But rarely have things been this
complicated, when U.S. security interests and U.S. economic
interests have pulled in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   And add to that another wrinkle. The Clinton administration is
praising China's economic management today in part to encourage it
to defuse an economic time bomb down the road: China itself.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``China today has the characteristics of every Asian country
that was hit by the crisis _ but worse,'' says Michael Walton, the
director of poverty reduction at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at some numbers you are not likely to hear President
Clinton rattle off in the next two weeks. Somewhere between 25 and
30 percent of all the loans on the books of Chinese banks are not
being paid back and probably never will be. That means there is now
at least $270 billion in bad debt in China (compared with $600
billion in much richer Japan). Moody's Investor Services warned
Friday that China's big state banks are ``in reality heavily
insolvent.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about those impressive skyscrapers in Shanghai that
Clinton will roar past in his motorcade on the way to a roundtable
with cell-phone-toting Chinese entrepreneurs? Vast numbers of them
are sitting empty. And while the entrepreneurs represent China's
future, up in the industrial northeast unemployment rates are
running near 30 percent. The numbers are getting worse as Zhu
Rongji, China's new prime minister, shuts down vast steel plants
and mines that Mao opened 40 years ago with a bunch of nifty
slogans but no business plan.
</P>
<P>
   So what has protected China from the economic calamity that has
hit its neighbors? A second Great Wall: its currency, which is not
freely convertible. That means the speculators of the world can't
move money freely in and out of China. Sealed off from the markets,
China has sidestepped George Soros and his friends, pegging its
currency to a fixed exchange rate with the dollar. (It helps that
the Chinese have built up a war chest of $150 billion in foreign
reserves.)
</P>
<P>
   But there are ways for the world to get around the wall. As the
dollar has soared, China's exports _ the fuel of its economic
growth _ have become far more expensive overseas. Suddenly the
countries whose currencies have dropped so dramatically _ Korea,
Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia _ are selling goods more cheaply and
cutting into China's market share. And that is reducing China's
growth rate at the moment it desperately needs money to finance its
perilous transition to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that when the Japanese yen fell to scary
new lows last week, the Chinese began to scream. Japan's economy is
so big that it could force another round of huge currency
devaluations _ a second, far more fearsome phase of the Asia
crisis. Chinese leaders began threatening to devalue their own
currency. China's nervousness is one reason Rubin intervened in the
markets to bail out the yen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Treasury secretary made no secret of the fact that he
was forced to select among bad choices. He wanted to force Japan to
make structural changes before he helped the yen _ massive
deregulation, tax cuts, shutting down the sickest banks. The
Chinese, he notes, have addressed their problems far more directly
than Japan has.
</P>
<P>
   What he got last week was a new commitment from Japan _ one that
may or may not be worth any more than previous commitments. If it
isn't, then he has only bought a little time. And sooner or later,
Japan's troubles could become China's _ and the world's.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 21, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-ASIA-REVIEW _ No one then could imagine the kind of crisis
Asia faces today: economic meltdown. And if you listen closely to
the oratory of Washington before the most important foreign trip of
Bill Clinton's presidency, to China, things sound very different.
On Tuesday Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin took to the podium of
the White House to declare that ``China has been an island of
stability in Asia'' _ a savvy, responsible player in the global
effort to tamp out the economic firestorm that started in Asia a
year ago. And Japan? The view from Washington these days is that it
is spreading the bubonic plague of the markets _ wild instability _
and yet refuses to clean up its act. By David E. Sanger. WITH
GRAPHIC. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WORKPLACE-REVIEW _ These days, it seems people are trying to be
all they can and must be at the office, as the workplace has become
an increasingly popular but elusive spot to look for meaning and
fulfillment in life. It's fine to take the road less traveled, as
long as it means finding a less-congested route to get to the
office earlier. By Adam Bryant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DIANA-DEATH-REVIEW _ Eight months have passed since the Princess
of Wales died in what the French authorities have called a
straightforward car crash. But their flat assertions that it was
merely an accident have only encouraged theorists, who are still
busily inventing wacky stories. By Sarah Lyall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-ENTOURAGE-REVIEW _ The horde accompanying President
Clinton to China this week will number more than 1,000 people. The
presidential entourage and its paraphernalia fill four passenger
planes and several large C-141 military transports. But why? By
John Broder. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CASPIAN-OIL-REVIEW _ A rush is on to exploit what could prove to
be the world's richest oil bonanza. The Caspian is a
California-size body of saltwater _ the world's largest landlocked
body of water _ that may sit on as much as 200 billion barrels and
16 percent of the Earth's potential oil reserves. Even at today's
low prices, that could add up to $3 trillion in oil. But it is it a
sea or a lake? The answer will determine what countries can exploit
the reserves. By Elaine Sciolino. WITH GRAPHIC MAP. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-PHONES-REVIEW _ The dream of an African renaissance is
all the rage these days on the continent, but without better
telecommunications it will be as hard to spread wealth and
democracy as it would have been for Florence and Chartres to spread
Renaissance culture without the old Roman roads. Only about 1 in
300 people in sub-Saharan Africa has a phone, making the financial
opportunities huge. By Donald G. McNeil Jr. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-WATCHDOG-REVIEW _ Midway through a news story about Steven
Brill's arrival as the newest major-domo in the booming industry of
media criticism, Howard Kurtz, a respected practitioner himself for
The Washington Post, suddenly found it necessary to open
parentheses confessionally in noting: ``The founder of Brill's
Content (to which this reporter is to be an occasional contributor)
could not be reached for comment.'' It was a moment of comic relief
badly needed by the Fourth Estate, run ragged these past five
months in its coverage of the allegations of sex and mendacity at
the Clinton White House. Here was the media watchdog watch turning
into a shimmering house of mirrors, with one watchdog sniffing out
the latest watchdog while properly noting the crisscross of
commercial interests at work in all the watching. By Francis X.
Clines. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COP-SUICIDE-REVIEW _ It happens dozens of times each year during
jittery hostage dramas and routine traffic stops: desperate people
lure police officers into shooting them in a phenomenon that has
come to be known in law-enforcement circles as suicide by cop.
There are no hard statistics showing the frequency of such
incidents, but experts estimate that up to 10 percent of the
roughly 600 fatal police shootings that occur in an average year
are caused by people actively seeking to die. By Alan Feuer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOBACCO-REVIEW _ Republicans can usually win when they can
position themselves as the guardians of low taxes and small
government. By the same token, Democrats have the advantage when
they can frame an issue as one involving the protection of
children. The tobacco bill, the most ambitious measure before
Congress this year, lay across that political fault line. By David
E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S.-REVIEW (Washington) _ Is China friend or foe? And
should it or should it not benefit from U.S. technology? The United
States is pulled both ways. A llok at how Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a
conservative Republican from a southern California district with
lots of high-technology industry, has changed his position.
</P>
<P>
   GOLF-TV-REVIEW (Undated) _ How big is golf? It is 24-hour
cable-TV-channel big. To put the very existence of the Golf Channel
into perspective, consider that there is no Football Channel, no
Basketball Channel, no Baseball Channel. The Golf Channel says
something uniquely profound about our culture. Here, on the
occasion of the U.S. Open, the first day of summer and Father's
Day, are gleanings from a single day's programming.

<P>
   Remember Abraham Maslow, the humanistic psychologist from Psych
101?
</P>
<P>
   He's the fellow who wrote that people are driven to scale a
``hierarchy of needs,'' starting with food and shelter, then
working up through safety, love and esteem to the bell-ringer of
all needs: self-actualization.
</P>
<P>
   ``A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must
write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself,'' he wrote.
``What a man can be, he must be.''
</P>
<P>
   That's great for poets and pianists, but what about corporate
assistant vice presidents and human resources coordinators? If
there's meaning in Mozart, why not also serenity in spreadsheets?
</P>
<P>
   These days, people are trying to be all they can and must be at
the office, as the workplace has become an increasingly popular but
elusive spot to look for purpose and fulfillment in life.
</P>
<P>
   This search for meaning didn't appear out of nowhere. In boom
times, prosperous workers can afford to worry about more than the
size of their paychecks. 1980s-era greed still has a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   And baby boomers are hitting an age when the children are moving
out, giving parents time to think about moving up a notch or two on
Maslow's hierarchy. Companies, reaching the limits of downsizing
and re-engineering, have decided that one of the few remaining ways
to get more out of their workers is to help them find purpose..
</P>
<P>
   Just peruse the business shelves of the local bookstore, which
look more and more like the self-help section. ``The Artist's Way
at Work: Riding the Dragon'' (Morrow, 1998) promises ``12 weeks to
creative freedom'' (in week one, dubbed ``Emergence,'' you're
supposed to write three pages of whatever every morning). The back
cover of ``The Search for Meaning in the Workplace'' (Abingdon
Press, 1996) advertises the book as part of a new genre:
``Career/Philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Such books are becoming the latest versions of ``Bartlett's
Famous Quotations,'' often sprinkling in the margins penetrating
insights from Aristotle and Confucius, along with Lee Iacocca and
Malcolm Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The authors and their corporate cheering section blur the line
between work and life, speaking in a language less English than
corporate-speak. Author Stephen R. Covey, for example, telling
readers how to live effective lives, says they should ``be
proactive,'' ``synergize'' and ``think win-win.''
</P>
<P>
   Want to take a break from work on the golf course? Forget it.
Golf IS work. It is for getting ahead in business and schmoozing
clients, particularly for women who have long felt excluded from
the boy's clubs that rule so many companies (``Breaking the Grass
Ceiling'' is not just bad wordplay but an actual book).
</P>
<P>
   How about escaping with a travel or adventure book? ``Strategy
Safari: a Guided Tour through the Wilds of Strategic Management''
will be published by the Free Press this fall. Thanks to computers,
work and fun are just a trackball click away from each other.
</P>
<P>
   Workers look to chief executives to be moral leaders as much as
stewards of the balance sheet and maximizers of profit. An
increasingly important part of a CEOs job is coining some nifty
phrase or goal to give employees a broader mission than bringing
home a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   John Welch, the vaunted chairman of General Electric, has for
years preached the virtues of the ``boundaryless'' workplace where
everyone contributes to the entire organization rather than tends
to their own narrow turf.
</P>
<P>
   The recent writings of well-known management gurus like Tom
Peters seem intended to inspire more than educate, though passages
like this one from Peters' ``Circle of Innovation'' (Knopf, 1997)
may simply leave readers perplexed: ``YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT AN
ERASER. Forgetting _ not learning _ is the highest art. Think:
ORGANIZED forgetting. STRATEGIC forgetfulness. How? Cherish WASTE .
. . SILLINESS . . . FAILURE. i.e.: Ready. FIRE! Aim.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporations are also pushing their workers to think about
meaning and purpose. In this tight labor market, many companies
need to show they care about their employees' lives beyond work.
Otherwise, those same employees might jump to competitors who show
they care a bit more about such things.
</P>
<P>
   Even law firms are trying to reduce turnover in the ranks by
offering associates such beyond-the-bottom-line gestures as
paternity leave, according to a recent front-page article in The
National Law Journal.
</P>
<P>
   And if work hasn't quite become a religion, it's starting to
look like one, as hundreds of companies play host to religion
classes to accommodate their time-pressed workers.
</P>
<P>
   With global competition, of course, companies also want their
workers to be all they can be on the job. After all, employers have
re-engineered and downsized, but those changes can do only so much
to help a company's performance, especially when the remaining
workers are exhausted from doing the work of two former colleagues.
So companies hire motivational and inspirational speakers to
recharge their employees' batteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got an energy problem,'' said Richard J. Leider,
author of ``The Power of Purpose: Creating Meaning in Your Life and
Work'' (Berrett Koehler, 1997) and a frequent speaker and adviser
to corporations like American Express, General Motors and Pfizer.
``Many companies are wondering, `How do we attract and renew and
bring out the energy and talents in our people?''' Live to Work
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that there's anything wrong with encouraging
people to think about the broader meaning of life. But increasingly
the distinction between work and life has blurred. Live to work, or
work to live? With pagers, cellular phones, laptops and electronic
mail, it's increasingly live to work, anytime, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that work is with us on the beach, if we're going to
find happiness and self-actualization on the beach, work is going
to be a part of it,'' said David Reibstein, a professor at the
Wharton Business School who said consulting clients and former
students regularly sent him e-mail messages late at night and in
the early morning.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is work gratifying for a lot of people but the office
provides a greater sense of relaxation, security and appreciation
than home, according to Arlie Russell Hochschild, the author of
``The Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work''
(Metropolitan, 1997). Work is also one of the few addictions in
society that is not only accepted but rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no substitute for hard work,'' Thomas Edison wrote in
1932. The problem these days is that for a lot of people, Edison's
words are literally true.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Violating a journalistic trust
 &HT;    (For release Wednesday, June 24, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been in this business more than 47 years and have never
lied in print. I've made mistakes, plenty of them, but I've never
lied. Neither have most of the people in this business of the daily
printed word.
</P>
<P>
   Have all the direct quotes I've used over the years been exact?
No. Have they all been in context? Yes. Sometimes I couldn't read
part of my scribbly notes but I made certain I got the gist of the
direct quote. Sometimes I paraphrased, leaving out the quote marks,
but at other times, when I knew the quote was close to being
totally accurate, I put them within the quote marks.
</P>
<P>
   Have all the people I've written about and quoted been real
people? How could there be any other way? I couldn't conceive of
inventing a person for a news story or column, unless it was
identified in print as a hypothetical person.
</P>
<P>
   Over all these years, I've misspelled names and places, and
gotten dates wrong, even matched the wrong person with an event.
And made some bad decisions. But never intentionally. Neither have
any of the people I've worked with.
</P>
<P>
   All this comes to mind because of Patricia Smith, the Boston
Globe columnist and Pulitzer Prize finalist, who was exposed
recently as fabricating quotes, people and events, and forced to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Her journalistic lies reinforce the stereotype of newspaper
reporters who often are criticized of ``writing that just to sell
newspapers.'' Reporters can be accused of writing to look good, but
to sell newspapers? Other than the folks in the financial news
department, newspaper reporters have no idea of economics.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other field, the reputation of the newspaper person is
evaluated by its weakest link. Politics are rated by the bad
politicians, and thus newspaper people are rated by the few liars
and plagiarists.
</P>
<P>
   During my tenure as a newsroom executive, I ran into some
strange people in this business. I once had a reporter who believed
anything was quotable, as long as it was said by someone. He never
made up the quotes or people, just allowed their reckless
statements to get into his story without concern whether or not the
allegation was legitimate. We parted ways.
</P>
<P>
   One of the claims against Smith, whose saccharic mea culpa was
printed in the Boston Globe and other newspapers, was that she
reviewed an Elton John concert in 1986 for the Chicago Sun-Times
without ever attending the concert. That rang a bell with me.
</P>
<P>
   There was once a TV editor at our newspaper, well before I
became an executive there, who reviewed a new TV show most harshly.
When the managing editor, who saw the show _ and liked it _ called
him in to debate the acrid reviews, it was discovered that the
writer's TV set was on the fritz and he never saw the show he
condemned, contending that he knew anyway that it would be bad.
</P>
<P>
   There was a new TV editor quicker than you could say Red
Skelton.
</P>
<P>
   All of us in the business have to be careful of what we say, and
who we say said it. It can come back to haunt us as it did Patricia
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In a column that she wrote for the Boston Globe as recently as
April of this year, Ms. Smith excoriated Stephen Fagan, the father
who raised his daughters after lying to them that their mother had
died.
</P>
<P>
   Her column began: ``So we've established that Stephen Fagan _ he
of the forehead hugging hair, Palm Beach preening, and makeshift
social status _ is the most pathological of pathological liars.''
</P>
<P>
   He might have been, at least until it was discovered that Ms.
Smith, herself, has been at this lying game since at least 1986 and
made up quotes and people in at least four columns this year. That
she writes only two a week gives her a high percentage of lying.
</P>
<P>
   I hope she now turns to writing novels; she's well-suited for
it.

 &HT;    SHORT TAKES: Crying for Big Tobacco
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   What we didn't know until the last few weeks, when Big Tobacco
started spending $40 million to instruct us, was that any effort to
put some bounds around the holocaust of smoking was just another
big-government tax-and-spend dodge. That is now Republican policy,
and it played well in the polls. What dummies we are.
</P>
<P>
   Parents used to tell their kids that smoking would stunt their
growth _ almost everything stunted your growth in those days. It
was a fuddy-duddy sort of thing to say, but it turned out to be
pretty much right.
</P>
<P>
   We know a lot of things now about smoking. Smoking can make you
sick. Smoking can kill you in highly unpleasant ways. Smoking is as
addictive as hard drugs. Smoking can track you down in the womb.
Smoking in the 20th century has manufactured premature death for
millions.
</P>
<P>
   My father was a cigar smoker. Used to walk around with an unlit
cigar in his mouth when he couldn't light up. The house reeked of
smoke. He wondered why he had an asthmatic kid. He died of cancer.
My wife's grandfather was a chain smoker, and proud of it. Died of
lung cancer. They tried to slip a pack of his beloved Lucky Strikes
in his pocket when they buried him. The rabbi wouldn't let them.
Something told him it wasn't right. Family lore does not record if
he elaborated.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: On taxes and tobacco, GOP plays with fire
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, those wacky congressional Republicans. Aren't they having
fun? Don't you wish you could be one?
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans vote to do away with the entire, complete,
whole federal tax system of the United States of America in just
five short years, and the same day Senate Republicans, as a public
health service, prove that tobacco really, really is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   The dismissal of the tax system is a gesture in search of a
point. Building on the 1995 triumph when they closed down the
government, House Republicans now are playing chicken with the idea
of eliminating the United States altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The majority complains the current system is hideously complex
and causes H&AMP;R Block and other social ills. Well, yes, but that's
because Congress keeps voting in little quirks to pay off favored
interests. Both parties are guilty, though over the years
Republicans have been especially creative in legislating dodges for
their business clienteles.
</P>
<P>
   In sunsetting the system, the House in effect is pleading to be
saved from itself. Congress doesn't have a clue about what to put
in the system's place, but the hard-core ideologues who ramrod the
House these days are arguing for either a flat tax or a national
sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   It really doesn't matter which. By ending the progressive income
tax that asks more of our big financial winners than of the
workaday, either would stick it to middle-income earners. To any
degree this whimsy can be taken seriously, what it's really up to
is eliminating the little loopholes in favor of a single huge one
that would make the well-off better off.
</P>
<P>
   Jolly as all that was, the Senate's tobacco dance was even more
entertaining. GOP majorities bloated the legislation with
irrelevant amendments, then their leadership killed the bill
because _ because it had been bloated with irrelevant amendments!
Thus did the tobacco lobby's kept senators avoid an honest vote.
</P>
<P>
   Common Cause figures senators who voted tobacco's way averaged
$20,761 in tobacco money over the past six years, four times more
than others. And tobacco gave $16.7 million to the parties, 80
percent of it to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Awesomely, big tobacco, which has lied to us for decades, gulled
the public again, this time with TV ads claiming the legislation
was just a tax bill meant to fund more big government, and targeted
at lower-income folks to boot.
</P>
<P>
   The tax hike on cigarettes would indeed have hit the
under-$30,000 crowd heaviest, but that's where smokers are
concentrated, especially price-sensitive young smokers. And for
every 10 percent increase in prices, there's a 5 percent decline in
smokers, so the levy would have disproportionately benefited the
same group. If the industry really cared about those folks,
wouldn't it stop selling them poison?
</P>
<P>
   And those awful new federal programs? They were mainly to help
tobacco farmers move to new crops, to do independent research and
to pay for smoking illnesses _ in short, to mop up after big
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   So, the industry ducks regulation and snakes out of a legal
obligation to cut youth smoking. And their congressional playthings
will continue to be well-greased for fun. Let the good times roll.

 &HT;    DEVELOPMENT THREATENS AMISH WAY OF LIFE
 &HT;    For release Saturday, June 27.
 &HT;    Photos for this story are available from the Nerw York Times
News Service.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HOLLAND, Pa. _ Eli's grandfather reckons that the Amish are
like other folks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the best environment for the Plain People is the
farm,'' he explained, standing in a well-ordered woodshop near
fertile fields that his family has cultivated for six generations.
``So just like you will save and bend over backwards to send your
children to college, we will save and bend over backwards to help
our sons and daughters buy a farm.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Eli's grandfather _ who does not want to be
identified further because of church strictures _ and the 36,000
other Plain Sect disciples in picturesque Lancaster County is that
developers are encroaching on farmland they have tended since
William Penn welcomed their persecuted forebears nearly three
centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster is the fastest-growing county in Pennsylvania as
families move in from Philadelphia and other East Coast cities.
Instant neighborhoods have sprung up on what were once rolling
dairy pastures and carefully plowed fields of produce, corn and
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, recent years have brought bumper crops of tourists.
Motels and theme parks are now as commonplace as barns and silos,
and tour buses outnumber Amish buggies on the crowded roadways.
Land prices have skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 40 years, the county has lost more than 103,000
acres of farmland to development _ an average of about seven acres
per day. The loss is especially dramatic considering that the farms
are among the most productive in the nation and are typically less
than 100 acres in size.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of local preservationists, the World Monument Fund
last year named Lancaster County one of the world's 100 most
endangered historic sites, along with the Taj Mahal, the ruins of
Pompeii and other threatened global treasures.
</P>
<P>
   With a lifestyle historically rooted in agriculture, the Amish
are at a cultural crossroads. Four decades ago, 95 percent of the
county's Plain Sect populace worked on farms, compared to about 50
percent nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   The Plain People have adapted economically _ finding outside
jobs and nurturing their own enterprises _ but the changes are
threatening their simple and spiritual way of life, warned
Randy-Michael Testa, a Dartmouth College professor and author of
``After the Fire: The Destruction of the Lancaster County Amish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: How far can a people bend until something
snaps?'' asked Testa. Now bearded Amish men in black trousers and
straw hats and women in long dresses and white bonnets watch warily
as suburban sprawl paves over much of the good earth between
Paradise and Bird-in-Hand and Intercourse and other colorfully
named villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``With more and more commercial development, it creates a
conflict, if I may say so, for land use,'' said Eli's grandfather,
who believes it would be sinful to call attention to himself and,
like most Amish, does not want to be photographed or publicly
identified. ``But the commercial developers are able to pay more
for the land. That takes it out of agriculture, which doesn't suit
me.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   When Amish settlers arrived in this lush valley in the early
1700s, they found a place to heed the Biblical words: ``Be ye a
people set apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 130,000 or so Old Order Amish in North America, about
20,000 live in Lancaster County. The sect and setting were
popularized in the 1985 movie ``Witness,'' starring Harrison Ford.
The county is also home to 16,000 Old Order Mennonites _ spiritual
cousins who share many of the same beliefs but are less rigorous in
their separation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17th Century, the Amish and Mennonites were persecuted in
Europe because they were Anabaptists _ believers in voluntary adult
baptism. The Old Order sects are known as the ``Plain Folk,''
adverse to ostentation and committed to their faith, family and
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Amish are famous for their pacifism, simplicity, plain garb
and curiously selective rejection of modern technology. For
instance, they will not hook into the local electric utility _
maintaining independence from government _ but do use generators to
produce their own electric power. They won't allow phones in their
houses _ fearful of the disruption of family time _ but do have
phones in outside sheds.
</P>
<P>
   They don't buy cars and rely on horse-drawn buggies for getting
about the county, but they will ride in cars owned by outsiders,
whom the Amish call ``English.'' They farm with horse-drawn plows
and harvesters rather than with tractors and combines. Their
children can ride scooters, but not bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Amish children still attend one-room schoolhouses, with their
formal educations ending with the eighth grade at age 14. The
adults pay income and property taxes but neither contribute to nor
collect from Social Security. They don't serve in the military or
in public office. They don't participate in federal farm programs.
And they don't demonstrate against rezonings of land use or lobby
for government protection of agricultural acres.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their belief is very clear on this. They are not going to tell
the rest of society what to do,'' said Herman Bontrager, a local
insurance executive and leader in the preservationist movement.
``It is very important to them to maintain integrity and honesty in
their beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, local preservationists explained, the Amish would
move to other rural regions or adopt non-farm occupations rather
than engage in any sort of organized public policy ``fight'' to
save the county's farmland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They live their faith more than speak it,'' Bontrager said.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   From the shade of her backyard trellis, Eliza can see the nearby
farmhouse where she was born and the furrowed field where her
father grew tobacco before his death, and where her nephews now
tend this traditional cash crop. She works in a mini-mart in nearby
Ronks and thereby ``knows both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What keeps me here is a respect of the religion. It keeps you
down to earth more. You don't get swept up in the fast pace. You
appreciate what you have more. You know the blessing of the rain as
well as of the sunshine,'' she explained. ``I believe there is one
God and each of us has to find our own way to reach Him.''
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly outspoken for an Amish woman, she does not equate
this inner peace with willing acceptance of commercial development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the Amish culture is going to survive somewhere,'' she
said. ``But we are blessed with good soil here and it is just not
right to pave over this land.''
</P>
<P>
   But asphalt parking lots already cover much of Lancaster County.
For many Amish families, an agrarian lifestyle is no longer an
option. Indeed, outside jobs are plentiful and ``some have found it
mighty nice to work 'til 5 o'clock and have evenings off. Farmers
work from sun 'til sun and then some,'' said Eli's grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   Some Amish families have yielded to the temptation of inflated
land prices and have sold out and bought farms in neighboring
counties or Kentucky, Indiana or Ohio. Others make quilts,
furniture or crafts for the tourists. Industrious and notoriously
frugal, some Amish businessmen have prospered and made theological
decisions that the Plain Life does not preclude use of cell phones
or pagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I continue to be very optimistic about their ability to adapt
and handle pressures from the outside world,'' said Conrad Kanagy,
a sociology professor at nearby Elizabethtown College. ``Many Amish
families have essentially moved from farm to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes bring complications.
</P>
<P>
   In enforcing federal child labor laws, for instance, the Labor
Department has fined some Amish sawmills and furniture shops for
employing teen-agers in what otsiders regard as hazardous jobs. In
earlier times, these youngsters would have gone to work on their
family farms after finishing their schooling at the age of 14.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes Magazine recently reported that some Amish businesses
have become so profitable that the sect has a snowbird community of
vacation homes in Pinecraft, Fla., where wealthy Plain People
escape the cold of Lancaster County winters. Amish elders worry
about such compromises of the Ordnung _ rules of living _ that even

   ``For us, the farm is the best place to raise a family,'' said
Eli's grandfather. Through barnyard chores, children learn
responsibility at an early age. It is the daily duty of 9-year-old
Eli, for instance, to care for calves. Extended families stay
together, building additions to farmhouses as offspring marry.
Sunday meetings are held in parlors and barns, since the Amish have
no churches.

   If Lancaster County's farmland is not preserved, the traditional
Amish way of life will fade away, predicts Testa, the Dartmouth
professor who has lived with the Plain People for his academic
studies.
</P>
<P>
   He cited an Amish parable to describe the dangers of gradual
change. ``If you drop a frog in a pot of boiling water, it will hop
out,'' he said. ``But if you put it in comfortable water and
gradually raise the temperature, the frog will stay until it is
cooked.''

   Fred Daum still lives in the Lancaster County house were he was
born in 1930. During his boyhood, he would see more buggies than
cars pass by on New Holland Pike. Now, fearful for the future of
his Amish neighbors, he is an organizer for LAND, the Lancaster
Alliance for New Directions, one of several preservationist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The conservationists have generated considerable sentiment
against haphazard sprawl. They have tried to establish Urban Growth
Boundaries outside of which development would be banned, but some
communities in the county have spurned this concept. The county's
Agricultural Preserve Board provides tax protection against rising
property assessments for farmers who promise never to develop their
land. The preservationists have managed to stave off a state
transportation department plan to build a four-lane highway through
the farmland, but feasibility studies on the project continue.
</P>
<P>
   Divine providence brought the Amish to Lancaster County, wedding
some of the world's best farmers to some of its most fertile soil,
Daum explained. ``They belong here.''

   LONDON _ Did a mysterious motorcyclist use a laser to blind the
chauffeur in the car carrying Diana, Princess of Wales?
</P>
<P>
   Was the chauffeur's blood contaminated with lethal quantities of
carbon monoxide?
</P>
<P>
   Was Diana murdered by the British secret service at the request
of the Royal Family, her car rammed by a white Fiat, which
``disappeared'' at the hands of agents?
</P>
<P>
   Or did she and her lover, Dodi Fayed, fatally stumble into an
underworld feud on their way to meet a drug dealer?
</P>
<P>
   And what about those shots fired from the grassy knoll? (Whoops,
wrong conspiracy.)
</P>
<P>
   Eight months have passed since the Princess of Wales died in
what French authorities have called a straightforward car crash.
But their flat assertions that it was merely an accident have only
encouraged theorists, who are still busily inventing wacky stories.
Diana was pregnant! No, she was snorting cocaine in the back of the
Mercedes! No, the Freemasons killed her, because the tunnel in
which she died was decorated with  &UR; ancient masonic symbols. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, some of the theories, which until recently have been
simmering on the Internet and in the minds of dedicated
conspiracists like Fayed's wealthy father, Mohamed, recently raised
their strange little heads in the documentary ``Diana: Secrets
Behind the Crash,'' which presented a mix of research and
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was broadcast on the ITV network earlier this
month, reported that the chauffeur, Henri Paul, was a paid agent of
the French secret service whose bank accounts mysteriously
contained more than $160,000 _ even though he earned only $35,000 a
year. It also said that Paul had lethal levels of carbon monoxide
in his blood, raising the possibilities that a) he was poisoned, or
b) his blood sample was nefariously switched after his death.
</P>
<P>
   James Hewitt, the cavalry officer who was Diana's lover, came on
to say that people he believed were connected to either the royal
family or the secret service contacted him during their romance to
warn him off, saying he would end up like a former bodyguard and
confidant of the princess who died in a suspicious motorcycle
accident in 1988. The mysterious callers made it clear, Hewitt
said, that ``it was not conducive to my health to continue the
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Fayed, who owns Harrod's but has little
credibility in Britain, possibly because he argues that the
accident was a plot to prevent Diana from marrying a Muslim. Fayed
has denied that Paul, one of his employees, was drunk, although his
blood alcohol levels far exceeded the legal limit for driving.
Fayed has announced that he is ``99 percent certain'' it was not an
accident at all.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary was greeted here with derision and incredulity.
``I think I'm living in a lunatic asylum,'' said Sir Bernard
Ingham, former spokesman for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
during an ITV debate about the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   The controller of news and current affairs at ITV, Steven
Anderson, brushed aside the criticism. ``If people are truly
satisfied that this was a simple accident, why did 12 million
people watch it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theories represent a sort of meeting of two needs,'' said
Henry Porter, the London editor of Vanity Fair magazine. ``The
first is the need to provide a spectacular and sensational
martyrdom to match Diana's life. The other is the need, in the case
of Mohamed Fayed, to remove the blame from the Ritz and himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``These two needs coalesce in a very useful sort of
collaboration. People just can't believe that she died in a
drunk-driving accident. It's too banal, it's too awful and in some
ways it's just not believable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Mirror, which has mostly supported Fayed, asked its
readers to call in to express their opinions. Of the 9,877 callers,
94 percent said they believed the chauffeur was ``paid by the
secret services.'' The crash was not ``just an accident,'' 95
percent said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Internet, the theories are wilder, mushing together
fantasies about a money and drug cartel controlled by the FBI, the
CIA, the Queen of England, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds
with _ ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The conspirators were acting on papal orders and were financed
by DuPont,'' declared one cyber conspiracist.

   WASHINGTON _ This is no ordinary circus.
</P>
<P>
   The horde accompanying President Clinton to China this week will
number more than 1,000 people and includes a blue goose, a
presidential seal, and a pair of road runners.
</P>
<P>
   The presidential entourage and its paraphernalia fill four
passenger planes and several large C-141 military transports. The
White House is taking 60 tons of communications gear, as many as 10
armored limousines and enough bottled water so that the president
and first lady won't have to open a tap to bathe in the luxurious
Chinese guest houses and five-star hotels where they will be
staying on their nine-day trip.
</P>
<P>
   The swarm includes six members of Congress, five Cabinet
officers with their own retinues, a chief of staff and a deputy
chief of staff, a national security adviser and a deputy national
security adviser, a press secretary and a deputy press secretary.
Five stenographers. Two two-member White House television crews. A
valet for the president and a hairdresser for Mrs. Clinton. The
president's private secretary and the White House staff secretary.
Speech writers and rewriters; doctors and lawyers, 375 reporters
and photographers. Snipers, commandos and bomb-sniffing dogs. And
countless lords aleapin'.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving the White House to China,'' one senior White
House advance agent said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors that he is bringing all his own furniture from the
United States aren't true at all,'' said Zhang Tianping, the public
relations manager at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, where the
Clintons will stay in Beijing, according to Agence France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is bringing his bulletproof lectern, known as the
blue goose, and the closely guarded carved presidential seal that
adorns it. The White House is flying in at least two road runners,
the sinister-looking black secure communications vans that
accompany a presidential motorcade. And, as always, Clinton will be
tailed by Kris Engskov, his personal aide and briefcase carrier.
</P>
<P>
   All this for a summit meeting in Beijing and postcard visits to
four other cities that even the White House says are expected to
yield few concrete results.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials and U.S. diplomats in China are appalled and
amused. One bewildered senior American in Beijing told a visitor
that he was told to expect 1,200 people when Clinton arrives next
Thursday. That may not be far off. White House advance people have
rented 350 cars in Shanghai alone.
</P>
<P>
   Even in comparison with China trips by previous presidents, the
size of the royal court is astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   When Richard M. Nixon made his historic journey to Beijing in
February 1972, he was accompanied by 300 people. The official party
numbered 34, and only 87 members of the press were allowed to cover
the visit. The White House and the American media wanted to send at
least twice as many people, while the Chinese demanded a much
smaller number. Weeks of bargaining resulted in 300 eventually
making the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``By today's standards, it was a modest group, but the Chinese
were shocked by the huge horde of people coming, both White House
staff and the numbers of press we requested,'' said Winston Lord,
an aide at the time to Henry Kissinger and later ambassador to
China.
</P>
<P>
   The shock to the Chinese had worn off a bit when Gerald R. Ford
visited Beijing in December 1975. Records from the Ford library
indicate that the contingent had grown to about 450 people,
including 170 American journalists. The trip was less newsworthy
than Nixon's, but in those years, for most American news
organizations, it was a rare opportunity to get into China at all.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of Ronald Reagan's visit to Beijing, Xian and
Shanghai in April 1984, the traveling party had grown to nearly 600
people, including a huge increase in the Hollywood stage managers
brought into the White House to assure photogenic coverage of the
Gipper. The press corps had grown to 260.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's 40-hour visit to Beijing in February 1989 was an
anomaly, a hastily arranged trip essentially tacked onto his
journey to Japan for the funeral of Emperor Hirohito. Records from
the Bush library indicate the traveling party was about 100 people
smaller than Reagan's entourage.
</P>
<P>
   John Podesta, the White House deputy chief of staff coordinating
the Clinton visit, said he has had to say no to scores of officials
who wanted to make the passage, and that a decision was made early
on not to invite business executives. Clinton is under fire for
accepting campaign contributions funneled through a Chinese
military official and for approving the sale of a satellite by a
company under investigation for leaking sensitive technology to
Beijing. Thus it was an easy call to keep CEOs off Air Force One.
But even without a large contingent of special pleaders, the list
of travelers just kept growing, Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will fly in with the
president. Also going are Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary
William Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Counting deputies, aides and support people, the official party
numbers 100, Podesta said, and ``another 500-600 will float in and
out around this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a trip quite this large,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said it could not provide an exact count because
many officials and support people are traveling separately and
meeting the president in China.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also say it is impossible to calculate in
advance the overall cost of the trip because the expenses are paid
by numerous government agencies and because many of the the bills
arrive for months after the trip has ended. But for a sense of
scale, news organizations have been advised that each accredited
reporter can expect to pay $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Service, citing security reasons, will provide no
figures on the numbers of agents assigned to the trip. But their
numbers include not only the plainclothes agents who stay close to
the president, but also sharpshooters and counter-assault squads,
officers to secure public sites and operate metal detectors and
technicians to run a secure communications network.
</P>
<P>
   But why so many others? The usual Clinton trip, after all,
involves a retinue of 500 or 600.
</P>
<P>
   White House press secretary Mike McCurry said the size of this
court reflects the importance of the relationship with China, as
well as a desire by senior government officers to be present at a
historic event. He attributed the growth in the size of the press
contingent to the demands of 24-hour-a-day news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   He also explained why no one will provide firm figures on the
size of the entourage. ``It's hard to get people to talk about any
of this stuff because it always seems so extravagant,'' McCurry
said, ``especially when you see other leaders with one or two cars
in their motorcades. On the other hand, they're not leading the
United States of America.''

 IN AFRICA, DREAMING OF A WIRED WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)  
 (bl)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ After relatively rich South Africa,
which African country has the highest percentage of cellular phones
among telephone users? Ghana? The Ivory Coast? Kenya? Nigeria?
</P>
<P>
   None of the above. The correct answer is the desperately poor,
badly shot-up Democratic Republic of the Congo, where the regular
telephone system _ where it exists at all _ is so decrepit that
cellular is often the only option.
</P>
<P>
   Cheerleading for the dream of an African renaissance is all the
rage these days on the continent, but without better
telecommunications it will be as hard to spread wealth and
democracy as it would have been for Florence and Chartres to spread
Renaissance culture without the old Roman roads.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1 in 300 people in sub-Saharan Africa has a phone,
making the financial opportunities huge. Most companies marketing
heavily to rural Africa are pushing low-technology goods like beer,
cigarettes, detergent and fertilizer. But impoverished Africans
also need telephones to relay family news and money, just as many
poor New Yorkers do when they patronize storefront phone shops.
</P>
<P>
   For example, failing to come home for a funeral is a grave
social offense in Africa. When a village doesn't have a phone,
someone must go to the city simply to tell others that a villager
has died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans spend a huge proportion of their meager incomes going
places they could reach by phone,'' said Piers Letcher, a spokesman
for the International Telecommunication Union, a Geneva-based
United Nations affiliate. ``People who need food will pay for
telecommunications _ they're transferring money from their
transportation budgets.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to common wisdom, rural telephones can make money if
the goal is one phone in every village, not one in each hut. Bakary
Njie, managing director of the national telephone company of tiny
Gambia, took on the risk of laying a 250-mile fiber optic cable
through the hinterland and attached 300 privately owned 24-hour
phone centers. Villagers walked miles to line up outside the
centers, which soon paid for the costly cable installation.
</P>
<P>
   The continent's obstacles are huge, however, and politics is a
bigger one than poverty, malarial jungles or the snows of
Kilimanjaro. Hard as it is to wire the 1 billion people in China,
at least they all live in one country; Africa's 740 million people
live in 55. Those African nations that don't have overwhelming
problems like civil war have simpler ones, like bureaucratic sloth
and dishonesty.
</P>
<P>
   Each country has different telecommunications laws _ or none at
all. And many governments earn a big chunk of their budgets through
their doddering telephone monopolies. The money comes from tourists
and executives in hotels that gouge so deeply that the phone bill
often tops the room bill, and from the fees paid by U.S. and
European carriers for incoming calls connected through the
monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   There are also absurd inefficiencies. For example, in a colonial
legacy, a call from South Africa to next-door Mozambique was until
recently routed through both London and Lisbon. Even when a country
wants to improve its phone service, pythons of red tape can
encircle the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of complex technology is high. Intercellular Nigeria
president Bashir Ahmad Rufai said he had to approach 20 Nigerian
banks to raise a mere $10 million for his network. ``One banker
asked us to line up a buyer for my telecom equipment if it didn't
work _ as if it were used furniture I could get rid of,'' he said.
Approaching foreign bankers was pointless, he added, because they
are afraid of Nigerian corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year, the ultimate in phone technology is set to roll
out: hand-held phones able to call from anywhere on the planet to
anywhere else, thanks to new networks of dozens of low-orbit
satellites. It's expensive but ideal for Africa's vast unwired
spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Getting bureaucrats in 55 countries to sign licenses is a
nightmare, though. ``A civil servant's job is fairly tenuous in
Africa,'' said John Richardson, head of Iridium Africa, which has a
satellite network. ``Seeing us means writing a position paper for
the minister, and so on. Why do that if you can get away with doing
nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, corruption seems to be abating. Richardson
said he had been steered toward signing on local partners related
to government officials, but had ``never personally bumped into an
overt or covert request for a bribe.''
</P>
<P>
   International Telecommunication Union secretary general Pekka
Tarjanne is an optimist for three reasons: technology is rapidly
becoming cheaper, the fading of socialism means privatization is no
longer a dirty word and minister of telecommunications is now an
important post in many countries. In 36 countries, the post offices
no longer run the national phone systems. In 10, there are
competing cellular phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even pie-in-the-sky ideas seem not so crazy these days.
Nigerian-American entrepreneur Joseph Okpaku attends conferences
trying to rustle up funding for his dream company, Telecom Africa.
His goals are to reverse the African diaspora, create pan-African
affirmative action and make everyone involved rich. His vision is
to recruit engineers around the world to come back to Africa to
design and produce telecommunications equipment here.
</P>
<P>
   Hopelessly romantic? Maybe not. Iridium is one of six new
satellite companies competing to serve Africa, and one way they can
make friends is to make their equipment here.
</P>
<P>
   As Letcher of the International Telecommunication Union said,
``If you can create 10,000 jobs in Africa, you'll land the deal.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Midway through a news story about Steven Brill's
arrival as the newest major-domo in the booming industry of media
criticism, Howard Kurtz, a respected practitioner himself for The
Washington Post, suddenly found it necessary to open parentheses
confessionally in noting: ``The founder of Brill's Content (to
which this reporter is to be an occasional contributor) could not
be reached for comment.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a moment of comic relief badly needed by the Fourth
Estate, run ragged these past five months in its coverage of the
allegations of sex and mendacity at the Clinton White House. Here
was the media watchdog watch turning into a shimmering house of
mirrors, with one watchdog sniffing out the latest watchdog while
properly noting the crisscross of commercial interests at work in
all the watching.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural edition of Content magazine (``the independent
voice of the information age''), Brill, a masterly self-promoter,
managed to unnerve the media with his own reporting and caustic
criticism of the print and television performance thus far on the
still murky story of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky, the
former White House intern now flirting with indictment.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a mad competitive tumble of rumor and scoop, leak
and spin that, apart from any search for truth, has been selling
newspapers sensationally and plunging television news into
round-the-clock frenzies of redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   For his debut, Brill succeeded in getting an exclusive interview
with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in charge of the
Lewinsky investigation whose style seems part Garbo, part Javert.
Brill fashioned not so much a bombshell as an enormous cream pie
smeared in the face of the Washington press corps. ``Corrupted to
its core,'' he charged in depicting the media as enablers of a
freewheeling prosecutor and ``headlining whatever he leaks out _
instead of remaining professionally suspicious of him and his
power.''
</P>
<P>
   In his indictment, Brill dared to denounce a few reporters by
name as ``lapdogs'' and ``stenographers'' fawning for biased scoops
engineered by Starr's office. Brill's timing was fortuitous, for,
as so often happens, there was no real news this week in the
Lewinsky story. The traditional fallback in this situation is for
the media to fill space by writing a story about the sort of job it
has been doing on the big story. But Brill arrived with rabid
keenness, his teeth bared for his own kind, nipping at a pack that
instantly turned yowlingly back at him.
</P>
<P>
   Treacheries were decried. Lawsuits were threatened by bloodied
reporters. Headlines were tinged with shock, shock! as Starr openly
confirmed that, for all the anti-leak strictures, he most certainly
did dispatch agents to operate amid the jostling, murmuring crowds
of anonymous sources who work the mean media streets of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Brill soon was vetted by deflated investigative journalists.
Legitimate questions were honed: How could Brill not bother to
tape-record the Starr interview as an event certain to be subjected
to enormous second-guessing and back-biting? How could he not
bother to disclose that he donated $2,000 to Clinton's re-election?
How dare he criticize press methods when, some reporters charged,
their own comments to him in the self-serving world of
``background'' interviewing became warped in translation or even
shifted like chess pieces onto the record as attributed quotes?
What did he call this stuff? Journalism?
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which was least scathed in the Brill version of
the Clinton/Lewinsky media saga, gloated as the Diogenes Watch
morphed cannibalistically into Les Liaisons Dangereuses. News
addicts not already numbed by the growing specialty of
media-watchdogging-cum-hotdogging could pay the $3.95 and read
Brill's full 25,000-word jeremiad, providing they had the stamina
of a doctoral candidate. This oeuvre was followed by a 19-page
single-spaced rebuttal from the presumably very busy Starr in which
the prosecutor charged that Brill's critique ``borders on the
libelous.''
</P>
<P>
   (Thus far, Brill, as principled as any ink-stained wretch, has
yielded only one apology _ for mistaking the ground rules and some,
uh, content of an interview _ once he had learned that the
complaining reporter had furtively tape-recorded the interview.)
</P>
<P>
   The conduct of Lewinsky and the president, whatever it really
had been at the White House, was turned for one brief welcome
moment into a sidebar. They stood by as mute as those accused of
heresy, alchemy and witchcraft in medieval inquisitions used to
wait on learned debates about holy methods. Anyone singed by the
relentless months of blowtorch coverage had to leer at the sweet
turnabout as media fur smouldered.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, media critics have been finding fault since the
invention of the printing press, and maybe since life itself was
first lifted out of context for retelling at prehistoric campfires.
``Newspapers are unable, seemingly, to discriminate between a
bicycle accident and the collapse of civilization,'' George Bernard
Shaw, one of the best of the critics, decreed a century before
Lewinsky became the apple of the press corps' eye.
</P>
<P>
   Let's stipulate, as the phrase goes among the wads of lawyers
now so richly, so leakily involved in the criminal investigation of
Clinton and Lewinsky, that the true story lies somewhere between a
bike accident and doomsday. The devil is in the details, still to
be unearthed by all manner of reporters as the watchdogs watch.

   Who is watching Brill? He anticipated the question, appointing
Bill Kovach, a respected newsman and curator of the Nieman
Foundation for Journalism at Harvard, to be an independent monitor,
and take aim at Content from within.
</P>
<P>
   But Brill's excoriating debut has prodded volunteer watchdogs to
the fore, all the way down the ranks to Matt Drudge, the Walter
Winchell wannabe on the Internet. He is often dismissed as a
grating cybergossip but he still lays proud claim to first sparking
the Lewinsky story's explosion in the nation's media. The
mischievous Drudge knows how to filch reporters' story leads and
how to get under the skin of media elitists who imagine the
business should somehow have firm standards.
</P>
<P>
   Tracking Brill's many television appearances in the requisite
huckstering of this latest media watchdog enterprise, Drudge
offered Brill free advice: ``Feed the hungry machine slowly.''

 DESPERADOES SEEKING A BAFFLING ENDGAME: SUICIDE BY COP 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ALAN FEUER

<TEXT>
<P>
   It happens dozens of times each year during jittery hostage
dramas and routine traffic stops: desperate people lure police
officers into shooting them in a phenomenon known in
law-enforcement circles as suicide by cop.
</P>
<P>
   There are no hard statistics showing the frequency of such
incidents, but experts believe that up to 10 percent of the roughly
600 fatal police shootings that occur in an average year are
provoked by people actively seeking to die.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those killed are like Moshe Pergament, a 19-year-old
college student and problem gambler who was shot by police last
November when he aimed a toy handgun at officers who pulled him
over for driving erratically on New York's Long Island Expressway.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are former inmates who would rather die in a
firefight than return to jail. Others are like Juan Rodriguez, a
46-year-old cancer patient who was shot and wounded in Jersey City,
N.J., in May after pulling a gun on two police officers eating in a
pizza shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you go and point a gun at a policeman?'' asked
Michael Johnston, a Jersey City police officer involved in another
suicide-by-cop incident this year. ``You have to figure they're
going to shoot you.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to be the point, law-enforcement experts say. Suicide
by cop is usually not a capricious act of mania or rage but rather
a calculated attempt to force police to act as executioners, said
Clinton Van Zandt, a former chief negotiator for the FBI. ``Many
times they are not `ordinary' crimes gone bad,'' he said. ``They
are the carefully planned suicides of people who want to be killed
by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   Law-enforcement officials have been aware of suicide-by-cop
cases for years, but researchers are just beginning to make sense
of the baffling mix of despair, self-hatred, violence and rage that
seems to fuel such acts. This research has taken on added
importance recently in light of the rash of school shootings around
the nation in which troubled children have opened fire on their
classmates and teachers _ in part, some experts say, to draw a
lethal response from the police.
</P>
<P>
   The term suicide by cop was coined in 1983 by Karl Harris, a
former California police officer with a Ph.D. in psychology who
worked at a suicide hot line in Los Angeles after leaving the
force. ``As a cop, I knew of a number of cases where it appeared
that people had actually forced police officers to shoot them,''
Harris said. ``In the suicide business I saw all the different ways
people attempted suicide, and it occurred to me that maybe some
people were actually forcing cops to shoot them because they wanted
to die.''
</P>
<P>
   In nearly a third of such cases, the victims actually leave
suicide notes, apologizing to the police for having purposely drawn
their fire, Van Zandt said. Just as often, he added, grand jury
inquests discover that the victims had previously announced to
their friends or loved ones their intention to draw gunfire
intentionally. But in the most confounding cases, researchers must
rely on exhaustive psychological studies to determine suicidal
motives, leaving definitive answers unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The few notable studies, including ones conducted by researchers
at the Harvard Medical School and in British Columbia, indicate
that the typical person who commits suicide by cop is a white man
in his mid-20s with a history of alcohol and drug abuse. Much like
traditional suicide victims, such people suffer from depression and
are haunted by feelings of dependence and hopelessness. Their
actions are often set off by the deterioration of an important
personal relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A break-up or a divorce with no belief that there can be a
reconciliation is often the significant contributing factor,'' said
Sgt. John Yarbrough, an officer in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
homicide bureau who analyzed police shootings for a recent study on
suicide by cop. ``They are helpless to change their situation and
they often suffer the frustration of, `I can't get it back, it's
over.'''
</P>
<P>
   If the typical psychological profile of someone who commits
suicide by cop seems nearly identical to that of a regular suicide
victim, researchers are still struggling to determine why police
are chosen as the weapon of choice rather than guns, nooses or
pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most common theory is that if you're shot by an officer,
you're the victim and the officer is the perpetrator,'' said Dr.
Deirdre Anglin, an associate professor of emergency medicine at the
University of Southern California and co-author of a study on
suicide by cop to be published this summer. ``Suicide is still
socially taboo. This way, you're not actually killing yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anglin said there were other, simpler motives, including
cowardice, religious prohibitions against suicide, concern over
insurance policies and a physical inability to commit the act
oneself.
</P>
<P>
   For Van Zandt, however, the rationale behind suicide by cop is
as simple _ and deadly _ as a loaded gun. ``What it all comes down
to is that people know the police have weapons,'' he said. ``If you
drive your car into a bridge abutment, you may not die. But
provoking a cop _ there's probably good reason to believe that's
going to kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   The effect on police officers in cases of suicide by cop is
often neglected, experts say. ``There are feelings of
powerlessness, feelings of being manipulated,'' said Bill Geller,
author of ``Deadly Force: What We Know'' (Police Executive Research
Forum, 1991). Geller added that most officers involved in
suicide-by-cop incidents _ like most of those who kill in the line
of duty _ retire prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, the Jersey City police officer who shot a
suicide-by-cop victim in January, said he has managed to remain on
daily patrols only because he now understands that he was provoked.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this kind of thing happens to you, you're basically the
victim,'' he said. ``The only way to go on is thinking that you did
your best _ that in end, it wasn't your decision. He forced you to
do what you did.''

 POLITICS OF TOBACCO: TAXES VS. KIDS  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans can usually win when they can position
themselves as the guardians of low taxes and small government.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, Democrats have the advantage when they can
frame an issue as one involving the protection of children.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco bill, the most ambitious measure before Congress
this year, lay across that political fault line. Here is what was
said on the final day of debate in the Senate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a massive tax on low-income Americans, and it is used
to proliferate the bureaucracy of this government,'' declared one
of the bill's principal Republican opponents, Sen. John Ashcroft of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota, who represents the Democratic
leadership on tobacco matters, put the question this way: ``Do we
protect our children's lives, or do we protect the profits of the
tobacco industry?''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the bill was shelved when Democrats fell three votes
short of the 60 needed to cut off debate and bring the measure to a
final vote. The Republicans won in part because the tobacco
companies mounted a mammoth advertising campaign, said to have cost
$40 million in the last two months, to persuade the public that the
main issue was a tax increase. This gave the Republicans the air
cover they needed to vote against the legislation, which most of
them wanted to do in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But the bill failed for another reason. Many Democrats allowed
their focus to shift. Punishing the tobacco companies became as
important as protecting children from smoking. That diluted their
strongest position and gave added weight to the Republicans'
anti-tax stance.
</P>
<P>
   To understand this, you have to think back a year ago, when the
major tobacco companies signed a trail-blazing agreement with state
attorneys general and class-action lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, the cigarette makers agreed to pay $368.5
billion over 25 years to finance health research and anti-smoking
programs. They also agreed to restrain advertising and pay annual
penalties if the rate of teen-age smoking did not fall to specified
levels. In exchange, lawsuits by the states would have been
dropped, class-action suits on behalf of people with
smoking-related illnesses would have been prohibited and no
punitive damages would have been allowed in suits filed by
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement required congressional approval. In April, the
Senate Commerce Committee voted to drive up the price of cigarettes
by $1.10 a pack, raising the 25-year cost to over $500 billion. The
companies walked out. They said the cost was too high and began
their campaign to defeat the legislation on the ground that it
would amount to a monstrous tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the high price really was the reason for the tobacco
executives' change of heart. But many people who know the industry
well believe that the main reason they switched and began to fight
was that it became apparent that Congress would not give them the
protections they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The companies could have afforded the added money, said Mary
Aronson, who advises institutional investors on legal trends and
who has followed the tobacco industry closely for years. ``What
they want more than anything else is peace in the courtroom,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   A lobbyist who works full time for anti-smoking legislation said
it was reasonable to argue, as the leading public health
authorities did, that the tobacco companies had acted so
reprehensibly over so many years that they did not deserve legal
protection. What cannot be argued, continued the lobbyist, who
insisted that his name not be used lest his words be used against
him in future negotiations, is that stripping away protection has
anything to do with stopping teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad took issue with the notion that it would have been better
politics to give the tobacco companies immunity from most lawsuits
so that a strong measure could have been passed to reduce teen-age
smoking. ``Where we made our mistake is in not countering their tax
argument forcefully enough and not talking about the taxes imposed
on all Americans because of this industry,'' he said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic pollster Mark Mellman said ``shifting the focus''
did create a problem. ``Democrats know we're on weak ground when it
comes to taxes,'' he said. ``But Democrats win hands down on
children's issues and health and safety issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that point has not been lost on President Clinton,
who based his 1996 re-election campaign on such issues as mandatory
leave for new parents, protection of children from sex and violence
on television and the Internet, uniforms for schoolchildren,
guaranteed health insurance for all children and more money for
education and child care.
</P>
<P>
   When the tobacco bill came up, the president said that he was
not enthusiastic about giving legal protection to the cigarette
companies but that it should not be a ``deal breaker'' if immunity
from lawsuits was necessary to get a bill that would discourage
teen-agers from smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have tried with less success to have children's
issues of their own. ``Both parties have their bread-and-butter
issues,'' said Keith Appell, a Republican political consultant.
``For Democrats, it may be children. Taxes are the bread-and-butter
issue of Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellman said that based on his polling and focus groups, he had
no doubt that the issue of children smoking would help Democrats in
the congressional elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Appell and his partner, Greg Mueller, disagree. They sent a
memorandum to clients last week about how in blocking the tobacco
legislation, Republicans had stopped a tax increase. The
consultants concluded: ``This sounds like a pretty darn good
30-second spot to us.''

 ON THE OTHER HAND....: A CONGRESSMAN'S SHIFT ON CHINA  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is China friend or foe? And should it or should it
not benefit from U.S. technology? The United States is pulled both
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Few embody the tug of war better than Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, a
conservative Republican from a southern California district with
lots of high-technology industry. Lately, in criticizing transfers
to China approved by the Clinton administration, he seems caught in
the contradictions of U.S. policy. Look at what he said four years
ago, and what he is saying now.
</P>
<P>
   _ By ERIC SCHMITT
</P>
<P>
   At a September 1994 House hearing on space, Rohrabacher favored
looser restrictions:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the No. 1 threat to the United States today seems to me not
coming from a military threat but instead an economic threat to our
well-being, don't these restrictions that we are talking about . .
. put us at a disadvantage in terms of this major threat to our
well-being in terms of the international economic competition in
the area of high technology?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you could tell me specifically what specific damage to our
national security would be caused if we would just transfer all
communications satellites from the munitions list to a commercial
dual-use list. . . .
</P>
<P>
   I would hope that our industrial leaders who are making these
decisions do not fall back to the position that they just want to
protect the use of old technologies from the new competitive
threats that are coming from China and the former Soviet Union. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   We are very concerned that in this new era that we are entering,
post Cold War era, era of global competition, we can't have our top
businessmen hampered by bureaucratic roadblocks.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was all for tightening them last month as he joined in a
House vote to ban the export of U.S. satellites that would be
launched on Chinese rockets:
</P>
<P>
   ``How is it that the Communist Chinese have improved their
missile capability? You better sit down, Mr. and Mrs. America,
because it appears that several large American high-tech
corporations, in collusion with the Clinton Administration,
provided technology to the Communist Chinese that perfected their
nuclear weapons delivery systems. . . .
</P>
<P>
   It takes the wind right out of your lungs, does it not, just to
think about it? If this is true, it is the worst technological
betrayal of the American people since the Rosenbergs. This is
nothing less than a catastrophe for the security of our nation and
the safety of our people. . . . ''

   To put the very existence of the three-year-old Golf Channel

says something uniquely profound about our culture. Just what is

   And money. The Orlando-based network says it expects to defy its

   Threats and Defiance In a Balkan Stalemate
</P>
<P>
   NATO began the week with a show of force to warn Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, to stop using his military against
the ethnic Albanian majority in Serbia's restive province of
Kosovo. More than 80 NATO jets ranged through the skies bordering
Serbia to drive home the point that the West was serious about
heading off Kosovo's ethnic bloodshed, which could spread through
the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the effect the message was having was not very clear. For
one thing, America's allies in NATO want United Nations
authorization for any use of force, and Russia threatens to veto
such a step.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic met in Moscow on Tuesday with Russian President Boris
Yeltsin and promised concessions over Kosovo. He did not, however,
agree to a key Western demand: withdrawing Serbian security forces
from the province. And he was defiant, declaring, ``In the latest
actions, it was declared by the security forces there were no
civilian victims at all.''

   An Atom's-Eye View of AIDS
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have obtained an atom-level picture, reconstructed by
computer from X-ray data, of the first contact made between an AIDS
virus and the human cell it infects. The picture portrays the
daunting strength of the virus' several defenses against the immune
system. It also defines points of vulnerability against which new
drugs and vaccines might be designed.
</P>
<P>
   The images were a result of an eight-year joint effort by
research teams at Columbia University and the Dana-Farber Cancer
Institute in Boston. They focus on the probe protein that studs the
virus' surface like the spikelets of a mine. The probe protein is
also the basis of an AIDS vaccine about to be tested in the United
States and Thailand.

   Cashing Out
</P>
<P>
   Gus Levy, a late chairman of Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co., once described
the firm's secret of success as ``long-term greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's top private investment bank subordinated the
individual deal maker to a team-oriented partnership. Delayed
riches came to those who pledged lifetime allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Goldman's 190 partners have decided that their philosophy
has proven so successful, and that the competitive landscape has
changed so much in the late 1990's, that the time has come to cash
out.
</P>
<P>
   They will dissolve their partnership in favor of selling shares
to the public, and reaping the very considerable value, as much as
$30 billion, that the firm expects the public to place on the
Goldman franchise. The question is whether Levy's magic formula
will lose the long-term ingredient.

   A Signal to Tehran?
</P>
<P>
   Six months after Iranian President Mohammad Khatami extended a
small olive branch to the United States, the Clinton administration
responded with the offer of a ``road map'' to normalized relations
between the two countries. The offer came in a speech by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright almost two decades after Iran's Islamic
revolution took U.S. diplomats hostage and made a breakup with
Washington inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the administration decided to make the gesture now
was not disclosed. But the United States, stunned by nuclear bomb
tests in India and then Pakistan, and losing its foothold on Iraqi
sanctions, may have noticed that it has no leverage in Iran,
another potential nuclear nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians were neither overjoyed nor grateful. Their
officials responded with the opinion that they would like to see
some deeds to go with the words. In her speech, Albright said
nothing new about U.S. efforts to isolate Iran economically.

   An Au Pair Goes Home
</P>
<P>
   The highest court in Massachusetts freed the au pair Louise
Woodward to return to her native England, and she was off like a
shot the next day, lingering not an extra minute in the country
where her name had become synonymous with the deepest fears of
working parents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward, 20, was convicted last fall of murdering Matthew
Eappen, the 8-month-old baby boy in her care, but Judge Hiller
Zobel then converted the verdict to a manslaughter conviction and
sentenced her to time already served _ 279 days. Tuesday, the
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court upheld that decision, while
emphasizing that Ms. Woodward had not been acquitted.

   A Downsizer Is Downsized
</P>
<P>
   When Albert Dunlap was ousted as Sunbeam Corp.'s chief
executive, the decision drew cheers in the streets from factory
workers at a plant in Cleveland that the company had planned to
close, an executive recruiter said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of Dunlap's former employees and associates
unapologetically celebrated the embarrassingly public way in which
he was thrown into the ranks of the unemployed, when the Sunbeam
board said he hadn't lived up to his reputation as a turnaround
artist. He had also become known as Chain Saw Al for the way he
downsized thousands of workers while earning tens of millions of
dollars for himself.

   A New Face at the U.N.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Holbrooke, architect of the Dayton accords on Bosnia,
has been nominated as the U.S. representative to the United
Nations, replacing Bill Richardson, who will be secretary of
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Given Holbrooke's reputation for independence and media
management, his appointment was big news for those who like to
speculate on the intricacies of power-sharing in the specialized
world of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There were immediate suggestions that Holbrooke might pull the
spotlight off Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and disrupt a
relatively harmonious foreign-policy team. But the two have vowed
to make their new relationship work, and one official took a
pragmatic view of the appointment's meaning: ``With so many balls
in the air, we needed another pair of competent hands.''

   Judgment in Hollywood
</P>
<P>
   The assignment was daunting: pick the 100 best American movies.
Ever.
</P>
<P>
   With such a wealth of cinematic riches over the century, where
could the American Film Institute turn?
</P>
<P>
   Such a task couldn't possibly be entrusted just to stuffy film
historians and critics.
</P>
<P>
   No, the institute also sought out common folk like, say, Bill
Clinton and Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors, of course, went to ``Citizen Kane.'' Even those
who've never seen the Orson Welles classic are used to it being
called the best, so they might well have voted for it anyway. And,
continuing to round up the usual suspects, No. 2 was perhaps the
most-quoted movie ever, ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Yankee Doodle Dandy'' an ignominious 100th? And not a
single film from Ernst Lubitsch or Preston Sturges?
</P>
<P>
   A moment of silence, please, or perhaps darkness, for the giants
left on the century's cutting-room floor.

 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Halfway around the world, where the Caucasus meets
the Middle East, a rush is on to exploit what could prove to be the
world's richest oil bonanza. The stakes are so high that otherwise
sane people are fighting each other for the chance to risk huge
investments in a part of the world plagued by ethnic rivalries,
civil wars, corrupt bureaucracies, faltering economies and big
egos.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. Some of these same people have also become
intently interested in solving a curious question: Is the Caspian
really a sea or just a lake?
</P>
<P>
   If it weren't for oil and the breakup of the Soviet Union,
that's the kind of question that might occupy scholars in some
musty corner of some obscure university. But today, people need to
know, and here's why:
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian is a California-size body of salt water _ the
world's largest landlocked body of water _ that may sit on as much
as 200 billion barrels of oil, which would be 16 percent of the
Earth's potential oil reserves. Even at today's low prices, that
could add up to $3 trillion in oil.
</P>
<P>
   If it is a lake, one set of rules about access to the oil would
apply, with the nations that border it controlling the undersea
wealth out to a few miles from their shores; the remainder in the
middle _ like the hole in a donut _ would be treated as an
international seabed. The oil in the middle could be exploited,
sold and transported only if all five countries agreed on how to do
it and on how to divide up the profits.
</P>
<P>
   If it is considered a sea, however, the entire bed would be
sliced into pieces, like a pie.
</P>
<P>
   And since five nations now border the Caspian, and a lot of
undiscovered reserves may lie in the large donut hole, the question
is anything but academic.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian Sea is what it has been called for a long time, and
under the international Convention on the Law of the Sea, it meets
most of the qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Soviet Union and Iran long ago found it
convenient to treat the Caspian differently. Under their 1921
Treaty of Friendship, they made it a freely navigated lake whose
resources _ caviar-filled sturgeon mostly _ were shared by the two
bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
   That worked well enough in the old days. But following the
breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Caspian suddenly became
the property of the five countries that border it: Russia on the
north, Iran on the south, Kazakhstan and tiny Turkmenistan on the
east and Azerbaijan on the west. What they want to exploit isn't
free-roaming like the fish.
</P>
<P>
   So the question underlying the lake-sea dispute is clear-cut:
Who owns the oil under the sea and who controls the pipeline route
by which it gets to market?
</P>
<P>
   For Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, which have the
biggest known fields under their waters, the Caspian is a sea that
would give them maximum control over their own slices.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Russia and Iran, which have less oil and gas off
their own shores, insisted that concern for the environment
required joint sovereignty over the Caspian and its resources, a
ludicrous position since Russia is by far the Caspian's largest
polluter. Russia also argued that because the economies of the
former Soviet republics were developed with Russian financial
support, it deserved more. Russia must have ``access to the
resources of the Commonwealth of Independent States,'' Yuri
Shafranik, who was then energy minister, said in 1994. ``We, by
virtue of our labor, mind, energy have created all this.''
</P>
<P>
   But last April, Russia began to modify its position after
discovering more oil in its sector. Russian President Boris Yeltsin
of Russia and Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev agreed in
principle _ but failed to sign an agreement _ to divide the seabed
and the oil under it into national sectors.
</P>
<P>
   There was a catch. Yeltsin also said that the waters above the
seabed would remain international. That means that all five
countries would enjoy common use of the sea itself, with freedom of
navigation, fishing rights and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   Clever move. Russia, which still can't quite accept the fact
that it has to make concessions to three former Soviet republics,
is opposed to a plan for an undersea pipeline that would bypass
Russia. But oil is no good unless it can be moved to market, so
Russia's compromise would give it veto power over any pipeline plan
on environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Yeltsin signs an agreement with Kazakhstan to divide the
Caspian, as he has said he will do next month, will Russia's
Parliament go along? And even if the Russian view prevails, does
that mean a navigational free-for-all in the Caspian?
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of navigation sounds good, but does that mean that any
country can move its navy around at will even if it seems
provocative to its neighbors?'' asked Toby Gati, who was the Russia
adviser on the National Security Council during President Clinton's
first term. ``What happens if one country's platform begins to leak
oil? Can the others say, `Get it out of here?'''
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's new position, Iran becomes the odd man out,
insisting that the Caspian cannot be divided into national sectors
and that the oil belongs to all.
</P>
<P>
   The only way Iran will agree is if the Caspian is sectioned into
``equal shares,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said in
May. That means Iran wants to control 20 percent of the seabed; the
normal division according to international law would give Iran less
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kharrazi also rejected the Russian idea of dividing the seabed
one way and the waters another. ``If there is going to be a
division accepted by different countries, I'm sure that one legal
regime has to be applied to the seabed as well as the waters of the
Caspian Sea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has also declared that any pipeline built under the Caspian
would be a disaster to sturgeon and migrating birds. But its motive
may be to delay the building of any undersea pipeline, in hopes
that the United States will drop its opposition to a much shorter,
cheaper pipeline that would go across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, regards the
whole debate as part of a U.S.-inspired plot to impose a military
presence on Iran's northern border _ the Caspian _ just as it did
on Iran's southern border, the Persian Gulf. ``The U.S. oil
companies' presence in the Caspian Sea is aimed at paving the
ground for the U.S. military presence in this sensitive oil-rich
region,'' he said recently.
</P>
<P>
   Even the World Bank is confused. Recently, the Bank's
International Finance Corporation indicated that Azerbaijan could
get financing for offshore development without a resolution of the
lake-sea issue, a decision that has set off a legal battle inside
the Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. position is that it will accept any decision that will
avoid a pipeline through Iran.
</P>
<P>
   And as some participants in this debate cite legalities and
environmental concerns, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan are busy
developing their offshore deposits, signing multi-billion-dollar
contracts with international firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the lawyers are dithering, the investors are planting
their flags,'' said S. Frederick Starr, an expert on Central Asia
who writes extensively about the Caspian. ``It's like land-staking
in the American West. You get your wagon out there as soon as
possible.''

 &HT;    Guess who went to dinner with big tobacco?
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If you tried to contact your GOP senator the evening
before the Senate's key vote on comprehensive tobacco legislation,
you might have found him out for early cocktails and dinner. One of
the year's biggest fundraisers for the Republican National
Committee and its Senate and House campaign committees was staged
at the Washington Convention Center, courtesy of big tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   You weren't invited. And you didn't have much voice in the way
your senator voted.
</P>
<P>
   But you can't match tobacco money. No one can.
</P>
<P>
   The night-before gala wasn't for giving lil' ol' $5,000 limited-
by-law contributions to individual GOP senators. It was to raise
$10 million in so-called soft money. Republican senators attended
in droves. And the next day they deliverd pro-industry votes as
expected. Tobacco is the top soft-money donor to the GOP, and has
been for the past three years. Phillip Morris alone has given
approximately $275,000 to various Republican political campaign
committees since the first of January.
</P>
<P>
   The get-along, go-along crowd of GOP senators who went from
being wined and dined to caving in on a crucial public health issue
will rationalize with their leadership that what's needed is a
narrower bill on tobacco, one that won't ``increase taxes.'' A vote
to increase taxes is a powerful election-year TV spot. Everybody
know that. The political pitfall on the tobacco issue is that the
American people don't really view increasing the cost of cigarettes
as increasing their taxes. According to a recent Gallup poll, 60
percent support raising the cost of tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   The people, hopefully, will see through much of the double-talk
on a matter GOP leaders have wrongly allowed to become partisan.
For example, the party that calls for personal responsibility for
welfare mothers doesn't demand such for folks who smoke themselves
to death. The party that wants to cut health care costs doesn't
isn't interested in curtailing the nation's greatest single health
care expense. The party that hates solving things through the
courts cares not about tobacco lawsuits that will go on endlessly.
The party that believes government policies can change personal
behavior doesn't want to bully people who smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Given the GOP's blatant sell-out to the tobacco industry, it's
an amazing thing that the legislation the industry so hates is
sponsored by a Republican. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) deserves a
place in ``Profiles in Courage'' next to John Quincy Adams who also
fought his party-- the most politically treacherous fight of all. A
Vietnam war veteran, true to a conservative social agenda ( he is
pro-life), loyal to the presidential campaign of Bob Dole when
other party faithful deserted, McCain has stood firmly against the
deceit of the tobacco industry without name-calling or blaming his
fellow Republicans. The same is true of his measured response to
GOP leaders' opposition to his campaign finance reform bill, one
related to this very issue and one tobacco lobbyists helped kill.
Not many know of McCain's quiet decision several years ago not to
accept any more tobacco money. It was after the discovery of
documents that show the industry purposefully targeted its
cigarette marketing to kids.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from one man's courage and a party sell-out, there's
something else voters ought to note: A dozen Republicans mustered
the courage to support the tobacco bill -- check to see if your
senator was one of them.

 &HT;    Cut them slack, and kids go adrift
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Now that school is out, my mom's hassling me about everything
I want to do,'' the teenager wearing a middle school T-shirt
complained to her girlfriend as they stood in line next to me in
the crowded outer lobby of the multiplex movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' her companion replied, rolling her eyes heavenward
to express adolescent contempt and annoyance. ``My parents are the
same way. Like we got into it last night about what I want to do
this summer. I mean, I almost lost it. I told them they got to cut
me some slack or ... ''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't hear the rest of the conversation as the two girls
rushed away to get into line at a ticket window just opening up.
Thus, I was left behind to reflect on the familiar phrase this
generation invokes like a sacred mantra: Cut me some slack.
</P>
<P>
   As it's used by today's youth, the message to adults is:
``Whatever your expectations or standards for me, adjust them to
accommodate what I want to do the way I want to do it or risk a
volatile explosion. I reserve the right to determine what's best
for me. And (most insulting of all to the older generation) you
have earned no right to tell me what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   After I left the theater, I continued to think about the
teenagers' overheard conversation and the struggle of wills going
on in many families where parents are striving to guide their
children safely toward adulthood. These parents are probably
frustrated and exhausted. Clearly, many teenagers are frustrated
and angry. This volatile mix of emotions, if unrelieved by healing
communication between parents and children, portends serious
trouble ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In Toni Morrison's novel (ITALS) Paradise, (UNITALS) she tells
of a time when ``give me some slack'' was the younger generation's
slogan, replacing respect for elders, fear of God or concern for
expressing his will.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the all-black town of Ruby, Okla., during the '70s, this
novel tells the story of perilous times when the divisive tensions
throughout the rural community were fueled by ``what nobody talked
about: young people in trouble or acting out behind every door.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger generation of the town's most stable families
thought their elders' ways of doing things too slow, weak and
ineffective, and, unlike previous generations, these youths had no
reluctance to say so. Hence ``the sass, the pout, the outright
defiance'' became likely responses whenever the older generation
tried to proscribe conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been better for everyone if the young people had
spoken softly, acknowledged their upbringing as they presented
their views. But they didn't want to discuss; they wanted to
instruct,'' Ms. Morrison writes. That observation definitely
applies to many of today's youth.
</P>
<P>
   In Ruby, young people no longer routinely acknowledged that the
older generation had wisdom the younger generation needed in order
to survive. Nor did the new generation feel any need to obey their
elders as an act of gratitude for the nurturing community provided.
Newly formed in more technological times and ignorant of the
hardships of the past, these youths felt sufficient unto
themselves, fully able to cope without standards except those of
their own making.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, though Ms. Morrison tells the mythic story of another era
and the dilemma of a new generation seeking to define its identity
and sense of purpose, the disconnect between adults and youths that
she describes mirrors the widening chasm between children and
adults in modern society where the sass, the pout and outright
defiance of our youth varies only in degrees of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the challenge to bridge the communication gap between
children and adults is more daunting than ever, but parents must
not abdicate their responsibility to gain momentary respite from
the struggle. Better that they risk occasional explosions of
adolescent wrath and work through it than cut the reins of
authority too loose. Slack reins provide children enough rope to
hang themselves.

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 By ABBY TANNENBAUM  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.
</P>
<P>
   7. Parents shall not use intimate details of their kids' lives
as conversational fodder. Boasts of children's accomplishments are
acceptable, but parents shall be discreet in their phrasing and
timing.
</P>
<P>
   8. Thou shalt not reveal devastating family secrets about
thyself or others unless thou hast arranged therapeutic support
systems.
</P>
<P>
   9. Thou shalt not publicly criticize the manners or behavior of
any child not thine own.
</P>
<P>
   10. Thou shalt flatter thy kinfolk _ falsely or not. All nieces
tap dance divinely, all babies are beautiful and all aunts look as
wonderful as ever.

   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

   As a travel writer, Shahin would like to provide summer
vacationers with sage advice on how to pack. But the truth is,
Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't
pack his bags. His wife does. This arrangement, he believes, is
quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

   While family reunions offer a unique opportunity to reconnect

 &HT;    Birthday bash for special cat held at International Museum of
Cartoon Art
 &HT;    By Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ It wasn't your average 20th birthday bash.
But Garfield isn't your average cat.
</P>
<P>
   The International Museum of Cartoon Art hosted a party and book
signing recently to kick off a two-month celebration in honor of
Garfield, the fleshy, fatigued feline that cartoonist Jim Davis
brought into the world in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a corn-fed, Indiana cat,'' Davis said, ``It's a great and
humbling thrill and a real honor to be here. This is a real mecca
for cartooning.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was joined by a 6-foot, walking and wise-cracking
Garfield, who arrived blind-folded in a city library's Bookmobile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most exciting thing I've ever seen,'' said Eric
Jorge, who said he is 8-3/4 years old. Jorge, of Palm Beach
Gardens, said he's ``definitely'' going to be a cartoonist when he
grows up. Or maybe a baseball player, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Davis gave fans every reason to expect 20 more years of
Garfield, Odie, his slow-witted canine companion, and Jon, the two
animals' hapless human handler. And he gave a preview of what's in
store for Garfield's future: A Garfield theme park will open
outside of Indianapolis in 1999 _ complete with four roller
coasters, a designated nap area and, of course, ``the best lasagna
in the land.''

 &HT;    Juveniles in Jonesboro shooting may land in San Marcos detention
facility
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ A San Marcos center for troubled youths has decided it
will not accept two Arkansas boys accused of killing five people in
a school shooting, even if an Arkansas judge recommends they be
placed there.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Andrew Golden, 12, and Mitchell Johnson, 13, were
accused of opening fire into a crowd of middle school teachers and
students, killing five and injuring 10 in what quickly became known
as the Jonesboro massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Last week (week of June 15 - 21), Arkansas officials toured the
Brown Schools Inc. facility in San Marcos as they looked for
alternative places to keep the boys if they are found guilty.
Concerns about the boys' safety in Arkansas' Division of Youth
Services program prompted the search. Officials would not comment
on whether other facilities were being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the decision about where the boys might be sent is
still in the initial stages _ they have not yet been before a judge
_ the Brown School has already declined to house and treat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have carefully considered the impact on our facility, our
neighbors and the kids whom we currently serve and believe it is in
the best interest of all to decline the opportunity to treat these
children,'' said John Harcourt, chief executive officer of the
Brown Schools, in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Judge Ralph Wilson Jr. was contacted by Brown School
officials Friday and notified of the center's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Walden, the prosecuting attorney in the case, said the
youngsters are undergoing psychological evaluations, and until
those are complete, it is premature to discuss the kinds of
facility where they could be placed. Bill Sadler of the Arkansas
State Police said discussing anything about the case or its
possibilities is ``completely inappropriate,'' since the boys do
not even have a hearing date set.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's visit did direct attention to the Brown Schools,
and that attention is what led the center to announce the decision
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the tremendous amount of media attention that
surfaced after the Brown Schools was considered as a treatment
option for the children has significantly compromised our ability
to accept these children into our program,'' Harcourt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown Schools, privately owned facilities founded in 1940 by
Bert Brown, treat children with behavioral and psychological
problems. There are 15 campuses in six states and Puerto Rico, all
licensed through the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory
Services as residential child-care facilities. The San Marcos
center is the oldest and best known.
</P>
<P>
   While the schools are known for their ability to treat children
with problems, they are not correctional facilities, said Donna
Burtanger, vice president of marketing and communications for the
Brown Schools. Although individual buildings are secured, Burtanger
said, the 110-acre campus in San Marcos is not fenced in.
</P>
<P>
   Security became a problem at one Brown School campus earlier
this year. Twice residents of the Brown Schools Rehabilitation
Center on Dittmar Road in South Austin walked off the grounds and
had run-ins with Austin police.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, a 19-year-old mental patient was accused of trying
to attack officers with a crowbar at a fast-food restaurant. He was
shot in the stomach. A week later, a 14-year-old boy left the
campus and pointed a BB gun at police officers, investigators said.
Police officers fired at the boy, but he was not hit.
</P>
<P>
   After those incidents, Brown Schools executive Jim Dalzell said
security was being reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a policy of carefully watching our patients, and if
that policy was followed, then we will have to look at what we have
to do in terms of our whole system to reduce the risk of this
happening again,'' he said.

 &HT;    Lost souls find new soles
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Come Friday (June 19) on 13th Street and
nobody knows anything. The shoes are gone. Took a hike.
</P>
<P>
   The streets in Coleman Park are hot, lawns dead if there was a
lawn to begin with. No irrigation. Rubbish is piled high in the
streets, in yards. Nobody on the streets except young men on the
corners. Some wear beepers.
</P>
<P>
   One young kid with several gold teeth and white cotton shorts
worn low over plaid underwear is standing on the corner in front of
Sam's grocery. He's wearing new Nikes _ so new you can almost smell
the box. The laces are untied, in the dirt, but so white, so clean
they or the shoes or both are quite obviously new.
</P>
<P>
   Know anything about all the stolen shoes? he's asked.
</P>
<P>
   What shoes, he says. It's a statement, not a question.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,400 pairs of shoes that disappeared from the street right
there yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gimme $1,000 and I'll tell you, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Are those shoes new, he's asked?
</P>
<P>
   He looks down at his feet. What shoes? he says.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday (June 18), a truck driver parked his rig carrying more
than 5,000 pairs of Nikes, Reeboks and Bass shoes on 13th near
Tamarind Avenue, one of the poorest neighborhoods of West Palm
Beach. The driver went off to find sex and dope. He came back and a
crowd had broken into the truck and stolen more than 3,400 pairs of
the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   At $80 to $100 a pair, that's $300,000 retail.
</P>
<P>
   But the police and some people in the neighborhood see the shoe
episode as an opportunity, not a crime. They feel it would be
``stupid'' to try to get the shoes back.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of those kids there, this was probably their first
pair of new shoes,'' West Palm Beach officer Chip Woods said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is reminiscent of the Brinks truck that capsized in
January 1997 in the Overtown section of Miami. Only $300 of more
than $800,000 in spilled money was returned.
</P>
<P>
   Miami police had warned passersby they would be arrested for
picking up so much as a quarter, but residents of Overtown laughed.
And kept the money. But one little boy returned 85 cents and was
given a good citizenship award. Honesty paid, but not much.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, no little kids are on 13th, no families. There are no
cafes, no water fountains, no ice cream wagons. Here and there down
an alley someone goes over a fence, disappears. A few feet flash
with bright new shoes, but the owners don't know anything.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody says the same thing about the stolen shoes: What
shoes. Or, I don't know nothing.
</P>
<P>
   That's understandable, says Donald Gibson III. He's the director
of the non-profit Community Resource Center. A native of the
neighborhood, he's come back to Coleman Park after 15 years of
doing community mental health work in San Francisco. He wants to
rebuild Coleman Park, those hot and dirty streets between Douglas
and Tamarind avenues north of Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure they're going to bend down and grab those shoes,'' he
says. ``People in Palm Beach or Wellington would do the same thing.
But here, these people are poor, exploited, red-lined out of their
homes and businesses. They're going to keep those shoes. They got
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Did the police _ who said they wouldn't be expending any shoe
leather on the case _ make the right decision?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever broke the lock on that truck is a hero to the people
around here,'' Gibson says. ``Nobody's going to turn him in. The
police made a prudent decision to walk away from this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking the shoes is wrong, sure,'' Gibson allows. ``But it's
gonna happen. A lot of people, they're not going to take those
shoes. There's a lot of pride here. Black people are proud. But
there's a lot of poverty, too. So, others, they're going to take
the shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson points up the street, toward Sam's. ``That store,'' he
says, ``used to be black-owned. Now, an Arab owns it. It smells,
the prices are high and the Arab doesn't live in the neighborhood.
That's the problem here. Money goes out but doesn't come in. Go
talk to the Arab.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arab turns out to be Jewish. Art Yahoda, 39, Tel Aviv
expatriate and owner of Sam's for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He's never been held up, he says, but half his vendors won't
deliver merchandise or produce. He has to pick it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today a beer truck comes,'' Yahoda says. `` While the driver
is wheeling in five cases, somebody grabs two cases of Guinness
Stout from the truck. You can't leave anything lying around. It
won't be there long.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Bennett just came in to the neighborhood, by way of
Camden, N.J. She lives on the second floor of an apartment house
with her daughter and 12-year-old grandson, Ahmad. She was working
when the shoe heist took place right in front of her apartment
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong to take the shoes,'' she says. ``If my grandson
came home with those shoes, I'd haul him myself to the police
station. I understand why people who need them would take the
shoes, but most of those shoes are long gone, sold or being sold.
That's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad, the grandson, nods. Helen Bennett tells him to stay off
the streets. He nods again. His shoes are old.
</P>
<P>
   Down on the street three women are loading a bunch of kids into
a big station wagon. They're going to the beach. What do they know
about the shoes?
</P>
<P>
   Each says the same thing: ``What shoes?''
</P>
<P>
   A West Palm Beach police car comes up the street. Two cops
inside. They're hot.
</P>
<P>
   What's new on yesterday's shoe heist?
</P>
<P>
   ``What shoes?'' they ask in unison.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't even heard about the shoes, they say. When did it
happen, where, they ask.
</P>
<P>
   Three thousand pairs of shoes. Gone. Nobody knows nothing.

 &HT;    Ice for the pool
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   STUART, Fla. _ Tony Tarallo was sick of climbing into a
94-degree pool every day. ``It was, like, not refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   So he ordered 1,200 pounds of ice for $200, helped push the
300-pound blocks one by one into the deep end, then climbed in
himself.
</P>
<P>
   While he and family friend Mike Flanagancq used one slab as a
mini-bar, the kids used the others as floats.
</P>
<P>
   Ice-truck driver Scott Jensen declined an invite and stood by,
sweating. ``I'd rather sit in the air conditioning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarallo, who owns a Stuart restaurant, completed his
10,000-gallon pool three weeks ago. This was an experiment, he said
as the water temperature fell to 90 degrees. It might become a
weekly event.
</P>
<P>
   He and Flanagan hoisted one rapidly melting block onto the lip
of the man-made waterfall that flows into the pool, then floated
under it. ``Being a kid, you know?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Cassidy, owner of Cassidy's Stuart Icecq, said this was the
first such request of the company this year. Others have simply
asked to crawl into their giant ice boxes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also have dry ice,'' he said, watching the fun. ``That's 110
below zero. I'd love to experiment with that.''

 &HT;    Leland returns to Florida after lung transplant
 &HT;    By Christine Evans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Maybe you weren't at the airport
Saturday (June 20), so you did not see a little squirt of a guy get
off the Midway flight from Raleigh, N.C., and you did not see all
the kids crowd around to give him hugs, or the big banner stretched
across the concourse to welcome him home, or the outrageous way the
little guy lifted up his shirt _ with the TV camera rolling! _ to
show off his scars, two big, curvy red lines stretching like smiles
across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   The World's Smallest Gym Teacher came home Saturday. And he
could breathe.
</P>
<P>
   He stepped off the plane in West Palm Beach with his wife,
Melissa, a heavy backpack that he carried himself, and, underneath
those smiling scars, a new set of lungs. That work.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Leland Herring told his friends and students and
colleagues from Wellington Christian School. ``I have only one
thing to say: This is a miracle. I mean, really! Your prayers made
it happen. Because when I went up to North Carolina, I didn't know,
to be honest with you, if I'd ever be coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   His doctors didn't know, either. The Herrings moved to Durham,
N.C., the day before Thanksgiving to be close to Duke University
Medical Center and the transplant team that hoped to save Leland's
life, if only they could get their hands on a decent set of lungs.
Leland has cystic fibrosis, and his own lungs were good for perhaps
another six months. If that.
</P>
<P>
   Just as doctors were getting worried, really worried, somewhere
in the Midwest a teenager died, and that teenager had a good set of
lungs and a blood type that matched. On April 26, Leland got his
transplant, which greatly increases the chance he will live another
five years, or more.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, he was back in his Durham apartment _ and that
afternoon, in typical fashion, he showed up at the gym to work out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am so appreciative,'' he said, his hands shaking a bit as he
made his speech from an airport chair, thanking everybody who had
cheered him up _ and on _ during the seven-month wait. ``This
donor, whoever he is, allowed me my first really good deep breath
of fresh air.''
</P>
<P>
   Now The World's Smallest Gym Teacher, as all the kids call him
(he's 5-foot-4 and 112 on a good day) has big plans. First, he will
fly to Illinois to be best man in a dear friend's wedding _ he
wasn't sure he would live to see that day. Then he will return to
Duke for a check-up _ the doctors are amazed by his progress. And
then, well, this is the really remarkable thing:
</P>
<P>
   He plans to go back to work this fall as The World's Smallest
Gym Teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see no reason to stop,'' he said, ``My motto is, `Just keep
going.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It is a gutsy motto, and he imparted it to his students at
Wellington Christian, where for three years he taught track and
basketball, never mind that he can't run a quarter mile himself.
Chris Tellexcq, 10 years old and next year a sixth-grader, recalled
how he and his teammates dedicated a track meet to Leland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend and I tied for first, and we held hands across the
finish line to honor Mr. Herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Dominique Kurnitskycq, 11, said she and her friend Jamie were
struggling to complete the mile run and the 50-yard dash for the
Presidential Physical Fitness Award _ ``and Mr. Herring, he was so
encouraging, he made us keep going until we got presidential.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior pastor at Wellington Church, Tim Christensoncq, said
he will never forget the day Melissa Herring showed his
congregation a video of Leland sitting on a bench outside his
Durham apartment before the transplant. For the first time, church
members saw Leland clearly suffering.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just sitting there, but he looked like he had just run
a marathon,'' the pastor said. ``He just could not breathe. His
lungs were working at about 19 percent of their capacity, and he
was just heaving. That video catalyzed us. We had a prayer meeting
right after.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Leland are just skyrockets, they burn fast and
they burn bright. None of us really have any idea how long we're
going to live, and he's such a poignant example of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a sports star, which he does not resemble, or a rock star,
which by a leap of imagination he might, Leland Herring came home
to a hero's welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Giggling teenage girls remarked that his cheeks looked a bit
chubbier. A grandmotherly type complimented his ``beautiful'' skin
tone. And the music teacher at Wellington Christian inquired
whether he could give Leland a hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' someone said, ``Just don't squeeze too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   And from the crowd, Brett Bowers, 11, emerged to tell one more
anecdote about his favorite teacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives out Mr. Herring's Bonus Points,'' Brett said. ``One
time, we had to do the mile, and a bunch of kids were saying, `We
can't do it!' And I said, `Yes, we can! We can do it!' And Mr.
Herring said, `Brett Bower, 20 extra bonus points!'
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing he wanted to teach us is, `Never say can't.' ''

 &HT;    Summer helpers look past parks
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Blue skies, rippling lakes and smiling swimmers are all
it used to take to get summer workers for Travis County, Texas,
parks. Now nothing but a stream of green cash does the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Fast food jobs, retail stores, beauty salons _ just about
anything, really _ paid more. The college-aged workers who usually
snapped up Travis County's 45 seasonal parks jobs instead man
drive-through windows. Halfway through spring, the parks department
lacked 32 seasonal workers, thanks in part to the Austin-area's 2.3
percent unemployment rate in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never had a problem hiring,'' said Donna Holt, human
resources coordinator for Travis County Transportation and Natural
Resources. ``This year...we can't get anybody out there at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in recent memory, Travis County raised
seasonal workers' pay to attract applicants, increasing wages to $7
an hour from $6.08 an hour _ still lower than the $7.50 an hour
some retail jobs pay.The parks department started doing telephone
interviews and quickened its hiring process, but is still 10
workers short of its usual number for this time of year. The pay
raise helped, bringing in 22 people since it took effect last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage means some park visitors wait in line longer to pay
their entrance fees. For a lucky few, who hit the right park on the
right day, it means no one is available to take their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can get in free,'' said Charles Bergh, parks division
director. Not always, though, because park rangers and other
supervisors have collected fees _ not normally part of their duties
_ at the county's 18 parks.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal workers pick up litter, keep an eye on boaters,
swimmers, picnickers and divers to make sure everyone follows park
rules, collect fees and hand out information pamphlets to visitors.
They work at a different park almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty low-stress job,'' said Shelly Sheppard, who left
a beauty salon job for a Travis County parks booth nearly two weeks
ago. ``The pay was decent.''
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos also has a seasonal worker shortage, but with
lifeguards, who earn between $6.30 to $7.08 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Pool managers and other supervisors are climbing into the
lifeguard stands because of a shortage of lifeguards, said Christi
Schmidt, city recreation manager. Besides nearby water parks,
better-paying fast food jobs and other employers, ``We've got the
outlet mall and they can maybe work at the outlet mall and make a
little more money,'' Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The state parks department and Round Rock city parks haven't had
as much trouble filling their positions. The state jobs typically
attract teachers looking for summer work and Round Rock only has
nine jobs to fill, officials for both said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis County still has more work than people and ``You share
everybody else's weight,'' said Pam Sliva, 35, a seasonal worker
since December. But new employees are clocking in.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Masters is one of them, donning the park uniform of white
knit shirt and green shorts for the first time last week. She spent
her second day on the job at Mansfield Dam Park, helping Sliva and
Sheppard collect fees and patrol the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making more at my other job, but this is a seasonal job so
that's to be expected,'' said Masters, who has worked in a hotel
two years while finishing her zoology degree at University of
Texas. ``But I make $7 an hour _ it's fairly good for the
responsibilities. It's not like it's a tough job, as far as I can
tell from one day. I love the scenery. I love being out on the
lake.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's one extra perk for Masters, who's used to handling
grumpy hotel guests' complaints. ``The people are pretty much happy
because they're coming out to the lake,'' she said with a grin.

FDA OFFICIALS ORDER BOOKS ABOUT HERB DESTROYED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials ordered
the destruction of three books about an herb and its use. Never
mind the First Amendment. Never mind upholding the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The herb at the center of this controversy is Stevia rebaudiana
Bertoni, better known as stevia or ``honey leaf.'' Under the law,
stevia can be marketed as a dietary supplement like a vitamin but
not as a food additive.
</P>
<P>
   The herb is said to benefit the health of those who take it. The
FDA considers stevia safe to simply swallow as a supplement (powder
or liquid), but unsafe when added to food or drink.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA goes ballistic when it thinks a company is selling
stevia as a natural sweetener _ a property for which the herb is
well-known in Paraguay and Brazil where it grows.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, Compliance Officer James Lahar of the Dallas, Texas
district office of the FDA, faxed a letter to Oscar Rodes,
president of the Stevita Co. in Arlington which sells the herb. The
letter states, in part: ``... a current inventory must be taken by
an investigator of this office, who will also be available to
witness the destruction of the cookbooks, literature, and other
publications for the purpose of verifying compliance.''
</P>
<P>
   The books in question address stevia's sweetening property _ a
big no-no, in the eyes of the FDA. Stevia could be a major economic
threat to established companies that manufacture artificial
sweeteners. It's calorie free.
</P>
<P>
   So the federal agency targeted the books: James Kirkland's
``Cooking with Stevia: The Naturally Sweet &AMP; Calorie-Free Herb,''
David Richard's ``Stevia Rebaudiana: Nature's Sweet Secret,'' and
Linda Bonvie, et al.'s ``The Stevia Story: A tale of incredible
sweetness &AMP; intrigue.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Rodes said that when he received the FDA
fax, he called his attorney in Washington, D.C. The local FDA
officers arrived a few hours later. According to Rodes, he said
that he would not destroy the books unless his attorney advised him
to do so. However, Rodes told them, if the FDA officers wanted to
destroy them, he would merely use his video camera to record the
event. The FDA officers left.
</P>
<P>
   Rodes also claims that the FDA officials told him that they
wanted Rodes to recall all the copies of the books he had already
sold. According to Rodes, that amounts to more than 4,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Lahar now claims he never ordered the books destroyed. In an
interview, he said, ``The sentence reads to the effect that if
books are going to be destroyed, we'd like to observe it.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked then where the idea for destroying books came from,
Lahar said he wouldn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   He responded, ``I've have been asked to refer calls to our press
office in Washington. ... We all have a boss.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who made the decision to silence him, Lahar referred to
FDA Associate Chief Counsel for Enforcement Annamarie Kempic in
D.C. Kempic did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   When the D.C. press office was called, press officer Judith
Foulke said she couldn't answer any questions about this case
because the matter was still under investigation _ a convenient
Catch 22. She couldn't even comment on the destroy-the-books
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Another wrinkle popped up. Julian Whitaker, a physician, asked
Rodes if he could purchase the three stevia books in question for
research purposes. Rodes, thinking he might violate FDA orders by
selling the books to the doctor, refused _ and explained why.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor called renown First Amendment attorney in Jonathan W.
Emord in Washington, D.C., to see what he could do. Emord called
the FDA to advise the agency that he planned to initiate legal
action to free the hostage books.
</P>
<P>
   Kempic then faxed a letter, dated June 5, to Emord in which she
says that Rodes can sell the books to Emord's client and states:
``... we have contacted Mr. Rhodes (sic) and advised him not to
destroy the books at this time.'' The ``at this time'' tells it
all.
</P>
<P>
   But pressure on the FDA had begun to mount. In a letter faxed to
Emord three days later, Kempic changed her tune. She writes: ``The
FDA Dallas District Office informs me that it was Mr. Rodes who
chose the option of destroying the books.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, says Rodes, emphatically. Why, after all, would he want
to destroy thousands of dollars worth of inventory?
</P>
<P>
   Rodes changed the labels on his stevia products so that they
conform to the strictest FDA regulations. They no longer suggest
any other use for stevia. A label that said ``tabletop ready'' was
replaced because this implies that stevia in these packages could
be used as a flavoring ingredient.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, however, the presence of the books remains a
critical issue for FDA officials.
</P>
<P>
   Rodes' company is one of the nation's major distributors of
stevia. The FDA confiscated two shipments of the herb that belong
to Rodes. Those shipments have yet to be released. This action is
costing Rodes business and money.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA oversees the sale and distribution of food and drug
products for the safety and health of the nation. The agency
sometimes acts overly cautious. Although stevia has been used as a
food additive without ill effects in Japan for more than 25 years,
the herb has not, according to the FDA, undergone sufficient
testing in this country to assure that it isn't harmful if used as
an additive.
</P>
<P>
   According to FDA officials, the herb stevia can be
``adulterated'' merely by being in the presence of information that
reveals its sweetening property.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas FDA agents even went so far as to mark up copies of the
offending books so that they couldn't be sold. Clearly these agents
violated the law. The FDA has no legal authority to destroy books.
None whatsoever _ no matter whose economic interests are at stake.

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Shift in job attitudes
would brighten South's future
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- In a downtown hotel in Louisville, Ky., last week
(week of June 15 - 21), Southerners who had gathered for a ``Future
of the South'' convention got a taste of the region's present-day
problems: Overwhelmed waitresses raced around the hotel restaurant
trying to serve far too many customers; guests carried up their own
luggage; hallway carpets went unswept.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Louisville's 2.7 percent unemployment rate has made
it tough for the hotel to hire an adequate number of workers. Real
estate ads featured lots of beautiful new homes, and the airport
was busy. It would seem any Kentuckian with a bit of ambition could
make a decent living in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   But while the state's largest city is booming, thousands of
Kentuckians continue to live in poor, rural areas where they hang
on to dirty, difficult mining jobs. The Louisville Courier-Journal
recently completed a series of stories that revealed about 10
percent of miners still get black lung disease, caused by the
inhalation of thick coal dust.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, that disease should not still exist. Mine operators
are required to send the federal government samples of the dust
levels in their mines to prove they are complying with tough
regulations. But the newspaper's reporter found that dust tests
routinely are being distorted to show the mine air is clean.
</P>
<P>
   Who would do such a terrible thing? Who would fake test results
so that workers would breathe in dangerous dust?
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, the miners themselves are usually the cause of the
cheating. They turn off the testing machines or put their shirts
over them so that dust can't get into the intake valves.
</P>
<P>
   The miners fear that if their employers are forced to meet
federal dust standards, they won't be able to operate profitably.
The workers don't want to lose their jobs, so they are willing to
cheat, even if that means committing suicide by black lung.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps during the 1930s, when the nation's unemployment rate
was 25 percent, making such a choice might have made sense. But
today, miners don't have to pick between lung disease and
joblessness. Employers in Louisville, Lexington and other vibrant
cities are begging for workers.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-working miner ought to be able to learn to operate a
construction crane or a bulldozer. All over the South, tree-cutting
companies are desperately seeking strong workers who can help clear
debris from this spring's big storms. Trucking companies are
looking for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities abound, yet coal miners would rather choke on coal
dust than change their location or occupation. Why? Finding the
answer to that question is vital to the South's economic future.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, sponsored by the Southern Growth Policies
Board, the blue ribbon panel of governors and other top leaders
from the region pounded home the message that the South will not
continue to prosper unless more workers learn the skills needed in
our high-tech, global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the South, employers are suffering from a lack of
workers, yet pockets of unemployment and underemployment persist
because so many people resist change.
</P>
<P>
   So we end up with these absurdities: In urban areas, many young
men would rather sell drugs and risk getting shot than learn to
repair cars. In coal-mining counties, men would rather breathe
filthy air than learn to operate construction equipment. In rural
areas, women would rather cut up poultry than enroll in nursing
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Getting people to break out of their familiar roles will require
the commitment of all community leaders. Educators, ministers,
union officials, politicians, employers and other leaders have to
deliver a tough, clear message: Today's economy is booming, but it
will reward only those people willing to change their old haunts
and habits.

 &HT;    Grilling the grillmasters about new book
 &HT;    By Kitty Crider
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Cheryl and Bill Jamison of Santa Fe, those fire
fanatics whose cookbooks have copped a couple of James Beard
awards, breezed into Austin last week to talk of things of meat and
heat, especially their latest work, ``Born to Grill'' (Harvard
Common Press, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   Now, Central Texans don't cotton to outsiders telling us how to
play with fire under an open sky. But who among us has had 15
grills on our patio at once?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the Jamisons are not total outsiders. Bill, whose
family is from Buda and Sprinkle, was the education director of the
Texas Commission of Arts and Humanities in Austin from 1973 to
1975, and Cheryl lived in Dallas awhile.
</P>
<P>
   The authors of ``Smoke &AMP; Spice,'' ``Sublime Smoke,'' ``The
Border Cookbook,'' ``Texas Home Cooking'' and the ``Rancho de
Chimayo Cookbook,'' both love good food.
</P>
<P>
   They are good sports, too, agreeing to let us grill the
grillmasters. Q: Do you still have 15 grills ? A: We are down to
six, but we predominantly use four: an indoor Viking gas grill, an
outdoor Weber kettle grill, a Hasty-Bake charcoal grill and a
Tuscan grill that fits inside a wood-burning fireplace. Q: What are
your favorite foods cooked on the grill? A: Bill: shrimp (out of
the shell), tuna steak and corn on the cob (out of the husk).
Cheryl: pork chops, porterhouse steaks, asparagus (angled so it
does not fall through the grill.) Q: What is grilling? A: It's high
heat, dry cooking, directly over the fire. But contemporary grills
are so versatile and easy to use that they've led us to neglect
real grilling.
</P>
<P>
   Too often these days we think we're grilling just because we're
using a grill, while much of the time we are actually cooking the
food in quite a different way _ roasting, baking, frying _ and
losing much of the grill flavor that brought us to the back yard
originally. (Our recipes state a preference fos when you turn the
fish, re-oil the grate. If grilling covered, sear both sides of the
fish first on high heat uncovered for 2 minutes; finish the cooking
with the cover on over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once
midway.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the steaks immediately, halved for four diners, with
dollops of the horseradish cream.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4. For a summer supper, pair the tuna with new potatoes
and string beans, dressed with vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing goes with grilled meat like corn on the cob. We used to
grill the old favorite in the way that's generally recommended,
soaking the ear in water and cooking it with the husk on. We
realized finally that the traditional method actually steams and
roasts the corn, instead of grilling it, producing a good result
but little true grill taste. Now we remove the husk and silk before
cooking, exposing the kernels directly to the heat, which sizzles
surface juices and concentrates the corn flavor. To keep it classic
and elemental, we add no seasoning except salt and butter,
preferably a premium version of the latter. Simply Superb Corn on
the Cob
</P>
<P>
   6 ears of corn, husked and silk removed
</P>
<P>
   Butter, preferably an unsalted premium butter such as Plugra,
melted
</P>
<P>
   Salt or All-'Round Rub
</P>
<P>
   Finely minced fresh parsley or cilantro, optional, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the grill, bringing the temperature to medium (4 to 5
seconds with the hand test).
</P>
<P>
   Brush the corn lightly with butter. Grill the corn uncovered on
medium heat for 20 to 25 minutes, turning on all sides to cook
evenly and brushing with more butter after about 10 minutes. If
grilling covered, cook for 18 to 22 minutes, turning once midway
and brushing with butter. The cooking time is longer than
technically necessary to cook the corn, but helps concentrate the
juices a bit, giving the corn a more intense taste and crisper
texture.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the corn again with butter, sprinkle it with salt or dry
rub, and serve hot. If you can't resist the urge to add a little
something extra, scatter on a bit of parsley or cilantro for color.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   All-'Round Rub: Mix 6 tablespoons paprika, 2 tablespoons each of
coarse-ground black pepper and coarse salt, 1 tablespoon chili
powder, 2 teaspoons packed brown sugar, optional pinch or two of
cayenne. Save this fruit fantasy for a special party, a birthday,
Father's Day, the Fourth of July, or just the next available
Saturday. Warming the bananas on the grill mellows their taste and
softens their texture, making them as meltingly luscious as the ice
cream and the toffee candy sauce. Grilled Banana Split with
Chocolate-Toffee Melt 1 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   6 medium bananas
</P>
<P>
   Three 1.4-ounce Heath Bars or 4 to 5 ounces chocolate-covered
toffee, chopped into chunks
</P>
<P>
   6 large scoops each of two kinds of ice cream, such as vanilla,
butter pecan, praline, chocolate or banana
</P>
<P>
   Whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   Toasted almonds, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Fire up the grill, bringing the temperature to medium (4 to 5
seconds with the hand test).
</P>
<P>
   Combine the sugar and half-and-half in a heavy medium saucepan.
Bring the mixture to a full rolling boil, stirring occasionally.
Stir in the butter and remove from the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Just before grilling, slice the bananas, still in their skins,
lengthwise.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the bananas cut-side down to a well-oiled grate. Grill
the bananas uncovered over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the
bananas skin-side down, brush their cut surface with a few
teaspoons of the sugar-half-and-half mixture, and grill them for 2
to 3 additional minutes, until soft and lightly colored.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the bananas from the skins. If you own long banana split
dishes, leave the banana halves whole and place two of them in each
dish. If not, cut the bananas into bite-size chunks and divide them
among individual serving dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Return the sugar/half-and-half mixture to medium-low heat and
stir in the toffee chunks. Cook briefly until the chocolate and
toffee have partially melted (leaving some chunkiness) and stir
well. Top each dish of banana with one scoop of each ice cream and
some of the chocolate-toffee melt. Add whipped cream, top with
almonds, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 gargantuan servings.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   Almost Heroes PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A comic version of Lewis and Clark, with Matthew Perry and the
late Chris Farley as mismatched 19th-century explorers. Novel and
giddily silly at first, but simply dopey by the end. Rated PG-13
for brief nudity, strong language and comic violence. 1 hour, 29
minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   The Apostle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Robert Duvall wrote, directed and stars in this slow-moving but
beautifully observed character study about a Pentecostal preacher
who finds, late in the game, that being a holy man and being a good
one aren't always the same thing. The acting is uniformly strong,
with Britain's Miranda Richardson disappearing entirely in the role
of a smalltown Louisiana woman and Farrah Fawcett doing just fine
as the preacher's trophy wife. And Duvall's performance is a small
miracle. Rated PG-13 for thematic elements and a scene of violence.
2 hours, 10 minutes. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   As Good as It Gets PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Just like the title says. Filmmaker James L. Brooks, a savvy
humanist with a humorist's ear, introduces us to three mixed-up New
Yorkers trying to work out their lives. Jack Nicholson is a
best-selling writer who's also a world-class misanthrope and
obsessive-compulsive. Greg Kinnear is his nice-guy gay neighbor
whom he regularly baits and Helen Hunt is the waitress who can
handle him . . . most of the time. Good acting, good writing, good
movie. Rated PG-13 for language and brief violence. 2 hours, 18
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Big Hit R
</P>
<P>
   The big ho-hum. Treading territory that ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
covered better last year, ``Hit'' ponders the problems of a
professional killer trying to maintain a domestic life. Mark
Wahlberg plays Mel, a hit man torn between mowing down mobsters and
romancing a girlfriend (Lela Rochon) and a fiancee (Christina
Applegate). Rated R for violence, language, and some sexuality. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced -- just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Character NR
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Oscar winner for best foreign language film, this dour
but compelling Dutch import is laden with Dickensian incident and a
Kafkaesque sense of fate. Set in 1920s Rotterdam, it's the tale of
a relentless war waged between a formidable father (Jan Decleir)
and his illegitimate son (Fedja van Huet). Not exactly a
lighthearted romp, but so much happens you barely notice. Not rated
but there is brief sex, nudity and violence. Subtitles. 1 hour, 57
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wenders' great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM)

INSIGHT COMES WHEN LIFE UPSETS OUR EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DELAVAN, Ill. _ By the time we got to church, the early morning
wind and rain had bullied its way through fields of my uncle's
knee-high corn and pushed into town, unplugging electrical power in
the whole building. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The preacher said the lights went out in the middle of the 8
a.m. service in the chapel, so they lit a few candles and carried
on. (As far as I know, Christian worship has never actually
required electricity.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the 9:30 service there still was no power, so we sat in the
sanctuary in a kind of sacred twilight, two small candles on the
altar offering the only light not strained through stained glass
windows. The effect was altogether remarkable and engaging. And I
gave thanks for an unexpected reminder that our alleged necessities
often are no more than conveniences that insulate and distract us
from reality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning aspect of the dimly lit sanctuary was the
depth of color that almost sang to us from the large round window
above the altar. The occluded outside light made the window's blues
especially profound in their richness, and I tried to remember ever
seeing that window on any of the several times I came to this
church as a boy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was the day in 1953 when we gathered here to bid Godspeed
to my grandmother _ dead of cancer at barely 65. But my only vivid
memory from that sad day is watching my other grandmother _ herself
already 71 _ pat the neatly folded hands of Grandma Tammeus as we
passed by her open casket. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure that as an 8-year-old boy it struck me as an odd and
even gross thing for the living to touch the dead. But today that
gesture seems to me to have been a loving and fearless act from a
spontaneously gracious woman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I cannot, however, bring to mind the lovely stained glass window
from that day or even from the day seven years later when we
collected here again to eulogize Grandpa Tammeus after his heart
ran out of beats. The reason, I'm sure, is that on those and other
occasions the electric lights in the sanctuary provided light
pollution, dimming the window's thick colors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm no Luddite. In fact, I am attached to much of the technology
that makes the way most of us live possible. So do not hear my
praise of church services without electricity as naive advocacy of
some long-gone time of supposed innocence. Rather, what I mean to
praise are interruptions of our increasingly unexamined
expectations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who live in cities and suburbs expect, at night, to
hear auto traffic and neighborhood dogs and even low-flying
aircraft as we slide away to sleep. I certainly do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the central Illinois farm house of my aunt and uncle is
surrounded not by a grid of busy streets but by nothing more than
fields of noiselessly growing corn and soybeans. The silence at
night is breathtaking. Indeed, when I lie in bed and draw breath I
hear nothing but the rhythmic seesawing of air in an out of me.
It's almost eerie. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the windows are open and I listen long enough I may,
eventually, hear a cricket, say, but the overwhelming sensation is
immersion in gentle but insistent waves of silence, like shimmering
heat rising from corn fields on a torrid day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a reminder to me that not everyone lives _ or needs to live
_ at my normal pace or decibel level. There are alternatives. And
my strong, healthy, still-farming uncle in his mid-70s may be proof
that such an alternative life can have benefits we ignore at our
own peril. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At church, with the power gone, the organ was out of commission.
Because of this interruption in our expectations, we listened to _
and sang along with _ a lively piano. I love organ music (my oldest
sister is a Juilliard pipe organ graduate, so I better), but
there's something refreshingly direct and simple about a happily
percussive piano in a church sanctuary, and I was glad for the
change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On all counts, in fact, I was glad on this trip to have insights
break in through overturned expectations. I just hope I can
remember to look for them in other times and places. &QL;
</P>
<P>

GET ENOUGH NOTHING IN ONE PLACE AND YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years I've wanted to write a column about nothing. My theory
is that the less a column is about the less an editor can find to
challenge. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've never quite gotten around to doing a column about nothing _
no matter what some of my more annoyed readers claim _ but today I
will get close by writing about almost nothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The scientific name for almost nothing is neutrinos. How close
to nothing is this subatomic particle? Well, until earlier this
month it was thought to have no mass at all, thus resembling Bill
Clinton's foreign policy. In addition, it is unimaginably small and
so neutral in terms of electrical charge that trillions of them
pass through our bodies each day undetected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They may not be as small as the Ken Starr Fan Club, but they're
teeny. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For amounting to almost nothing, neutrinos certainly dealt the
scientific world a hefty blow upside the head a few weeks ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who have been trying to capture and study neutrinos
announced that neutrinos actually have mass. Indeed, there are so
many neutrinos in the cosmos that their mass may account for all
the so-called ``missing mass'' in the universe. And that's a
bunch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And this conclusion doesn't come from just one geek in a
basement lab. No, a team of more than 120 scientists from American,
European and Japanese research institutions has been working on
this project. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Listen to what physicist John G. Learned (a wonderful name for a
scientist) of the University of Hawaii said about the finding of
the research team on which he served: ``It could prove to be the
key to the Holy Grail of physics, a unified theory of
everything.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You may find the naivete of what I'm about to tell you amazing,
especially if you have come to appreciate and even be comfortable
with all the ambiguity, complexity and chaos in the world, but ever
since Albert Einstein, scientists have been seeking this theory of
everything. It would be a single set of equations to explain all
the foundational forces of the world, from gravity to
electromagnetism to the strong and weak interactive forces inside
atoms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The famous physicist Stephen Hawking even claimed once _ in a
burst of arrogant and ridiculous hyperbole _ that once we find this
grand unified theory of everything we will ``know the mind of
God.'' Well, no. The most we might know then is an inventory of
utensils in God's tool box. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As scientists conduct this quixotic search for the grand theory
of everything, they have devoted more than two years to using a
fantastic array of equipment just to study the itsy-bitsy
neutrino. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to call attention to the size of their efforts, they
named themselves the Super-Kamiokande group. They buried a
50,000-ton tank of purified water deep underground in a zinc mine
owned by the Kamioka Mining and Smelting Company in Japan, about
150 miles northwest of Tokyo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There they set up intricate and expensive devices to detect the
astonishingly faint flashes of light given off when neutrinos
interact with the water in the tank. From their measurements they
determined that neutrinos have mass. If you expect me to explain
the math and science behind this conclusion you have been sadly
misled into thinking I'm capable of such a feat. I can't even
explain why my car often starts when I turn the key. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For decades scientists have been wondering where all the mass in
the universe is that their equations tell them exist. They call
this missing mass ``dark matter.'' The mass of neutrinos, it turns
out, may be some or most of the dark matter for which they've been
hunting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which surprised me. My theory has been that dark matter is made
up mostly of members of Ken Starr's Fan Club. &QL;
</P>

GOODMAN.

   FILM-REVIEW-JEALOUSY (Undated) _ Writer-director Noah Baumbach

   LOUISIANA-CASINOS (Kinder, La.) _ For thousands of gamblers from
cities around Texas, a bus ride to the casino is the low and short
road to the Vegas-style action. And it's virtually a vacation
jackpot. The casinos subsidize the bus trips for players and often
throw in a free meal and complimentary drinks. By JOHN MacCORMACK

   GLF-OPEN-JANZEN (San Francisco) _ Lee Janzen sat down and
dandled the U.S. Open trophy on his right knee, as though it were
his son, Connor, or in a more playful mood, his wife, Beverly. He
had completed one of the most remarkable comebacks in major
tournament history, turning a seven-shot deficit to Payne Stewart
into a one-stroke win at the Olympic Club. By RAY RATTO.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-OPEN-STEWART (San Francisco) _ Paye Stewart tipped his very

<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Bishop Alvaro Ramazzini was
stunned when fellow Bishop Juan Gerardi was beaten to death just
two days after he'd presented a major report on human rights
violations in Guatemala. The killing shows that the death, deceit,
corruption and cover-up that characterized Guatemala's 36-year
civil war did not disappear with the 1996 peace accord. By
STEPHANIE SALTER.

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ Mark and Dayle Gruder lost their

   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ What we didn't know until the last few
weeks, when Big Tobacco started spending $40 million to instruct

   DOG-CHOICES _ As a professional educator, Allen Bower has
learned that the best way to avoid mistakes is to do your homework.
After a series of disasters with dogs that got on his nerves, the
school executive studied up on canines and concluded a Bichon Frise
would be best for his family. The books said its personality was a
good fit. And that's critical, says Dr. Stan Coren, a psychologist
at the University of British Columbia and author of the new hit,
``Why We Love the Dogs We Do.'' (Hendrick, Atlanta

   LELAND-RETURNS _ Maybe you weren't at the airport Saturday (June
20), so you did not see a little squirt of a guy get off the Midway
flight from Raleigh, N.C., and you did not see all the kids crowd
around to give him hugs. The World's Smallest Gym Teacher came home
Saturday. And he could breathe. Leland Herring said: ``I have only
one thing to say: This is a miracle.'' (Evans, Atlanta

<P>
   SEASONAL-WORKERS _ AUSTIN _ The college-aged workers who usually
snapped up the Travis County, Texas, 45 seasonal parks jobs instead
man drive-through windows. Halfway through spring, the parks
department lacked 32 seasonal workers, thanks in part to the
Austin-area's 2.3 percent unemployment rate in May. (Daniel, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

<P>
   WHAT-SHOES? _ WEST PALM BEACH _ One young kid is standing on the
corner in front of Sam's grocery, Coleman Park, Florida. He's
wearing new Nikes _ so new you can almost smell the box. The laces
are untied, in the dirt, but so white, so clean they or the shoes
or both are quite obviously new. Know anything about all the stolen
shoes? he's asked. What shoes, he says. It's a statement, not a
question. (Reid, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   POOL-ICE _ STUART, Fla. _ Tony Tarallocq was sick of climbing
into a 94-degree pool every day. ``It was, like, not refreshing.''

300-pound blocks one by one into the deep end, then climbed in

Common Press, $27.95). Now, Central Texans don't cotton to

</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Everest . . . grade A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist,
Hunter S. Thompson, and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's
version of Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to
Vegas has a brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But
Johnny Depp gives an amazing performance as Thompson. Rated R for
vulgar language, violence and extensive drug use. 2 hours. (ER)
Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Gingerbread Man R
</P>
<P>
   This tasty thriller pairs mainstream John Grisham with maverick
Robert Altman. The mix works surprisingly well. A cocky attorney
(Kenneth Branagh) helps out a waif-ish waitress and finds he's into
something far murkier than he thought. Branagh is excellent, as is
the supporting cast (Robert Downey Jr., Robert Duvall), and Altman
captures Savannah with far more flavor and far less fanfare than
Clint Eastwood's ``Midnight'' excursion. Rated R for violence,
language and nudity. 1 hour, 55 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
yearlong hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Hanging Garden R
</P>
<P>
   A dysfunctional family in full bloom is the focus of this
provocative and original film. When a long-absent brother (Chris
Leavins) returns for his sister's (Kerry Fox) wedding, past and
present, realism and surrealism collide with eerie ease and often
darkly comic results. Rated R for profanity and sex. 1 hour, 31
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+

</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mouse Hunt PG
</P>
<P>
   As far as your kids are concerned -- this unevenly delirious
comedy succeeds as a spin on ``Home Alone.'' Broadway dynamo Nathan
Lane and English comic Lee Evans have the Joe Pesci-Daniel Stern
roles, as greedy interlopers looking to oust a mouse from a house
that's worth millions. The rodent has the Macaulay Culkin part. Our
hero is not as photogenic as the erstwhile boy star, but he's
certainly as resourceful: Who else would use a wheel of cheese as
transportation? Rated PG for minor profanity. 1 hour, 33 minutes.
(Tom Sabulis) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a fourth-century legend, it's about
a young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself
as a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This
isn't just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Music From Another Room PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Badly off-key. With its lyrical title and a cast including Jude
Law (``Gattaca'') and Oscar nominee Brenda Blethyn (``Secrets &AMP;
Lies''), the movie sounds like a charming character study. But it's
mainly an endurance test. Law plays Danny, who falls in love with
the woman (Gretchen Moll) he helped birth 20 years before. Rated
PG-13 for a mild sex scene and some profanity. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
(SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   The Object of My Affection R
</P>
<P>
   Based on Stephen McCauley's novel, this comedy-drama is
fashioned as sort of a modern-day Shakespearean romp of romantic
mismatches. Nina (Jennifer Aniston) gets pregnant by her bossy
lover (John Pankow). She begins to think her new roommate George
(Paul Rudd) would make a better father -- he's polite, single,
smart and a babe. He's also gay. Shimmering with charm and sharp
performances, the movie can't quite overcome a central problem.
George and Nina are such bland, nice nudniks, it's hard to invest
in their story. Rated R for strong language and some sexuality. 1
hour, 51 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   The Players Club R
</P>
<P>
   Rapper Ice Cube, making his debut as a writer and director,
steals readily from Spike Lee's 1996 flick ``Girl 6.'' And that's
the best thing he does here. Cube's movie about a strip club
masquerades as the story of a single mother (Lisa Raye) who nobly
struggles to pay her college tuition and feed her young son by
performing at night. Instead we get a cliched view of women, two
rapes and a catfight between the mother and another dancer. Rated R
for strong language, sexual content and violence. 1 hour, 43
minutes. (SM) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Post Coitum NR
</P>
<P>
   Doomed passion is charted unsparingly in this French film from
Brigitte Rouan. A chic 40-ish woman (Rouan) risks her family and
her career for a heedless affair with a younger man. A raw,
revealing tragicomedy that offers truths as inescapable as stretch
marks. Not rated but there are steamy sex scenes. In French with
subtitles. 1 hour, 37 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel, Steve Murray, and Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Reviewer's initials appear at end of review). Grades range from
A to F.
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED: Post Coitum . . . Grade B+
</P>
<P>
   Primary Colors R
</P>
<P>
   Color it a knockout. Mike Nichols, who gave a generation a code
word (``plastics''), now delivers its elegy with this savvy film
about a presidential hopeful and his wife who resemble certain
White House inhabitants. The movie moves from satire to something
far deeper almost effortlessly. The terrific cast is headed by John
Travolta (all gut and twinkle), Emma Thompson and Kathy Bates. As
Pogo once said, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.'' Rated R for
language and adult situations. 2 hours, 14 minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER)
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Scream 2 R
</P>
<P>
   Still a scream -- in both the scary and the funny sense. Writer
Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven, the team that made
``Scream'' the unexpected hit of 1996, take scary sequels as their
target this time around. Neve Campbell returns as our beleaguered
heroine Sidney, now enrolled in picturesque Windsor College (it's
actually Decatur's Agnes Scott), where a masked killer is prowling
around with a butcher knife. ``Scream 2'' can't recapture the
bracing experience of the first film. But it gets as close as you
could hope for. Rated R for language and violence. 2 hours. (SM)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot, and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti -- an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Species II R
</P>
<P>
   The principal difference between this one and ``Species'' is --
well, there really isn't a difference. Michael Madsen is back,
trying to keep Natasha Henstridge (a clone of the character she
played in the first film) from having sex and spreading alien DNA.
The only real fun is in listening to the audience call out the plot
points before the characters find them out. Rated R for language,
sex and gore. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Titanic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The ship goes down, but the movie stays afloat. Writer-director
James Cameron harnesses Hollywood's latest high-tech tricks to tell
an old-fashioned romance for the gals that doesn't neglect the guys
either. Kate Winslet plays an upper-crust Philadelphia girl
returning from Europe on the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio is a
scrappy artist who has admired her from afar. Rated PG-13 for
disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality and brief
language. 3 hours, 14 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit, and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for language. 1 hour, 44 minutes.
(ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed -- the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Wedding Singer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A sweet 'n' silly love song of a movie. It's 1985. Adam Sandler
is the titular matrimonial entertainer. Drew Barrymore is a
sweetheart of a waitress. They're clearly Meant For Each Other, but
otherwise engaged. The pre-teen boys who rented ``Happy Gilmore''
by the billions may not be entranced, but the date crowd will
appreciate the shrewd blend of '80s jokes (DeLoreans? Billy Idol?)
and romance lite. Rated PG-13 for mild sexual situations and vulgar
language. 1 hour, 36 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Wilde R
</P>
<P>
   A dutiful, decorous rendition of a man who was anything but.
This Cliffs Notes version of Oscar Wilde's life gives us Wilde as
playwright, wit and gay martyr but leaves out the importance of
being Oscar. Still, Stephen Frye gives a tremendous performance in
the title role. Rated R for nudity and sex. 1 hour, 56 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Woo R
</P>
<P>
   An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to find true love
amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is the title
character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy behavior of
guys, she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy Davidson) with
the determination to prove his innate canine drive. Rated R for
language, sex and marijuana smoking. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take a smooth step up from
television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for mild language, gore
and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-

 &HT;    COLUMN: Small town parade means . . . port-a-johns a-plenty
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio. If it has wheels that go around and it's
painted red, you can bet it's in our village this weekend. It's
Gibsonburg's
</P>
<P>
   year to host the Northwestern Ohio Volunteer Fireman's Annual
Convention and I dare you to find anyone who can pronounce all of
that after nine
</P>
<P>
   o'clock tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The welcoming banner went up last week, strung between the
appliance store and the insurance office, and streets have been
swept to
</P>
<P>
   within an inch of their bricks. For days, volunteers have been
weeding and planting flowers uptown. Company's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, aluminum recycling bins hit the corners and flatbeds
loaded with portable outhouses came rolling into town. One confused
</P>
<P>
   driver looked like he was going to drop the whole load in my
front yard. We talked, and he moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Later, I asked my sister-in-law what she imagined folks did
before roll-away toilets were invented. ``Went in the bushes, I
guess,'' was her
</P>
<P>
   unconcerned response. She always thinks it's a little odd when I
wonder about stuff like that, but just think about it. Six thousand
people (the
</P>
<P>
   estimated parade-day attendance, and three times the population
of our village) with the urge - where would they go? And even if
there had been
</P>
<P>
   public restrooms available, could a little sewage plant have
handled all of those flushes?
</P>
<P>
   On my front porch, just two blocks west of the one-block
business district, I'm kind of in the thick of things which is
great for parades
</P>
<P>
   and waving at neighbors, but a little dicey when 83 companies,
complete with fire engines (state-of-the-art and antique), rescue
trucks,
</P>
<P>
   campers, golf carts, dogs, daughters, and mothers-in-law, hit
the village streets. Our shady sidewalks are awash in unfamiliar
faces out
</P>
<P>
   for a stroll and a look-see.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I pedaled my bike uptown for some last-minute
shopping and a quick glimpse of the big doin's. The grocery store
was
</P>
<P>
   full, the bakery was jammed, and the restaurant was so confused
they'd gone to a limited menu (just like at home - eat what's on
your plate and
</P>
<P>
   don't complain).
</P>
<P>
   On the ride back, I noted a sign warning revelers: No drinking
beyond this point. Uh huh. Sure, I'm thinking, and if frogs had
</P>
<P>
   wings.... But, if the edict holds, that means hilarity will stop
a block short of my house and I'll be spared some of the racket of
the impromptu
</P>
<P>
   Friday night whoop-de-do where merrymakers pile on firetrucks
and circle the blocks with sirens blasting and horns blaring,
turning our sleepy
</P>
<P>
   village into Hearing-Loss City.
</P>
<P>
   A vintage beauty of a truck with a rocking chair strapped to the
front bumper just rolled by hauling a wagon loaded with firewood
behind
</P>
<P>
   it. Figure that one out.
</P>
<P>
   In a little while, on the high school lawn, firefighters will
get together and turn the hoses on one another - well not exactly.
Opposing
</P>
<P>
   teams will be spraying water at a 15-pound ball on a cable, and
whoever drives the ball into the other team's territory, wins.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon the judges will be electing a convention queen.
Our representative is a pretty little girl I taught 8th-grade
English.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be 18 high school marching bands, and our 1918 Model T
fire truck (the village's first not powered by horses) will lead
the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, friends will wander over and pull up a rocker to watch.
We'll have some refreshments and just kick back to enjoy the
goings-on.
</P>
<P>
   We'll probably be thinking how lucky we are to have a front row
seat on a shady porch for the festivities. I know I will.
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, I'll be feeling twice-blessed for not having to
visit one of those moveable outhouses.

After a series of disasters with dogs that got on his nerves, the
school executive studied up on canines and concluded a Bichon Frise
would be best for his family. The books said its personality was a
good fit. And that's critical, says Dr. Stan Coren, a psychologist

SCHOOLS NOT LIABLE FOR TEACHER MISDEEDS THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School districts cannot be held responsible when a
teacher sexually harasses or abuses a student if the school
authorities were not informed of the misconduct, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling means that in order to collect monetary damages,
a student must prove that school officials knew of the teacher's
misconduct and chose to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Congress speaks directly on the subject, we will not
hold a school district liable in damages ... for a teacher's sexual
harassment of a student absent actual notice and deliberate
indifference,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   She noted, however, that the ruling will not affect any right
that a harassed student has to recover monetary damages from a
guilty teacher, or against a school district under some state laws.
But such state cases have proved virtually futile.
</P>
<P>
   Although refusing to hold school districts liable, O'Connor
acknowledged that ``harassment unfortunately is an all too common
aspect of the educational experience ... and that a student suffers
extraordinary harm when subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by
a teacher, and that the teacher's conduct is reprehensible and
undermines the basic purposes of the educational system.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling killed a sexual-harassment lawsuit against a
Texas public school district over a teacher's sexual relationship
with a ninth-grade student.
</P>
<P>
   Because the decision focused exclusively on a school setting
involving teachers and students, it does not apply to on-the-job
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices are expected to say more on that subject in
employment in a pair of decisions to be announced before the court
ends its 1997-98 term this week or next.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the justices are considering whether employers
should be held financially responsible for a supervisor's sexual
misconduct when the victim complained to another supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   In the other pending case, the question is whether a company is
responsible if one of its supervisors harassed a woman and
threatened to make her job difficult unless she succumbed to his
advances but never carried out the threat. She alleged that even
though she received a promotion, she felt compelled to resign
because of a hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's case, Frank Waldrop was 52 and a social studies
teacher at a Lago Vista, Texas, high school when in 1993 police
found him naked in the woods with a 15-year-old student, Alida Star
Gebser.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawsuit that Gebser and her mother later filed
against the Lago Vista school district near Austin, the sexual
relationship had lasted for about six months. Gebser, now a college
student, apparently told no one about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in October 1992, parents or guardians of at least two
other girls had complained about what they called inappropriate
comments Waldrop made to their daughters. He met with the parents
and said he had meant no offense. The school principal admonished
Waldrop and considered the matter resolved, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   After the police discovered Waldrop and Gebser having sex in the
woods, Waldrop was fired and stripped of his teaching certificate.
He eventually pleaded no contest to a charge of attempted sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out Gebser's lawsuit against the school
district, however, after noting a lack of evidence that any
administrative official knew about the sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
dismissal of the suit, rejecting arguments that school districts
should be held responsible whenever a teacher sexually harasses a
student.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's majority opinion were Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Stevens attacked the majority decision,
saying: ``As a matter of policy, the court ranks protection of the
school's district's purse above the protection of immature high
school students that those rules would provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also said the decision ``thwarts the purposes of Title
IX'' of a 1972 law denying federal aid to schools that allow
discrimination against girls in sports and other school activities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that under the 1972 law
sexually harassed students may collect monetary damages from their
schools and school officials. But it did not say what standard
should be used for imposing liability on a school district for the
intentional acts of one of its teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In their arguments before the court, lawyers for the Lago Vista
school district said it would be unfair to make employers legally
responsible when they don't know that the harassment is taking
place.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Gebser contended that a school district should
provide adequate procedures to prevent, discover and eradicate
sexual harassment. School districts that fail to create a safe
environment, they said, should be held financially liable,
regardless of whether they knew about sexual harassment.

FINDING THE RAINBOW AFTER THE JASPER KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CARY CLACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Rainbows often follow storms, breaking the
darkness with an arc of iridescent hope.
</P>
<P>
   The storm of racial hate that swept across the life of James
Byrd Jr. in Jasper, Texas, can never be expunged from that
community's landscape or the nation's consciousness. The act was
too brutal and resonated with memories of times past when black
bodies hung from Southern trees.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of Byrd's death, hope is seen as Jasper's
residents _ black, white and brown _ reach out to one another to
grieve and comprehend the vicious crime. For the residents of
Jasper, a town that doesn't fit the stereotype of a racist East
Texas town, this is a time to reacquaint themselves with one
another and strengthen their bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The hope that breaks through the darkness of Byrd's last night
on Earth is that nationwide, Americans rededicate themselves to
seeing one another as individuals while appreciating the wealth of
cultures that enrich this land.
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't take a gruesome killing to remind us that racism
still thrives. It remains a virus left unchecked by inattention and
neglect.
</P>
<P>
   The antidote to defeating it is as old as the virus itself:
education and creating relationships. For those who don't live
lives that virtually segregate them from people of other
ethnicities, this is easy. For others, it's going to take work.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, President Clinton proposed a national dialogue on
race. His intentions were good but both the series of town hall
meetings and the advisory board fell short.
</P>
<P>
   Racism won't be overcome by new hate-crime laws, a government
edict or a presidential commission. Its conquest will be at the
hands and in the hearts of people who choose to know and learn from
one another.
</P>
<P>
   A character in Carlos Fuentes' novella, ``Constancia,'' asks,
``How long a vigil, I ask myself, does historical violence impose
on us?''
</P>
<P>
   The historical violence of racism will impose its vigil as long
as we are less vigilant in fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   The rainbow over the United States after the storm in Jasper is
the hope that racism will be defeated. But the rainbow also can be
a warning of the consequences if racism persists. As an old
spiritual says:
</P>
<P>
   ``God sent Noah the rainbow sign
</P>
<P>
   No more water, the fire next time.''

STORM DOORS ADD PROTECTION AND STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New thermal door technology has reduced the need
for the old storm door, which plainly provided extra protection to
conventional doors from wind, rain and debris.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past several years, the appearance of storm doors
has caught up with the look of exterior doors. While most of us are
familiar with the low-end white aluminum storm door, new models
feature wood and foam cores, solid brass hardware, full-view,
beveled glass panels, brass inlays, etched or stained glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The solid wood core makes the door sturdy,'' said Mary Ann
Holler, marketing communications manager for Larson Doors in South
Dakota. ``They are also weather-stripped and don't rattle. The
baked-on enamel finish gives an elegant look to the sheet aluminum
that covers the wood core. In the last five years, the hardware has
been upgraded to brass levers and locks to accent the front
entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Holler said the heavier storm door still adds another barrier to
the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you open your front door, you're not exposed to the
person on the other side,'' Holler said. ``Many of the new storm
door models also come with a keyed deadbolt lock.''
</P>
<P>
   Storm doors also double as screen doors in summer, by switching
the glass panel to the companion screen panel. Some storm doors
feature a triple-track system to hold both the screen and glass
panel.
</P>
<P>
   A good storm door begins at approximately $100 and goes up to
$250, and high-end models can reach $500 or more.
</P>
<P>
   With the higher-end models, there is often more glass, affording
a better view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The large glass panels are beautiful, allowing you to see the
front door,'' Holler said. ``But you might want to consider a kick
panel for the lower half if you have a medium- to large-size dog.
This way, they won't get the glass all muddy or streaked or dent
the screen insert in warm weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Some manufacturers include muntins, or dividers, to give the
door a Colonial flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new wood-core storm doors come in colors to
coordinate with your primary front door or shutters, and some
suppliers offer a warranty that's good for as long as you own your
door.
</P>
<P>
   Storm doors generally carry instructions for the
do-it-yourselfer. Some companies may offer a discounted
installation fee with the sale. But if you purchased a storm door
and need it professionally installed, plan on paying another $190
to $230.

TROUBLES IN THE PATH OF A TORNADO 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MECHANICVILLE, N.Y. _ Imagine for just a moment that you're
coming off gall bladder surgery, recuperating at home. Imagine that
you hear a tornado warning on the radio. Imagine that you dive for
your basement.
</P>
<P>
   Then imagine that in just a few moments everything you own is
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   You've just imagined that you're Dayle Gruder. She and her
husband, Mark, are New York state workers. Until three weeks ago,
they lived in a three-year-old house atop Ferdinand's Hill in
Mechanicville, an Albany suburb. Then that towering twister roared
through. In only a minute or so, it inflicted about $145 million in
damage to 186 homes and dozens of businesses. Miraculously, it
killed no one. But this thing tore up more than real estate. It
also tore up lives _ among them, the lives of Mark and Dayle
Gruder.
</P>
<P>
   When the Gruders emerged from the rubble of their home, they
were thrilled to be alive and unhurt. But their house was a
shambles. Their cars were scrap metal. The rain drenched down on
them as they surveyed the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks now, the Gruders have been cheered by the
selfless support they've received from neighbors and people
involved in the rescue effort. But they've also had a look, close
up and personal, at the limitations of human institutions in
dealing with disasters like this. The sheer scope of this
catastrophe has meant that many tornado victims, like refugees in
war-torn Europe a half century ago, have essentially been on their
own as they struggle to dig out and rebuild and resume normal
lives.
</P>
<P>
   After the tornado ripped through, rescue workers hustled the
Gruders and other victims off the hill. Strange, jagged lightning
was shooting horizontally through the rain. The storm had ripped
off gas meters, creating vast leaks. A single lightning strike on
that high ground could have been murderous.
</P>
<P>
   In just the clothes they were wearing _ with no money, credit
cards or identification _ they made their way down the hill and to
the home of friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even have toothbrushes,'' Dayle Gruder told me.
``They were very kind to us. They fed us. They bought us
toothbrushes ... The next day, we had to go to a firehouse. They
would bus us back up to the house. I had to have my painkillers. I
was in agony ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Only two people could go to each house. I wasn't allowed to
reach, stretch, pull or pick up anything. So, we had a friend come
up to help, and they would not let the three of us go ...
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I was left behind in the firehouse ... the scanner was
going in the firehouse, and I'm sitting there by myself. And I hear
an officer on the scanner saying, `Oh, my God, there's a huge crowd
getting off. They let them all off the bus at once. We can't
control the crowd. The only thing we can do is shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, nobody got shot. Eventually, the Gruders got a $12,000
advance from their insurance company _ an out-of-state check that
took a week to clear. They found a furnished apartment and rented a
car.
</P>
<P>
   Their insurance policy calls for full replacement value of the
house, but the insurance company wants to knock off 15 percent for
depreciation. The precise figure they'll get to rebuild is still
under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado lasted only a few eyeblinks, but the Gruders have no
idea this nightmare will end for them. Dayle Gruder says that when
the new house is built and furnished, she'll videotape everything,
inside and out, and secure the tape and all the family papers in a
bank safe deposit box.
</P>
<P>
   And pray that no tornado hits that bank.

IN GUATEMALA, A BISHOP IS MARTYRED BUT HIS RESEARCH SURVIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Like millions of Guatemalans, Roman Catholic
Bishop Alvaro Ramazzini was stunned when fellow Bishop Juan Gerardi
was beaten to death just two days after he'd presented a major
report on human rights violations in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected this,'' Ramazzini said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the killing, however, nothing that has happened _ or not
happened _ has surprised Ramazzini. The death, deceit, corruption
and cover-up that characterized Guatemala's 36-year civil war did
not disappear with the 1996 signing of a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, personally, feel this crime (Gerardi's murder) will never
be cleared up,'' Ramazzini said earlier this month during a visit
to San Francisco. ``There is no political will to resolve it.''
</P>
<P>
   A low-profile, auxiliary bishop with an inner-city parish in
Guatemala City, Gerardi was attacked about 10 p.m. April 26 near
his garage. The assailant used a concrete block to smash his head
from behind, then dragged the 75-year-old priest into the garage
and obliterated his face with more beating.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop's wallet and ring were not taken.
</P>
<P>
   The founder of Guatemala's Archdiocesan Human Rights Office,
Gerardi launched a massive research project in 1995 to document
cases of human rights violations that occurred during the long and
bloody civil war. More than 6,500 eyewitness testimonies were
included in the report, which named and detailed the deaths of some
55,000 Guatemalan victims.
</P>
<P>
   Entitled ``Guatemala, Nunca Mas'' (``never again''), the report
blamed 80 percent of the 200,000 civil war deaths and
``disappearances'' on the Guatemalan military and paramilitary
groups that were backed by wealthy landowners. (Two percent of
landowners control 67 percent of arable land in Guatemala.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite wait-and-see stances by most authorities, including the
U.S. ambassador, there is no doubt in the minds of Gerardi's
colleagues and most Guatemalan people that the bishop was killed
because of the human rights report.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many powerful people in Guatemala who did not want
the report to come out and who do not want the peace process to
continue,'' Ramazzini said. ``This shows if they're capable of
killing a bishop, they're certainly willing to kill anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   A current disinformation campaign against the slain priest _ an
implication that perhaps he was a homosexual and his death a result
_ disgusts Ramazzini but, again, does not surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The claims are entirely false,'' he said, shaking his head.
``We interpret them as an intent to manipulate the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such accusations are akin to charges that, because the Catholic
Church is committed to social justice and human dignity, it is a
front for Communist activity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the killing of Gerardi and an investigation that
Ramazzini says has been inept, at best, the report now has a life
of its own. International human rights groups like the San
Francisco-based SHARE Foundation already are raising money to
publish a million copies of the four-volume report and to draw
worldwide attention to the bishop's death.
</P>
<P>
   SHARE spearheads a campaign to place a two-page ad, signed by
hundreds of U.S. religious and lay leaders, in the National
Catholic Reporter. Among other declarations, the ad calls ``upon
the United States government to press for a full, impartial
investigation'' into Gerardi's death and to declassify U.S.
government information about Guatemala's civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bishop Ramazzini: ``If we want to do a spiritual, internal
cleansing, we must bring all violations to light. Guatemalan
society has to face what we have lived. There cannot be a true
reconciliation until the guilty confess their sins, and the victims
can then have an opportunity to forgive them.''

UNLOCKING SOME MYSTERIES FOR `X-FILES' NEOPHYTES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Let's face it, these ``X-Files'' freaks are
scary people. They are such a collection of geeks and nerds,
wallowing in the minutiae of a television show that their presence
may almost be enough to keep you from checking out a movie that has
you curious.
</P>
<P>
   These ``X-Philes'' communicate in code, know the titles of all
the episodes, and have those encyclopedias so they can tell you
that Owen Lee Jarvis was hired by Susan Kryder to do yard work
after her husband was institutionalized and Jarvis must defend her
son Kevin against the Forces of Darkness in ``Revelations.''
</P>
<P>
   (I borrowed one called ``X-Files Confidential,'' published by
Little, Brown _ Jarvis is killed by Millennium Man and after he
dies his body smells like flowers.)
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to give anyone the heebie-jeebies. But why be
intimidated by some cult? This ``X-Files'' insider stuff is
actually pretty simple. Knowledge of a few key characters and
symbols from the television show is enough to enhance your
enjoyment of the movie while still allowing you to have a complete
life. And no matter what anyone tells you, it's all make believe.
</P>
<P>
   _ Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully: We'll start real simple
here. Mulder is the guy and Scully is the girl. They are FBI
agents, working on the X files, which deal with unexplained
phenomena. The files were burned up in the last TV episode. Mulder
and Scully want to go to bed but haven't so far. Mulder went to
Oxford and reads a lot of porn and watches adult videos. He
believes in UFOs. Scully has a medical degree, is an expert in
forensics and thinks science can explain everything. She's into
cleaning her gun. On to the esoterica.
</P>
<P>
   _ 10-13: Creator Chis Carter's birthday, it is also the last
four digits of Scully's cell phone number. It's bound to turn up
somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cigarette Smoking Man: Also known as Cancer Man, this dude
with the perpetual smoke aflame is part of a group of mystery men,
known as The Syndicate, who are plotting with aliens to take over
the world. Other Syndicate members include the Well-Manicured Man;
a German named Strughold who dabbles in eugenics; and the ageless
Dick Clark, part of the first alien-human crossbreeding experiment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Black Oil: The black oil virus carries the alien life form and
kills ordinary humans who don't have a little alien in them.
Members of the Syndicate also have developed a vaccine so they
don't get killed with everyone else, but chances are they won't
share it, even if you ask nicely.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corn and Bees: These are quick and easy carriers of the virus
and will likely make an appearance in the movie. Choice of these
vehicles for spreading the disease shows how stupid the aliens
really are, because if they really wanted to reach everyone, all
they would have to do is put the virus in boxes of Kraft Macaroni
and Cheese. They would own the world within a week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Lone Gunmen: Computer hackers who are heavy conspiracy
theorists and help Scully and Mulder whenever possible. They also
appear on the show so hard-core ``X-Philes'' have someone to
identify with. Dweeb City.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mulder's Relatives: His dad worked with Cigarette Man at the
beginning of the alien conspiracy back in '48 or whenever but
bailed out. Mulder's sister was abducted by aliens. Just another
dysfunctional American family.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scully's Crucifix: A little cross worn on a chain around her
neck meant to symbolize a guy from a couple thousand years ago who
could walk on water, was killed and came back to life after a few
days. Man, this sci-fi stuff can get out of hand. OK, save the
letters: The crucifix represents Scully's faith in God as opposed
to Mulder's seeming lack of same. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's lots more, like Mulder and Scully's boss Skinner,
who used to be Cigarette Man's stooge but now seems to be a
straight shooter, or the black helicopters, which symbolize the
shadow government. But this is more than enough. Just remember,
it's supposed to be fun.

CONSENSUS GROWS FOR NEW APPROACHES TO EDUCATION

 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen carefully, and you just might hear the walls of an
American monolith _ public education _ starting to crack.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, a national commission on educational
excellence released ``A Nation at Risk,'' a report that said our
schools were ``being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that
threatens our very future as a nation and a people.'' Now, the
system is being challenged _ from Milwaukee to San Antonio, from
Maine to California _ by radical reforms that are rapidly making
new alternatives a norm. The message to many school systems seems
clear: ``Change with us or prepare to die by attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, the kids are dying,'' says Howard Fuller, the former
superintendent of the Milwaukee public schools, and a strong
advocate of vouchers _ one of the most controversial funding tools
of change _ for low-income students. ``They are dying in reality,
and they are dying academically.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stark talk has begun to mute the long-heard argument that
any challenge to public education threatens the base of democracy
and that programs such as vouchers, which allow parents to take
funds that would be used to teach their children and seek
educational alternatives they like better, are pernicious policies
that help a few students at a high cost and leave many more
wallowing in a system stripped of funding.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levine, president of Teacher's College at Columbia
University, last week came out _ reluctantly, he said _ in support
of vouchers to help the poorest students in the nation's worst
schools that show no signs of improving. In Chicago, if a major
internal reform effort now underway proves ineffective, officials
may implement a voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   A rapidly growing alternative to vouchers is the charter school
movement, under which communities can create new schools with fewer
of the strictures of the traditional ones. In 1992, there was one
charter school in the country. In September, there will be more
than 900. In Massachusetts, 25 charter schools are open, and 25
more are awaiting approval.
</P>
<P>
   While vouchers have not been proposed in Boston, charter schools
have been spreading like wildfire here and elsewhere in the nation.
And each will take money that would have otherwise gone to the
established public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are not only turning to charter schools as a salvation,
educators are as well. Susan Jamback spent 15 years as a teacher
and seven as a principal and thought about speaking out against
charter schools when New Hampshire was debating whether to permit
them.
</P>
<P>
   School reform in and of itself, of course, is nothing new.
Throughout this century, ``sweeping'' reforms have been instituted
through regulation and edicts from governors, state legislators, or
local boards. But such reforms nearly always took place within the
existing system and, if not with its blessing, at least with its
qualified support.
</P>
<P>
   What often is happening now, however, is change from the bottom
up _ individuals so dissatisfied with the system as it is that they
are striking out to start new schools, or desperately trying to get
vouchers that enable the poor (the only ones who heretofore had no
choice) to have options beyond rickety neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vouchers are a way for poor parents to affect the system,''
says Fuller. ``To be frank about it, choice has never been an
issue, it has just been a a matter of who had the choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a new world,'' says Paul Peterson, a professor of
government at Harvard's Kennedy School and director of the program
on education policy and governance. ``How fast this will move is
another question. It may take 50 years for the system to
fundamentally change. It is a very large system, and there are a
lot of vested interests fighting to keep the staus quo. But once
civil rights leaders are on board, then it will all be over with.''
</P>
<P>
   When people talk of vested interests, layered bureaucracies,
they often mean teachers unions, which adamantly oppose vouchers.
But Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of
Teachers, says her group is not obstructionist and that teachers'
unions are a strong partner for reform in cities from Boston to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we have been an obstacle to vouchers,'' says Feldman.
``Vouchers are not reform, they are giving up on the public school
system.''
</P>
<P>
   That some critics have suggested giving up on public education
is a remarkable development, and frightening evidence of profound
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment to the education of the public, and the use of
government funds to pay for it, is as sacred a commitment as you
can get in this country,'' says Paul T. Hill, a University of
Washington education researcher, and coauthor of ``Reinventing
Public Education.''
</P>
<P>
   That commitment, coupled with an entrenched bureaucracy and
polling data that show many Americans concerned with educational
quality in schools other than their own, has traditionally left the
system unchallenged.
</P>
<P>
   But that is changing fast, for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, poor children frequently ended up in vocational
programs, trained to work in factories. If they dropped out of
school, that drew little response. But in a world where blue-collar
jobs are disappearing, a higher level of education is essential to
succeed, says Fuller, now an education professor at Marquette
University and director of the Institute for the Transformation of
Learning.

GOP VICTORY ON TOBACCO COULD BECOME ASHES IN THE FALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Democrats needed an issue that would enhance their
chances of winning back control of the US House in November, the
Republicans last week may have handed it to them on a silver ash
tray.
</P>
<P>
   After the GOP Senate leadership orchestrated the defeat of the
massive tobacco bill, key Senate Democrats immediately laid this
defeat at the feet of the GOP leadership and their partner, the
huge tobacco lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats can now claim that the GOP and the tobacco lobby
worked closely together to kill a bill that protects their own
self-interests at the expense of the interests of millions of
school children who might have benefited from the educational and
preventive aspects of the antismoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
   As some Democrats said afterward, the GOP's successful strategy
to kill the tobacco bill was a ``defining moment'' for both
Republicans and Democrats in terms of which party truly has the
best interests of families and children at heart.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic senators pointed out in a joint press
conference after the vote that the GOP leadership and key tobacco
lobbyists are popping champagne corks in celebration. But the
Democrats might also have cause for celebration in the fact that
the GOP now has given them an election issue that they can use.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties are fighting to win over public opinion
on this issue. The Republicans are saying that they killed, not an
effective antismoking bill, but a big tax bill that would have done
more harm than good to the American taxpayer. They did not mention
the fact that the bill included a major tax cut, which Sen. John
McCain, Republican of Arizona and a sponsor of the bill, pointed
out after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, including President Bill Clinton, are saying that
the GOP killed one of the most important bills ever crafted.
Clinton said of the bill, ``It may not be dead tomorrow. And it's
not dead over the long run because the public health need is great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never quit on anything this important in my life, and I
don't intend to stop now,'' he added, further warning the GOP that
it cannot assume that it's ``safe to walk away from the biggest
public health obligation that this country has today.''
</P>
<P>
   US Senator Edward M. Kennedy looked toward November when he said
``No power on earth _ not even the Republican leadership of the
Senate working in an unholy alliance with Big Tobacco _ can stop an
idea whose time has come. It may be that the final vote on this
legislation will occur on election day.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason why the Republicans killed the bill, as a few
Democrats pointed out, was to protect some GOP Senate members and,
if the bill had been sent to the lower chamber, some House members
who may have seen their vote against the bill used against them by
the electorate in their respective districts.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP is hoping to counter the Democrats portrayal of their
alliance with the tobacco lobby by announcing that the House would
file an antismoking bill that would be focused more directly on
teenage smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But, as House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, Democrat of
Missouri, suggested, that bill will likely be little more than a
piece of paper containing words such as: ``Don't Smoke.'' In other
words, any such bill that House Speaker Newt Gingrich offers would
be far more satisfying to the tobacco lobby than to parents who
want to keep cigarettes out of their children's mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Gingirch and other members of the House GOP leadership will try
to file antismoking legislation that would give the appearance of
sincerity, but the Democrats have already warned the electorate
that the real purpose will remain the same: to prevent any real
legislation that will hurt big tobacco and its GOP friends in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, while the GOP charged that the defeated tobacco bill
would have been too expensive for the industry, the tobacco
industry saw no problem in spending more than $50 million to run a
national ad campaign aimed at defeating the bill. And, based on
some reports, the industry is preparing to launch another ad
campaign aimed at keeping any true antismoking legislation from
getting passed this year.
</P>
<P>
   But this time the ad campaign, along with GOP efforts, to
prevent passage of such legislation, may backfire.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic strategists will have to effectively counter what
is expected to be a massive and expensive campaign blitz by big
tobacco in the coming months. Although Democrats will not have the
funds to launch a counter-campaign as expensive as the tobacco
lobby's, they will have one thing on their side that can cut
through any campaign built on a foundation of deception and ongoing
greed _ the truth.
</P>
<P>
   If the Democrats continue their almost daily, factual
explanations of why the GOP killed this legislation, the electorate
will clearly see who is more truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans who lost elections after spending millions on
campaigns this year found out, for example, that no amount of money
can disguise the true intentions of an ad campaign, whether it's
about a candidate or a tobacco bill. And the electorate will know
what party supports truth in packaging.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans fear and the Democrats hope, the voters in
November will know the difference.

 UNDATED: ... of Learning.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before ``A Nation at Risk,'' vast sums were pumped into
fixing the system, particularly in urban schools. More has been
funneled in since, often with little to show for it in better
learning and higher test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Consider figures from Eric Hanushek, an economist at the
University of Rochester who for 30 years has studied educational
policy and performance in schools. He says that between 1970 and
1997, spending adjusted for inflation on a per pupil basis rose by
91 percent and is now at a national average of $6,564 per pupil.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that it has bought us much in terms of
overall improvement or much improvement in terms of distribution,''
says Hanushek. ``There was some black-white improvement in the
'80s, but that seems to have stopped and may even be widening in
the '90s. And the narrowing of those attending college has
stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill says that rising frustration is being fed by what he calls
``the politics of hope. A new superintendent comes and says things
will change, but they lose the push or are discredited, or the
proposals are never bold enough to make a difference in the long
run. The result, especially among African-American parents and
leaders, is the sense that the system is not going to fix itself.
That is why there is as much support in the legislature for charter
schools, and business people are willing to fund vouchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Financier Theodore J. Forstmann, a senior partner at an
investment firm, and John Walton, an heir to the Wal-Mart fortune,
this month committed $100 million to poor students in five cities:
New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Jersey City, and Washington, D.C.
They hope that money will be matched by other business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the program, Forstmann said public schools had
become stagnant monopolies and needed competition to change.
</P>
<P>
   While the $100 million donation is the single largest ever for
vouchers, the most comprehensive private funding outlay for
vouchers will get underway later this year when $50 million will be
used to give every student in the Edgewood School District, a
predominantly poor and Hispanic district in San Antonio, vouchers
for a seat in another public school district or in a private
school. One state senator said the program ``declares war on public
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Peterson will monitor students who leave Edgewood,
those who stay, as well as students in three control districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we find no results, and if a series of studies come in like
that, it will slow the voucher process way down,'' says Peterson.
``But there are some signs from Milwaukee that are positive.''
</P>
<P>
   While vouchers have not been proposed in Boston, charter schools
have been spreading like wildfire here and elsewhere in the nation.
And each will take money that would have otherwise gone to the
established public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are not only turning to charter schools as a salvation;
educators are as well. Susan Jamback spent 15 years as a teacher
and seven as a principal and thought about speaking out against
charter schools when New Hampshire was debating whether to permit
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought schools could be changed from within, but I was
still in denial,'' says Jamback, now principal of the Chelmsford
Public Charter School. ``After many years of minor successes and
major frustrations, I finally decided it was a lost cause.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I now get to hire everyone. I always had a small group of
teachers I could work with, but never a whole school. I had to
spend too much time cajoling, training, defending, pushing, and the
payoff was not worth the time spent. Now, everyone can move,
comparatively, at lightning speed. I can hire people who are
trained or philosphically aligned and there are no more `Why are we
doing this' questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Educational issues are not the only player in the emerging
drama. Emotional ones are, too. Emotions run high over the
Milwaukee voucher program, as well as one in Cleveland, because
they are publicly funded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can take the amount of money spent on vouchers and put in
an all-day kindergarten program for every child,'' says Feldman.
And it is not simply money. There is a finite number of spaces in
private schools _ which educate about 10 percent of the nation's
students. With vouchers, many will be left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Even privately funded voucher programs can meet with resistance.
Two years ago, the mayor of Jersey City, N.J., presented a plan to
give some students tax-funded vouchers to attend private schools.
When the state blocked the plan, a local Pepsi distributor offered
to pick up some of the costs. The National Education Association
local organized a boycott, and the company changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   That voucher programs would take money out of the system to help
a few and leave the majority behind is something even some
reformers find unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sympathetic to the notion if you pull kids out of the
system, it gives them a chance to succeed, but you can't make the
argument that you want to save 100 kids by giving them vouchers and
then abandon the 4,000 left behind,'' says US Senator John Kerry,
the Massachusetts Democrat who last week broke from his party's
tradition of backing teachers' views by calling for the abolition
of seniority that serves to protect teachers who have become burned
out or are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry says he called for the end of tenure because of what he
has seen in 14 years in Washington. ``I watched the discussions of
education reform. I watched George Bush, and I have heard (Bill)
Clinton talk about it. But our kids still can't read, schools are
falling apart, and bureaucracies in many places are layered and
impenetrable.''
</P>
<P>
   While many public schools work well, Kerry said he could not
``sit here and watch another class of kids graduate'' from schools
that are dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for vouchers improved this month when Wisconsin's
highest court turned aside concerns over the separation of church
and state and ruled that Milwaukee could extend its voucher
program, which serves 1,500 poor students, beyond private schools
to religious ones.

<P>
   Regardless of when or if he is drafted, Jackson can rest assured
that he is a known talent throughout the NBA. McRae is working on
becoming the same. Enrolling at UTEP (which will leave the Western
Athletic Conference after next season), McRae will get an
opportunity to play twice against heralded point guard Andre Miller
of perennial WAC power Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention matchups against league foe Fresno State and
guard Chris Herren of Fall River, who was a teammate of McRae's on
the BABC squads. ``Going against two of the best guards in college
basketball, that gives me a chance to show the world I can play,''
McRae said, ``and if I can play well maybe that will open a few
scouts' eyes and maybe they will come look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   That could help distance him from allegations in Utah that
almost cost him any chance at fulfilling his dream.
</P>
<P>
   McRae was arrested April 19, 1996, on two charges of forcible
sexual abuse, one charge of burglary (both second-degree felonies)
and one charge of aggravated kidnapping (a first-degree felony).
</P>
<P>
   In the attempted burglary/forcible sexual abuse charge, a
19-year-old student at Dixie accused McRae of entering her room
uninvited, climbing into her bed, and fondling her before being
asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In the aggravated kidnapping/forcible sexual abuse charge, a
17-year-old high school student accused McRae of pulling her into a
room, detaining her, and fondling her before she demanded to be let
out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   McRae was held on $75,000 bail; bail was placed so high because
he once failed to appear in a Boston court on a cocaine possession
charge. He spent 13 days in a Utah jail and was able to post bail
after it was reduced to $10,000. McRae said his aunt put her home
up as collateral to bail him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really difficult, being so far from home, not close to
family and friends. That was the toughest thing about it,'' said
McRae. ``All along I knew one day, even if it wasn't the next day,
that the problem would resolve itself. I just prayed to God every
night one day it would work out and it did.''
</P>
<P>
   When the case against McRae went to trial Sept. 26, 1996, it
took several unusual twists. Defense attorney Mitchell Barker
requested to have Deputy Washington County Attorney Marlynn B.
Lema, the prosecutor, disqualified after he discovered he needed to
call her as a witness for the defense. Lema was asked to testify
about an April 19 taped interview she conducted with McRae during
his time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Lema said she told McRae she would
do everything possible to investigate the incident. The assertion
was not recorded on the interview tapes. Barker also asserted that
witnesses McRae said could clear him were not interviewed by the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Judge James Shumate to declare a mistrial and
disqualify prosecution from the case. The case was set for trial
twice afterward and canceled both times, then turned over to the
Attorney General's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that McRae plea-bargained to two counts of gross
lewdness (a first-degree misdemeanor). He was given 18 months
probation and sentenced to time served, and required to undergo
psycho-sexual counseling, to write a letter of apology to the
plaintiffs, and to send monthly letters to the court. Assistant
Utah Attorney General Paul Graf said both sides were satisfied with
the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McRae still insists the incidents in question never took
place, and added he only pleaded to misdemeanor charges because he
was no longer able to afford legal counsel (transcripts show
Mitchell had withdrawn from representing him for that reason).
</P>
<P>
   McRae asserts the charges were levied after he overheard his
accusers use racial slurs in conversations about athletes at the
school they were secretly having relations with.
</P>
<P>
   He said he informed the players about what was said, the players
confronted the women, and the women concocted the allegations
against McRae to get back at him. ``When they were in court, they
acted as if they never met each other, and they were best
friends,'' McRae said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened my eyes up as far as the friends I choose to keep my
company in. And it helped me grow up a lot and see the world for
what it is. It taught me that one minute everything can be going
nice and fine and rosy, and the next minute the whole world can be
caving in.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae said he hasn't undergone a court-ordered psychological
evaluation because he is still awaiting paperwork from the courts,
but he said he doesn't think it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing me stupid for counseling. Counseling for
what?'' he said. ``I don't even need any counseling. If this had
been anywhere else, it wouldn't have even gone to court. People
think I don't want to talk about it. But I'm willing to go on the
radio, or TV, because nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   When told about McRae's assertion that his accusers fabricated
both incidents looking for revenge, Graf said, ``This is new
information to me. The factual basis, as I understood it to be, was
him being in the bedroom and on the bed of one of the girls and
taking the other girl in the apartment and barring the door, not
letting her out. I have not heard the allegation you have made to
me, that this is a racially motivated type of situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had excellent legal counsel, and I think he would have
brought it to me. That was not mentioned.'' Graf said he would
investigate whether legal paperwork has been sent to McRae so he
could comply with the terms of the plea agreement. ``It's his
responsibility, but I will see if there is something I need to do
and take care of it,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   According to McRae, the cocaine charge is behind him. ``That was
a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time,'' he said,
adding that police broke up a party he was at and when one of those
present dropped some cocaine, everyone was taken in and charged.
</P>
<P>
   Tallahassee College coach Mike Gillespie said there were some
concerns about McRae's troubles at Dixie College and that the
school, which began its basketball program seven years ago,
conducted its own investigation before admitting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a lot of people, and everyone said Eggie probably
had not been guilty and a lot of the things that were being said
about him had not been done,'' Gillespie said. ``I think he was
ready to get back into school. He had been treated unfairly at
Dixie. He's a young man who needed an opportunity to prove he's a
good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McRae averaged 13 points and 9 assists a game, and
guided a 25-6 team that was ranked No. 1 among junior colleges for
most of the season before being upset in the state tournament.
``He's still a tremendous penetrator with the ball, he has great
upper body strength, and is a great leader,'' said Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McRae said had it not been for his legal troubles,
he probably would not have taken his college studies as seriously.
He says he now is on track to receive an associate's degree from
Tallahassee College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I have any regrets, although I wish that in high
school maybe I could have studied a little harder,'' said McRae.
``Maybe then I would have passed the SAT. But maybe this is a
blessing in disguise. My mom always told me if you take the harder
route good things happen. This is not the path I would have took
earlier, but I'm making the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and McRae spent Memorial Day weekend in sultry South
Florida, visiting friends who had moved there from the Boston area.
They have spent much of the offseason in summer school while
preparing to venture along The Path alone again. Jackson said the
pair's friendship will help them both along the way, no matter how
far they drift apart.
</P>
<P>
   McRae doesn't sound so certain. ``It's going to be hard,'' he
said. ``If I ever needed anything here, I could call on Ran and he
could call on me. I'm backing his decision, and I know we can talk
on the phone, but it's not the same as face to face.''

IS IT TIME FOR A BEANIE BABIES BAN?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   A wave of Beanie Baby-related crime is sweeping the nation. Week
after week, reports of new and shocking Beanie Baby criminal
activities come to light. And for every Beanie Baby crime that
makes the news, you can be sure that there are dozens, maybe even
hundreds, more that we never hear about.
</P>
<P>
   How long will this continue? Isn't it time we started talking
about banning the source of the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Last week two residents of Brunswick, Maine, _ one of them a
17-year-old girl _ were arrested and accused by police of
masterminding a heist of between 300 and 400 Beanie Babies,
according to an Associated Press report. They were caught trying to
unload the stolen Beanies in an Auburn store.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Ty (USA), releases only limited numbers of
each Beanie Baby, which are sold in stores for about $5. The
escalating prices of certain rare collectible Beanies have led to a
flourishing black market that drives the crime wave.
</P>
<P>
   A few Beanies fetch prices of up to $5,000 _ Peanut the Royal
Blue Elephant, Nana the Brown Monkey, Derby the Fine Mane Horse,
among others. Many have a resale value of more than $1,000 _ Bronty
the Brontosaurus, Chilly the Polar Bear, Flutter the Butterfly,
Humphrey the Camel, to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   Criminals will stop at nothing to get their hands on Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Nashua, N.H., couple were arrested recently for forging
$2,400 in checks to buy Beanie Babies. According to an AP report,
they told police they bought heroin with the money they made
reselling the Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   _ A registered sex offender in Grand Prairie, Texas, strewed his
parents' front lawn with Beanie Babies in an attempt to lure
children into the house, which is located across from an elementary
school, according to a May 29 report in The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   _ In April, robbers hit two Los Angeles store owners on the head
with metal pipes and stole a box of Beanies, along with $1,000 in
cash. ``I can't believe people would damage other people over a
beanbag,'' an unnamed store employee told a reporter from The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. These are a few of the most extreme Beanie
Baby-related crimes, but other incidences of thievery, duplicity,
and fraud abound.
</P>
<P>
   A store owner in Westminster, Calif., told The Los Angeles Times
she limits the number of Beanies each customer can buy to one or
two. But some people, she said, come back in disguise to buy more,
or bribe children to buy for them.
</P>
<P>
   Counterfeit Beanie Babies continue to proliferate, according to
Beanie World News, a glossy magazine that bills itself as
``America's Best Selling Beanie Baby Magazine,'' presumably to
distinguish it from all the others.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 52 cartons containing 8,596 fake Beanies from China _
with an approximate street value of $450,000 _ were seized by US
Customs at Chicago's O'Hare Airport. According to Beanie World, the
faux Beanies included ``Flash, Smoochy, Bruno, Snowball, Waves
Spike, Spooky, and Waddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Beanies, real and counterfeit, are being confiscated at the
Canadian border to try to stem the tide of fakes washing into the
United States. Cars are being searched. (Vacationers take note.)
Look for the prices of Maple the Canadian bear and Special Olympics
Maple the Canadian Bear to skyrocket as they become virtually
unavailable, the magazine advises, looking on the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   Is it time for a Beanie ban? I know what some of you are
thinking: If Beanie Babies are outlawed, only outlaws will have
Beanie Babies. Which might be just fine with some parents who are
getting sick of the things and all the hysteria that attends them.
Meanwhile, Beanie Baby crime marches on.

SHOWDOWN IN CONGRESS FOR GAMBLING OPPONENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is preparing to act on an array of
legislation that could dramatically alter the nation's booming
casino industry, as an antigambling coalition led by key
Republicans fights GOP leaders to eliminate tax breaks for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the antigambling movement will be tested in the
coming weeks. Congress is ready to consider proposals that would
kill a $3 billion annual tax break for gambling losses, make it
more difficult to build new Indian casinos, and prohibit gambling
on US-based Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Donald Trumps of this world are profiting handsomely from
this business,'' said Representative Patrick Kennedy, a Rhode
Island Democrat, referring to casino owners like the New York real
estate mogul.
</P>
<P>
   But the Trumps of the world _ including his counterparts in Las
Vegas _ are concerned that as Congress turns its attention away
from tobacco, gambling could be the next target.
</P>
<P>
   The antigambling movement is led by a group of religious
conservatives, notably the influential James Dobson of Focus on the
Family. Dobson is working with Republicans such as Senators Dan R.
Coats of Indiana and John Ashcroft of Missouri to enact bills
intended to slow the explosive growth of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the gambling industry has mobilized a massive
lobbying and fund-raising drive to influence the outcome of the
legislation. The industry quadrupled its political contributions in
1996 and hired former Republican Party chairman Frank Fahrenkopf as
its chief lobbyist.
</P>
<P>
   Fahrenkopf is the head of the American Gaming Association, which
represents most major commercial casinos but not the tribal
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Fahrenkopf said he became concerned that
there were no strings attached to the money that casinos were
contributing to campaigns. He instituted a requirement that
candidates listen to the lobbyists' message before getting the
donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were leaving Las Vegas without knowing a thing about our
industry,'' said Fahrenkopf, referring to candidates who came to
the gambling mecca for quick fund-raising trips. ``I said they have
to give us an hour and a half of time before a fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress have been happy to comply. Many
congressional leaders, including House minority leader Richard A.
Gephardt of Missouri and Senate majority leader Trent Lott of
Mississippi, visited Las Vegas recently and returned with large
campaign donations. All told, gambling interests delivered nearly
$4 million in unregulated ``soft money'' to the political parties
during the 1996 campaign and are on track to give a similar amount
this election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Casinos are hoping to see the payoff. They appear to be placing
their biggest bet on Lott, who last week helped kill tobacco
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, casino construction has exploded in
Lott's state, making Mississippi the third-largest source of casino
revenues, after Nevada and New Jersey, according to industry
officials. Lott flew aboard a jet owned by Mirage Resorts owner
Stephen A. Wynn to attend one of the fund-raisers put on by
Nevada's gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trent has been very helpful,'' said Senator Richard H. Bryan,
a Nevada Democrat who has led the way in protecting the casino
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Lott prevented a vote on a proposal to
eliminate the $3 billion deduction for gambling losses. Under
current tax law, gamblers can deduct losses from their winnings,
reducing their tax bills substantially. But Lott agreed to allow
backers to try attaching it to a different bill, perhaps as soon as
July.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott hopes to save the gambling deduction as he defeated the
tobacco bill, he could be in for a surprise. Some of his key
tobacco allies, including Ashcroft, have parted company when it
comes to gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would not be a tax hike,'' Ashcroft said about his
support for eliminating gambling loss deductions. ``This is the
elimination of a subsidy for something that is not a productive
enterprise.'' Ashcroft said a backlash against the growth of the
gambling industry in the last decade will lead to public support
for killing the subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders, meanwhile, are concerned about a Senate effort
to limit their ability to establish new casinos. Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt has proposed that his department be able to mediate
between a tribe and a governor when a state will not negotiate in
good faith on a tribal casino. Senate leaders have blocked
Babbitt's request for this authority, ``basically making it
possible for a state to just stall everything, and we have no
recourse,'' said Babbitt spokesman Michael Gauldin.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a group of California tribes that have been unable to
come to terms with Governor Pete Wilson came to Washington to lobby
Congress and the administration for the right to establish gambling
operations. Two tribes have hired Lanny Davis, who until earlier
this year was President Clinton's special counsel on the
campaign-finance investigation. Davis helped arrange delivery of a
letter from the tribes to Clinton. He also sat in on a meeting
between the tribes and members of Congress, as well as a session
with Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are also lobbying heavily for a measure introduced
last week by Rhode Island's Kennedy. Kennedy, the founder of the
congressional Native American Caucus, wants the Narragansett tribe
in his state to have the right to build a bingo hall.
</P>
<P>
   But Kennedy's support for the bill turned into a demonstration
of the power of antigambling forces. Rhode Island's two senators,
its second House member, and the governor quickly blasted Kennedy's
proposal and vowed to kill it. Kennedy, who has received more
campaign contributions from gambling interests than all but three
House members, acknowledges that the bill faces an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Many Rhode Island political leaders point to a 1978 agreement to
provide 1,800 acres to the tribe in exchange for the state's
keeping jurisdiction over the land. In 1994, Rhode Island voters
rejected a referendum that would have allowed the tribe to build a
casino. Then in 1996, Senator John Chafee, a Rhode Island
Republican, backed legislation that bars the tribe from operating a
gambling enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, arguing that Chafee's measure violates the tribe's
rights, is backing a bill that would repeal it. Chafee said
Kennedy's measure ``allows bureaucrats in Washington to make the
decision to expand gambling in our state, something we know our
citizens and voters oppose.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Kennedy said he personally opposes gambling.
But he said the Narragansett tribe, as a federally recognized
sovereign nation, should be allowed to operate a bingo hall that
would help lower the tribe's high unemployment rate. Moreover, he
noted that Rhode Island already profits from gambling revenues from
dog tracks, keno, and slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hypocritical for the leadership of Rhode Island to
say they are for denying the Narragansetts the very same revenues
that the state profits handsomely from,'' said Kennedy, whose
district does not include the tribal land.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy received $24,000 from gambling interests in this
election cycle as of June 1, according to the nonpartisan Center
for Responsive Politics. The three House members who received more
were Nevada's representatives _ Republicans John Ensign and Jim
Gibbons _ and Gephardt.
</P>
<P>
   Casino lobbyists, meanwhile, are urging Congress to ban Internet
gambling on the grounds that it is unregulated. But the lobbyists
acknowledge that casinos have another reason for opposing on-line
gaming. ``Competition, sure,'' said Roger Stone, a lobbyist for
Trump.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether Congress will act on any of these
issues before receiving a report from the Gambling Impact Study
Commission, which was established in 1996 and is not slated to
deliver a report until 1999. The commission includes casino
operators and casino critics such as Dobson, raising doubt whether
the panel can agree.

CHINA'S TV PLANS FOR CLINTON IRK US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares for this week's
summit in China, his advisers have been stung by threats from the
Beijing government not to broadcast his speeches live to an
audience of more than 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``technical difficulties,'' Chinese authorities have told
a White House advance team that it will be nearly impossible to
show several toasts and speeches live with simultaneous
translation.
</P>
<P>
   The US officials say the Chinese are making excuses. Taped,
delayed broadcasts will give President Jiang Zemin's government
time to edit Clinton's speeches, toning down or deleting any calls
for democratic openings and improvements in human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that it's a technical problem _ I mean, they
have television,'' said Stanley Roth, the assistant secretary of
state for Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The advance teams are still working on the final details of
several prickly topics, including Chinese sales of nuclear
technology to Pakistan and Iran, wording about the ballooning US
trade deficit with China, and sales of high-tech equipment to
Beijing. But for days, Jiang's representatives have been
intransigent on the subject of television coverage of the nine-day,
five-city visit, according to officials in the White House and the
State Department. Clinton is to arrive in China on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When they were assured anonymity, several of the officials
expressed irritation at the recent rounds of negotiations with the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might expect, the Chinese are completely paranoid and
neurotic about this,'' said an official familiar with the
discussions in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that the National Security Council, which
advises Clinton on foreign policy, has decided that soon after
arriving Clinton must make an unmistakable call for a democratic
opening in China. ``Sometimes when you're paranoid, there's a good
reason,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the Chinese are well aware that the Chinese
know Clinton will couch any criticisms in the soft phrases of
diplomacy. ``Clinton will keep his message subtle ... he's not
going to make a frontal assault on their system. He's not going to
say, `Your leaders are a bunch of Leninist thugs.'''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton will make about 15 public speeches during the
visit. The White House was initially interested in a ``town
meeting'' at Beijing University or another site, but that has been
scaled down to be a talk to students.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Americans, Chinese officials are planning to
broadcast excerpts from Clinton's remarks at the forum with
students at Beijing University and at other venues.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's government has not formally announced its decision about
broadcasting, and the US negotiators are reluctant to talk publicly
because they hope for last-minute concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls asking
for a comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are especially irked because in February 1989,
China had the know-how to broadcast a live nationwide speech by
President George Bush. It was the first time a foreign leader's
remarks had been shown live in China. Bush was given a spot in
prime time, just before broadcast of immensely popular Donald Duck
and Mickey Mouse cartoons in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials estimated that the 15-minute broadcast reached
an audience of 400 million people or more. Bush, who had lived in
Beijing, was seen as a friend of China. He and his secretary of
state, James A. Baker III, avoided public comments about human
rights during their two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased that we had negotiated a way for Bush to talk
directly to the Chinese people,'' said Winston Lord, who served as
US ambassador to China at the time. ``As I recall, that didn't
require a lot of heavy lifting'' on the part of US negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was a different era. The crackdown on
demonstrators at Tiananmen Square was four months away and the
controversy over China's contributions to American polical
campaigns had not started.
</P>
<P>
   By airing Clinton's remarks unedited, the Chinese would be
returning a courtesy, administration officials said. When Jiang
spoke at the White House, Harvard University and other sites at a
summit last fall, his speeches were broadcast to Americans,
sometimes on C-Span and sometimes on other channels.
</P>
<P>
   To Jiang's advisers, though, that was exactly the problem. They
were smarting when Clinton used a memorable phrase to reprimand
Jiang at a White House exchange, broadcast live: ``You are on the
wrong side of history,'' he said.

WILL WE ALWAYS HAVE A VENICE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The city known as ``La Serenissima'' has had a Jewish ghetto
since 1516, when the Venetian government set aside land for Jews
exiled from other countries. The word ``ghetto,'' in fact, comes
from the Italian word for metal casting: The site of the ghetto had
previously been home to a foundry.
</P>
<P>
   By 1650 there were 5,000 Jews in Venice. Now there are fewer
than 500, and only 20 or so live in the ghetto, where there are,
however, still five synagogues. The German Synagogue, dating from
1528, is the oldest, occupying the top floor of an apartment
building: No one could live above God, and there wasn't enough
space in the ghetto for a free-standing synagogue. The German
Synagogue's leaky roof has damaged its precious frescoes; the angle
of its floor makes the Leaning Tower of Pisa seem straight. Its
upkeep, and that of its sister synagogues, are a crushing
responsibility for the tiny Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Save Venice. Prompted by the cataclysmic floods of 1966, a
small group of concerned Bostonians led by Wellesley College art
historian John McAndrew and his wife, Betty, started the first of
the two dozen private international committees that work to rescue
Venice from the ravages of weather, time, and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Save Venice grew from a volunteer group raising
a few thousand dollars a year to a professionally run charity with
an annual budget hovering around $1 million and a New York branch
that is an altogether larger and more glamorous affair than its
older sister in Boston. The organization has learned sophisticated
marketing. There's even a new Venice Collection of home
furnishings, launched at Bloomingdale's this past winter. A
percentage of sales from the Venetian-inspired bed linens, lamps,
tableware, and furniture goes to the Save Venice cause.
</P>
<P>
   Save Venice's woman on the scene is Melissa Conn, a vivacious
young American art historian who works out of the organization's
office on the Grand Canal, just across from the Accademia, that
treasure-trove of Tintorettos, Titians, and Bellinis. Conn recently
led me through the city's baffling maze, to the Venice beyond the
pigeon-infested St. Mark's Square, where daytripping tourists begin
and end their visits, to the Venice of the dark, meandering
canal-side streets that John Singer Sargent loved to paint.
</P>
<P>
   She showed me some of Save Venice's completed projects and some
for the future. We saw the thundering equestrian statue of Orazio
Baglioni, the commander of the Venetian army who died defending the
city in 1617. Once gray with filth, the statue has now been
restored, its original gilding gleaming once again against the
darkness of the church of SS. Giovanni e Paolo. We saw a young
restorer, Toto Bergamo, cleaning marble reliefs in the church of S.
Francesco della Vigna, which is in a neighborhood too poor to
afford the work on its own. Using poultices and toothbrushes,
Bergamo will labor for the better part of a year to remove
centuries of soot left from candles. We saw the Scuola Grande di
San Marco, one of the greatest examples of early Renaissance
architecture in Europe, which currently has weeds growing out of
cracks in the marble facade and clunky glass and iron screens that
protect the exterior marble reliefs from soccer balls flying over
from the adjacent square. Venice is not an outdoor museum: People
live _ and play _ here.
</P>
<P>
   Restoration costs vary as widely as Save Venice's projects, from
the $5,000 the Boston chapter's Young Friends raised to restore
``Il Gobbo di Rialto,'' the much-loved 16th-century statue of a
hunchback that supports the pulpit where new laws were proclaimed,
to the $4 million that the organization as a whole raised to bring
Santa Maria dei Mira-coli back to glory. The Miracoli _ recently
and triumphantly reopened after a decade-long effort _ is Save
Venice's biggest project to date, and the only Italian church ever
completely restored, inside and out, in a single continuous
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Save Venice operates in one of the world's most surreal cities.
It's a place that holds a special fascination for Bostonians, in
part because Venice's Palazzo Barbaro, home to several generations
of the expatriate branch of Boston's Curtis clan, was the
inspiration for the museum that Isabella Stewart Gardner built on
the Fenway. Gardner was a guest at the Curtises' palazzo. So were
Sargent and Claude Monet, two of Boston's best-loved painters. So
was Henry James, who used it as a setting for ``The Wings of the
Dove.'' I was invited to sip peach juice with the current Curtis in
residence, Patricia, whose great-grandparents had bought the place
in 1872. Patricia Curtis, who grew up in Europe and has never been
to Boston, lives in splendor _ but worries about the endless upkeep
of a 15th-century palace that includes a library filled with gilded
furniture and leather-bound books, under a curved ceiling that is a
riot of plasterwork and frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Conn worries, too, and not only about the projects Save
Venice tackles. Over those she has some control. But there's the
huge issue of the future of the city itself. ``We could have a huge
onslaught of bus after bus in the year 2000, which the Pope has
declared a pilgrimage year,'' Conn says.
</P>
<P>
   One Italian minister fought for holding a millennial world's
fair, Expo 2000, in Venice. Preservationists fought back, arguing
that the influx of visitors would irreparably damage the city's
fragile fabric. They won _ the battle, not the war.
</P>
<P>
   Venice's champions are always coming up with schemes to control
tourism. One is to charge an entrance fee to the city itself,
treating it like a Colonial Williamsburg or a Disney theme park.
Venice hasn't gone out of its way to be accessible to tourists in
the past. Churches filled with art treasures used to have hours
that were erratic at best, at the whims of poorly paid caretakers
who tended to close them for three-hour lunches. Recently, many
churches have agreed to stay open from 10 to 5 _ and also to charge
admission of about $2.
</P>
<P>
   With the dwindling of their congregations, the churches are
acting more like museums. As for museums themselves, Venice's
greatest, the Accademia, which is stuffed with Tintorettos,
Veroneses, and Bellinis, used to be open only in the mornings. Now,
it's not only open in the afternoons, but until 10 most nights.
This means more tourists, mostly daytrippers coming by bus, since
there is no available land in the city to build more hotels. It
means more tourist money. It also means more wear and tear on frail
buildings. And that means more demands for help from Save Venice.
</P>
<P>
   While that help is urgently needed, the private committees can't
come across as high-handed foreigners. Save Venice works under the
supervision of Italian government agencies, and also under the
watchful eye of UNESCO. And it works discreetly. Except in the very
few cases when a project has been undertaken as a memorial to
someone, there are no plaques on Save Venice restorations.
</P>
<P>
   One of those exceptions is the current restoration of a painting
that has long been a mystery, the huge ``Supper at Emmaus'' in the
Church of San Salvador. Save Venice took on the project in memory
of Sydney Freedberg, the Boston-born art historian who became a
legend in his field during three decades of teaching at Harvard,
who was a leader in Save Venice, and who died last year. Authorship
of the painting has long been debated; some scholars argued that it
was a Giovanni Bellini. During its current cleaning, though,
restorers not only discovered a date of 1513 under the filth, they
also decided the painting was definitely by Carpaccio. The world of
Renaissance art is abuzz with this news. Freedberg, a super-sleuth
in attributing art, would have enjoyed sharing in this discovery.

BOB AND MARGARET ARRIVE, OH SO POLITELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
BOB AND MARGARET 
Created by: David Fine and Alison Snowden 
On: Comedy Central 
Time: Mondays at 10:30 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Bob &AMP; Margaret,'' the new animated series on Comedy Central,
is about as far from ``South Park'' as biscuits and tea are from
cheesy poofs. This droll slice of British life is the polite new
townhouse on TV's block of ``cartoons for adults,'' which already
includes ``King of the Hill,'' ``Dr. Katz: Professional
Therapist,'' ``Daria,'' and, of course, ``The Simpsons.'' It's a
slight but charming domestic comedy, one that milks affectionate
humor out of the quiet eccentricities of its ordinary middle-aged
characters, a London dentist and his podiatrist wife.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-episode series, on Comedy Central Monday nights at 10:30,
is based on the 1995 Oscar-winning short film ``Bob's Birthday.''
The creation of husband-and-wife team David Fine and Alison
Snowden, it covers familiar relationship territory with an
appealing modesty _ sort of like a marriage sitcom on the order of
``Mad About You'' but with a muted, laugh-track-free veneer. The
main characters don't display the edginess and directness so common
in American TV comedy, which may be why they have been designed
with long pink faces, round red noses, and hair like blobs of
soft-serve ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the kitcheny coziness of ``Bob &AMP; Margaret'' are the
couple's two very hungry dogs, who have a habit of stealing scenes
as they joyously beg, steal, lick, and sneak any morsel of human
food left unattended for a single moment. Bob doesn't especially
like the pooches, working their tails into a happy frenzy by saying
in an excited voice, ``Do you want to go to the vet and be put to
sleep?'' Margaret, on the other hand, is protective of her brood,
unaware that she's under heavy surveillance from the dogs during
her snack. One of the subtleties of ``Bob &AMP; Margaret'' is that
while the couple lead a reserved existence, their dogs flamboyantly
pursue their own appetites.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent source of the comedy on the show comes from pitting
the low-key, ambivalent Bob and Margaret against more aggressive
and predatory people. Tonight, Bob's practice is threatened when a
glitzy young dentist opens up shop across the street. Bob's
patients and his secretary are seduced by the new guy and pay him a
visit, and even Margaret, who has chipped her tooth on some dog
food, ends up in his shiny chair. In the third episode, which airs
July 6, Bob and Margaret go on a health kick and find themselves in
a game of badminton with a pushy and cheating woman, who finally
whacks her boyfriend unconscious with her racket. Compared to this
unbearable couple, Bob and Margaret's social awkwardness looks
almost lovable.

   Naturally, an animated series can offer its producers respite
from high star salaries. But animated shows also come with creative
advantages, as they are sometimes able to evoke more of human
nature than comedies featuring real actors. ``Dr. Katz:
Professional Therapist,'' which begins its fifth season tonight at
10 on Comedy Central, is one of the most enjoyable of them. It toys
masterfully with the line between comedy and psychosis, as
well-known comedians show up in animated form to undergo a session
with the good doctor. They deliver what resembles comedy routines,
but in the context of therapy, the routines sound quite different _
usually fairly bonkers. Tonight, cigarette-smoking man Denis Leary
shows up as a father who goes into a few scary tirades about the
stress of raising children. On ``Dr. Katz,'' the squiggly
characters pulsate with the sort of anxiety that Bob and Margaret
work hard to keep at bay.

 UNDATED: ... this discovery.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After its restoration, ``Supper at Emmaus'' will return to its
original position in the Contarini Chapel in San Salvador. Keeping
paintings and sculpture in the churches and palazzi for which they
were designed, in their original architectural settings, is part of
Save Venice's mission. That also means the art isn't pampered as it
is in a climate-controlled museum with state-of-the-art security.
But this is art that has _ or at least had _ a different meaning
and function than ``museum'' art. It's startling to see holes
circling the face of a madonna who is the central figure in an
altarpiece. The holes are for nails, to hang crowns and jewelry on
the painting in celebration of the Virgin's feast days. To the
celebrants, this madonna is part of a religious rite, not art for
art's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Most Save Venice projects have involved Roman Catholic churches,
because that's where most of the art is. But now Save Venice is
helping to save the Jewish ghetto. To many, ``Venice'' plus
``Jewish'' equals Shakespeare's Shylock, the greedy moneylender of
``The Merchant of Venice.'' Shakespeare's treatment of Shylock as
the ``other'' is actually helpful in understanding the sense of a
separate reality in Venice's ghetto. On the interior of its brick
wall is a series of powerful contemporary bronze reliefs by
Lithuanian artist Arbit Blatas, commemorating the Holocaust; the
wall is topped with barbed wire, to suggest the Nazi death camps.
Laundry lines stretch across the windows of the low- &QC; 
ceilinged apartments squashed under the German Synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venice is already strange,'' says Sandro Romanelli, the former
president of the Jewish Community, a position that's a holdover
from the days when the ghetto had its own internal government.
``You get to the ghetto and it's even stranger.'' Consider, for
instance, the Christian-style bas-reliefs of biblical stories in
the French synagogue. Because of the Jewish prohibition on graven
images, the stories are told without any people. The Red Sea parts
_ but Moses is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Romanelli thinks big. He plans to convert a large home for the
elderly, which is increasingly underpopulated as the number of Jews
in the ghetto declines, into a major cultural center. He also plans
to see the German synagogue restored. At the moment, the marble
floor of its oval-shaped central room tilts so dramatically that
were you on skates, you'd roll downhill. Venetian floors and walls
typically tilt at alarming angles; one reason is that canal
dredging, a periodic necessity, causes foundations to shift. ``My
living room is like this, too,'' says Conn. ``When I wash the
floor, the water slides to one end.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the 15th century, Nicolo di Pietro's 1408 painting
of the Madonna and Child had acquired a reputation for causing
miracles. So many Venetians made votive donations to it that there
was finally enough money to build a church around the painting. The
Church of the Miracoli, designed by the Lombardo family of
architects and sculptors and dedicated in 1488, is long, slim, and
vessel-like, as if it were about to float down the canal that
borders it. The Miracoli is clad, inside and out, in richly veined
marbles, in the colors of honey and champagne, rubies and emeralds.
But by the 20th century, the hues both delicate and dramatic were
muted by filth. And 19th-century restorers had made matters worse,
by putting cement between the marble and the brick core, which
attracted and held water, with its corroding salts. In the Save
Venice restoration, the marbles were removed, soaked in deionized
water to remove the salts, and reattached to the brick with metal
hooks that allow air to circulate. Metal hooks had been used in the
first place. ``A lot of what we do,'' says Conn, ``is correcting
19th-century restoration. The original is often better.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Miracoli glistens in the sun, the effect amplified by
its reflection in the canal. It looks more like an oversize jewel
casket or reliquary than a mere building. How to keep the Miracoli
sparkling is now the challenge. Pigeons, and their acid-laden
droppings, are an eternal problem. The Miracoli now sports hundreds
of ``pigeon spikes.'' Metal needles protruding from flat surfaces
to prevent pigeon-landings, they're virtually invisible, much less
conspicuous than the netting that is the usual alternative. And in
the canal beside the Miracoli, the poles that held up the
scaffolding during the restoration have intentionally been left in
place, to prevent gondoliers from pushing off the marble walls.
</P>
<P>
   In a quiet corner of the island of the Lido, with St. Mark's
Square a distant backdrop, is the Jewish cemetery, on a tract of
land the Venetian government ceded to the Jewish community in 1386.
The thousands buried here over the centuries have not been left to
rest in peace. Their tombstones were unceremoniously uprooted and
tossed aside during periods of war, foreign occupation, and road
building. The carved images on those stones are a surprising mix of
faces, feathers, crowns, masks, putti. All manner of images, both
Jewish and Christian, make an appearance, the iconography often
determined by the Jew's country of origin rather than the
proscriptions of faith.
</P>
<P>
   Great writers including Goethe and Shelley made pilgrimages to
this cemetery, whose mournful wildness perfectly suited the
temperament of Romantic-era writers. In 1834, the French author
George Sand threw a famous temper tantrum here, documented by poet
Alfred de Musset, who wrote that Sand ran ``jumping from tomb to
tomb,'' an indication that the stones were lying flat on the ground
rather than upright. Many of them still are.
</P>
<P>
   For most of this century, the cemetery has been neglected,
choked by spontaneous vegetation, including bamboo that grows in
the areas most in need of draining, the carving on the toppled
stones worn down by puddles left after rains. For the past 20
years, Cesare Vivante, a prominent member of Venice's Jewish
community, has worked to convince the world that the cemetery
urgently needs, and deserves, restoration. Thanks to Save Venice,
plus help from other charitable and government sources, his dream
is finally coming true. The restoration of the cemetery has an
estimated $400,000 price tag: Save Venice is contributing $60,000.
Even with the other contributions, though, there is still about
$80,000 left to raise.
</P>
<P>
   In a sunny spot in the adjacent ``new cemetery,'' where Jews
have been buried since the 18th century, Aldo Izzo, the former
Italian naval officer now in charge of maintaining both Jewish
cemeteries, has set up a ``lapidarium'' _ a hospital for
tombstones, where they wait their turn to be cleaned, consolidated,
and conserved, which costs around $1,100 per stone. Several
restored stones now stand proudly upright again, their carving
legible once more.
</P>
<P>
   All burial grounds are an issue in Venice. Space is so tight in
the city's main cemetery that the deceased get to stay underground
for only a few token years before being dug up and packed into
slots in cemetery walls. Foreigners buried in Venice are more
fortunate. Distinguished citizens of the world including
Stravinsky, Diaghilev, and Ezra Pound are permanently interred in a
separate foreigners' cemetery. John and Betty McAndrew are buried
there, too. And every November on All Saints' Day, Melissa Conn
lays flowers on their graves.

A CINEMATIC STORY IN BLACK AND WHIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
FREEDOMLAND 
By Richard Price. Broadway Books. 548 pp. $25. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As cinematic as artillery against a night sky, ``Freedomland''
is a big, blustery novel with a story at its center just as
incendiary. Set over the course of five summer days in the projects
of a black community near Newark, it crackles with a visual realism
and dialogue so pitch-perfect you can almost see the credits
rolling in a darkened theater. No big shocker there: Richard Price
is one of the few highly regarded American novelists to work
Hollywood and actually appear to like the place. Long appreciated
for the flinty, inner-city truths of such novels as ``The
Wanderers'' and ``Clockers,'' he's also been lauded for the
tough-boy screenplays (among them ``The Color of Money''). His
style is half dialogue coach, half urban anthropologist. Emile Zola
and Tom Wolfe are the guys on his literary corner, and what he
lacks in psychological depth or literary interiors, he provides in
sweep and street-smart authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   That savvy affection for veritas took Price to the headlines, to
the 1994 catastrophe of Susan Smith and her missing children in
South Carolina, for the subject matter of ``Freedomland'': A white
mother whose fabricated story about a black carjacker masks her own
role in her son's disappearance. Price must have figured that
incident for all it was worth, seeing within it the elements of
tragedy, betrayal, psychopathic hubris, a race card played and then
sullied beyond repair. By transplanting the rough outlines of the
Smith saga to a housing project in the urban Northeast, he has
brought a horrific tale into his own intimate milieu. The result is
a near-hallucinatory novel, replete with the palpable details of
24-hour police work, tabloid journalism, murderous summer nights,
and, worst of all, a mother whose mind seems to be breaking page by
page.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Martin is 32, a teaching aide in the Dempsy, N.J.,
projects who lives in the neighboring white working-class community
of Gannon. When the novel opens, she's stumbling through Dempsy at
9 p.m., her hands bloodied, oblivious to everything around her. At
the hospital emergency room, she tells her story through a haze of
shock and denial: Her car was stolen by a young black man, she
insists; she was thrown clear and injured; her 4-year-old son,
Cody, was in the back seat. Witness to this fractured testimony is
Lorenzo Council, a 47-year-old black detective for whom Dempsy's
day-to-day heartbreaks are a personal mission. He's arrogant,
gregarious, and compellingly human, a man with his own personal
turmoil who wants to save everybody else worth saving, or at least
give them a chance. Lorenzo quit drinking several years ago; since
then, he's had to rely on hope and his own volition to do his
consistently impossible job. And now he's got a white woman
unraveling on him, by turns copping to the minor sins of motherhood
or trying to escape into the netherworld of her CD headphones.
Whatever evil Brenda Martin may have committed, she hardly seems
capable now of anything more demanding than monstrous incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The other onlooker to this unwinding drama is Jesse Haus, a
young stringer for the Dempsy Register who has ``converted
journalism into a track and field event.'' Pumped up and ruthlessly
single-minded, Jesse lives for the deadline and the story for all
the usual vicarious reasons: If she can break the lock on Brenda's
precarious psyche, she'll gain access to a place most people
wouldn't go on a million-dollar dare. With Lorenzo propping up
Brenda in order to interrogate her, and Jesse offering the woman a
fake-benign protection from the rest of the media frenzy, the two
form a kind of ravaged contract both to guard and to break their
suspect-victim. Jesse wants an exclusive; Lorenzo wants to find a
child _ &UR;  &LR; or, barring that, solve a murder.
</P>
<P>
   That we suspect from the outset the fate of Cody Martin doesn't
really rob ``Freedomland'' of its punch. Instead, that knowledge
lends the novel a merciless inevitability, propelling it toward
Brenda's dissolution and the town of Dempsy's enraged comprehension
of her acts. Initially a barricade is set up in the projects to
isolate suspects, then a bogus arrest is made. Calling her rewrite
man every few hours, Jesse is becoming dangerously frenzied; nobody
has slept, and Lorenzo's so stooped over from asthma that the
reader can barely breathe. By the time a save-the-children group
shows up to accelerate the search, leading Brenda through the
grounds of an abandoned mental institition, the tension in
``Freedomland'' is so exquisitely rendered that any revelation _
even one of ineradicable darkness _ would come as a relief.
</P>
<P>
   You can feel the imprint of celluloid all over Price's novel:
That's the unstoppable power of it, and it's also responsible for
the book's limitations. This is a screen treatment set to text,
with brilliant depictions of Dempsy's residents, with crosscutting
that dances flawlessly from one dramatic cameo to the next. The
racial and class anxieties between the projects and the police,
between Dempsy and Gannon, are handled with depth and insight; it
is also refreshing to read a novel (particularly one written by a
white man) where you have to work to figure out a character's race,
rather than simply assuming he or she is white. But Price is so
agile (and fanatically detailed) at setting up scenes that the
shots themselves begin to feel endlessly repetitious: the first
third of the novel, for instance, takes place over a mere seven
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda herself, the sorrow-ridden antagonist who has almost
caused an entire city to burn, is delivered to us externally,
through Price's use of gesture and language. We begin to understand
her frailty and the horrendous consequences of her amorphous sense
of self through painstaking images _ Brenda disappearing into the
soulful world of her headphones, listening to her ``hit parade of
lamentation,'' Brenda chopping off her hair or writing Cody's name
across eight pages of a composition book. These are action clues so
exactingly creepy they render this broken woman with surprising
gravitas: We might not be able to bear what she may have done, but
we know with wrenching certainty who she is.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse's tough-girl reporter is hardly envisioned with such
complexity. She waffles between over-identification with her
subject and callous disregard; no reporter, no matter how
sentimental or ambitious, was ever so guilty of both traits
simultaneously. It's also hard to imagine that a cop would hand
over his chief suspect to a reporter for safe-keeping for hours on
end, regardless of how much Lorenzo and Jesse begrudgingly trust
each other. What does come through with intricate credibility is
the bizarre, shipwreck intimacy among all these players _ the
obsessional reality of a world constructed and shared over the loss
of a child.
</P>
<P>
   If Brenda Martin is the maelstrom of despair in ``Freedomland,''
Price has also given us the more far-reaching tragedy of Dempsy's
agonies _ the barricades nobody can see, built by racism and
poverty and still standing long after Brenda is gone. Poised for
trouble, hellbent on protecting Dempsy's residents from their own
fury, Lorenzo explains his devotion to a neighborhood activist: ``I
just want to keep people safe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Safe,'' his old friend counters, in what is possibly the
grimmest exchange in the book. ``Safe for what?''
</P>
<P>
   With its chillingly accurate dialogue, its comprehension of a
personal calamity and the mile-wide fallout, ``Freedomland''
manages to be outraged and tender at once. And the novel has a
moral center as certainly as Lorenzo has a calling. Hollywood may
have counseled Richard Price on how to see, but it surely hasn't
told him how to feel.

RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEATH OF KURT COBAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
WHO KILLED KURT COBAIN? 
The Mysterious Death of an Icon 
By Ian Halperin and Max Wallace 
Birch Lane Press, 214 pp., $19.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As you look at the jacket and title of Ian Halperin and Max
Wallace's book ``Who Killed Kurt Cobain?'' you may find yourself
perplexed: Aren't the victim and perpetrator one and the same?
Finish the book and you may not be so sure.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, Cobain _ the lead singer-guitarist-songwriter of
Nirvana _ died of what, officially, was ruled a self-inflicted
shotgun blast to the head. An autopsy revealed he had a lethal dose
of heroin in his system. He was found alone in his Seattle home.
Cobain had written a song called ``I Hate Myself and I Want to
Die.'' It appears that he tried to overdose earlier, on a European
tour. He was a heroin addict. He was unhappy with stardom, and
scorned those simplistic ``voice of a generation'' proclamations.
He had a volatile relationship with his wife, Courtney Love, of the
band Hole. His lyrics were full of fear and self-loathing.
</P>
<P>
   Add everything up and it seems to equal suicide. But Halperin
and Wallace, two Canadian journalists, assemble a patchwork of
evidence that suggests _ but does not state _ otherwise. As they
see it, there are tendrils of allegations and suspicions that lead
back to Cobain's widow, Love _ actress on the ascent, loose cannon
always. Not that she injected the heroin, put the shotgun in his
mouth, and pulled the trigger four years ago. No one alleges that.
But the authors do present a case that suggests Cobain's death
might have been in her best interest.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strange journey, and the boat of evidence has more than
a few holes in it. It's not helped by fairly pedestrian writing and
an inability to explain what made Cobain so important and Nirvana
so good.
</P>
<P>
   Halperin and Wallace use private investigator Tom Grant, whom
Love hired after Cobain's death, and Love's own father to raise
doubts. (Both also have a vested interest in the case.) They
unearth various friends and acquaintances of Cobain _ not all of
whom are exactly straight shooters _ who say that he was
contemplating a divorce; that she was bugging him about his will;
that she derided him as unable to do anything without her; that
she'd already put a wedge between him and his bandmates. When the
international news media came a-knocking after Cobain's death, she
used the opportunity to promote Hole's album ``Live Through This,''
with its posthumously chilling title. Her serial post-Cobain
romances did not suggest a widow in mourning.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, the authors are not waving an ``X-Files'' flag
of conspiracy. They're aware that the cast of characters alleging
foul play is not beyond reproach. There's Love's estranged father,
Harrison (who's roadied for, written about, and ticked off the
Grateful Dead), who details what he sees as Love's lying and
manipulative nature. There's the late El Duce, an obese
alcoholic-junkie-lead singer for the punk band the Mentors, who
claimed Love offered him $50,000 to off Cobain in the year
preceding Cobain's death. (This material is also in Nick
Broomfield's documentary film ``Kurt and Courtney,'' which opened
June 12, and serves as a visceral companion piece to the book.) El
Duce, since deceased, passed a lie detector test about the claim.
</P>
<P>
   More modestly, Halperin and Wallace are suggesting the police
investigation was hasty and cursory. When a spouse dies, the
surviving spouse often is under some degree of suspicion. Here,
Seattle police saw the gunshot wound and, it seems, pretty much
closed the case. Seattle's chief medical examiner was a former punk
rocker and old friend of Love's. The authors suggest he may have
``overlooked'' a finding that revealed Cobain had three times the
lethal amount of heroin in his system, an amount (both junkies and
pathologists agree in this book) that would likely make him
incapable of suicide by gunshot. To say nothing of putting away his
works and rolling down his shirtsleeve.
</P>
<P>
   The authors make four other allegations casting doubt on the
suicide verdict. There were no identifiable fingerprints on the
gun, the box of shells, or the pen used to write the suicide note,
they report. The note itself, they say, is vague enough to suggest
Cobain wanted a respite from the rock life, not death _ and four
lines of the note don't match the handwriting on the rest of it.
Three weeks before his death, they tell us, police were called to
Cobain's house, and he told them he was hiding from Love. And
finally, Cobain's credit card was used twice after his death, but
before the body was found.
</P>
<P>
   The authors set the stage with a biographical sketch of Cobain's
youth, followed by one of Love. Separately, they had in common a
semi-nomadic existence and an attraction to sex, drugs, and rock
'n' roll. Together, they shared all that and more. Cobain was,
however, a nicer guy, and certainly more the genuine artist. Love
comes off as a people-using, ladder-climbing, domineering,
groupie-cum-rock star. (This, of course, before she remade herself
as a movie star.) &UR;  &LR; Love declined to be interviewed for the book.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the authors do not offer, nor do they claim to have,
any evidence implicating Love or anyone else in foul play. This is
a book about suspicion, implication, possibility. &UR;  &LR; They &UR;  &LR; write that
their intent is, simply, to get the case reopened. It might prove
interesting if it were.

CHINA'S TV PLANS FOR CLINTON IRK US 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and w coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares for this week's
summit in China, his advisers have been stung by threats from the
Beijing government not to broadcast his speeches live to an
audience of more than 1 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   Citing ``technical difficulties,'' Chinese authorities have told
a White House advance team that it will be nearly impossible to
show several toasts and speeches live with simultaneous
translation.
</P>
<P>
   The US officials say the Chinese are making excuses. Taped,
delayed broadcasts will give President Jiang Zemin's government
time to edit Clinton's speeches, toning down or deleting any calls
for democratic openings and improvements in human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that it's a technical problem _ I mean, they
have television,'' said Stanley Roth, the assistant secretary of
state for Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The advance teams are still working on the final details of
several prickly topics, including Chinese sales of nuclear
technology to Pakistan and Iran, wording about the ballooning US
trade deficit with China, and sales of high-tech equipment to
Beijing. But for days, Jiang's representatives have been
intransigent on the subject of television coverage of the nine-day,
five-city visit, according to officials in the White House and the
State Department. Clinton is to arrive in China on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   When they were assured anonymity, several of the officials
expressed irritation at the recent rounds of negotiations with the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you might expect, the Chinese are completely paranoid and
neurotic about this,'' said an official familiar with the
discussions in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   The official added that the National Security Council, which
advises Clinton on foreign policy, has decided that soon after
arriving Clinton must make an unmistakable call for a democratic
opening in China. ``Sometimes when you're paranoid, there's a good
reason,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, the Chinese are well aware that the Chinese
know Clinton will couch any criticisms in the soft phrases of
diplomacy. ``Clinton will keep his message subtle ... he's not
going to make a frontal assault on their system. He's not going to
say, `Your leaders are a bunch of Leninist thugs.'''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Clinton will make about 15 public speeches during the
visit. The White House was initially interested in a ``town
meeting'' at Beijing University or another site, but that has been
scaled down to be a talk to students.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Americans, Chinese officials are planning to
broadcast excerpts from Clinton's remarks at the forum with
students at Beijing University and at other venues.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's government has not formally announced its decision about
broadcasting, and the US negotiators are reluctant to talk publicly
because they hope for last-minute concessions.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return calls asking
for a comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are especially irked because in February 1989,
China had the know-how to broadcast a live nationwide speech by
President George Bush. It was the first time a foreign leader's
remarks had been shown live in China. Bush was given a spot in
prime time, just before broadcast of immensely popular Donald Duck
and Mickey Mouse cartoons in Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials estimated that the 15-minute broadcast reached
an audience of 400 million people or more. Bush, who had lived in
Beijing, was seen as a friend of China. He and his secretary of
state, James A. Baker III, avoided public comments about human
rights during their two-day stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pleased that we had negotiated a way for Bush to talk
directly to the Chinese people,'' said Winston Lord, who served as
US ambassador to China at the time. ``As I recall, that didn't
require a lot of heavy lifting'' on the part of US negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, was a different era. The crackdown on
demonstrators at Tiananmen Square was four months away and the
controversy over China's contributions to American polical
campaigns had not started.
</P>
<P>
   By airing Clinton's remarks unedited, the Chinese would be
returning a courtesy, administration officials said. When Jiang
spoke at the White House, Harvard University and other sites at a
summit last fall, his speeches were broadcast to Americans,
sometimes on C-Span and sometimes on other channels.
</P>
<P>
   To Jiang's advisers, though, that was exactly the problem. They
were smarting when Clinton used a memorable phrase to reprimand
Jiang at a White House exchange, broadcast live: ``You are on the
wrong side of history,'' he said.

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !! ``Dream for an Insomniac''  Slight but sunnily diverting romance
played out among the staff and regulars in a family-owned
coffeehouse in San Francisco. MacKenzie Astin, Ione Skye, and
Jennifer Aniston keep the cappuccino foaming. (R)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! ``Hav Plenty''  &LR; Christopher Scott Cherot wants so badly for you
to like his first film, a lightweight comedy about the vagaries of
attraction, that that you almost feel sorry when it just doesn't
work. Even a standout performance by Tammi Jones, as a pushy
Francophile, can't pull this out of the fire. (R) (Renee Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! 1/2 ``High Art''  &LR; Invigorating, risk-taking film about SoHo
types trying to figure out how much of themselves to parcel out to
get what they want. Ally Sheedy is haunting, delivering the career
re-entry performance of the year as a talented but fragile
self-exiled photographer attracted to an ambitious careerist. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! 1/2 ``Mulan''  &LR; Disney, back in top form with a fresh treatment
of a Chinese legend about a girl who disguises herself as a male
soldier, empowering herself and saving her country. Although closer
to Disney formula than to Chinese culture, its theme of women's
self-determination will strike a universally popular chord.
``Mulan'' is Disney's best since `The Lion King.'' (G)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; (FU)!! 1/2 ``The Opposite of Sex''  &LR; This study of familial and
sexual dysfunction is rudely funny in its first half, draggy in its
second. But it's a wonderful showcase for Christina Ricci as an
icepick-tongued teenager, using scorching one-liners as weapons as
she invades the space of her gay brother, drolly played by Martin
Donovan. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; !!! &LR;  1/2 &UR; ``Testamento''  &LR; Lush, beautiful filmmaking. It's about the
life and loves of a wealthy Cape Verdean businessman (played with
panache by Nelson Xavier) and the effect his death has on several
townspeople, especially the young woman named sole heir to his
fortune. (Unrated) (Renee Graham)

 &UR; !!! &LR;   &UR; ``The X-Files: Fight the Future''  &LR; Typically, this
eagerly-awaited film, an offshoot of the hit television show, poses
twice as many questions as it answers. Still, the film, scripted by
series creator Chris Carter, succeeds in offering thrills for
longtime fans and newcomers as FBI agents Mulder and Scully get
knee-deep in all sorts of nasty covert doings. (PG-13) (Renee

 NEW YORK: ... personally invovled.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He thought briefly about singing, but he couldn't sing. Then he
thought of becoming a musician, but he didn't play an instrument.
Not deterred, he said, he tried to figure out what his strength
was, and how he could put that strength to work in the music world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was numbers. I was always very good at math,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado got together with some friends and started a social
club, appointing himself president. They began to organize
``waistline parties'' _ dances in basements of neighborhood
apartment buildings with live bands, where admission fees were
based on the size of the woman's waist. (The bigger the waist, the
more it cost.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Raffi was the one who stood at the door and did all the
measuring,'' recounted Jose ``Tuffy'' Sanchez, who helped organize
the dances and now works as RMM office manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have five bands going, and the place would sell out,''
Mercado said. ``I mean sell out. People would be waiting in line
around the block all night long.'' The shows averaged 1,500 in
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of money,'' Sanchez said. ``There was a real
void in entertainment for Puerto Ricans, and we filled it. That's
what Raffi has always done, see. He pays attention. When there's a
void, he steps in.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercado and Sanchez soon opened the 3 &AMP; 1 nightclub in Brooklyn,
hoping to expand their concert parties. According to Mercado and
Sanchez, people came by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, Mercado was in his early 20s, newly married to a
young Puerto Rican woman named Dolores, and their first child,
Debra, had made her appearance in the world. Another, Damaris, was
soon on the way. (Dolores passed away eight years ago; Mercado has
not re-married and has two adult children, Ralph III and Melissa,
by another woman.)
</P>
<P>
   Mercado worked as a delivery man for United Parcel Service
during this time, but his mother said that he told her he could not
envision himself punching a time clock for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, he took a job booking a nightclub called Cheetah, where
he discovered a little-known band called the Fania All-Stars. The
band, featuring pianist Eddie Palmieri, bassist Ray Baretto, and
singer Hector Lavoe, went on to become the trailblazers of the New
York salsa sound. (Salsa originated in New York City as a hybrid of
Cuban rhythms, big band orchestration, and American harmonies.)
</P>
<P>
   One year later, Mercado established his first company, Ralph
Mercado Management Inc., or RMM. Though his current company still
bears the same name, in the early days Mercado focused exclusively
on representing artists. He became known around New York for his
punctuality, organization, and ability to get artists paid well, a
rarity in those days.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Puente recalled those early days in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone took advantage of Latin musicians back then,'' he
said. ``As a promoter, Raffi was different. He respected us. ...
He's very efficient, very businesslike, and he's a man with ethics.
That was hard to find in a manager back then. Everybody who was
anybody went with Raffi.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, Mercado was the invisible conductor
behind the careers of dozens of Latin music's top artists,
including most of the nation's best-known Latin jazz artists, such
as Palmieri, pianist Hilton Ruiz, trumpeter Charlie Sepulveda,
flutist Nestor Torres, and percussionist Giovanni Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1987, Mercado said, he found himself increasingly
frustrated by the way major record labels in the United States
treated Latin musicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to getting major record labels to sign these
artists, forget it,'' Mercado said. ``They didn't think there was a
Latin market. Or if they did, they didn't understand how to treat
the artists.''
</P>
<P>
   So he started his own label, signing recording contracts with
many of the artists he had represented, but also branching out in
search of newer, younger, and glossier talent, a move that rattled
some of his longtime associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the people what they want,'' Mercado said.
``It doesn't mean today's music is worse. It's just very, very
different. In the old days, bands and musicians were where it was
at. Now it's singers, singers, singers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the new voices he discovered was Harlem-born salsa singer
Marc Anthony, who recently starred alongside Ruben Blades in Paul
Simon's Broadway musical, ``The Cape-man.'' Anthony also will
perform _ in English _ the theme music for Disney's upcoming
``Zorro'' feature film.
</P>
<P>
   RMM's newest roster additions include Michael Stuart, a
photogenic young Puerto Rican salsa singer, and Corrine, his female
counterpart. On the merengue front, RMM is banking on Manuel and
Grupo Mania; in salsa, it's hoping for big sales with new bachata
singer Henry Rosario.
</P>
<P>
   RMM also has begun to venture into the world of Rock en Espanol
and Latin House/Rap, with groups such as Limi-T XXI, Tres X, and
Vivanativa. But Mercado said he is most excited about Raul Paz, a
young Cuban singer he found performing at a nightclub in Paris.
With his romance-novel-hero looks and rich, versatile tenor voice,
Paz is the artist RMM will promote most heavily in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Money also is being poured into a new ``Fobidden Cuba'' series,
aimed at the Anglo audience currently buying Cuban recordings in
record numbers, and into RMM's new film division, RMM Filmworks.
Last year, RMM released its first film, a documentary on the
evolution of salsa, ``Yo Soy del Son a la Salsa,'' directed by
Cuban-born director Rigoberto Lopez. Mercado said that he has plans
for a feature film this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're growing in all kinds of directions,'' said Mercado.
``This is only the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no class you can take to learn to run a business like
RMM. There is no college that will teach you what we know.''
Pointing to his heart, he concluded, ``It's got to come from
here.''

VACCINES WON'T WIN WAR ON TICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Englanders and others who live in areas plagued by Lyme
disease have been eagerly anticipating the advent of a vaccine,
hoping perhaps to be able enjoy the woods and marshes again without
eternal vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Two vaccines are indeed on their way, but anyone who thinks
they'll put an end to Lyme disease anxiety is doomed to
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of
a vaccine made by SmithKline Beecham. Given as a series of three
shots over a year, it was 79 percent effective at preventing Lyme
disease in tests involving 10,936 people aged 15 to 70. The FDA
isn't bound by the panel's vote, but approval is considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Pasteur Merieux Connaught, is expected to
submit a similar vaccine with comparable efficacy _ tested in
10,305 people aged 18 to 92 _ to the FDA by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderful, of course, to have ``any new tools of
prevention,'' as Dr. David Dennis, coordinator of the Lyme disease
program at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   And in areas where Lyme disease is endemic, including many parts
of New England, a vaccine will ``make a real difference,'' agrees
Dr. Allen Steere, chief of rheumatology and immunology at New
England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the vaccines become available _ and SmithKline's
could be out in a few months _ you won't be able to ramble freely
in the boonies if you really want to avoid Lyme disease, which
strikes 12,000 to 16,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the studies so far have tested the SmithKline
vaccine in people between 15 and 70 and the Connaught vaccine in
people 18 to 92. Until research in children is completed, it's not
clear how well the vaccines will work in these groups. Nor is it
clear whether people with certain diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis, should get the vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Also, since the vaccine doesn't kill the tick itself _ just the
bacterium inside it _ you have to watch out for ticks anyway,
because the ticks that spread Lyme also carry other diseases like
babesiosis and ehrlichiosis.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember that it takes three shots given over
a year's span to get adequate protection. The SmithKline vaccine is
only 50 percent effective after two shots. This means you have to
start shots in advance; even if the vaccine is approved soon, you'd
have time for only two shots by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the way the vaccines work, the protection wears
off fast, which means you'll need shots every year. What happens is
that the vaccines stimulate your immune system to make antibodies
to a protein on the surface of the bacterium (Borrelia
burgdorferi), which lives in the tick's gut. When the tick takes a
drink of your blood, it sucks in these antibodies, which then kill
the bacteria inside the tick before they get in your blood stream.
Your immune system never encounters the whole bacterium, which
would give longer lasting immunity, so the immunity gets weaker
with time.
</P>
<P>
   If, despite vaccination, a bacterium does enter your body, it
substitutes another protein on its surface, against which the
vaccine would not work. So if the first line of defense fails, you
may still get infected.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors also worry that in people who already have a
chronic form of Lyme disease, getting vaccinated might make things
worse. ``I would be extremely cautious about (vaccinating) anyone
who thinks they had Lyme disease,'' says Dr. Sam Donta, a
specialist at Boston Medical Center and the Boston Veterans Affairs
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not always easy to tell who's been infected, because
some people do not have obvious symptoms. In fact, Lyme disease is
both often-missed and overreported. If you fail to notice the rash
that follows within a few days of a bite from an infected tick, the
symptoms that arise in the next few weeks _ fever, chills, headache
and fatigue _ might be mistaken for something else.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even if you decide to be vaccinated _ which
makes sense if you live in an endemic area, despite the
shortcomings _ you will still need to take precautions against
ticks, says Dr. Bela Matyas, medical director of epidemiology at
the Massachusetts Public Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that ``70 percent of people contract Lyme
disease in their own backyard,'' says David Weld, executive
director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation in Somers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That means that you'll have to stay vigilant _ all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PREVENTION IS THE KEY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mild winter and a wet spring mean this will be a banner year
for ticks, and the rate of new Lyme disease cases is already double
last year's. Here's how to protect yourself:
</P>
<P>
   _Learn to look for the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis, on your
skin or clothing after walking in fields or woods. The tick is most
likely to bite in the nymph stage, when it's a dark speck the size
of a poppy seed.
</P>
<P>
   _If you can't avoid areas where ticks thrive _ woods, marshy
areas, high grass, and bush _ wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants
tucked into socks, and closed-toe shoes. Light colors make it
easier to spot ticks on your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   _Spray clothes with insect repellant. Permethrin, the most
effective, kills ticks on contact, but it's very irritating, so
don't get it on your skin.
</P>
<P>
   _Standard repellants for use on skin contain DEET
(diethyltoluamide) and are also effective. High dose DEET may cause
nerve damage in rare cases, and more often can cause allergic
reactions. Avoid concentrations higher than 30-35 percent for
adults; 10-15 percent for children. Don't use it on your face and
wash your hands so it doesn't get into your eyes if you rub them.
And don't use it on kids under a year old.
</P>
<P>
   _When you get home from a tick-infested area, shower or bathe
and check yourself and your children carefully for ticks.
</P>
<P>
   _Remove ticks with tweezers within 24-48 hours. &UR;  &LR; Grab the tick
as close to the skin as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _If pets have been in tick-infested areas, check them, too, as
well as areas where they sit or lie.

GOING DEEPER INTO OUR PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Down into the lifeless, oxygen-free depths of the Black Sea, and
on the edge of the American continental shelf where the Hudson
River plunges into the deep ocean, explorers will deploy an array
of high-tech gear this week in search of history that has lain out
of reach for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   In the Black Sea, a team from Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution and MIT hopes to find evidence of harbors dating from
an era when the waters were hundreds of feet shallower, and perhaps
shipwrecks that could reveal ancient deep-water trading routes,
possibly the maritime equivalent of the old Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
   Off the coast of New York, an expedition led by oceanographer
Robert Ballard and archeologist Kevin McBride of the University of
Connecticut will search for signs of human settlements that may
predate any ever found on land on the East Coast, perhaps revealing
how and when this part of the continent was first settled _ maybe
as far back as the height of the last ice age, 18,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Coming close on the heels of stunning discoveries last year, the
searches represent the dawning of another era in archeology, a
dramatic advance made possible by oceanographic research tools,
including precisely-controllable robotic vehicles with electronic
cameras, and high-resolution sonar detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the most ambitious attempt so far to explore in
deep water for traces of humanity's distant past yielded an
astonishing trove of data. In just three weeks, a Mediterranean
expedition, led by Boston University archeologist Anna Marguerite
McCann and Ballard, discovered five Roman shipwrecks spanning
virtually the entire history of Roman maritime trade. These ships
lay as much as 2,800 feet deep on the ocean floor. Before then, no
ancient wreck had been found deeper than 300 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were so deep, the Roman ships' artifacts were
better preserved than any found in shallow water. At those depths,
McCann said, there is little of the activity that quickly destroys
shallower shipwrecks, including wind and wave action, devouring by
marine creatures, or looting by treasure hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deep sea's opened up'' for archeology, said McCann in an
interview last week. And it was last year's remarkably successful
Mediterannean research that proved the value of applying the
technologies of deep ocean exploration to the old and often
tradition-bound field of archeology, she said. ``It was a
breakthrough, a true beginning for marine archeology.''
</P>
<P>
   Her colleagues in the field were profoundly critical, McCann
said, when Ballard first offered back in 1989 to apply his team's
equipment and expertise to the untested idea of deep-water
archeology. They were skeptical because Ballard was not an
archeologist, because of his high public profile since his
discovery of the wreck of the Titanic, and because they thought
robotic deep-sea vehicles would be too clumsy to recover artifacts
without breaking them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ballard is not an archeologist,'' McCann conceded, ``but I'm
not an engineer or an oceanographer. The technology is here, and
there are treasure hunters using this and selling stuff. I thought,
`We've got to get into this.'''
</P>
<P>
   In weighing whether to go against her colleagues' advice and
join the expedition, said McCann, now 65, who already was
considered one of the nation's leading authorities on Roman-era
archeology, ``I thought, `Why not? I'm old, I don't have to worry
about tenure.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McCann has been recruited by Boston University,
which already has one of the nation's leading departments for
dry-land archeology, to create a program dedicated to underwater
archeology. What is needed now, according to both oceanographers
and archeologists who have participated in the pioneering
deep-water explorations, is a generation of graduate students who
will be trained from the start in both traditional archeology and
in the technology of deep marine exploration.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard sees himself as a kind of matchmaker in helping to bring
about the marriage of these two fields. &UR;  &LR; ``There's a new
opportunity here,'' he said last week, ``to bring together the
world of oceanography with the world of archeology, and to try to
create a new field of science.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the relatively shallow near-shore waters of the
continental shelf, up to a depth of about 200 feet, have been
explored by archeologists using scuba diving equipment for many
years. But deeper water, where only expensive submersibles,
submarines and remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs) can reach, had
never been examined by archeologists until McCann decided to sign
on as archeology director for Ballard's 1989 trip to Skerki Bank,
in the Mediterranean Sea near Sicily.
</P>
<P>
   That year, with thousands of schoolchildren watching through a
satellite link as part of Ballard's educational Jason Project, the
team discovered a Roman shipwreck they dubbed the Isis.
</P>
<P>
   It was eight years before they were able to take the second step
_ last year's return expedition to the area. This time, they had
some new tools: the Navy's NR-1 nuclear submarine to perform the
initial reconaissance and locate promising sites, and a
sophisticated array of sonar equipment and digital cameras added to
the Jason, the world's most precisely-controllable ROV. The
three-week trip yielded eight discoveries, five of them Roman ships
ranging in age from the first century BC to about 400 AD. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``What we did in the Mediterranean that had never been done
before &UR;  &LR; was to make quantitatively accurate maps of the site, to
allow all the information from that wreck site to be preserved,''
said Dana Yoerger, an oceanographer at Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution whose job includes guiding the ROVs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Many groups now have the capability to use these robotic
vehicles to take pictures of underwater sites, and to use computers
to create photomosaics of an entire site, but Woods Hole alone has
the ability to monitor the vehicle's position to within a half-inch
as it takes its pictures. The shapes and dimensions of objects in
its photomosaics can be measured with the precision that
archeologists achieve when they measure the position of every
artifact and plot it on maps of land sites. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Thanks to the precision of this data, McCann said, ``I think
the archeological community has been won over.''
</P>
<P>
   Being able to find ancient artifacts in such deep sites not only
opens up previously unreachable areas for research, it also allows
the mapping of trade routes that were previously unknown. It also
means that ancient wrecks will likely be found in a far better
state of preservation than those found in shallower water.
</P>
<P>
   Ballard, who last year left Woods Hole to head a new
organization called the Institute for Exploration, based in Mystic,
Conn., said it was the discovery of the Titanic that opened his
eyes to that potential. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``What really amazed me about the Titanic was the preservation
environment of the deep sea,'' he said. ``Ships that found their
way to the bottom in deep water were very different'' from those
near shore.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, near-shore wrecks are often rapidly buried under
accumulating sediments; in the deep sea, sediments build up at an
imperceptible rate of about a half-inch every thousand years, he
said. In addition, ships that sink near shore are often quickly
torn apart by the pounding surf; in deep water they may settle
gently to the bottom and remain undisturbed and virtually intact.
</P>
<P>
   He offers a vivid vivid illustration of that benign environment.
When the team returned to the Skerki Bank site, the imprint in the
mud of an amphora they had removed eight years earlier was still
clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   The preservation may be even better in the Black Sea, Ballard
said &UR; . &LR;  ``It is the largest body of water in the world with no
oxygen,'' he said, and without oxygen the marine organisms that
often devour all the exposed wood in a wrecked ship are unable to
survive there.
</P>
<P>
   David Mindell, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who will lead the Black Sea expedition, said the
explorers hope to find evidence of a trade route directly across
the sea through deep water. ``It would have been the maritime
equivalent of the Silk Road,'' he said. ``It would have been a
pretty significant shortcut, if you could make it work, between the
Mediterranean and Central Asia.'' Some ancient texts, he said,
suggest such a route was indeed used.
</P>
<P>
   Oceanographers have found that until about 7,000 years ago, the
Black Sea was a freshwater lake about 300 feet shallower than its
present level, and that it was flooded when the Mediterranean broke
through the Bosporus. That flooding, which may have buried ports in
areas that are now far offshore, is believed to have taken place
very rapidly, and some archeologists think it may have been the
origin of the Biblical story of the deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the site Ballard's group will explore this week off
Long Island was also high and dry for many millennia, and may hold
sites that were once hunting encampments on land. Until about
12,000 years ago, when most of what is now New England was buried
under a mile-thick sheet of ice, the continental shelf was exposed
and may have been occupied by the ancestors of native Americans.
Connecticut's Mashantuck and Pequot tribes are helping to finance
this week's reconnaissance mission, which will once again use the
Navy's NR-1 submarine, in hopes of learning about their distant
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time anyone has gone out in this region
thinking paleo-Indians,'' Ballard said.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for discoveries of ancient sites around the world
is enormous, as the new deep-water methods continue to be applied
in new places, McCann said. ``The technology is here,'' she said.
``This is new knowledge, a new opportunity, and we've got to get in
there make use of it.''

RACE: WHO PULLED THE TRIGGER? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ZACHARY R. DOWDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston juvenile public defender Bill Talley was irked as he read
and watched the news of six fatal schoolyard shootings over a
period of eight months by white youths in American hamlets.
</P>
<P>
   In news reports in the nation's top newspapers and magazines,
including The Washington Post, The New York Times, The Boston
Globe, the Chicago Tribune, the Los Angeles Times, and Newsweek,
Kip Kinkel, 15, the boy who allegedly killed his parents and two
classmates in a gun rampage in Oregon last month, was ``skinny,''
``slight,'' ``diminutive,'' or ``freckle-faced'' with an
``innocent'' look.
</P>
<P>
   Other white school assailants received the same treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Luke Woodham, convicted last week in Mississippi of killing two
students, was described by print and broadcast reporters as ``the
chubby, poor kid at Pearl High School who always seemed to get
picked on,'' a ``nerd,'' and ``intelligent but isolated.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Carneal, who allegedly killed three students in West
Paducah, Ky., was described as ``thin'' and ``a solid B student.''
Mitchell Johnson and Andrew Golden, who allegedly killed four girls
and a teacher in Jonesboro, Ark., were ``little boys.'' Andrew
Wurst, who allegedly killed a teacher in Edinboro, Pa., was a ``shy
and quirky eighth-grader with an offbeat sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob Davis, who allegedly killed a student in Fayetteville,
Tenn., was ``among the brightest and most promising that Lincoln
County High School had to offer.''
</P>
<P>
   These descriptions, Talley &UR;  &LR; say, contrast markedly with those
used in reports on African-American and Latino youth killers in big
cities like Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one's calling'' these white youth ``maggots or animals,''
said Talley, who defends many African-American and Latino youth in
court. ``Not that this coverage'' of Kinkel ``is bad, but the
question is: Why isn't the same type of language used when there
are black and Latino defendants?''
</P>
<P>
   Roxbury District Court Judge Milton Wright also saw sharp
differences from his courtoom in Boston. For example, a story on
the Kinkel shooting in Newsweek began this way: ``With his shy
smile and slight build, 15-year-old Kip Kinkel has an innocent look
that is part Huck Finn and part Alfred E. Neuman _ boyish and
quintessentially American.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Quintessentially American?'' Wright said. ``That always means
white.''
</P>
<P>
   Several media analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never is an African-American kid or a Latino kid described as
being an all-American kid,'' said Darnell Hawkins, a professor of
African-American studies and sociology at the University of
Illinois at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the references are symptomatic of how the news
media create vastly different images for young white criminals than
for youths of color.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts say the huge coverage of the school shootings,
which violate a place considered safe and almost sacred, is
appropriate. But they say the media often dress up violent white
youth even in cases where they were known for violent or cultish
behavior. Analysts say such coverage widens the racial divide by
depicting black and Latino youth murderers as inhuman while making
young white killers seem too small, too smart, or too
innocent-looking to have committed their acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is thinly veiled racial coding,'' said Franklin Gilliam,
a political scientist at the University of California at Los
Angeles. ``They might have said this is a normal kid, but to say
he's Huck Finn is a little much.''
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on the coverage of the schoolyard attacks, Julian
Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People, recently told the National Press Club: ``If this
were black kids doing this, you'd see op-ed pieces ... talking
about a pathology of violence loose in the community, about some
dangerous elements being unleashed, about the breakdown in family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   When violent crime in urban communities reached alarming peaks,
a 1992 Washington Post article referred to it as ``the pathology of
random violence that is decimating black youth across the
country.'' A 1991 article in The Atlantic Monthly said, ``The
emergence of predominantly black underclass neighborhoods rife with
the worse symptoms of social pathology has proved to be one of the
most disturbing developments in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Many news stories since then have discussed whether black
teenage killers are ``superpredators.'' News accounts of young
black murder suspects culled from a Nexis-Lexis search of youth
killing often describe them in court as ``blank-faced,'' ``dazed,''
or ``showing no emotion.'' Unlike the more human terms given the
white school killers, young black suspects often are not described
physically at all. Often, the first description of them is whether
the youth was in a gang.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Ralph Martin of Boston said many young black
suspects are ``seemingly sweet of countenance, and lacking in
obvious bravado.'' But Martin said he rarely sees black youth
described that way when their names make the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Ray Hammond, chairman of the Ten-Point Coalition, known
nationally for its work against juvenile crime, said the media do
not ``relate to Raheem,'' choosing a synonym for black youth. ``To
them, he's from another culture, another world ... someone who
slides down an inevitable path, one from which he cannot be
saved,'' Hammond said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, others said race is not a factor in the differing
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Polsby, a Northwestern University Law School professor who
comments on the media, Washington Post columnist James Glassman,
and Bill Kovach, director of the Nieman Foundation at Harvard
University, said the school shootings have a special shock value
because the crimes brutally revealed rural adolescent angst.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that a kid has taken weapons and slaughtered numbers
of people, that mass-murder aspect to it, is what takes everybody's
breath away,'' Kovach said.
</P>
<P>
   But Alvin Poussaint, a Harvard Medical School psychiatrist, and
Deborah Prothrow-Stith, a Harvard School of Public Health authority
on juvenile violence, have noticed big differences.
</P>
<P>
   Poussaint notes that while there is wide media discussion of
mood disorders and depression for the white teenage killers, he
said there is little of that for low-income African-American and
Latino youth killers who suffer at higher levels of the kind of
depression that precedes violence.
</P>
<P>
   Prothrow-Stith said that when journalists contact her for quotes
on the school shootings, they are more inclined to probe for
context than when the killers are African-American and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that as the violence gets closer and closer to
home, we as a society become less likely to talk about demons and
superpredators, like we did with the kids in urban communities,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   While there are no race-based studies on word descriptions of
youthful criminals, several studies have shown how the media
stereotypes black and white people.
</P>
<P>
   _Professor Robert Entman of North Carolina State University
found in a 1994 study of Chicago television news that blacks
suspected of violent crime are shown twice as much in the physical
grasp of police as whites suspected of violent crime. He also found
that white people, in a city that is half black, are portrayed as
Good Samaritans 13 times more often than black people.
</P>
<P>
   _In a 1997 study, Gilliam found that viewers of television news
often think criminals are black or Latino even when broadcasts show
no faces and make no mention of race.
</P>
<P>
   _In a 1997 study of 214 hours of local television news in
California by the Berkeley Media Studies Group, 55 percent of
stories on youth involved violence, though less than 1 percent of
youths are arrested for violent crimes. Black and Latino youths
were more than twice as likely as white youths to be interviewed
for stories on violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's in contrast to Caucasian kids in news stories, who
appear in a variety of roles,'' said Lori Dorfman, codirector of
the Studies Group.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Gilliam, is that the image of a white teenage
killer often does not register in the newsroom. Gilliam perceives
that even when young suspects of color have no prior record of
trouble, they are still described in less sympathetic terms. ``If
my predisposition is that white kids are good, and one goes bad, I
don't blame all whites or all kids,'' Gilliam said. ``But an act by
a black kid is perceived as having implications for the entire
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Entman and Daniel Romer of the University of Pennsylvania say
the media need to examine how it describes youth. They say that
using Huck Finn or Alfred E. Neuman to describe violent white youth
is questionable, since there are no black icons of lovable rascals
seared into the nation's consciousness. ``A black kid wouldn't get
that kind of language,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilliam said reporters should also avoid racial coding. In a
national Nexis-Lexis search of news stories, no school shootings
were associated with any ``pathology.'' Despite the horror of their
crimes, no story linked Kinkel, Woodham, Carneal, Johnson, Golden,
Wurst, or Davis with the term ``superpredator.''
</P>
<P>
   In his National Press Club speech, Bond said it is time that
America recognized factors behind youth violence that cut across
race and class. ``It seems to me there's kind of a pathology out
there, some kind of love of guns, a gun culture out there that's
dangerous and insidious,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, people like Hammond are waiting to see if the
coverage will result in the Kip Kinkels and Luke Woodhams being
seen as individual problems that white America can separate itself
from, or if it helps to ring a national alarm over how too many
youth of all colors use guns to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be interesting to see where it goes from here,''
Hammond said. ``Black kids have long been canaries in the coal
mine, but no one wanted to look down where the black canaries were.
We were invisible. Now that the canaries are visible, and next
door, they are not so easy to ignore.''

BLOSSOMING OF BLOOMSDAY IS QUESTIONED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ Ah, Bloomsday. Or is it Bloomsweek?
</P>
<P>
   Bloomsday is a Dublin tradition, celebrated by a dedicated group
of literature lovers who dress up as characters from James Joyce's
epic novel, ``Ulysses,'' which recounts in minute detail a day in
the life _ June 16, 1904 _ of the protagonist, Leopold Bloom.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd dressed in Edwardian period costume gathers for
breakfast in the seaside village of Sandycove, then saunters up to
the James Joyce Center in the Martello tower. Joyce lived briefly
in the tower. The crowd then retraces Bloom's steps up the
Sandymount Strand and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   There are many readings. And Bloomsday would not be complete
without the obligatory lunch at Davy Byrne's pub.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing year, however, Bloomsday gets bigger, if not
necessarily better. This year marked the biggest-ever celebration,
with a worldwide Internet reading.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Dublin, Bloomsday has blossomed into Bloomsweek, a
six-day festival complete with corporate sponsors. More coffee mugs
and T-shirts bearing Joyce's image are sold than copies of his
confusing, brilliant book. At the end of it all, one might be
forgiven for assuming that Joyce's masterpiece was underwritten by
the Guinness Co.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a half century after this quaint tradition began, some
Dubliners, and especially some of Ireland's literary giants, are
beginning to ask, is it still quaint, or has it become just another
tourist attraction sullied by crass commercialism?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The celebration of Bloomsday is traced to 1954, when a group of
writers led by Patrick Kavanagh and Flann O'Brien used horse-drawn
carriages to retrace Bloom's steps. It was, truth be told, a
glorified pub crawl, even if the intentions were sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Cronin, the poet and biographer who took part in that
initial pilgrimage, says the early celebrations were noble
commemorations held to honor a great Irish writer who lived in
exile in Paris and whose works were banned in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But Cronin, whose book ``Dead as Doornails'' chronicles the
hard-drinking Dublin literary scene that ended with Brendan Behan's
death in 1964, is among a growing list of writers who believe
Bloomsday is blooming out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Seamus Heaney, the Nobel laureate who has a house on Sandymount
Strand, says Joyce would not like Bloomsday. But Heaney is wary of
those who would censor the celebrations. As he told the Sunday
Times, Heaney said it is important to draw a distinction between
Joyce the citizen and Joyce the writer: The former belongs to
everyone, the latter to those who have read and appreciate his
work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
--- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A very unscientific survey of the families and children enjoying
the Bloomsday celebrations in Peoples' Park in Dun Laoghaire found
that few _ actually, none _ had read Ulysses. But the children
loved the period costumes, the singer, and the antique cars.
</P>
<P>
   David Norris is Ireland's first, and only, openly gay
politician. He is also the driving force behind what has become
Bloomsweek. A Joycean scholar, he is unapologetic about getting
Joyce to the masses, and is scornful of what he considers the elite
who dismiss Bloomsday as having become too common.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent Trinity College graduates dinner in London, Norris
had a bunch of stuffed shirts laughing at Joycean quips. He says
humanizing Joyce gets many people who never read Joyce, and even
those who did so out of obligation, to go back and discover this
remarkable artist.
</P>
<P>
   But what about those who say Bloomsday has become tawdry?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all old farts,'' Norris said.

   As marketing pitches go, it might sound more alarming than
alluring, but BankBoston can promise you an electrifying experience
if you use their newest automated teller machines _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, the bank, which operates New England's
largest network of ATMs, has joined dozens of other financial
institutions in installing touch-screen computer systems. These
allow people to choose the amount of cash they want to take out or
select other transactions by touching the glass computer screen
directly, instead of using a keypad.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-dozen basic types of touch-screen computer
technologies are in use today. BankBoston, which has switched over
about 400 of its 1,507 ATM locations to touch screens, uses a
unique ``capacitive'' technology made by a Methuen, Mass. company,
MicroTouch Systems Inc., in which the ATM customer draws
electricity from the screen to enter numbers and transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get nervous. It's less electricity than you would get from
picking up a tiny AAA battery, and you are putting yourself at no
risk if you go get $50 when it's raining. But it does mean you have
to take your gloves off, or the machine will not respond.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the system, which runs about $35,000 per
machine, are four wires that feed from each corner into an
invisible conductive mesh under the screen. When your finger makes
contact with the glass, within less than 1/100th of a second it
will draw slightly more electricity from the corner closest to
where you are touching, and progressively less from the corners
farther away. In effect, your fingertip is acting as a
``capacitor,'' something that draws electric current.
</P>
<P>
   By sensing how much electricity is being drawn from each corner,
the ATM's computer figures out where you are touching. It
correlates that to what is being shown on the screen, the way a
computer determines where a mouse click is aimed on a screen.
</P>
<P>
   Then it registers that you have touched the number 5, or
``transfer from checking to savings,'' or whatever other option is
being displayed. It also makes a beep and causes the relevant icon
to flash to show you it sensed you made contact.
</P>
<P>
   One big appeal of the system is that it allows ATMs to handle a
much larger range of transactions than the standard four
transaction keys. It also reduces the number of screens you need to
flip through to get to the transaction you want. That's because
instead of showing only three possible transactions at a time, plus
a button to summon the next three, it could display a dozen or more
possible transactions on a single screen.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction for the bank is that the machines _ which on
average are used by more than 200 people a day _ are less prone to
breakdowns. ``Our field service personnel are big fans of things
without moving parts,'' says Stephen R. DeMay, a BankBoston product
manager at its Waltham consumer banking headquarters. ``Anything
that can break down, will.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, touch-screen ATMs could be used to sell a wide
range of products, such as MBTA bus and subway passes, prepaid
telephone calling cards, or concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Or a bank could let you use ATMs to pay utility bills or get
current stock quotes (a service CitiBank has made available at some
machines in Manhattan). Many BankBoston ATMs already offer postage
stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network will evolve to offer different things at different
places,'' says Randy Gearhart, BankBoston's director of global
consumer marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Other types of touch-screen systems are in use at such places as
tourist information kiosks, museums, and restaurant cashier desks,
including:
</P>
<P>
   _Acoustic and infrared systems that project waves over or
through the surface of the screen in two directions. When your
finger breaks a wave by touching the screen, the computer
calculates where your finger is and correlates it to what the
screen shows. One drawback, according to MicroTouch marketing
manager Alice D. Moran, is that these systems can often register
``false touches'' or get confused by water droplets or cleaning
solvent residue on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   _Resistive systems in which, put most simply, your finger or a
pen-like device completes a circuit on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   _Strain gauge systems in which the screen is mounted on what are
essentially very sensitive springs. Your finger's pressure actually
pushes the screen inward, and the strain gauge calculates from the
tilt where you are touching.
</P>
<P>
   One feature of the BankBoston machines is a ``privacy screen''
that makes the screen unreadable to someone standing outside a
60-degree arc fromto the center of the screen. This feature is
designed to thwart snoopers from figuring out your secret ATM
number, or reading your massive reserve credit balance you owe.

ODE TO OLD MAN ON THE MOUNTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANTRY, Ireland _ Each day, the old man moves across his small
piece of the island, looking west toward the child who gives him
strength. Her name is Katie Driscoll. She is 13, the old gent's
great-niece, and she lives in Arlington, Mass., where she wrote
this past school year about what Danny O'Driscoll, 85, means to
her. Here, on Father's Day, is a portion of that essay:
</P>
<P>
   ``On Muntivera peninsula in Southwest Ireland stands a rugged,
wind-battered mountain, steeply rising in waves of rock-ribbed
ridges and bog-filled hollows. It is a harsh, wild hill smothered
in tangles of heather and gorse, wildflowers and ivy, and scattered
with surprise waterfalls. Etched into this hill is a farm that
gazes into the deep rippling waters of Bantry Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It includes a stone, slate-roofed farmhouse, an open-walled
barn where kittens frolic through fresh hay in search of mice, and
a stone shed where calves are raised. It is here you see
85-year-old Daniel O'Driscoll herding sheep up the mountain with
his faithful dog, Teddy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny, my great-uncle, grew up on this farm with three
brothers and two sisters, the oldest being my grandfather. His
brothers and sisters immigrated to England and America to find work
and raise their families. Danny and his younger brother, Christy,
worked the farm together until Christy's death in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the beginning of a controversy within the family that
continues today. Some felt Danny should be in the rest home in
nearby Clonakilty; ``He'll die on the mountain,'' they say. At 85
years, he is completely stooped over, in danger of falling
unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to die on the mountain than in Clonakilty,'' insists
Danny. He has refused to leave his farm. Instead, my family has
joined him for one month each summer to keep his way of life going.
Caring for our elderly uncle has come to be supporting a way of
life that reaches far into the past, even beyond his 85 years. My
uncle didn't change with the times; he has steadfastly kept to the
old and ancient ways about the farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, Danny leads us through an overgrown,
rainforest-like path of ferns, leaves, and sub-tropical growth
until we reach a field thick with fresh-cut hay. Danny brings out
the hand-crafted rakes and hand-forged pitchforks, tools for the
art of making `caulks' of hay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend the entire day beneath the beating summer sun, raking
and turning the hay, gathering it and pitching it into high piles
with Danny demonstrating how to transform a pile of loose hay into
a tight, waterproof haystack, perfectly proportioned. On most
farms, machines are used to gather, bale, and stack hay, but on
Danny's farm we do all the work by hand. He insists on the old
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny expects us to do the work right and when truly
frustrated with our unknowing ways, he exclaims, `Will o' God! Have
ye not a spark o' sense?' We all have come to enjoy Danny's lively
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mountain is alive with stories from the past, and Danny
weaves the age-old expressions and stories into every task we share
with him. Neighbors also stop by, telling news and stories with
sharp bits of wit and wisdom, building on tales from past
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experiences with Danny O'Driscoll relate to having respect
for the old, and the thoughts and feelings of people who are old.
How we treat the elderly is an important concern. What is best for
the aging seems to be different for each person. What they think is
best for their lives might be what they should do, although they
might make a poor decision for their body's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is more important: What the old want or what the old
need? Maybe ``dying on the mountain'' is what one needs if the
mountain is where the memories, stories, and life are; if a
mountain is where one chooses to find peace, then let it be.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Muntivera peninsula, there is a farm, a symbol of beauty, a
place where the lush green countryside stretches into the sparkle
of the sea. On this farm lives the stooped and aged Daniel
O'Driscoll, whose body is weakening but whose soul is alive, living
where he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's where he was yesterday; walking slowly through the
mist, waiting for a big part of his life, a 13-year-old, to return
from America.

HERE'S WHERE INEFFICIENCY PAYS OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you're tempted to smirk at the waddling hips and
exaggerated elbows of your neighborhood racewalker, consider this:
He's burning more calories than a runner going the same pace, and
is less likely to get hurt doing it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare instance where inefficiency is a plus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly counterintuitive to most people when I tell
them I'm going to teach them an inefficient activity that is the
best workout they could ever imagine,'' acknowledges Mark Fenton,
editor-at-large of Walking magazine who studied biomechanics at
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent survey by the Sporting Goods Manufacturers
Association, 33.2 million Americans walk recreationally or
informally for exercise, while 32.3 million run or jog. Yet,
although untold thousands use at least some racewalking techniques
in their fitness walking, only about 5,000 people actually compete
in racewalking events.
</P>
<P>
   If all &UR;  &LR; those runners want to spend less time on the disabled
list while staying in shape, they might want to rethink their
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very commonly with my runners I see with injuries, I tell them
to racewalk,'' says Dr. Gary N. Guten, an orthopedic surgeon and
director of the Sports Medicine and Orthopedic Center in Milwaukee.
``You get the most rewards with the least risks.''
</P>
<P>
   So why don't more people do it? In part, says Guten _ also the
author of ``Play Healthy, Stay Healthy'' _ because it takes time to
learn the technique, in which one foot must be in contact with the
ground at all times, the knee of the back leg must be straightened
with each step and the arms swing like a short pendulum at a
90-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the sociability factor: Because so many more people
run than racewalk, you can always find plenty of companions.
</P>
<P>
   Jay T. Kearney, senior sports physiologist for the United States
Olympic Committee in Colorado Springs, has another thought:
``Because it looks goofy.''
</P>
<P>
   But let's get back to the rewards.
</P>
<P>
   In a study at the University of Colorado in Boulder, 82 people
were randomly assigned to 28-week programs of step aerobics,
running or racewalking. Each exercised for 40 minutes, four days a
week, at 80 percent of their maximum heart rate. After 28 weeks,
although each group showed similar improvements in cardiovascular
fitness, 16.7 percent of the runners had dropped out because of
injury, while no racewalkers had to quit. Overall, runners missed
an average of 11 days because of injury, while racewalkers missed 1
1/2 days. Other studies have echoed that finding.
</P>
<P>
   Morever, says William Byrnes, an associate professor in the
Department of Kinesiology and author of the study, ``People seem to
get injured in running, then go to racewalking and don't experience
injury.''
</P>
<P>
   That's mostly because of the lessened impact. ``You don't leave
the ground, ever,'' says Fenton, who has coached the US national
racewalking team. ``The runner leaves the ground with every step.''
</P>
<P>
   In racewalking, because at least one foot is always on the
ground, the force of impact is only about 1 1/2 times the person's
body weight, and as technique improves, that becomes even less. In
running, the impact is three times body weight, if not more. In
other words, a 140-pound racewalker hits the ground with no more
than 210 pounds of force on each step, while a 140-pound runner
slams it with 423 pounds. With the higher impact come more acute
injuries, especially to the knee.
</P>
<P>
   Although appearances would hint otherwise, racewalkers don't
seem to sustain many hip injuries, despite the emphatic, rolling
motion. ``There's more movement, but it's not jarring,'' says
Kearney. ``The hip is designed to do the motions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the lower risk of injury isn't persuasive, perhaps the higher
burn of calories will be.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point _ called the crossover speed, at just above 5
miles per hour _ it takes more energy to walk than to run. Picture
yourself dashing to catch a bus, picking up the pace more and more
until you break into a jog because you feel as if you can't walk
any faster. If at that point you instead continued to walk, it
would take so much more effort than running that you actually burn
more calories at the same speed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a 1979 study at Columbia University, at 5 m.p.h., a
12-minutes-per-mile pace, a runner burns 480 calories an hour,
while a racewalker expends 530 calories. As both the runner and
racewalker pick up speed, the gap widens: for instance, at 7
m.p.h., the tally becomes 690 to 960 _ a difference of 270
calories &UR;  &LR; per hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're getting a lot of movement of your limbs relative to the
distance you're moving across the ground,'' says Kearney of
racewalking. ``There's a lot of ancillary muscle contraction to use
those limbs.'' Then, too, because racewalkers are taking shorter
strides _ remember, they don't have the flight phase enjoyed by a
runner _ they need more steps to cover every mile, and that means
even more contractions.
</P>
<P>
   And as they increase speed, they don't increase stride length,
as runners &UR;  &LR; do, but instead boost stride frequency. More steps,
more muscle contractions, higher oxygen consumption, more calories
burned.
</P>
<P>
   So will runners _ especially the slower ones, who aren't going
any faster than a good racewalker _ be inclined to switch? Theresa
Taylor-Dusharm, an exercise physiologist for Advocate Health Care
in Chicago, doubts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``With less chance of injury it's definitely the way to go,''
she &UR;  &LR; says &UR; . &LR;  ``But you know those diehard runners won't give it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information on learning to racewalk, call the New
England Walkers hotline at 781-433-7142.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think you're ready for racewalking but want to
learn how to get the most from fitness walking, ``The 90-Day
Fitness Walking Program,'' a book by Mark Fenton and Seth Bauer, is
a good way to start.

DOES RADIATION MAKE FOOD DANGEROUS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By USHA LEE MCFARLING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. The government says radiating food can't hurt you, but does
it kill the vitamins in the food? What is the point of radiating
food if it destroys nutritional value?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Radiation has been applied to some foods to kill bacteria and
lengthen shelf life for years. Since the 1960's, the Food and Drug
Administration has approved the irradiation of wheat, spices, and
tea.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In 1984, the FDA allowed the irradiation of meat, poultry,
fruits, and vegetables as well. Astronauts have eaten irradiated
food since 1972, and at least 40 countries, both developed and
developing, allow the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   In irradiation, food is placed in large aluminum containers and
exposed to gamma radiation as the food moves through a chamber on a
conveyor belt. The process kills bacterial cells that can cause
disease or decomposition of food.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials say the technology is safe, does not unduly alter
food's nutritional value, and is necessary to stem the estimated
6,000 to 9,000 deaths caused in this country each year by
food-borne illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics show you hands-down that the biggest problem
people face is microbiological,'' says James Tillotson, the
director of the Food Policy Institute at Tufts University.
``Whoever thought a child could die from a glass of apple juice?''
he said, a reference to a recent case in which fresh juice was
contaminated by a virulent strain of E. coli bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Much bacteria cannot be effectively washed off because it gets
into tiny crevices in some foods, such as raspberries, says
Tillotson. Some imported fruits carry harmful bacteria because
human feces is used as fertilizer in some countries. Irradiation
can also kill bacteria that can grow if meat is handled improperly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Some proponents compare irradiation to a car air bag: an extra
precaution against carelessness or an accident. But opponents have
several concerns, including the impact on nutritional value of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that irradiation reduces vitamin content,
particularly of vitamins A, C, E, and B complex, says Michael
Colby, executive director of Food and Water, a Vermont-based
organization that is leading efforts to stop food irradiation.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents, including Tillotson, say irradiation removes
only a small amount of vitamins, and more are removed during
canning, cooking or freezing. Many nutritionists say the small
nutritional loss is not critical in a country as well nourished as
ours. Colby responds that people will still have to cook, freeze,
and process irradiated food _ and so will end up with even less
nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   He and others also have safety concerns. The FDA claims numerous
animal studies show that the process is safe, but some scientists
look at the same data and conclude that irradiation is not safe.
Still others say that they are not for or against irradiation _
they just want more conclusive studies done before the technology
becomes widespread.
</P>
<P>
   Irradiation, adds Colby, should not be a substitute for clean
processing and handling of the nation's food supply: ``It allows
processors to continue the filth and contamination.''
</P>
<P>
   The process does not make a food radioactive, but it may
introduce ``radiolytic compounds.'' These chemicals, says Colby,
are relatively new compounds and have not yet been proved safe. In
addition, accidents at food irradiation plants could expose workers
or the environment to radiation, he says.
</P>
<P>
   While opponents and proponents debate the scientific and safety
issues, consumers may ultimately decide the shelf life of food
irradiation. A CBS News poll last year found 73 percent of
Americans oppose irradiation, but supermarket anecdotes suggest
otherwise. A grocer, interviewed in a November 1997 Technology
Review article, said that when both irradiated and non-irradiated
chicken was offered to consumers, they bought whichever was
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   In another test, irradiated strawberries outsold similarly
priced non-irradiated berries _ probably because irradiation killed
mold on berries and made them look better.

CHINESE DISSIDENTS IN THE US STRUGGLE TO KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shen Tong came to America a frightened undergraduate, on a dead
run from the June 1989 massacre of unarmed demonstrators around
Tiananmen Square. Now a graduate of Brandeis University defending a
doctoral thesis at Boston University, he promotes democracy in
China from a spacious house in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Jianli already was in this country, working on a doctorate
in math at the University of California at Berkeley, when the
democracy movement that would be crushed by the massacre emerged.
He rushed back to China to advise and support students in the
square; on June 4, he watched as 30 of them were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yang is a PhD candidate at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and is active in broadcasting and publishing
pro-democracy information in China.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are ``Forty-niners,'' leading dissidents whose names
are on a list of 49 people most strictly banned from returning to
China. Both are doing well, academically and materially, in the
United States. But in their home lives, they are very different.
</P>
<P>
   Yang has married, fathered a son, and bought a house he and his
friends are rehabilitating. Shen is single and a renter who says he
can't bring himself to buy a house. ``I feel like I always have to
be ready to pack and go back in three days,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after Tiananmen, on the eve of the first visit to
China by a US president since the bloodletting, China's exiles are
divided _ not by bitter personal and political competition, as they
were just after the massacre, but by difficult personal emotions
and choices forced on them by their banishment and the decimation
of their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often run into a dilemma of conscience,'' Yang says. ``I
don't feel sad I'm here, but we all want to go home and share the
burden, share the suffering with our colleagues. My dream is to
contribute to democratization there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elite Chinese students _ especially those from Beijing and
Qinghua universities, the Chinese analogues to Harvard and MIT _
have little trouble making their way in this country. Most are able
to qualify for scholarships and teaching assistanceships at
top-flight US institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Life is harder for older exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among older dissidents whose English is not so good, there is
an element of quiet desperation to their lives,'' says William
Alford, director of East Asia legal studies at Harvard Law School
and a frequent visitor to China. ``These intelligent, well-spoken
people, who were not high-profile dissidents, are just managing to
get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Xizhe, who lives in a one-room apartment, speaks little
English and receives bare subsistance aid.Wang spent 15 years in
prison for political offenses before being freed in 1993 as part of
an apparent bid by China to increase its chances of winning the
2000 Olympics. After two years of police harassment and
surveillance, he fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``After long years in prison, I felt I needed to get charged
with the knowledge of what was going on in the world,'' Wang says,
``and I was being monitored so closely it was impossible to
accomplish anything there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he ``probably will return home as soon as possible.
A couple of years is enough to study and recharge... so when I am
recharged, I should return.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Goldman, a Boston University professor who specializes in
Chinese intellectual history and dissent, says exiles who are
qualified scientists or who go into business are doing well here,
while ``the ideologues cannot find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the exile community generally are ``very helpful to
each other,'' she adds, working out ``communal living arrangements,
sharing food'' when that is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles generally agree that it would not be difficult for them
to return to China in defiance of the ban on their entry, but say
they would be swiftly apprehended and probably imprisoned once they
tried to support themselves or renew their liberalization
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Wang, say they don't care and will return regardless.
Others say they can do more for the democratization of China from
exile, but they are torn by the recognition that the longer they
are away, the more they lose touch with their rapidly changing
homeland, and the weaker their voices become.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for many of the activists is to work on projects,
including publishing and broadcasting in mainland China, and
meeting with sympathetic mainland intellectuals, while avoiding
direct confrontation with authorities. It is intellectually daring,
absorbing work, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a large operation in China, and the people we are
working with are closely watched,'' says an advocate in one of
several foundations with Boston-area ties that are active on the
mainland. ``Yet there are certain things you can do'' even in
expressing, publishing, and broadcasting liberatization messages.
``There is a space, a gray area, for negotiation of visible
dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time, approval by President Bush of permanent
residence status on request for any Chinese student who entered the
United States legally after the massacre, and the gradual
relaxation in China of the repressive atmosphere that prevailed
after the massacre all have reduced the ranks of exiled dissidents.
Activists who have persevered say this has not necessarily been
bad.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, Shen says, there were 8,600 Chinese
dissident groups around the world, and the number of dissident
students was estimated in the tens of thousands. Now there are
fewer organizations, and the number of dissidents barred from
returning probably is about 200, with perhaps twice that number in
self-imposed exile.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, activists say, there is far less personal rivalry
among those who have stayed the course. Disagreements over how to
act, and how to encourage the United States to act, toward China
are much more civil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most students _ including many of the leaders _ were not
highly politically motivated'' before the massacre, Shen said.
``Those who stayed with the movement got a chance to really
understand politics as a serious vocation with its own ethics, its
own rhythms and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harvard Law's Alford notes, ``where everyone was
looking for political solutions in '89, they have now come to
realize that change comes in many ways _ through economics, and
through communication that is not directly political but has
hopeful expectations for society.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, all concerned are sensitized to symbols.
Thus there is virtually no opposition to President Clinton's visit
to China, which begins Thursday. But there is apprehension over how
Clinton will handle the welcoming ceremony at Tiananmen Square, a
ritual on which the Chinese government insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Gang, third on the list of students most wanted by the
Chinese government following the massacre, served six years in
jail. He was beaten, subjected to electric shocks, and kept in
isolation. Harassed by police and prevented from working when he
was released, he fled, and is now barred from returning. Recently,
he received a master's degree in computer science from Columbia
University, and last week he started work at Teradyne in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go there, that's his business,'' Liu says of Clinton. ``But
if he goes he should do something for the victims of 1989.
Tiananmen Square is a very sensitive place.''
</P>
<P>
   Many exiles believe Clinton is making a mistake going to the
square. They themselves are torn over the symbolism and don't
believe the president has a grasp on it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not proper,'' Yang says. ``Tiananmen Square is the
symbol of murder. It is a symbol of organized lying and coverup.
... How can Chinese people interpret it if he is welcomed where so
many died, and just shakes hands and says nothing?''

SHE FORGOT THE MOST IMPORTANT RULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JACK THOMAS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was midmorning last Thursday when computers
throughout the Globe city room blinked with a message that an
urgent staff meeting had been scheduled for noon by the editor,
Matthew V. Storin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's it about?'' asked a feature writer now so distressed by
events that ensued that he insists his name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' I answered. ``I can't go, because I'm writing
on deadline, but when the meeting's over, let me know what
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What I was writing was a column that asked why Americans have so
little confidence in journalists. I got the answer soon enough.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before noon, Storin stopped by. ``You'd better
come to this meeting,'' he said grimly.
</P>
<P>
   When news was broken to the staff that Patricia Smith had been
asked to resign for having fabricated people and quotations in her
metro column, there were audible sighs and murmurings of ``oh,
no,'' and then the silence and sadness that come with a death in
the family.
</P>
<P>
   On the day after Smith's resignation, telephone calls and e-mail
to the ombudsman's office ran 3 to 1 sympathetic to Smith and
critical of the Globe. One response was particularly bizarre. In
reaction to Smith's column of apology Friday, a woman from
Dorchester called to say that it was so poignant and so well
written that it ought to be nominated for a Pulitzer.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Friday, members of the Globe staff struggled to make
sense of the realization that for all her skills at writing, what
Smith had done was to take the language she claims to love and
twisted it to manipulate readers and make a mockery of the least
complex and most fundamental standard of writing _ telling the
truth.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, sad, and unable to explain why Smith had come to
violate that trust, many people at the Globe were depressed. The
question on many minds was posed by Robert A. Jordan, president of
the union that represents writers and editors: ``Why would someone
with such skill and talent and passion need to go beyond the
boundaries of journalistic ethics to make an impact when she could
have made with the same if not greater impact within the
boundaries?''
</P>
<P>
   It's ironic, but many of the columnists, reporters, and editors
who demand daily that other people answer questions in the midst of
crisis were unwilling in their own crisis to speak for the record
about Patricia Smith and her struggle with truth.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was afraid, though. Viola Osgood, an
African-American woman from Dorchester who is retired as a writer
of editorials for the Globe, had the courage to say what others
would only whisper:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Globe should have asked for Patricia Smith's
resignation. I think the Globe should have fired her.''
</P>
<P>
   I agree.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, charges resurfaced that in years past, another
columnist, Mike Barnicle, had fabricated characters and quotations.
To avert any question of a double standard, the Globe acted swiftly
and prudently in announcing that Barnicle's columns, too, would be
scrutinized again.
</P>
<P>
   As Storin explained to the staff on Thursday, all three metro
columnists _ Smith, Barnicle, and Eileen McNamara _ had been
notified two years ago that their columns would henceforth be
examined vigorously for fabrications. It's startling, and
disappointing, too, that any editor feels compelled to remind
columnists that they are not allowed to write falsely, that they
are obliged to write the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith's column of apology was written with her
customary flair, she continued to compromise the truth. Making up
an entire column of fictitious people and fictitious quotations is
not, as she would have us believe, slamming home a point.
</P>
<P>
   It's lying.
</P>
<P>
   And for all her professed love of the language, when she writes:
``I will survive this, knowing that the heart of my columns was
honest and heartfelt,'' the question remains, were they honest, or
were they deceitful?
</P>
<P>
   That is why many people, black and white, are angry for reasons
articulated by Viola Osgood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the first black women to work at the Globe full
time,'' says Osgood. ``I was `the girl,' and `honey' and `dear.'
And I was given `soft' stories along with two other black women,
Carmen Fields and Gayle Pollard, until we rebelled and got to do
the same stories as everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in as black woman and walked out as respected
journalists who did the job as well as anyone else, black or white,
male or female. We worked hard to leave a legacy where black women
like Patricia Smith would be trusted to do the job without regard
to sex or color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Patricia Smith has prostituted that, and I'm angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What she did is unforgivable. I worked 24 years at the Globe,
and it never occurred to me that anybody would make up quotes. And
Patricia Smith's column of so-called apology was an insult to
blacks in journalism who worked so that she would have the status.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what did she do? She forgot the most important rule in
journalism _ tell the truth.''

SUSAN TRACY'S BIG WEEK AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Susan Tracy is about to have one of those weeks people in
politics dream about, and for the best of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She deserves it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the inadequately sung sleepers in the campaign to succeed
Joe Kennedy in Congress, Tracy is about to be plucked from the
large pack and tapped on the shoulder by no less than the National
Women's Political Caucus.
</P>
<P>
   And then, from another, equally important direction, she is
about to be tapped on the other shoulder by Local 26 of the Hotel
and Restaurant Workers. For those who follow this business, Local
26 is one of Boston's major sources not just of the validation that
comes from significant endorsements, but of the field workers and
phone banks that can transform shoestring, grass-roots campaigns
into machines. This sudden surge of support, moreover, just happens
to come as she prepares to hold a very important fund-raiser
downtown this week.
</P>
<P>
   For those who detest conventional wisdom and who think Kennedy's
departure presents an ideal opportunity to pass the torch and get
fresh energy and ideas, Tracy comes from central casting.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom type-casts this campaign into nothing
more than a contest of names and resumes. But Tracy's bottom-up
effort has the potential to severely undercut the twin pillars of
that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   The solid labor support for this community activist and former
state legislator is no knock on Ray Flynn. The former Boston mayor
from outside the district has always been there for working people.
But as Local 26's president, Janice Loux, put it after meeting with
the crowded field, it is the future that's on the union's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question about the issues labor cares about,'' she
said, turning to the candidate the union supported for the
Legislature when she first ran in 1990. ``Susan Tracy is especially
important in her determination to protect pensions, and we don't
have any doubt about her record in putting together the coalitions
that get things done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is more about the person. Susan is the hometown girl
in this thing; she lines up perfectly with the identity of our
union. It isn't often you seek this mixture of a genuine
identification with working people along with an ability to get
things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the fact that Tracy is getting blessed by the women's
movement she has always supported is no knock on the campaign's
other ``name,'' Marjorie Clapprood. Before she went into the talk
show business, there was never a moment _ in the Legislature or
running with John Silber statewide in 1990 _ when she wasn't in the
thick of things. Again, however, this is about the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Susan Tracy is very seasoned, but she also has the energy of
youth,'' said Pat Dear of the Women's Political Caucus. ``Because
of who she is and what she's done, she is instinctively able to see
people not as voters but as constitutents and as neighbors. Coming
up through the ranks really gives you a special ability to make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot to say of a 38-year-old who worked her way through
Boston College after Catholic school, ran Flynn's homeless
operation, and represented the city both before the Legislature and
later in it. But as she took me around the sprawling district last
week and then at a candidates' night in Dorchester, that was what
everyone who knows her wanted to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has two wonderful qualities that are rare in
combination,'' said Tim Garvin over at the Y he runs in Boston's
Brighton district. ``Nobody can get from Point A to Point B better,
but she also knows the people who are affected. She simply gets
it.''
</P>
<P>
   We were talking welfare reform. Tracy knows there are miles to
go at the national level before this can work over time. She also
knows that nine of the 36 kids at the Y that day for afternoon day
care are on vouchers under the state's absurdly Draconian rules;
and that those vouchers expire this fall. As we talked, she fumed
at the inattention given affordable housing issue during the '90s.
But she could also point out buildings where federal subsidies are
about to expire, putting low-income tenants at great risk.
</P>
<P>
   Tracy is also happy to talk Social Security reform, about which
her mind is open to the new ideas in Washington. But she gets truly
passionate about the widows who face special privation in both
pension and Social Security benefits, precisely because she knows
so many individually.
</P>
<P>
   She is not a soundbite artist. Tracy is a straight-ahead talker,
favoring verbs and direct objects over adjectives and adverbs. But
she knows people she doesn't know are going to hear about her
organizing success and look at her more closely to see what's
there. She needs to be ready for that.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, hers is not the only way to make a fresh start.
There are also candidates with business backgrounds who seek to
identify with the New Democrat, bipartisan twist in today's
congressional climate. And they deserve close attention, too. But
this week is Susan Tracy's. It's also a week for all those who
delight in showing how conventional wisdom has all the durability
of a sand castle.

GNMA FUND SEEMS BEST FOR CONSERVATIVE INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I will be 62 in July and will begin drawing Social Security
of $1,112 a month. I retired last year, and the Social Security
will combine with a pension of $1,500 a month and my wife's pension
and Social Security. We own our home and the bills we have are for
normal things we need and a few we don't. We are not desperate for
more income, but it would be convenient. I enclose a copy of the
statement on my 401(k) account, which remains with my former
employer. I would like to move it and then draw some income without
loss of principal. The 401(k) is invested through Vanguard, and I
would like to stay with them, although it could be moved elsewhere.
How should I handle these funds to get the maximum gains with the
least loss?
</P>
<P>
   W.M., Warren, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The statement shows that 97 percent of the 401(k) money is in
a Vanguard money market fund, with the other 3 percent in a common
stock, presumably that of your former employer. I often hesitate to
suggest much of a change when a person has a portfolio that's this
conservative, reasoning that if a person holds a huge percentage of
his or her savings in a money market fund, it's because they are
very, very conservative _ perhaps even are the kind of people who
would lose sleep over the prospect of losing money in the stock or
bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some people hold money market investments
simply because they didn't understand the confusing array of
offerings when they set up their account, and accordingly chose
what seemed simplest and safest.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously you could roll the account over into a Vanguard IRA
with similar investments and obtain your goal of an income stream
without loss of principal by simply withdrawing the actual
dividends from the money market shares. You could even sell the
common stock and put that money into the same fund.
</P>
<P>
   But if you want to be a bit more aggressive, I make this
suggestion. Instead of the money market fund, why not roll the
account over into shares of Vanguard's GNMA fund _ a proven
above-average performer within its category, and a fund which you
can expect, over the long run, to yield about 1.5 percentage points
more than the money markets.
</P>
<P>
   The key words in that last sentence are ``over the long run,''
because there's no escaping the fact that Ginnie Mae funds can be
quite volatile in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   These funds own government-guaranteed mortgage securities, and
while Uncle Sam stands behind both interest and principal payments,
the value of these holdings _ like any fixed-income investment _
fluctuates inversely to interest rates. That's to say, when
interest rates rise, the value of these securities fall; when
interest rates fall, fixed-income securities rise in value.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, the value of such funds also rises or falls when the
markets only speculate that interest rates will change. The
long-term record shows that these funds do poorly in about two of
every ten years, but that they also tend to make back the lost
ground fairly quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a suggestion for a conservative strategy for a GNMA
position for one who is concerned about preserving capital. More
the funds to the GNMA, but direct that Vanguard send you monthly
checks representing only 5 percent of the value of your initial
investment. Since the GNMA fund is currently producing a yield of
6.5 percent, that means that you would be reinvesting about 23
percent of your yield. Over time those reinvestments should build
up a buffer sufficient to keep the principal value at a higher
level than your initial investment, even when those apparently
inevitable bad years come.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, once that buffer has reached the point that the account
is 10 to 15 percent larger than your initial investment, you could
decide you have enough padding, and at that point direct that the
entire yield from your position be sent to you monthly.
</P>
<P>
   At least on paper, if a fund yields 6.5 percent and you withdraw
only 5 percent, the principal should grow by 10 percent in a matter
of six years and one month; to achieve 15 percent principal growth
would require a little less than 8 1/2 years. Either way, once you
get to the target, you could then give yourself a thumping good
``raise,'' increasing your withdrawals by 43 percent if you set the
target for the buffer at 10 percent, and by nearly 50 percent if
you set the buffer at 15 percent. Either way, it's an attractive
way to build a little protection against future inflation into your
retirement budgeting.

   Q. I find myself starting over as I recover from an unwanted
divorce after 25 years of marriage. I am a 48-year-old baby boomer
who has not prepared for my retirement years. I will be inheriting
about $50,000 and would like to know the best way to invest this
for my future. Last year I opened a $3,000 account in Vanguard
Windsor II, and IRA accounts of $1,000 each in Vanguard Index
Growth and Balanced Index. This year I am considering adding Janus
Worldwide fund to the IRA portfolio. Since most of my money will
not be in IRAs, would a tax-managed account be a good idea for me?
</P>
<P>
   T.J., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's true that Vanguard's tax-managed funds appear to work.
Last year, for example, the Vanguard Tax-Managed Growth and Income
fund produced a total return of 33.31 percent, and its
distributions for the year represented 1.34 percent of its yearend
net asset value. The Vanguard Index 500 fund, which holds a very
similar portfolio, produced a total return of 33.21 percent, and
its distributions represented 2.12 percent of yearend assets. The
only problem with these tax-managed funds is that there is a fairly
limited menu. Besides Growth and Income, there are balanced and
capital appreciation funds in the category _ and none of the
value-oriented type of funds I tend to favor in general and favor
now in particular.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is twofold: One is to reason that index funds
tend, by their nature, to make fairly moderate distributions;
theirs is basically a buy-and-hold strategy, and it leads to few
unpleasant surprises on tax day. So it seems to me that a taxable
account in Vanguard Index Value or Balanced Index might ultimately
be more attractive. (It's worth noting that the Tax-Managed
Balanced fund differs from Balanced Index in one important area,
which is that it normally has a target portfolio of 50 percent to
55 percent tax-free bonds, with the rest in cash and stock;
Balanced Index holds 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, and
thus should be a better candidate as a long-term savings vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The second suggestion is that you consider putting all or some
of the inherited money in one of Vanguard's variable annuity
accounts. These offer tax deferral of all internal growth within
the accounts, which means you would face no tax liabilities at all
until you withdraw funds in retirement, and at that point you would
pay taxes only on the percentage of withdrawals representing the
internal growth. Since you don't seem to expect to be rolling in
cash during retirement, this might be an attractive prospect for
you, since you would probably be in a lower tax rate then than you
are now. Variable annuities are complicated instruments, offering a
mild form of insurance which enables them to offer the
tax-deferral.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't free _ you can expect the cost of the insurance to
reduce returns on these accounts by about one-half of 1 percentage
point annually, but for many people the tax advantages are
sufficient to far outweigh that drawback.
</P>
<P>
   An important final point about variable annuities is that they
work only as long-term investment vehicles, and you would pay a 10
percent tax penalty on earnings if you withdraw funds before age 59
1/2.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How does one go about opening a Uniform Gifts to Minors
account, and how much do you need to open one?
</P>
<P>
   G.B., Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's about the simplest thing in the world. You simply ask
the financial institution of your choice, whether it be a mutual
fund, a brokerage firm, or a bank, to establish the account,
supplying vital statistics and Social Security numbers for both the
beneficiary and yourself (or any other person you chose as
custodian). The minimum investment amount is up to the institution
_ the bank I called required only $10 to open a UGMA passbook
savings account. At other institutions such as mutual funds,
different minimum initial investment levels are established _
frequently at lower levels than for other accounts. At the Vanguard
mutual fund family, for example, the normal $3,000 minimum initial
investment level is reduced to $1,000 for such accounts. Other
mutual fund families have no minimums at all, although such funds
do typically levy a sales charge of some sort, either up front or
deferred or a combination of the two.

THE GOOD WORK TO BE SEEN ACROSS THE THAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A theater junkie could make a satisfying trip to London
simply by crossing the Thames and hanging out where the Royal
National Theatre and Shakespeare's Globe are holding forth. The
National is riding a hot streak engineered by former artistic
director Richard Eyre and current AD Trevor Nunn. ``Closer,'' in
fact, is a National production that transferred to the West End.
Many of their productions are touring at America's regional
theaters _ ``An Enemy of the People'' in Los Angeles; Tennessee
Williams' ``Not About Nightingales'' at the Alley in Houston; and
one of their most intriguing plays, Michael Frayn's ``Copenhagen,''
is coming to the Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven June 23 through
27.
</P>
<P>
   There are grumblings of a more commercial sensibility, but with
subsidies stagnant at best, Nunn has made it clear that future
productions like ``Oklahoma!'' have to pay the rent _ although if
``Oklahoma!'' is nearly as good as the National's ``Carousel,''
there won't be anything to apologize for.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, its three theaters along the Thames now offer a
delicious smorgasbord, with Christopher Hampton's lacerating
adaptation of ``An Enemy of the People'' with Ian McKellen
(reviewed last week) in the Olivier Theatre before transferring to
the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles; and ``Othello'' and ``The
London Cuckolds'' holding forth in the Lyttelton, where Fiona Shaw
is just opening in ``The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie.''
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Barry's new play, ``Our Lady of Sligo,'' wasn't on, as
they say, at the smaller Cottesloe while I was there, but Frayn's
``Copenhagen'' is certainly one of the meatier offerings in London.
In 1941 the German physicist Werner Heisenberg went to see his
colleague Niels Bohr in Copenhagen, then under German occupation.
Presumbably Heisenberg was there to find out if the Allies were
close to developing the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Frayn makes this the jumping-off point for a discussion of
quantum physics and the uncertainty principle and if that doesn't
sound like the most riveting of theatrical possibilities to you,
you're half right. This isn't a dressed-up theater of ideas like
Tom Stoppard's ``Arcadia.'' I spotted half a dozen people fighting
off, or giving in to, naptime during the first half. But all eyes
were open after intermission, when the implications of uncertainty
were becoming clearer. If Heisenberg had taken a simple yet daring
leap of faith, would the Germans have beaten the Allies to the
bomb? Had Heisenberg figured it out and censored himself to prevent
the Germans from winning the war? The only thing certain is that
Frayn has fashioned a very compelling play out of the uncertainty
of motivation, one that even someone as mathematically challenged
as myself could see is playing with, and mastering, philosophical
fire.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road is the year-old Shakespeare's Globe, the project
that American Sam Wanamaker led to fruition. Designed in the style
of Shakespeare's theater, with a pit for groundlings, and benches
to keep the richer folk out of the sun and rain, the Globe is a
most enjoyable place to experience Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Rylance, the theater's artistic director (and the American
Repertory Theatre's Hamlet), describes the ambience the place
achieves in his notes to the audience: ``Whether seated on a bench
or standing, Shakespeare kept his audience physically aware of
themselves. There is nowhere on the stage that an actor can be seen
by everyone in the theatre, Shakespeare must have wanted you to
look at each other sometimes while you listened. Shakespeare and
his fellows placed their thoughtful observations in an emotional
story, let yourself get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, one's appreciation is enhanced by leaving one's
seat (they're murder on the back anyway) and walking around the
pit, particularly in a comedy such as ``As You Like It,'' where the
actors barrel their way through the crowd onto the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the most profound Shakespeare in the world and not
every actor is wonderful, but both ``As You Like It'' and ``The
Merchant of Venice'' show that accessibility is a most
Shakespearean virtue. The Globe shows that Shakespeare doesn't have
to be quantum physics. Not, as the National demonstrates, that
there's anything wrong with that.

WHY WE HOPE THERE WILL ALWAYS BE AN ENGLISH TEHATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ED SIEGEL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's difficult for an American theatergoer in London
not to be awed by the health of the British scene. There is, of
course, the choice _ it's easy to find a pair of plays almost every
day for the duration of one's stay. And the quantity matches the
quality, as is obvious from the Anglo-Irish domination of this
year's Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive aspect of British theater, though, is the
sense that it still matters, that it's still part of the national
dialogue for more than a tiny percentage of the people. A
production of Ibsen's ``An Enemy of the People'' is part of the
debate over Tony Blair's moving the Labour Party to the right.
Brits talk about the romantic implications of Patrick Marber's hot
West End play ``Closer'' alongside Helen Fielding's bestseller
``Bridget Jones's Diary.'' Young people flock to the reconstructed
Globe Theatre, where being a groundling is as cool as going to a
rock club. All right, almost as cool. And when British producers
look for star power, they lure a fine actor like Kevin Spacey into
doing ``The Iceman Cometh'' instead of a clown like Quentin
Tarantino into ``Wait Until Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, easy to romanticize the English theater scene.
Government subsidies account for much of the healthier climate for
theater in England than in America, and Blair has made it obvious
that he's no friendlier to the arts than his Tory predecessors. As
ticket prices rise, the financial elitism of the audiences becomes
a self-fulfilling prophecy. Theater still matters to more people in
England than in America, but the percentage is dropping. And with
the recent boom in the British film industry, it's getting harder
to get long-term commitments from even second- or third-tier
actors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the theatrical fabric is relatively bright and
more resistant to contemporary flames. At its core is a most
impressive historical through-line, where productions of
Shakespeare are vital to today's concerns and Marber, Harold
Pinter, and Tom Stoppard seem clearly part of the Shakespearean
tradition. There are as many people sniffling away at the end of
the Royal National Theatre's ``Othello,'' for example, as there are
at Marber's more contemporaneously resonant play.
</P>
<P>
   You could draw that historical through-line, in fact, from
``Othello'' through the same company's adaptation of Edward
Ravens-croft's Restoration play ``The London Cuckolds,'' to the
historical play about Harold Macmillan, ``A Letter of
Resignation,'' to revivals of Pinter and Peter Shaffer, to three
contemporary plays: ``Closer,'' ``Nabokov's Gloves,'' and Alan
Ayckbourn's latest, ``The Things We Do for Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayckbourn's title is meant to be ironic. While it conjures up
notions of sentiment and sacrifice, the play is really about vagary
and betrayal, in which a prig played by Jane Asher and a macho
Scotsman who have seemingly nothing in common except contempt for
each other betray her best friend/his fiancee for a stormy, violent
relationship with each other.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the light comedy in the bunch. ``Closer'' has even
more laughs, but Marber's wit, though somewhat glib, cuts like a
knife. You leave the theater feeling as if you've been scarred as
deeply as the four characters for whom love and sex seem like drugs
rather than emotions. Once they've achieved their peak highs, they
need a hit of something, or someone, else, even though their
betrayals leave lives in ruins. The same goes for Patrick Wise's
lawyer in ``Nabokov's Gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   In those rare instances where a monogamous relationship seems to
work, as in Pinter's ``The Lover'' _ part of a loving revival of
three of his works by the Donmar Warehouse _ it's only because the
couple have decided to pretend that they're carrying on affairs
with, as it turns out, each other's alter ego.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hugh Whitemore's dull historical play ``A Letter of
Resignation'' has a double entendre on the subject as the British
prime minister Harold Macmillan has to resign himself to his wife's
affair if he isn't to lose her.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is new, of course. The high-spirited Restoration
romp ``The London Cuckolds'' _ the National makes clear that
``Restoration'' and ``romp'' aren't a contradiction in terms _
makes clear that there's no putting a lid on libido. And if any
production of ``Othello'' these days seems like an O.J. Simpson
prequel, the National's is all the more creepy for Simon Russell
Beale's seductive sycophant of a Iago. Does Desdemona's innocent
flirtatiousness set him on his murderous way? The things that Iago
and Othello (an unsatisfyingly bombastic David Harewood) do for
love aren't terribly different than their contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   What all these decidedly unromantic plays add up to is a
restlessness with the spirit of the times. A revival of Shaffer's
'60s one-acter, ``Black Comedy,'' playing on a very funny double
bill with Stoppard's ``The Real Inspector Hound,'' reminds us that
bed-hopping reflected the miniskirted merriment of that decade, but
there's nothing funny about it in these plays _ even in Ayckbourn's
comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Nabokov's Gloves'' the postmodern disdain for values is
represented in the attorney's indifference to his client's guilt or
innocence and in his determination to bed her, no matter what the
cost to his marriage or to his client's fragile psyche. His wife's
self-righteousness betrays a heavy-handedness on the part of the
playwright, Peter Moffat, but the ideas he's juggling are
nonetheless provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closer'' is the play where these issues come together most
satisfyingly and most disturbingly. Marber gets all the
contemporary nuances right _ the exoticism of a ``Something Wild''
romance; the phobias over commitment; even quasipornographic
Internet flirtation. Yet what's most striking is the yearning of
its youngest and seemingly least traditional character for a life
in which values like sacrifice matter.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of Marber's wonderfully sexy and droll dialogue _
his other impressive play, ``Dealer's Choice,'' is coming to
Gloucester Stage this summer _ there's a sense that the playwright
is also looking for a way out of the hedonistic dead end. Take, for
example, this scene between the younger woman, Alice, who confronts
Anna, her supposed friend, for stealing her man:
</P>
<P>
   ALICE: Why did you do this?
</P>
<P>
   ANNA (tough): I fell in love with him, Alice.
</P>
<P>
   ALICE (laughing): That's the most stupid expression in the
world. ``I fell in love.'' As if you had no choice. There's a
moment, there's always a moment; I can do this or I can resist it.
I don't know when your moment was but I bet there was one.
</P>
<P>
   ANNA: Yes, there was.
</P>
<P>
   ALICE: You didn't fall in love, you gave in to temptation. Don't
lie to me.
</P>
<P>
   Marber doesn't offer any easy ways out, though. Besides the
edge-of-the-seat dialogue, ``Closer'' is a tightly constructed play
in which the inevitability of circumstance catches the audience in
its grip as tightly as the tragedy in ``Othello.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' entertainingly skims the surface of
today's relationships, but ``Closer'' is closer to the bone.

LOW SPARK OF `HIGH ART' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``High Art'' is centered in New York's downtown art scene, a
singular world as notorious for its poseurs and pretensions as for
its sparks of daring creativity. Yet this film, written and
directed by newcomer Lisa Cholodenko, slips beneath the airy
galleries, perfectly chilled wines, and terminal hipness of that
arena to present its shadow self. Hers is a world where today's hip
darlings become tomorrow's punch lines, as talent and promise are
eroded by drugs and expectation. This film has less to do with high
art than the low spark of misspent lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was something I was exposed to,'' said Cholodenko, who
wrote and directed the film, which opened Friday. ``I came to New
York in 1992, and ended up meeting a lot of people living in the
downtown art, photo, and film scene, and there were people like
that. There were a lot of people who sat around, dabbled (in
drugs), and lived in lofts. It's an atmosphere that I found very
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the film is Lucy Berliner, a Nan Goldin-type
photographer once renowned for gritty, provocative photos. But her
fame becomes shrouded in mystery after she disappears from the art
world and descends into druggy decadence with her German lover,
Greta, a former actress who spends most of her time nodding off in
a heroin haze. Their junkie-chic lives are interrupted by Syd, an
assistant editor at a tony photo magazine, who lives in the same
apartment building. Syd accidentally meets Lucy and is quickly
enthralled by her and the ruined romance of her world.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which won a screenwriting award at this year's
Sundance Film Festival, stars Radha Mitchell as Syd and Patricia
Clarkson as Greta, but the actress receiving the most attention is
Ally Sheedy as Lucy. The role is a stark departure for Sheedy, best
remembered as a card-carrying member of the so-called Brat Pack,
the cadre of young, photogenic actors who appeared in such popular
1980s films as ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``St. Elmo's Fire.'' It
was a fame Sheedy shared with Molly Ringwald, Anthony Michael Hall,
Judd Nelson, Emilio Estevez, Demi Moore, and Rob Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Sheedy broke from the Brats and appeared in ``WarGames'' with
Matthew Broderick, ``Short Circuit'' with Steve Guttenberg, and
``Only the Lonely'' with the late John Candy. But her career waned
as roles became scarce, and she battled drug problems and
unforgiving directors who refused to see beyond her good-girl
wholesomeness.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while many teenagers and 20-somethings in the 1980s were
plucking down their dollars to watch Sheedy and her Brat Pack
cohorts, Cholodenko was frequenting her local art house, which
never ran the suburban teen-angst films that made Sheedy famous.
Knowing little about Sheedy's past work, the filmmaker had no
trouble imagining her as a strung-out lesbian artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw those movies, so I really didn't really know who
she was,'' Cholodenko said. ``I knew in a really general way about
the Brat Pack, but for me it was really a blank slate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cholodenko, who worked as an assistant editor on such films as
Gus Van Sant's ``To Die For'' and John Singleton's ``Boyz N the
Hood'' before making her first feature, has been fascinated with
photography since she was a student at San Francisco State
University in the 1980s. She was particularly struck by the
personal artistic style of Goldin, Larry Clark (director of the
controversial film ``Kids''), and Jack Pierson. Their photos mostly
featured friends and acquaintances, often people on society's edge.
With graphic images of sex and drug use in black-and-white, their
work was both shocking and scintillating. By the time Cholodenko
moved to New York, that style had permeated popular culture from
music videos to fashion, culminating in ``heroic chic,'' with
models affecting the burned-out, dead-end look of junkies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was being used to sell everything from clothes to
cologne,'' she said. ``At the same time, work of Larry Clark was
being displayed in the Museum of Modern Art, so I knew I wanted to
explore that world of artists and drugs in a fictional story.''
</P>
<P>
   In her original story, Cholodenko focused on Syd's career
ambitions. At the magazine Frame, Syd has the title of assistant
editor, but she spends more time fetching coffee and pastries for
bosses than making major editorial decisions. Although she is at
first unaware of Lucy's fame, she is immediately moved by the work
she sees when she first visits Lucy's apartment. Prompted by her
bosses, Syd imagines getting her big break if she can persuade Lucy
to create new photographs for a special issue of the magazine. In
later drafts, Cholodenko toned down Syd's ``status-seeking'' to
create a character with more shades of gray, a woman torn between
the personal and professional sides of her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early on she was much more in the `All About Eve' camp,'' she
said, referring to the classic 1950 film with Anne Baxter as a
conniving young actress. ``But I wanted more complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in ``High Art'' there are no innocents. Syd has a
burgeoning romantic love for Lucy, but she is just as eager to use
Lucy for her own professional gain. Some may find the ambiguity of
the characters off-putting, and just as many are likely to be
unsettled by the film's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, people want to be uplifted at the end of a
movie,'' said Dolly Hall, the film's producer. ``So it's incredibly
hard to not only get people to invest in a film, but to do see a
movie which is a big downer at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Cholodenko discussed changing the film's ending, but
decided only the original conclusion could be true to the story,
Cholodenko said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it, and there were drafts when I tried to push
it in a different direction. But it just felt wrong,'' she said.
``The story needed to go in a certain direction, and anything less
I felt would really be a cop-out.''
</P>
<P>
   For her next film, Cholendenko is switching coasts. She is
developing a story about the music industry in Los Angeles, and
that film, like ``High Art,'' also will focus on the people behind
the glitter and glamour. But for now, she is still reveling in the
success of her first film, which was screened at last month's
Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was making the film, my only goal was to get through
this without feeling ashamed,'' she said. ``We made this film
without an agenda, we made it on our own terms, and that may never
happen for us again. That's what we want to enjoy.''

IN THE THICK OF SUMMER, EFFECTS OF CRIPPLING ICE STORM LINGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH BENJAMIN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. _ The four-inch-thick ice that encased six
upstate New York counties in January has long since melted, but the
havoc it wreaked is far from forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six months after the storm, power has been restored to
the 125,000 people who were without electricity, structural damage
has been repaired and the last of the downed tree limbs are being
collected and chipped.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of problems remain.
</P>
<P>
   Many farmers, who are an integral part of the region's economy,
are still struggling to put their lives back together. The
distribution of millions of dollars in federal and state aid that
could assist the farmers is tangled in red tape. The majestic trees
that once graced the Adirondack Mountains have been broken and
stripped of branches, which has crippled the maple industry and may
hurt tourism.
</P>
<P>
   The region, which straddles the Canadian border to the North and
Lake Champlain on the east, is no stranger to nature's wrath. In
the last three years, floods and blizzards have pounded the area.
But the ice storm that began on Jan. 5, transforming Clinton,
Essex, Franklin, St. Lawrence, Jefferson and Lewis counties was
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Five days of freezing rain followed by a snowstorm left
thousands of residents stranded in their homes without heat,
electricity and, in some cases, food. Nine people died during the
storm, most from carbon monoxide poisoning caused by generators or
space heaters operated in poorly ventilated rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The area's 1,400 dairy farmers suffered some of the most serious
losses, according to Donald LaPierre, executive director of the
Clinton County Farm Service Agency. Collectively, they dumped an
estimated $300,000 worth of milk that week, and some never
recovered from the financial setback. Already, more than 12 Clinton
County dairy farmers have sold their farms, LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   While homeowners have received more than $40 million in grants
and low-interest loans from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, the farmers are still waiting for compensation for loss of
livestock and decreased productivity due to the storm. Although
many had insurance, their policies did not cover damage done by ice
or other natural disasters, which are typically excluded under an
``act of God'' clause.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of dollars have been allocated to assist farmers,
LaPierre said. Just this week, the New York Emergency Management
Office announced a $2.8 million program that will reimburse farmers
up to $5,000 for lost cows. But distribution of these funds has
been held up by bureaucratic hassles.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are avenues we have to follow,'' said LaPierre, who is
still awaiting training on how to administer federal funds to
farmers and determine who is eligible to receive them. ``It's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, farmers are waiting and some are simply giving
up on farming and selling off their land.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was the last straw for some small dairy farmers who
had already grown weary of farming's many demands and low financial
return, said Joseph Giroux, a Clinton County legislator who also
owns about 150 head of cattle on a farm in the town of Plattsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle before, and the struggle continues,'' Giroux
said. ``This caused some people to give up, is all.''
</P>
<P>
   The maple industry did not escape the ice storm either. Until
January, maple farmers were the second-largest producers of syrup
in the Northeast. This year, about 380,000 taps couldn't be set due
to storm damage, according to the New York Agriculture Statistics
Service.
</P>
<P>
   It could be years before trees fully recover, according to Lewis
Staats, a maple expert at Cornell University Cooperative Extension
in Lake Placid.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, many maple farmers may have been forced out of
business and it will be too late, said Earl Parker, who owns about
250 acres of sugar bush 10 miles north of Plattsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to give up and I don't want to cut these trees
until I'm sure they're not going to produce,'' said the 63-year-old
farmer, who was the North Country's largest producer of maple syrup
in the until the storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But several logging companies have already contacted me. I
said `no,' but I know some farmers who said `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tree damage may also hurt the tourism industry. It remains to be
seen whether the millions who flock to the Adirondacks in the
summer stay away or leave early after glimpsing what some locals
have dubbed ``the uglification of the North Country.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry's saving grace may be that the worst tree damage is
on trails between Lake Placid and Keene, which are not heavily
used, said Katy Odell, communications director at the Lake
Placid/Essex County Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   The number of visitors may decline, however, come September and
October when fall foliage lovers, or ``leaf peepers,'' typically
travel. If they hear of the damage, these tourists may shun the
area in favor of Vermont or the Catskill Mountains, which could
cost millions in tourist dollars.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other effects of the ice storm on residents that
cannot be tallied or studied. The disaster left people feeling
fragile and vulnerable, feelings they won't soon shake off, said
Jeanie Roberts, executive director of the Clinton Northern Essex
Chapter of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least for the next few years, the broken trees will be
around us and we'll see the damage,'' Roberts said. ``We're more
acutely aware of the fact that this can happen here, not somewhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned a lesson that we'll remember for a long time.''

BOCELLI'S BLITZ 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time I heard Andrea Bocelli was last fall, a few weeks
after the September release of the Italian tenor's ``Romanza''
album on Philips. In an upscale restaurant, ``Romanza'' was the
soundtrack for lunch, and it wouldn't stay in the background. The
musicians I was interviewing couldn't stand the volume and
intensity of Bocelli's power ballads, found his passions
incompatible with their palates. So they asked if the music could
be turned down _ or off. The hostess was aghast. ``That record is
the reason people come here.'' So much for the chef ...
</P>
<P>
   Within the five years since the release of his first CD in Italy
in 1993, Bocelli has become one of the hottest stars in the record
business. Last year he sold 14 million CDs worldwide, coming in
second only to the Spice Girls. He made his first US appearance
last April, so he is not yet a household name here, although
``Romanza'' has been on the world music charts for months and
recently went platinum in this country. ``Aria,'' Bocelli's
recently released record of operatic music, immediately went to the
top of the classical charts. PBS made a substantial contribution to
Bocelli's popularity, as it did to the Three Tenors and Andre Rieu
before him, by repeatedly broadcasting his video, ``A Night in
Tuscany,'' during its December fund-raising period. Bocelli's first
US tour begins in Pittsburgh in July and brings him to Great Woods
Aug. 4; the seats in the pavilion are long gone, but some lawn
tickets remain. People Magazine discovered Bocelli last month and
told his fans that the unshaven tenor likes cologne (Opium and
Azzaro Pour Homme) which he wears ``for myself, not for other
people.''
</P>
<P>
   At 39 Bocelli is a late bloomer for a pop star, even for an
aspiring opera singer. He tells interviewers that from childhood he
always loved listening to opera, always enjoyed singing on family
occasions. A career in music, especially on the operatic stage,
seemed out of the question because he has been blind since a soccer
accident when he was 12 _ a fact unmentioned in his personal
publicity and a forbidden subject in interviews. In 1986, Bocelli
finished his law degree at the University of Pisa and spent a year
as a public defender, but he couldn't resist the lure of music. He
auditioned for former Met tenor Franco Corelli, who accepted him as
a pupil. To pay for the lessons, Bocelli took jobs in piano bars
(in addition to piano, he plays saxophone and flute). He was often
too self-conscious to sing, but when he did, he chose saloon songs
associated with Frank Sinatra and Charles Aznavour.
</P>
<P>
   His rise to celebrity was unexpected and swift. In 1992, the
Italian pop star Zucchero had a new song called ``Miserere'' that
he wanted to record with Luciano Pavarotti. To interest the
tenorissimo, he made a demo of the song, and the tenor he chose was
Bocelli. When Pavarotti heard the demo, he reportedly said, ``You
don't need me'' _ but went ahead and recorded the song anyway.
Pavarotti was unavailable to tour with Zucchero, but Bocelli was
ready and eager; audience response was tremendous and spontaneous,
and soon he had his own solo spot on Zucchero's show. Television
appearances during the annual San Remo festival and competition
made Bocelli a national star. In 1994, he recorded his first album
for the Sugar label in Italy. In 1995, ``Con Te Partiro'' (``Time
to Say Goodbye'') became an international hit, selling millions of
copies across Europe; a bilingual duet version with Sarah Brightman
was also a big success, especially in Germany _ Brightman first
heard Bocelli and the song in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   What is interesting about this story is that Bocelli became a
pop star almost by accident. Most of the great Italian tenors from
Enrico Caruso to Pavarotti have sung Neapolitan songs and pop
music. For this historical reason Bocelli went along with the game,
but he also hoped it would open the door to concerts and even
opera. In an interview in the May issue of Britain's Classic CD
magazine, Bocelli said, ``Pop was a very important medium. It was
the best way to get myself known to more people quickly and,
without the pop success, no one would have accepted me on the
classical side. There have been thousands of difficulties and
questions about me being able to do classical. A lot of people
brought up the problem that I wouldn't be able to see the
orchestral director and most people thought it would be impossible
for me to act on stage. These two points have been blown away,
because the facts speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Most crossover has been in the opposite direction _ not since
Grace Moore in the 1930s has a popular entertainer made a
successful career in opera, although Mary Martin toyed with the
idea. Michael Bolton recently made an operatic album, but he has
spent too many years putting his voice through the shredder. In
1993, Bocelli appeared onstage in the short role of Macduff in
Verdi's ``Macbeth'' in Pisa, and earlier this year he sang Rodolfo
in a production of Puccini's ``La Boheme'' in Sardinia that was
televised. The performance hasn't been commercially released on
video, but Bocelli fans have eagerly circulated copies of their
off-the-air tapes.
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing performance, and people who watch it will cry
all the way through ``La Boheme'' for the first time in years.
Bocelli does not portray Rodolfo as a blind man; there's a lot of
horseplay and emotional embraces that unobtrusively guide the tenor
to where he needs to be, like the railing on the stairs. There are
some wonderful rehearsed effects, as when Bocelli lifts the
fainting Mimi in his arms and carries her over to the bed where she
will die. But many of the best touches seem spontanous, as when
Rodolfo steals a kiss from Mimi when she isn't looking, or when he
pulls his chair closer to her so he can listen more intently to her
aria. Overall Bocelli acts the part better than many a sighted
tenor. And although he is still figuring out how to pace himself
through a full performance, he sings it better than anyone since
the young Jose Carreras 25 years ago. Because his singing is so
pure, honest, and full of belief he makes everyone sing better too
_ this may be the performance of soprano Daniela Dessi's career.

CARLOS CASTANEDA A MYSTERY IN LIFE, DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda died April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Los Angeles Times'' reported Friday that the bestselling
author and self-proclaimed ``sorcerer'' died at his home in Los
Angeles of liver cancer, that he was cremated immediately and that
his ashes were spirited away to Mexico, according to the Culver
City, Calif., mortuary that handled his remains.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman in the office of Castaneda's Los Angeles
literary agent, Tracy Kramer, said it is Kramer's opinion and the
opinion of others who worked closely with Castaneda that the author
evanesced _ disappeared like mist from this world in much the same
way Castaneda believed his teacher Don Juan and his group did in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to officially die in order for his will to be
executed,'' the spokesman said. ``We expect a statement on Dr.
Castaneda's Cleargreen Web page stating that Carlos Castaneda left
this world in the tradition of the Mexican sorcerers of antiquity
in his lineage.'' The Web address is www.castaneda.org.
</P>
<P>
   Cleargreen is a Los Angeles company set up by Castaneda to
market and handle publicity for his books, seminars and workshops.
</P>
<P>
   If Castaneda didn't vanish into thin air, he may as well have.
It's doubtful there's ever been a cult personage shrouded in more
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow himself to be photographed, have his voice
recorded or grant many interviews. No one knows when he was born,
where, or even his real name.
</P>
<P>
   One of his autobiographical accounts reports that Carlos Ce'sar
Arana Castaneda immigrated to the United States in 1951. He
reportedly was born Christmas Day 1925 in Sao Paolo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the Castaneda mystique is based on the fact that even
his closest friends aren't sure who he is,'' wrote his ex-wife,
Margaret Runyan Castaneda, in a 1997 memoir that Castaneda tried to
keep from being published.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda denied being married.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever he was or in whatever manner he ``moved on,'' there's no
denying Castaneda's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   His 10 bestselling books on the teachings of Yaqui shaman Don
Juan's worlds of non-ordinary reality galvanized a generation in
the late 1960s and early '70s. Many viewed him as America's
godfather of the New Age movement. His books were subsequently
translated into 17 languages, adding millions more to his fan base.
While his popularity has waned in this country, his works are just
now being discovered and revered in places such as Germany and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's adventures began in 1960, when he met Don Juan Matus
in Nogales, Ariz. He was an anthropology student at UCLA,
collecting information for a doctorate on the use of hallucinogenic
peyote cactus by indigenous peoples. He was told by a mutual friend
that Matus was an expert on peyote.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda thought he was studying the elderly Yaqui Indian, but
Juan Matus was studying him. Castaneda became his apprentice.
Encouraged by Don Juan, Castaneda wrote about his indoctrination
and participation in the world of seers, witches and beings from
``unfathomable'' worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's thesis, published in 1968 by the University of
California Press, became an international best-seller, ``The
Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued publishing over the next 30 years. ``The Wheel of
Time: The Shamans of Ancient Mexico, Their Thoughts about Life,
Death and the Universe''is scheduled to be released in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Castaneda's Cleargreen Corp. said that his
works will continue to be published and that there are ``things
written down that have not yet come out.''
</P>
<P>
   She regards Castaneda's company as the carrier of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if people want to reach infinity, the tools
are available,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   I met Carlos Castaneda last summer in a Cuban restaurant near
West Hollywood. The interview came about because of a workshop
sponsored by Castaneda that was coming to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He did not notice me when I first walked in. He was looking down
at his table, elbows propped, head between his palms like a sleepy
kid in study hall. He did not look well then. He was very thin.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked up, my eyes met the eyes of the most famous
sorcerer in the world. These were sober eyes, steady eyes that
reeled in my awareness and held it with unbending intent.
</P>
<P>
   As if reading my mind, he said: ``There is nothing to Carlos
Castaneda. Personality is a pretense. Fame? Success? Who gives a
(expletive)? If we weren't so involved in ourselves, we wouldn't do
such barbaric things to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He then smiled mischievously, and I joined him for a long,
pleasant lunch.
</P>
<P>
   As for who Carlos Castaneda really was, you'll have to decide
for yourself. For me, he was the real thing. &QL;

 UNDATED: ... Dessi's career.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are six Bocelli CDs, including a guest appearance (one
number) on a Deutsche Grammophon album, ``A Concert for the
World,'' and there is some duplication among them. ``Romanza,'' the
first CD with worldwide distribution, is actually a compilation of
the juciest power ballads from the first two albums on Sugar.
Philips has followed up with ``Aria'' and ``Viaggio Italiano''
(``Italian Voyage''), which was recorded, paradoxically, in Moscow.
This is a collection of five additional arias (including the
inevitable ``Nessun dorma''), Neapolitan songs, and ``sacred''
selections heard in arrangements that recall the high 1930s _ the
legendary Beniamino Gigli could have stepped into these
arrangements without a hitch, which is probably the point.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Pilavacchi, president of Philips Records, says, ``Andrea
Bocelli's voice touched me right from the very first minute I heard
it _ that's the reaction everyone has. I think he came to Philips
because it was his dream to make classical records and sing opera.
He will still make pop records, in fact he's making one now, but
most of his activity will be in the classical field. He's doing a
sacred album for us, and there will be a video to go along with
that, and we plan to record a complete `Boheme' with Myun-Wha Chung
conducting.''
</P>
<P>
   Bocceli's pop singing makes an immediate impression because of
the natural emotion in his voice and the sincerity of his
expression. But it doesn't wear well _ the music is
undistinguished, the orchestrations caloric, the electronics
wearing, the context so crassly commercial. Also Bocelli doesn't
vary his strategy enough. He does adjust his voice a bit, roughing
up and thinning out his middle range so that he doesn't sound
overbearing or pretentious. But structures nearly all his pop songs
the same way; they begin lightly and conversationally, then the
full voice kicks in for the big tune and the climaxes. Apart from
the deliberate casual roughness, Bocelli sings very straight _ he's
very careful not to put his voice through the shredder _ and from
the rhythmic point of view, pretty square.
</P>
<P>
   The opera singing is marked by the same natural emotion and
sincerity, and it is better. Pilavacchi says Bocelli prefers to
sing unmiked, as he has in his operatic performances and classical
concerts. The voice does not seem large; it is the quality that
counts. The range is extensive _ he has no fear of high C, knocking
off a string of them in Pavarotti's old show piece from Donizetti's
``La Fille du Regiment,'' and even ventures above that in an aria
from Bellini's ``I Puritani.'' For the most part, he shies away
from the dramatic repertoire, and the heaviest arias tend to
receive the least satisfactory performances.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly and automatically Bocelli has been compared to
Pavarotti, who paved the way. Pavarotti and the Other Two may not
have built a vast new audience for opera, as promised, but they
have certainly built a huge new public that wants more of the same,
and Bocelli is ready to supply it. To these ears, Bocelli and
Pavarotti don't sound or sing much alike. A better comparison is to
the Italian tenor idol of the generation before Pavarotti, Giuseppe
di Stefano. Bocelli does not boast the exceptional beauty of tone
that di Stefano enjoyed in his youth, but he shares his
predecessor's vivid diction and generous, authentic emotionality,
reinforced by a shared technical flaw. Both tenors have trouble
with managing the transitional notes between the upper middle voice
and the top tones, the so-called ``passaggio.'' Both Bocelli and di
Stefano sound raw and strained on these pitches, but this problem
does make them sound sincere, the way an untrained folksinger does.
Di Stefano's faulty technique and undisciplined lifestyle
foreshortened his career _ his great days were over by the time he
had reached Bocelli's current age. The only price Bocelli is
currently paying is in top tones that don't invariably carry the
full resonance of the rest of his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Bocelli is disarmingly modest about his vocalism. Repeatedly he
tells interviewers that the more he learns about singing, the more
he realizes he needs to know; he speaks with infinite respect of
his predecessors, whom he regards as his superiors. There are
things Bocelli hasn't mastered; not all of his ornamentation is
elegantly turned, for example. But Bocelli doesn't need to speak as
modestly as he does. He is an instinctive, natural musician who has
worked hard to learn what he needs to know about style. Whatever
his formula for pop songs, he doesn't sing all his arias the same
way. His most beautiful performance to date is ``Cielo e mar'' from
Ponchielli's ``La Gioconda,'' which he phrases poetically and with
many shades of dynamics; the performance is both intimate and
expansive. Mario Lanza, to make another obvious comparison, was a
more solid singer; Bocelli is more imaginative.
</P>
<P>
   The video ``A Night in Tuscany'' (Polygram) presents an
idealized portrait of Bocelli's life _ we see him riding a white
horse through woods and ocean surf; he plays chess in a bistro;
chats with his family, which maintains vineyards and olive groves
and bottles a Bocelli Chianti; he ripples through Liszt's
``Liebestraum'' at the piano. There are glimpses of his wife,
Enrica, whom he met in one of his piano bars, and their two small
sons. He says he likes to spend time with them at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   The video doesn't add much to what comes over on the records
because it doesn't show Bocelli very often when he is actually
singing _ it repeatedly cuts away to the orchestra, or to his
partners in duet, opera soprano Nuccia Focile, pop stars Marta
Sanchez and Zucchero, and the unclassifiable Brightman, who looks a
little like Zucchero scrubbed up and poured into a gown. For
Pavarotti's enormous handkerchief, Bocelli substitutes long silk
scarves as a visual signature. Its to Bocelli's advantage that he's
never seen the regulation tenors strut and pose, so he can't
imitate them; he doesn't even gesture. His colleagues ``act,'' mug
for the camera. Bocelli doesn't, so you like him for that. He
simply stands there and sings, his bushy head slightly inclined to
the microphones, pouring his heart out. When something has gone
well, an irresistible smile lights up and you love him, but you
already loved him the minute he opened his mouth to sing.

CARLOS CASTANEDA A MYSTERY IN LIFE, DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda died April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Los Angeles Times'' reported Friday that the bestselling
author and self-proclaimed ``sorcerer'' died at his home in Los
Angeles of liver cancer, that he was cremated immediately and that
his ashes were spirited away to Mexico, according to the Culver
City, Calif., mortuary that handled his remains.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman in the office of Castaneda's Los Angeles
literary agent, Tracy Kramer, said it is Kramer's opinion and the
opinion of others who worked closely with Castaneda that the author
evanesced _ disappeared like mist from this world in much the same
way Castaneda believed his teacher Don Juan and his group did in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to officially die in order for his will to be
executed,'' the spokesman said. ``We expect a statement on Dr.
Castaneda's Cleargreen Web page stating that Carlos Castaneda left
this world in the tradition of the Mexican sorcerers of antiquity
in his lineage.'' The Web address is www.castaneda.org.
</P>
<P>
   Cleargreen is a Los Angeles company set up by Castaneda to
market and handle publicity for his books, seminars and workshops.
</P>
<P>
   If Castaneda didn't vanish into thin air, he may as well have.
It's doubtful there's ever been a cult personage shrouded in more
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow himself to be photographed, have his voice
recorded or grant many interviews. No one knows when he was born,
where, or even his real name.
</P>
<P>
   One of his autobiographical accounts reports that Carlos Ce'sar
Arana Castaneda immigrated to the United States in 1951. He
reportedly was born Christmas Day 1925 in Sao Paolo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the Castaneda mystique is based on the fact that even
his closest friends aren't sure who he is,'' wrote his ex-wife,
Margaret Runyan Castaneda, in a 1997 memoir that Castaneda tried to
keep from being published.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda denied being married.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever he was or in whatever manner he ``moved on,'' there's no
denying Castaneda's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   His 10 bestselling books on the teachings of Yaqui shaman Don
Juan's worlds of non-ordinary reality galvanized a generation in
the late 1960s and early '70s. Many viewed him as America's
godfather of the New Age movement. His books were subsequently
translated into 17 languages, adding millions more to his fan base.
While his popularity has waned in this country, his works are just
now being discovered and revered in places such as Germany and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's adventures began in 1960, when he met Don Juan Matus
in Nogales, Ariz. He was an anthropology student at UCLA,
collecting information for a doctorate on the use of hallucinogenic
peyote cactus by indigenous peoples. He was told by a mutual friend
that Matus was an expert on peyote.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda thought he was studying the elderly Yaqui Indian, but
Juan Matus was studying him. Castaneda became his apprentice.
Encouraged by Don Juan, Castaneda wrote about his indoctrination
and participation in the world of seers, witches and beings from
``unfathomable'' worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's thesis, published in 1968 by the University of
California Press, became an international best-seller, ``The
Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued publishing over the next 30 years. ``The Wheel of
Time: The Shamans of Ancient Mexico, Their Thoughts about Life,
Death and the Universe''is scheduled to be released in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Castaneda's Cleargreen Corp. said that his
works will continue to be published and that there are ``things
written down that have not yet come out.''
</P>
<P>
   She regards Castaneda's company as the carrier of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if people want to reach infinity, the tools
are available,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   I met Carlos Castaneda last summer in a Cuban restaurant near
West Hollywood. The interview came about because of a workshop
sponsored by Castaneda that was coming to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He did not notice me when I first walked in. He was looking down
at his table, elbows propped, head between his palms like a sleepy
kid in study hall. He did not look well then. He was very thin.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked up, my eyes met the eyes of the most famous
sorcerer in the world. These were sober eyes, steady eyes that
reeled in my awareness and held it with unbending intent.
</P>
<P>
   As if reading my mind, he said: ``There is nothing to Carlos
Castaneda. Personality is a pretense. Fame? Success? Who gives a
(expletive)? If we weren't so involved in ourselves, we wouldn't do
such barbaric things to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He then smiled mischievously, and I joined him for a long,
pleasant lunch.
</P>
<P>
   As for who Carlos Castaneda really was, you'll have to decide
for yourself. For me, he was the real thing. &QL;

THE BERRY GORDY OF TROPICAL LATIN MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALISA VALDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when the term ``Latin music''
referred to music exported from Latin America. But in the past
decade, Latin music has become a lucrative American business.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino population in the United States grew from 14.6
million in 1980 to 22.4 million in 1990, an increase of 53 percent.
The United States is now the fifth-largest Spanish-speaking nation,
and Spanish speakers are the fastest-growing immigrant group here.
With the shifting demographics has come astounding growth in the
domestic Latin music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Exact figures are tough to determine. The Recording Industry
Association of America started tracking the genre only last year,
and Sound-scan, which monitors national record sales, collects data
only from major music retail chains. (Most Latin rec-ords still are
sold out of mom-and-pop stores.)
</P>
<P>
   But Billboard estimates annual growth in domestic Latin music
sales at more than 20 percent. The New York Times reported that
Radio City Music Hall now books Latin acts for 50 percent of its
shows. The most popular radio stations in at least two major cities
_ Los Angeles and Miami _ are in Spanish. Artists such as Boyz II
Men, Celine Dion, Madonna, and Toni Braxton recently have released
reverse crossover recordings, in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the domestic Latin music market is obvious in the
bustling, spacious SoHo lobby of RMM Records and Video Corp. Gold
records line the walls; phones ring incessantly. The company made
more than $20 million last year, a 40 percent increase over the
year before, making it the world's most successful label for
tropical Latin music (Afro-Caribbean-based music such as salsa,
merengue, and bachata). Seven years ago, 80 percent of RMM sales
were generated in Latin America, but since 1994, the majority of
sales have been coming from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is changing,'' said RMM owner and president, Ralph
Mercado Jr. ``And the way I see it, we represent that change.''
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in Brooklyn, Mercado, 56, is to salsa and
merengue what Berry Gordy was to soul and R&AMP;B. He also has been
called ``the new Emilio Estefan,'' a comparison that equates his
power with that of the Miami-based record company executive who
also is producer, manager, and husband of pop star Gloria Estefan.
In April, Billboard presented Mercado with its El Premio
lifetime-achievement trophy. A spokesperson said the award ``is
given to those Latino artists and music industry executives who
have helped expand Spanish-language genres beyond their Latino
followers.''
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Dominican dockworker and a Puerto Rican factory
worker, Mercado grew up hearing the music of his parents' homelands
in the hallways of his family's fifth-floor walk-up. His dad, he
said, taught him to dance the merengue as soon as he could walk.
</P>
<P>
   Now the owner of a five-bedroom luxury condominium towering 56
stories above Lincoln Center, Mercado has not forgotten his modest
roots. His speech is pure street Newyorican. He still finds his
acts by hanging out in clubs. He treats owners of mom and pop
stores the same way he treats Tower Records. He wears a pinky ring.
And, even though his office is surrounded by some of the finest
restaurants in the world, his mother, Manuela, 81, comes to the
office several times a week to cook him rice and beans.
</P>
<P>
   The category of Latin music is very diverse. The largest seller
under the Latin umbrella nationally is Mexican/regional, which
totals more than 50 percent of all sales. Most of these sales occur
in the southwestern states like Texas and California.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Latin music accounts for 23 percent of all Latin music
sales nationally. The biggest market for tropical Latin music in
the world is the Northeast, with New York City as the top consumer
base. The second-biggest market is Puerto Rico; the third is
southeastern Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Of the tropical market, Mercado's RMM accounts for 40 percent of
all sales. The remaining 60 percent is divided among various
labels, ranging from WEA Latino and Sony Latin to the independent
Caiman Rec-ords; no company has a larger share of the pie than RMM.
Five years ago, RMM ``could not even get into Sam Goody's
bathroom,'' said Vicente Iturbides, national director of sales and
marketing for RMM. Now, Sam Goody is RMM's biggest corporate
account.
</P>
<P>
   RMM's success comes thanks to a roster of more than 30 popular
artists, including the legendary Tito Puente and Celia Cruz, as
well as their modern counterparts Marc Anthony and India. Earlier
this year, Anthony, RMM's biggest seller, received Billboard's
tropical artist of the year award. Manny Manuel, the top-selling
merengue artist in Puerto Rico, records on RMM. Several artists who
were interviewed said they chose RMM because of the company's
``family atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Iturbides said that he has met nearly all of the presidents and
CEOs of tropical labels, and that ``none of them has the street
smarts, the savvy, and the gut instincts of Ralph Mercado, who grew
up on this music. He knows instinctively what the community
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercado's father, Ralph Sr., died when Mercado was 15 years old.
Mercado's mother worked for many years in a Brillo factory; she
also worked for the phone company. She still lives in the
fifth-floor walk-up where she raised her family, because she does
not want to move away from her friends. Mercado has offered to move
her many times, but she's not interested.
</P>
<P>
   At 14, Mercado went with some friends from the neighborhood to
the Palladium nightclub in Manhattan to hear his first live
concert: the Machito Orchestra. In an interview in his SoHo office,
he said that night changed his life forever. ``I was just
completely blown away. The energy, the colors, the sounds! I came
out of there knowing I had to be involved in this music somehow,
personally involved.''

BAUMBACH SCORES AGAIN WITH `MR. JEALOUSY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Noah Baumbach was praised for his first film, ``Kicking and
Screaming,'' about a bunch of guys who graduate from college but
can't seem to take the next step. With ``Mr. Jealousy,'' Baumbach
has taken the next step and made a terribly good film.
</P>
<P>
   His central figure is the well-meaning but emotionally confused
(and sadistically named) Lester Grimm, who is played
sympathetically by one of the most appealing young actors working
today, Eric Stoltz. Lester is kind of a loser for no good reason
except that he feels a little too sorry for himself to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   He's smart, but he just doesn't seem able to apply himself to
writing the fiction he knows he ought to be writing. He's sweet and
good looking, but he sabotages relationships by ruining them before
they can ruin themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When he meets Ramona (Annabella Sciorra), something clicks and
he seems to forget himself momentarily. Before he knows it, they
are a couple spending most of their free time together and edging
up to the moment when full commitment is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Just around then, Lester starts allowing his lifelong affliction
_ jealousy _ to poison his mind. Obsessed with Ramona's ex-lovers,
he focuses on one, a famed young writer named Dashiell (Chris
Eigeman), whose recent short story is a veiled description of his
affair with Ramona.
</P>
<P>
   Lester's perversity forces him to tail Dashiell and finally to
join Dashiell's therapy group, led by Dr. Poke (played by a
glum-looking Peter Bogdanovich). Lester isn't sure why he's doing
this. Is it to torture Dashiell in group for being a first-class
creep? Is it to learn about Ramona's taste in men? Or is it to
humiliate himself?
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Baumbach uses all of these motivations to come
up with some amusing, imaginative and charming situations. As
neurotically duplicitous as Lester must become to continue his
charade, he still remains likable, and this is problematic as he is
much more likable than Ramona, to whom duplicity comes more
naturally. In fact, it's a little tough to understand what Lester
sees in her. If Baumbach's movie has a flaw, it is that Ramona
seems a cardboard figure. Sciorra can't do much more with the
character than play her as a self-righteous runaround. She likes
flirting with ex-boyfriends, and she especially likes defending her
right to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Stoltz, who is executive producer on the film, gives, as always,
an intelligent and bemused performance that keeps us rooting for
the otherwise maddening Lester. As Stoltz seems to know, Baumbach
is definitely a filmmaker to watch.

`MULAN': `YENTL' WITH A DIFFERENT LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mulan,'' Disney's 36th animated full-length feature, is based
on a popular Chinese legend about a young woman named Mulan who
disguises herself as a man in order to take her aging father's
place in the Army. She suits up and answers the emperor's call in
the fight against the invading Huns.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the movie is full of catchy songs by Matthew Wilder and
David Zippel, and there is the dazzling Disney palette of colors
and the studio's renowned suppleness with a cartoon image. But,
boy, it's hard not to keep thinking that this movie is basically
``Yentl'' with a nose job.
</P>
<P>
   Barbra Streisand played the I.B. Singer character who dressed as
a male in order to get the kind of Talmud education that was denied
females. Her studies brought her face to face with the man she
loved, a fellow Talmud scholar. Oh, the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Mulan, on the other hand, looking like an Asian version of the
perky Sandra Bullock, is in drag in order to fulfill her ailing
father's obligations to his country. All this nobility leads to a
meeting with the handsome young commander of her unit, Shang (voice
of B.D. Wong), with whom she falls in love. (Shang's singing voice
is Donny Osmond's.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Yentl'' had Streisand's wondrous voice, a few melodic notches
above Mulan's singing voice _ Lea Salonga. (Ming-Na Wen of ``The
Joy Luck Club'' provides the speaking voice of Mulan.) In its
favor, ``Mulan,'' however, can boast the talents of Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   He is the voice of Mushu, a tiny dragon who is the equivalent of
the Robin Williams genie in ``Aladdin.'' That is, Murphy gets to
riff to his heart's content on the theme of being a less than
frightening dragon, and thank goodness because he gives a rather
dull movie whatever life it's got.
</P>
<P>
   The pint-sized dragon is sent by Mulan's ancestor spirits to
help the poor girl live through her rash adventure. As with all
Disney animated features, ``Mulan'' is admirable for the sheer
vastness of the project. Artists, animators and technicians
numbering more than 700 were employed in the making of the movie.
And it took two directors, Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft, to pull it
all together. Not to mention that it boasts one of the first, if
not the first Asian female protagonist in an animated feature.
</P>
<P>
   The voice acting is good overall, including Soon-Tek Oh as
Mulan's father; Harvey Fierstein as Mulan's comrade Yao; and Miguel
Ferrer as the evil Hun, Shan-Yu.

   SCI-YELLOWSTONE (Undated) _ Experts call Yellowstone the most

   (ED NOTE: Susan Paynter is the Metro page columnist for the Seattle
P-I)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PAYNTER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Without credibility, all the vivid quotes, funny turns
of phrase and piercing insights a columnist can craft aren't worth
the paper they're written in.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility does not mean never making an honest mistake. Or
that everyone agrees with or likes you. But, without being
believed, you've got zip, nada, bubkes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, award-winning Boston Globe news columnist Patricia
Smith became the latest journalist to learn that lesson the hard
way. She must have known it all along, but somehow chose to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won this year's American Society of Newspaper Editors'
Distinguished Writing Award for column writing. She was a finalist
in April for a Pulitzer Prize. And she resigned last week after an
internal investigation of her work revealed she had made up several
quotes and even fabricated a handful of people featured in her
acclaimed, twice-weekly column.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, her editors admitted her colorful copy seemed too
good to be true _ and apparently was.
</P>
<P>
   In last Friday's farewell, Smith's apology was predictable, just
better written than those preceding her in journalism's hall of
shame.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted her columns to jolt. To be talked about. She had set
her own expectations too high and spread herself too thin. So she
``tweaked'' her copy to achieve the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tweak'' is a pretty polite word for faking news and making up
sources. And while Smith's explanation was surely painful, it was
also spiked with self-pity. ``To those colleagues and readers who
salivated daily at the thought of my head on a platter, congrats,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not the first to go this route. Another Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporter, Janet Cooke, resigned from The Washington
Post under similar circumstances in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month a series of fabrications caught up with
widely published free-lance reporter Stephen Glass. He admitted
making up people, events _ even a company _ in a report on cyber
crime printed in The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Justifiably, journalism is combing its conscience and checking
the batteries in the smoke-and-mirrors detector.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, because those who break the commandment ``Thou
shalt not defraud the reader'' don't only lose their own jobs. They
lose ground for all the reporters and editors who earn their keep
in column inches every day they go to press.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's contract with the readers is unforgiving. It says
be accurate, be fair, and, if humanly possible, be first. Do it
against the clock amid noise and chaos and sometimes conflicting
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers may still blame you for bringing them bad news. But
you have a chance to inform and maybe even help them. And, although
the payoff may not come in the form of a nice fat paycheck, it's
there in personal access to the events and people worth knowing
about.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist's contract is not one bit less binding, but it can
be a lot more personal. Expectations are high.
</P>
<P>
   Your face, opinions, personality and sometimes even your
emotions stand in the public square. If you take on difficult and
touchy issues _ as Smith apparently did _ the reaction can be swift
and highly personal.
</P>
<P>
   Without a tender heart, a columnist touches no one. But it had
better be wrapped in a pretty tough hide.
</P>
<P>
   Even after decades in the newspaper business, anonymous reader
attacks can take my breath away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the anger in the voice of one male caller stayed with
me after a column on moms juggling work with the raising of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in the mirror, Susan!'' the voice spat. ``You'll see
what's wrong with this country and its kids. It's selfish,
egotistical, money-grubbing mothers like you! If you can't live on
your husband's salary, you have no right to have a child!''
</P>
<P>
   As a columnist, I have had people write and call radio talk
shows to wish the worst pain, not only for me but for my family. A
few have wished I could still be ``aborted.''
</P>
<P>
   But columnists also hear the kind-est possible comments. And,
once in a while, someone writes to say, ``I don't always agree with
you, but this time you made me think about this in a new way.''
That's the best.
</P>
<P>
   Real life _ and the people who live it _ far outstrip fiction
any day. Their quotes and personas may not always fit neatly into a
column's preconceptions. But being surprised is more fun.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth.

WINDOWS 98 PACKS TV PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Any new product succeeds or fails based on what might
be called its bomb index, how much bang it gives for the buck. In
the case of Windows 98, the index should also include the length of
the fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from antitrust issues, discussion about the
operating-system upgrade Microsoft Corp. will release Thursday has
focused on what it will deliver right away _ smoother operation,
more Internet features, more disk space, for example _ and whether
those things are worth about $90 at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important over the long term are new features in Windows
98 that most consumers may not notice at first: software that turns
the personal computer into an intelligent, interactive television
and delivers mountains of news, entertainment and financial
information without tying up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The reason these features may take awhile to ignite consumer
interest is that they require a television tuner card, an add-in
device still far from commonplace in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   But hardware makers are pushing to make tuner cards an easy,
inexpensive option for consumers. Microsoft, by adding the software
to Windows today, is aiming to foster and profit from another
explosive business as the computer and the television come together
at last.
</P>
<P>
   Sound cards provide a good analogy, said Steve Guggenheimer, the
Microsoft product manager responsible for its digital television
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we added sound support into the operating system,
adding a sound card was pretty hard to to. Now you can't find a PC
without a sound card,'' Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've added the fundamental building blocks for TV
reception, it will start to increase over time,'' he said. ``It's
another logical extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes new software called WebTV for Windows that,
in conjunction with a tuner card, turns the PC into a television
monitor and program guide. It lets the user make transactions or
find out more about a topic _ tools that are similar to, though
separate from, those in Microsoft's WebTV set-top products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just used the WebTV brand to represent the TV technologies
that have been added to the PC,'' Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also includes a similar technology from Intel Corp.
called Intercast that combines images and data, an example of which
is NBC's coverage of the U.S. Open over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers could follow the action on San Francisco's
Olympic Club golf course in the conventional way, but Intercast
viewers could click on graphics on their PC screens to study the
course hole by hole, find biographical data about the contestants
and learn more about the PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation packaged with Windows 98 is a
data-broadcasting service developed by a Phoenix company called
WavePhore.
</P>
<P>
   Called WaveTop, it distributes various types of news,
entertainment, financial and other data using a portion of the
television signal called the ``vertical blanking interval,'' the
horizontal black stripe that appears on a television screen when
the vertical-hold control goes haywire. Users view the information
in a browser, just as they would on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   WavePhore reaches 100 U.S. markets, about 85 percent of the
population, through a distribution deal with the Public
Broadcasting Service.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar in concept to the popular Pointcast service on the
Internet, but because the data is sent in a TV signal, it can be
updated constantly without tying up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   WaveTop transmits 170 megabytes of data every day _ 10 megabytes
an hour for 17 hours a day, general manager Sandy Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   WavePhore officially launched the service in April, but is
counting on a boost from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's going to generate a tremendous awareness of
broadcasting data to your home PC,'' Goldman said. ``That's one of
the main objectives for us _ to hitch our wagon to Microsoft, to
help us educate the market. And second, by including our software
in (Windows 98), you don't have to look for it _ it's already
included.''
</P>
<P>
   As demand grows, a number of manufacturers are vying to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ATI Technologies makes a product called the ``All-In-Wonder''
that combines TV-tuner and graphics adapter capabilities, and
replaces the computer's existing video card.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Hauppauge Computer Works and ixMicro, make
boards that work in conjunction with the existing video card.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary, but have dropped substantially in the past couple
of years, said Mike Richmond, manager of broadcast products in
Intel's consumer products group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really a testament to the cost reduction that's very
common in our industry,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   A few computer makers have begun including TV tuners as standard
equipment, but it will be awhile before they become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers ``don't want to make a device standard until
they can get it for under $30,'' which typically means $75 to the
customer, said Scott Naylor, product manager at ixMicro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to get the cost down low enough to where it can
be part of a standard machine,'' Naylor said. ``And we're also
working with them to do build-to-order options.''
</P>
<P>
   A tuner board is often a good option for someone buying a new
computer for a home office, he said. For $80 or so, it adds TV
features that would cost a few hundred dollars in a separate unit.
The same logic applies in college dorms, where computers are
common, but space and money are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Tuner boards are also popular with stock brokers, who use them
in desktop computers to monitor television news, and in Pacific Rim
countries, where tiny apartments make it difficult to install a
television and a computer monitor, said Rufus Connell, an analyst
with Frost &AMP; Sullivan in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, adding TV functions to the PC is not about
replacing the television, Microsoft's Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of putting the PC in the living room and
everyone in the family huddling around it to watch TV,'' he said.
``It's a matter of getting TV information in another area, when I'm
not close to a TV.''
</P>

<P>
   ``He shall be hailed as son of God, and they shall call him the
son of the most high'' sounds like a passage from the New Testament
describing Jesus Christ, but it comes from a Dead Sea scroll that
scholars say was written a generation before Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   Written in Aramaic on a piece of leather about the size of a
business envelope, the Son of God text contains language almost
identical to the New Testament account of the angel Gabriel's words
to Mary in the book of Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say the text bolsters an increasingly popular
theory that there was little original about the divine claims by
the carpenter from Nazareth.
</P>
<P>
   Yet overlooked for decades is evidence that the scholars are
wrong and that this little-known document -- along with other Dead
Sea Scrolls -- could not have been written until well after the
rise of Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians and Jews, the implications are as important as
the Bible itself. Claiming that the Son of God text and other Dead
Sea Scrolls are ancient, scroll scholars have convinced publishers
of Christian Bibles to make hundreds of changes to some recent
editions of the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   But the Son of God text contains long-ignored Hebrew vowel marks
and words written in tiny letters, neither of which came into use
until centuries after 25 BC, the year that scroll scholars
speculate the Son of God text was written.
</P>
<P>
   And just as important as the physical evidence attesting to the
scroll's age are the ideas it contains and the way they are
expressed.
</P>
<P>
   Its verses describe the coming of a divine messiah who would be
the son of God -- terms that some rabbis and scholars say would
have been foreign and offensive to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that a Jew of that time didn't write this,''
said Rabbi Kenneth Weiss of El Paso, Texas. ``It's not a Jewish way
to refer to a messiah, and I don't believe a Jewish source would
ever use that phrase.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after seeing a copy of the original Son of God text, Murray
Friedman, director of Feinstein Center for American-Jewish History
at Philadelphia's Temple University, could not believe it was found
among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable!'' he said. ``If this is real ... Jesus has
been authenticated. If it's a BC document, it announces in strict,
clear-cut terms the arrival of the messiah. But if it's after, it's
worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Hershel Shanks, editor of Biblical Archaeological Review
magazine, has written a new book on the scrolls that comes within
shouting distance of Friedman's view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the 'son of God,' a designation that is
strongly associated with Jesus as messiah in Christian theology is
referred to in a Dead Sea Scroll text called 4Q246,'' Shanks writes
in ``The Mystery and Meaning of the Dead Sea Scrolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Forced to speculate on how a supposedly pre-Christian text could
refer to the coming messiah as divine, Shanks says the Son of God
text suggests Jews had come to accept that idea in the generation
before Jesus was born.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks also tells of a second little-known Qumran fragment that
speaks of the sonship of the messiah -- theologically, another term
for deity.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent presence of that very loaded concept so intrigued
scholars in 1955 that they subjected that fragment to infrared
analysis just to be sure, and then said nothing more about the
results for almost 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Disagreeing with the views of established scroll scholars,
Milton Fisher, a professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and former president of that institution, said
he does ``not think the Son of God text was written before the time
of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanoch Guy, professor of Hebrew and coordinator of Hebrew
Studies at Temple University in Philadelphia agreed that ``the
language is absolutely Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that this is a Christian text,'' he said of
the Son of God text.
</P>
<P>
   The Dead Sea Scrolls supposedly were written by a Jewish sect
over a period that began as early as 200 years before the birth of
Christ and ended early in the first century.
</P>
<P>
   About 68 AD, most scholars believe, the scrolls were stashed in
caves overlooking the Dead Sea where they remained undisturbed
until 1947 when an Arab shepherd boy stumbled upon them.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   But, even as Israel marks its 50th anniversary as a nation, many
questions remain about the origins of the scrolls. While the
scrolls are a national treasure to Israel and the basis for changes
in Christian Bibles, publishers of Jewish Bibles are reluctant to
go along, even though the scrolls are thought to be the oldest
existing copies of Jewish holy texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are really leaving the (Bible) as is,'' said
Helaine Denenberg, editorial assistant with the Jewish Publication
Society, North America's foremost publisher of Jewish Bibles.
Orthodox Jews are even more adamant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrolls are not from mainstream Judaism, but from an
extremist sect,'' said Rabbi Yehoshua Kaganoff of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the existence of the Son of God text was known only
to a handful of scholars. But in the mid-1990s, the entire text was
published, revealing striking New Testament themes: The text reads
in part, ``One nation shall trample on another nation ... (Then)
his kingdom (shall be) an everlasting kingdom ... He shall judge
the earth in righteousness, and everyone shall have peace ... and
every nation will submit to Him.'' (EDITOR'S NOTE: Parentheses
represent reconstructed passages.)
</P>
<P>
   In their efforts to portray the Son of God text as a
pre-Christian document, some scroll scholars theorize that it
referred to some figure who lived a century or more before the
birth of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence strongly suggests that the writer was aware of
New Testament theology, of Jesus and of the end of the world that
he described.

<P>
   KINDER, La. _ It's 4 a.m. on a Wednesday and the nearly vacant
Grand Casino Coushatta is a slot-player's paradise, with just a
handful of gamblers wandering among 2,300 gleaming machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the slowest time of the week. In a couple of
hours, our regular morning players will start coming in,'' said a
host at the gaming house that can hold 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The never-setting neon suns glow brightly overhead and the
casino pulses softly with an eerie blend of taped Muzak, beeping
machines and the occasional riveting cascade of coins into a metal
tray.
</P>
<P>
   And while idle blackjack and poker dealers stifle yawns,
janitors scrub rugs and men in blue jump suits rush around emptying
coins from machines, a hardy, dedicated few gamble on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won $2,250 one time, and $2,700 another time,'' said Felisa
Garza, 65, a San Antonio seamstress and a veteran of the gambling
graveyard shift.
</P>
<P>
   Garza spoke while tending a cigarette and steadily pumping
half-dollars into two 50-cent slots.
</P>
<P>
   Nine hours earlier, Garza and 32 others boarded a charter bus in
San Antonio. Many clutched pillows and tiny drink coolers for the
330-mile ride.
</P>
<P>
   With a second casino on the itinerary, it would be nearly 24
hours more before the gamblers are home in San Antonio, all weary,
some broke, but most ready to go again next week.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of players from cities around Texas, this is the
low and short road to the Vegas-style action.
</P>
<P>
   And for the Louisiana casinos that depend heavily on Texas
gamblers, the bus trade, humble though it might be, is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos subsidize the Texas bus trips so players pay little
or nothing for the ride. The casinos also often throw in a free
meal and complimentary drinks.
</P>
<P>
   And, since everyone sleeps on the bus, there is no hotel bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't drink. I don't go to dances or movies. I don't do
nothing. This is like a day off for me, to go out. And even if you
don't win, it's a lot of fun,'' she said as the cherries and
diamonds whirl past.
</P>
<P>
   Even at this hour in early June, anything can happen to the
truly lucky, as a gleaming white sports car waiting nearby attests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Win a car for 25 cents. Win a BMW Z-3 and $10,000 cash. Play
Super Grand Bonus,'' read the signs on the quarter machines.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case anyone forgets what this is all about,
photographs of smiling winners grasping giant fake checks decorate
the casino walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than Vegas. It's a better bus, better food and
they treat us like people,'' said Josie Ramirez, who has been going
twice a week to Louisiana for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 65, and in Vegas, they don't have patience. It's more
relaxing here than any place,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacinto Perales, 60, who operates a charter service in South
Texas, once hauled gamblers to Las Vegas, a 2,500-mile round trip.
But for the last five or six years, he has been running east.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly our customers are senior citizens and most of them are
regulars. Some go every week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people win. That's why they go with me. We go
at the right time of night and people know which machines pay.
You've got to know your machines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip begins at 7 p.m. on a Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours later, Perales flips on the inside bus lights and
gives the wakeup call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning. We're in Kinder, Louisiana. We'll be at the
casino in about five minutes, so please start waking up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As the bus pulls into the casino's vast parking lot, a Jeep
escort with a blinking yellow light attached swoops out and leads
the bus.
</P>
<P>
   Perales gives the customary briefing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be here until 8 a.m. and during our five-hour stay, you
cannot come back to the bus. You don't have to play but you do have
to remain inside the casino,'' he said, speaking much as a teacher
would to a busload of school kids.

WINDOWS 98 PACKS TV PUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Any new product succeeds or fails based on what might
be called its bomb index, how much bang it gives for the buck. In
the case of Windows 98, the index should also include the length of
the fuse.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from antitrust issues, discussion about the
operating-system upgrade Microsoft Corp. will release Thursday has
focused on what it will deliver right away _ smoother operation,
more Internet features, more disk space, for example _ and whether
those things are worth about $90 at retail.
</P>
<P>
   Just as important over the long term are new features in Windows
98 that most consumers may not notice at first: software that turns
the personal computer into an intelligent, interactive television
and delivers mountains of news, entertainment and financial
information without tying up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   The reason these features may take awhile to ignite consumer
interest is that they require a television tuner card, an add-in
device still far from commonplace in the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   But hardware makers are pushing to make tuner cards an easy,
inexpensive option for consumers. Microsoft, by adding the software
to Windows today, is aiming to foster and profit from another
explosive business as the computer and the television come together
at last.
</P>
<P>
   Sound cards provide a good analogy, said Steve Guggenheimer, the
Microsoft product manager responsible for its digital television
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we added sound support into the operating system,
adding a sound card was pretty hard to to. Now you can't find a PC
without a sound card,'' Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we've added the fundamental building blocks for TV
reception, it will start to increase over time,'' he said. ``It's
another logical extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes new software called WebTV for Windows that,
in conjunction with a tuner card, turns the PC into a television
monitor and program guide. It lets the user make transactions or
find out more about a topic _ tools that are similar to, though
separate from, those in Microsoft's WebTV set-top products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just used the WebTV brand to represent the TV technologies
that have been added to the PC,'' Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also includes a similar technology from Intel Corp.
called Intercast that combines images and data, an example of which
is NBC's coverage of the U.S. Open over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   Television viewers could follow the action on San Francisco's
Olympic Club golf course in the conventional way, but Intercast
viewers could click on graphics on their PC screens to study the
course hole by hole, find biographical data about the contestants
and learn more about the PGA tour.
</P>
<P>
   Another innovation packaged with Windows 98 is a
data-broadcasting service developed by a Phoenix company called
WavePhore.
</P>
<P>
   Called WaveTop, it distributes various types of news,
entertainment, financial and other data using a portion of the
television signal called the ``vertical blanking interval,'' the
horizontal black stripe that appears on a television screen when
the vertical-hold control goes haywire. Users view the information
in a browser, just as they would on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   WavePhore reaches 100 U.S. markets, about 85 percent of the
population, through a distribution deal with the Public
Broadcasting Service.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar in concept to the popular Pointcast service on the
Internet, but because the data is sent in a TV signal, it can be
updated constantly without tying up a telephone line.
</P>
<P>
   WaveTop transmits 170 megabytes of data every day _ 10 megabytes
an hour for 17 hours a day, general manager Sandy Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   WavePhore officially launched the service in April, but is
counting on a boost from Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's going to generate a tremendous awareness of
broadcasting data to your home PC,'' Goldman said. ``That's one of
the main objectives for us _ to hitch our wagon to Microsoft, to
help us educate the market. And second, by including our software
in (Windows 98), you don't have to look for it _ it's already
included.''
</P>
<P>
   As demand grows, a number of manufacturers are vying to meet it.
</P>
<P>
   ATI Technologies makes a product called the ``All-In-Wonder''
that combines TV-tuner and graphics adapter capabilities, and
replaces the computer's existing video card.
</P>
<P>
   Others, including Hauppauge Computer Works and ixMicro, make
boards that work in conjunction with the existing video card.
</P>
<P>
   Prices vary, but have dropped substantially in the past couple
of years, said Mike Richmond, manager of broadcast products in
Intel's consumer products group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really a testament to the cost reduction that's very
common in our industry,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   A few computer makers have begun including TV tuners as standard
equipment, but it will be awhile before they become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Computer makers ``don't want to make a device standard until
they can get it for under $30,'' which typically means $75 to the
customer, said Scott Naylor, product manager at ixMicro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working to get the cost down low enough to where it can
be part of a standard machine,'' Naylor said. ``And we're also
working with them to do build-to-order options.''
</P>
<P>
   A tuner board is often a good option for someone buying a new
computer for a home office, he said. For $80 or so, it adds TV
features that would cost a few hundred dollars in a separate unit.
The same logic applies in college dorms, where computers are
common, but space and money are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   Tuner boards are also popular with stock brokers, who use them
in desktop computers to monitor television news, and in Pacific Rim
countries, where tiny apartments make it difficult to install a
television and a computer monitor, said Rufus Connell, an analyst
with Frost &AMP; Sullivan in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   For most people, adding TV functions to the PC is not about
replacing the television, Microsoft's Guggenheimer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a question of putting the PC in the living room and
everyone in the family huddling around it to watch TV,'' he said.
``It's a matter of getting TV information in another area, when I'm
not close to a TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of television and computer technology won't
result in a single all-powerful device, he said. Instead, just the
opposite is likely to happen _ there will be new types of devices,
all with more intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at a convergence of devices here but at a
convergence of technologies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we might see this moving forward is that devices will
get better and better at sharing information. . . I'm going to want
my information, my personal information, anywhere, at any time.''

   ``Don't forget to take your ID with you. You need to prove you
are 21 when you win. And don't forget what time we leave or your
bus number. We leave at 8 a.m. and it's bus 007,'' he said, noting
the bus number several times and making his passengers repeat it
back to him.
</P>
<P>
   And then, after grabbing a free breakfast coupon and signing up
for a ``player card,'' the eager gamblers pour into the huge
illuminated casino, some not to be seen for five hours.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a few first-timers such as Teresa Perez of
Laredo, Texas, who is here with her sister. Hours later, Perez
recounted her initial reaction to the extravagant possibilities of
the Grand Casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so fascinated, I was looking all over the place. I liked
the sound of the machines when other players were winning. It was
so exciting,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing the nickel machines. I was pushing all the
buttons. I was so excited, the lady came and said, `Are you OK?'
Just slow down,''' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   And, as her own modest stake ran low, Perez said she began
feeling highly conspicuous in the nearly empty game hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Who's looking at me?' I didn't want anyone to know
I had lost. I don't even spend a dollar on the lottery and here I
am spending $40 or $50. My money went so fast,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 8 a.m., right on schedule, the white bus is rolling again
through rural Louisiana, over two-lane blacktops through an
unfamiliar land of tall oaks and pines and amazingly green lawns.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop will be the Grand Casino Avoyelles, in Marksville,
two hours to the northeast.
</P>
<P>
   A little more than two hours later, they were back at it,
working the slots at the Grand Casino Avoyelles, which _ like the
Grand Casino Coushatta in Kinder _ is on Indian land, where state
gambling laws do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Neal, a hostess at the Grand Casino Avoyelles, explained
some of its gambler-friendly feature as she conducted a
walk-through of the jam-packed gaming floor.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the 1,700 slot machines, 40 gaming tables featuring
blackjack, roulette, craps, minibaccarat and various poker games,
the casino offers a full-service childcare center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have day care for the kids, from 6 weeks to 10 years of
age, and for those 11 and older, we have an arcade,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Parents are issued a pager so they can be summoned should any
problems arise with their children or should the casino want to see
if they are still in the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run random checks to make sure people don't just drop their
kids off here and then go shopping,'' Neal said.
</P>
<P>
   Neal said the casino keeps track of how much individuals bet
through their ``player cards,'' which are inserted into card
readers on each machine as players move around the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Gamblers use the cards to accumulate free meals, hotel stays and
other perks, much like travelers get perquisites by accumulating
frequent-flier miles. But the real benefit is to the casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only way we can know how much they are gambling,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   By 4 p.m. Wednesday, the white bus was again on the road,
beginning the 440-mile trip back to San Antonio. There would be
only one stop, and most gamblers quickly settled in for some sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't invite me back,'' said Estella Regalado, a
regular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost everything and just before we left, this lady came over
to where I was playing and put three quarters in and won $500,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As Perales made a fueling stop, the weary gamblers staggered out
to use the restroom, grab a bite and then crawl back on board.
Before he pulled out, Perales asked a final question.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many of you would be interested in adding a third
casino?'' he asked, while cautioning that it would add at least
eight hours to the 30-hour trip.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction was quick and decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had 90 percent of the hands go up. I was surprised. I
thought everyone would want to go back home, but everyone wants to
gamble,'' he said.

A COLUMN'S BASE RESTS ON RESPECT FOR READERS

   (ED NOTE: Susan Paynter is the Metro page columnist for the Seattle
P-I)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PAYNTER  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Without credibility, all the vivid quotes, funny turns
of phrase and piercing insights a columnist can craft aren't worth
the paper they're written in.
</P>
<P>
   Credibility does not mean never making an honest mistake. Or
that everyone agrees with or likes you. But, without being
believed, you've got zip, nada, bubkes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, award-winning Boston Globe news columnist Patricia
Smith became the latest journalist to learn that lesson the hard
way. She must have known it all along, but somehow chose to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Smith won this year's American Society of Newspaper Editors'
Distinguished Writing Award for column writing. She was a finalist
in April for a Pulitzer Prize. And she resigned last week after an
internal investigation of her work revealed she had made up several
quotes and even fabricated a handful of people featured in her
acclaimed, twice-weekly column.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, her editors admitted her colorful copy seemed too
good to be true _ and apparently was.
</P>
<P>
   In last Friday's farewell, Smith's apology was predictable, just
better written than those preceding her in journalism's hall of
shame.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted her columns to jolt. To be talked about. She had set
her own expectations too high and spread herself too thin. So she
``tweaked'' her copy to achieve the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tweak'' is a pretty polite word for faking news and making up
sources. And while Smith's explanation was surely painful, it was
also spiked with self-pity. ``To those colleagues and readers who
salivated daily at the thought of my head on a platter, congrats,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is not the first to go this route. Another Pulitzer
Prize-winning reporter, Janet Cooke, resigned from The Washington
Post under similar circumstances in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month a series of fabrications caught up with
widely published free-lance reporter Stephen Glass. He admitted
making up people, events _ even a company _ in a report on cyber
crime printed in The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Justifiably, journalism is combing its conscience and checking
the batteries in the smoke-and-mirrors detector.
</P>
<P>
   That's good, because those who break the commandment ``Thou
shalt not defraud the reader'' don't only lose their own jobs. They
lose ground for all the reporters and editors who earn their keep
in column inches every day they go to press.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's contract with the readers is unforgiving. It says
be accurate, be fair, and, if humanly possible, be first. Do it
against the clock amid noise and chaos and sometimes conflicting
demands.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers may still blame you for bringing them bad news. But
you have a chance to inform and maybe even help them. And, although
the payoff may not come in the form of a nice fat paycheck, it's
there in personal access to the events and people worth knowing
about.
</P>
<P>
   A columnist's contract is not one bit less binding, but it can
be a lot more personal. Expectations are high.
</P>
<P>
   Your face, opinions, personality and sometimes even your
emotions stand in the public square. If you take on difficult and
touchy issues _ as Smith apparently did _ the reaction can be swift
and highly personal.
</P>
<P>
   Without a tender heart, a columnist touches no one. But it had
better be wrapped in a pretty tough hide.
</P>
<P>
   Even after decades in the newspaper business, anonymous reader
attacks can take my breath away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the anger in the voice of one male caller stayed with
me after a column on moms juggling work with the raising of
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in the mirror, Susan!'' the voice spat. ``You'll see
what's wrong with this country and its kids. It's selfish,
egotistical, money-grubbing mothers like you! If you can't live on
your husband's salary, you have no right to have a child!''
</P>
<P>
   As a columnist, I have had people write and call radio talk
shows to wish the worst pain, not only for me but for my family. A
few have wished I could still be ``aborted.''
</P>
<P>
   But columnists also hear the kind-est possible comments. And,
once in a while, someone writes to say, ``I don't always agree with
you, but this time you made me think about this in a new way.''
That's the best.
</P>
<P>
   Real life _ and the people who live it _ far outstrip fiction
any day. Their quotes and personas may not always fit neatly into a
column's preconceptions. But being surprised is more fun.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the truth.

CHINESE DISSIDENTS IN THE US STRUGGLE TO KEEP THE FAITH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shen Tong came to America a frightened undergraduate, on a dead
run from the June 1989 massacre of unarmed demonstrators around
Tiananmen Square. Now a graduate of Brandeis University defending a
doctoral thesis at Boston University, he promotes democracy in
China from a spacious house in Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Yang Jianli already was in this country, working on a doctorate
in math at the University of California at Berkeley, when the
democracy movement that would be crushed by the massacre emerged.
He rushed back to China to advise and support students in the
square; on June 4, he watched as 30 of them were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Now Yang is a PhD candidate at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and is active in broadcasting and publishing
pro-democracy information in China.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are ``Forty-niners,'' leading dissidents whose names
are on a list of 49 people most strictly banned from returning to
China. Both are doing well, academically and materially, in the
United States. But in their home lives, they are very different.
</P>
<P>
   Yang has married, fathered a son, and bought a house he and his
friends are rehabilitating. Shen is single and a renter who says he
can't bring himself to buy a house. ``I feel like I always have to
be ready to pack and go back in three days,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years after Tiananmen, on the eve of the first visit to
China by a US president since the bloodletting, China's exiles are
divided _ not by bitter personal and political competition, as they
were just after the massacre, but by difficult personal emotions
and choices forced on them by their banishment and the decimation
of their ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We often run into a dilemma of conscience,'' Yang says. ``I
don't feel sad I'm here, but we all want to go home and share the
burden, share the suffering with our colleagues. My dream is to
contribute to democratization there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elite Chinese students _ especially those from Beijing and
Qinghua universities, the Chinese analogues to Harvard and MIT _
have little trouble making their way in this country. Most are able
to qualify for scholarships and teaching assistanceships at
top-flight US institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Life is harder for older exiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among older dissidents whose English is not so good, there is
an element of quiet desperation to their lives,'' says William
Alford, director of East Asia legal studies at Harvard Law School
and a frequent visitor to China. ``These intelligent, well-spoken
people, who were not high-profile dissidents, are just managing to
get by.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Xizhe, who lives in a one-room apartment, speaks little
English and receives bare subsistance aid.Wang spent 15 years in
prison for political offenses before being freed in 1993 as part of
an apparent bid by China to increase its chances of winning the
2000 Olympics. After two years of police harassment and
surveillance, he fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``After long years in prison, I felt I needed to get charged
with the knowledge of what was going on in the world,'' Wang says,
``and I was being monitored so closely it was impossible to
accomplish anything there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he says he ``probably will return home as soon as possible.
A couple of years is enough to study and recharge... so when I am
recharged, I should return.''
</P>
<P>
   Merle Goldman, a Boston University professor who specializes in
Chinese intellectual history and dissent, says exiles who are
qualified scientists or who go into business are doing well here,
while ``the ideologues cannot find a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the exile community generally are ``very helpful to
each other,'' she adds, working out ``communal living arrangements,
sharing food'' when that is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Exiles generally agree that it would not be difficult for them
to return to China in defiance of the ban on their entry, but say
they would be swiftly apprehended and probably imprisoned once they
tried to support themselves or renew their liberalization
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Wang, say they don't care and will return regardless.
Others say they can do more for the democratization of China from
exile, but they are torn by the recognition that the longer they
are away, the more they lose touch with their rapidly changing
homeland, and the weaker their voices become.
</P>
<P>
   The solution for many of the activists is to work on projects,
including publishing and broadcasting in mainland China, and
meeting with sympathetic mainland intellectuals, while avoiding
direct confrontation with authorities. It is intellectually daring,
absorbing work, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a large operation in China, and the people we are
working with are closely watched,'' says an advocate in one of
several foundations with Boston-area ties that are active on the
mainland. ``Yet there are certain things you can do'' even in
expressing, publishing, and broadcasting liberatization messages.
``There is a space, a gray area, for negotiation of visible
dissent.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time, approval by President Bush of permanent
residence status on request for any Chinese student who entered the
United States legally after the massacre, and the gradual
relaxation in China of the repressive atmosphere that prevailed
after the massacre all have reduced the ranks of exiled dissidents.
Activists who have persevered say this has not necessarily been
bad.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, Shen says, there were 8,600 Chinese
dissident groups around the world, and the number of dissident
students was estimated in the tens of thousands. Now there are
fewer organizations, and the number of dissidents barred from
returning probably is about 200, with perhaps twice that number in
self-imposed exile.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, activists say, there is far less personal rivalry
among those who have stayed the course. Disagreements over how to
act, and how to encourage the United States to act, toward China
are much more civil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most students _ including many of the leaders _ were not
highly politically motivated'' before the massacre, Shen said.
``Those who stayed with the movement got a chance to really
understand politics as a serious vocation with its own ethics, its
own rhythms and balances.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harvard Law's Alford notes, ``where everyone was
looking for political solutions in '89, they have now come to
realize that change comes in many ways _ through economics, and
through communication that is not directly political but has
hopeful expectations for society.''
</P>
<P>
   In this environment, all concerned are sensitized to symbols.
Thus there is virtually no opposition to President Clinton's visit
to China, which begins Thursday. But there is apprehension over how
Clinton will handle the welcoming ceremony at Tiananmen Square, a
ritual on which the Chinese government insisted.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Gang, third on the list of students most wanted by the
Chinese government following the massacre, served six years in
jail. He was beaten, subjected to electric shocks, and kept in
isolation. Harassed by police and prevented from working when he
was released, he fled, and is now barred from returning. Recently,
he received a master's degree in computer science from Columbia
University, and last week he started work at Teradyne in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go there, that's his business,'' Liu says of Clinton. ``But
if he goes he should do something for the victims of 1989.
Tiananmen Square is a very sensitive place.''
</P>
<P>
   Many exiles believe Clinton is making a mistake going to the
square. They themselves are torn over the symbolism and don't
believe the president has a grasp on it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not proper,'' Yang says. ``Tiananmen Square is the
symbol of murder. It is a symbol of organized lying and coverup.
... How can Chinese people interpret it if he is welcomed where so
many died, and just shakes hands and says nothing?''

REDDING, CALIF., IS THE HUB OF AN OUTDOOR WONDERLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDING, Calif. _ Why go to Redding? After all, what could be
unique about it? What's in it for you?
</P>
<P>
   Redding is at the center of a 60-mile radius that is the capital
for outdoor recreation, not only for Northern California, but for
the West. The region provides outstanding fishing, hiking, boating,
hunting, biking, rafting, mountain climbing, camping, backpacking
and recreational travel.
</P>
<P>
   There's a 23-inch rainbow trout mounted on the wall of my office
that I caught in the Sacramento River right in the town of Redding,
three minutes from Interstate 5. It reminds me of just how special
this area can be:
</P>
<P>
   Fishing: Giant Shasta Lake, located 10 miles to the north, is
now completely full and has 370 miles of shoreline, with 22 species
of sport fish and 30-bass days now common; Whiskeytown Lake, 10
miles to the west, provides fishing for kokanee salmon; the
Sacramento River in Redding is outstanding for fly-fishing for
trout, with 10-fish days common with trout to 5 pounds; the Upper
Sacramento River 30 miles to the north is a classic mountain stream
with good fly-fishing. There are an additional 11 lakes and eight
streams within 45 minutes, including four blue-ribbon trout
streams, McCloud River, Hat Creek, Fall River and Pit River.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking: There are 3 million acres of national forest within this
area, including dozens of small, beautiful lakes in the
Trinity-Divide country northwest of Redding. America's greatest
hiking trail, the 2,700-mile Pacific Crest Trail, cuts right
through the region. Its higher portions are still covered in snow.
I have hiked 50 of the best trails in the region, to seven dramatic
waterfalls as well as at Castle Crags State Park 40 miles to the
north, with its drop-dead gorgeous series of 7,000-foot-high
granite spires.
</P>
<P>
   Boating: The capital of boating in the West is just a 15-minute
drive to the north at Shasta Lake, with 400 houseboat rentals, 12
marinas, 14 boat ramps. Yet with five major lake arms and thousands
of coves, nobody feels crowded. Whiskeytown Lake, a short drive to
the west, is outstanding for sailing. In all, there are 17 lakes
for boating and water sports within an hour's drive of Redding.
</P>
<P>
   Biking: The best family bike trail in the region is the
Sacramento River Trail, a great, easy route along the river north
of town, with bike rentals available nearby. More challenging
mountain bike trails are available at nearby Whiskeytown National
Recreation Area, Shasta Lake, and the adjacent Shasta-Trinity
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   Rafting: My favorite is the do-it-yourself trips in inflatable
kayaks on the Trinity River, with equipment rentals and the best
stretch of water (Class II and II-Plus) about an hour's drive west
of Redding. But within a few minutes of the hotel is the Sacramento
River, a favorite for inner tubes and easy rafting on hot days.
Expect cold water. For pure whitewater exhilaration, the famous
Hells Corner run (Class IV and V) is available north of Mount
Shasta on the upper Klamath River.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain climbing: Mount Shasta, at 14,162 feet, offers the
preeminent adventure site in Northern California, a 13.6-mile
ascent of 7,000 feet over snow, ice and rock, to the summit. A much
easier, but similarly stunning, climb is the hike to the top of
Mount Lassen, 10,457 feet, requiring a 2,000-foot climb over the
course of a 2.5-mile zig-zag, expected to be accessible in July.
</P>
<P>
   Camping: There are 63 campgrounds within a 50-mile radius of
Redding, most set near beautiful lakes, streams or deep in forests.
Of these, 48 have space for RVs, including three near Redding and
another nine within 15 miles of Redding. This does not include
another 100 hike-to camps in wilderness and remote national forest.
</P>
<P>
   Backpacking: Mount Shasta, Mount Lassen, Trinity Alps and the
Pacific Crest Trail provide thousands of miles of trails and
hundreds of wilderness-style camps. The trails in the high country,
with most elevations ranging 6,000 to 9,000 feet, will be clear of
snow by early July and in ideal shape from mid-summer through fall.
Surrounding mountains are sprinkled with hundreds of small,
pristine lakes filled with clear water and small, but hungry,
trout.
</P>
<P>
   Recreational travel: The best nearby trips are to Mount Lassen
Volcanic National Park for its boiling mud points, steam vents and
sweeping views; Castle Crags State Park 45 minutes to the north for
its rim of granite spires; and Mount Shasta, rising like a diamond
in a field of coal an hour to the north, where you can drive up
Everitt Memorial Highway to 7,800 feet to reach the No. 1 trail
head on the mountain or see sweeping views without even taking a
step.

WHAT I WISH SOMEONE HAD TOLD A YOUNGER ME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PHIL RECORD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Greek historian Plutarch once said, ``Oh that men would
learn that the true speaker is he who speaks only when he has
something to say.''
</P>
<P>
   I think the wise ancient one had graduation ceremony speakers in
mind when he uttered those words.
</P>
<P>
   For I cannot remember one idea or suggestion made by any of the
speakers when I graduated from old St. Mary's Elementary School, or
old Laneri High School or even the University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   True, those events occurred many years ago, but you would have
thought that at least one would have said something that would have
been meaningful enough to have stayed with me.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, I have no recollection of the names of the
speakers. I can only recall that the speaker at Notre Dame was a
well-decorated Army general.
</P>
<P>
   Being a graduation speaker is no easy calling. Most young folks
really don't give a darn what they have to say. The graduates want
to get their diplomas and get out of there to celebrate. Most of
their relatives are there to rejoice in their kin's achievement and
to breathe a sigh of relief that the ordeal is finished.
</P>
<P>
   All these thoughts became clear to me when I was asked to
address the graduating class at Fort Worth Academy a few weeks ago.
I considered it one of the most challenging speaking assignments I
have ever accepted (and I have accepted many during the last
decade).
</P>
<P>
   I searched for quite a long time, trying to determine what I
could say that might have some meaning to these eighth-graders.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't need to tell them that they faced many new challenges
as they advanced to a new chapter in their young lives. They
already knew that.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't need to tell them that we were counting on them to
improve this world of ours. They knew that _ at least they had
already been told that on many occasions.
</P>
<P>
   I finally decided that I would share with them five things I
wished someone had told me when I was preparing to leave elementary
school. Here are the five points I wished a graduation speaker had
convinced me were applicable to me, because I had to learn them the
hard way:
</P>
<P>
   1. It is OK for men and boys to cry.
</P>
<P>
   It took nearly 50 years for me to learn the freedom that comes
from shedding tears when I'm hurting, or when I'm rejoicing, or
when I'm deeply moved by an event.
</P>
<P>
   From the looks on the young men's faces that night at FW
Academy, I fear I was not very convincing. That's OK. They'll learn
if they are wise.
</P>
<P>
   2. You don't have to control everything.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the most difficult things I have had to learn.
Somewhere along the line, I had been convinced that one should
always strive to be in control of every situation.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until I was in the depths of depression at age 48 that
a wise priest-counselor convinced me that I needed to let God take
control of my life _ that he could control circumstances that were
beyond my control during that terrible journey into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   When I finally took that momentous step, I stopped messing up so
many things in my life and the lives of those around me.
</P>
<P>
   3. It is OK to take risks when the objectives are important.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's great achievers are risk-takers who
experience an occasional failure, I told the graduates. Reaching
for happiness, striving for love, trying to be a success _ all
involve worthy risks. Those who evade risks encounter blandness.
</P>
<P>
   4. You don't have to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Why, oh why, didn't someone convince me of that when I was on
the threshold of leaving elementary school? Oh, how much worry I
would have been spared had I been convinced of that.
</P>
<P>
   I was a perfectionist for many years. Yet perfection was often
beyond my capabilities and what was expected of me by others.
</P>
<P>
   When told by my father to rake up the leaves, I figured I had to
capture every leaf in the yard. My father would have been delighted
with the capture of 95 percent of the leaves. Not me! I would have
been down on myself had I not snared that last elusive leaf in the
yard.
</P>
<P>
   It was a wise professor at Notre Dame, Tom Stritch, who finally
convinced me that he and others simply were expecting my best, not
perfection, and that I needed to stop expecting more from myself
than God expected of me.
</P>
<P>
   What a relief that was, although I find myself occasionally
slipping back into that quest for perfection.
</P>
<P>
   5. Don't expect your friends to be perfect.
</P>
<P>
   When we expect friends to give more than they possibly can, we
are doomed to disappointment. This is such an important topic that
I will reserve further comment for another column.
</P>
<P>
   I concluded the talk by issuing a challenge to the students.
</P>
<P>
   I reminded them that they had reached this point in their lives
because of the dedication and hard work of many teachers.
</P>
<P>
   I asked each of them to determine which teacher at the academy
had had the greatest impact on their life and then to write that
teacher, thanking him or her for all they had done for them.
</P>
<P>
   I told the young people to give themselves an A if they
fulfilled the challenge within a week, a B if it took two weeks, a
C it they waited three weeks, a D if it took a month, and an F if
it took longer because I doubted if they would ever do it after a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after making the talk, I received a letter from
headmaster Charles Asche, who told me that the next day he saw
tears running down the faces of several teachers as they read
thank-you notes that they had found in their mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   That made my risking the challenge worthwhile.

<P>
   You no doubt know of helpers of the canine persuasion, mostly
guide dogs and perhaps some hearing dogs. But have you ever heard
of therapy administered by a bunny or turtle, a horse or pig or,
believe it or not, a stingray?
</P>
<P>
   These animals, along with cats and dogs, are participating in
the treatment, care and emotional nourishment of seriously ill or
injured individuals, from young children with severe burns,
crippling birth defects or brain injuries to the sick elderly in
nursing homes. They are the stars of a documentary, ``Mary Tyler
Moore in Three Cats From Miami,'' to be broadcast at 8 p.m. Eastern
daylight time and Pacific daylight time on Sunday on HBO. The
documentary is co-presented by the Delta Society, a pioneer in
animal-assisted therapy through its Pet Partners Program.
</P>
<P>
   It shows Splash the stingray as he prompts Noah, a boy with
cerebral palsy, to rise from the wheelchair he is reluctant to
leave and walk up stairs to help feed Splash and receive a
thank-you kiss _ yes, a kiss from a stingray _ as well as a bit of
a bath in return.
</P>
<P>
   It shows Harley the swine _ who acts more like a dog than a pig
_ prompt Juanita, a severely brain-injured girl, to begin to tune
into her surroundings and attempt to talk.
</P>
<P>
   And it shows Frosty, a 1,300-pound horse, helping children like
Jordan, who has Down syndrome, improve his muscle tone to the point
where he can run, jump and play like other children, and John, who
was brain-injured and is stiff most of the time, learn to relax his
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the three cats, Buster, Flashback and Flame, who
bring joy, comfort and love to elderly patients in a Florida
nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Assistance animals, as they are called, have been helping ill,
injured and disabled people for many decades. The overwhelming
majority of the animals have been dogs. But in recent years the
popularity of pet therapy has burgeoned and the variety of
assistance animals has expanded to include monkeys, dolphins, birds
and fish. Many medical institutions and rehabilitation services,
including White Plains Hospital Center in Westchester County, N.Y.,
are now incorporating pet therapy into their more traditional
ministrations.
</P>
<P>
   How Pet Therapy Helps
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever had a pet that responds to talk or touch
knows the comfort and joy an animal can offer a human being. Pets
bring people out of themselves, help them forget their troubles and
enjoy the company of a living creature that rarely complains. Pets
lavish unconditional love, stimulate laughter, foster
responsibility and self-esteem and make their owners feel needed.
Pets can also minimize health risks in people who are not sick.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown, for example, that blood pressure declines
when people watch fish swimming about in a tank. Researchers in
Melbourne, Australia, recently found that pet owners overall have
lower blood pressures and cholesterol levels than people who do not
own pets. Those with birds or fish for pets were as well off as
those with dogs, so it was not the exercise associated with walking
a dog that was responsible for this finding.
</P>
<P>
   A study of 1,000 Medicare enrollees in a health maintenance
organization found that those with pets experienced less stress in
response to disturbing life events and paid fewer visits to
physicians than their counterparts without pets.
</P>
<P>
   Pets of all kinds also foster social interaction and reduce
isolation and loneliness, especially for those who are seriously
disabled or disfigured and might otherwise be avoided by strangers.
</P>
<P>
   And for the seriously ill or disabled, a pet can do much more.
Service dogs can be trained to perform nearly 100 different tasks,
including opening and closing doors, turning switches on and off,
pulling a person up from a sitting or lying position, assisting a
person in and out of a bath or pool, helping someone dress,
retrieving dropped or needed objects, pulling wheelchairs, helping
with shopping and carrying packages and even dragging a person to
safety in an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Dr. Karen Allen, in the department of medicine at
State University of New York at Buffalo, and Dr. Jim Blascovich, at
the University of California at Santa Barbara, published the
results of a two-year study of the value of service dogs to people
with disabilities that required them to use a wheelchair. The 48
participants, half of whom were given service dogs, had severe
chronic conditions that required many hours of care each day. Those
with service dogs developed a higher level of self-esteem and
psychological well-being and were more involved in their community.
They were also more likely to work part-time and use public
transportation and they required less assistance. After one year,
the number of hours of paid assistance they needed had declined by
68 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More Parts for Pets
</P>
<P>
   Pet therapists are constantly discovering new roles that pets
can play in aiding the ill and injured. At the Shriners Burn
Institute, for instance, a once-abandoned bunny named Dusty is
encouraging children who have been severely burned to learn to
touch again. In Florida, a loggerhead sea turtle named Mo, born
with a defective shell, helps to build self-esteem in Robert Smith,
a boy born without legs. Robert gets to do something no other child
does _ brush Mo's shell and rub his neck and flippers.
</P>
<P>
   And in Tacoma, Wash., inmates at a women's prison rescue and
train abandoned dogs to be assistance pets. One of the dogs,
Natasha, a Shepherd-Husky mix, goes to school with Stephanie, who
has neurological problems and uses a wheelchair. Natasha opens the
gate, pulls Stephanie's chair and accompanies her on the school bus
and into the classroom, to await the next task, like picking up a
dropped pencil.
</P>
<P>
   In cooperation with Pennsylvania Hospital, Independence Dogs
Inc. in Chadds Ford, Pa., trains dogs to assist Parkinson's disease
patients whose severe symptoms cannot be relieved by drugs alone.
The dogs are taught, for example, to tap a patient's foot with a
paw when the patient is suddenly unable to move, or ``freezes.''
The tap prompts the patient to move again. The dogs are trained to
walk beside the patient and provide support when balance is lost,
which has significantly reduced falls and fostered independence.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of his canine assistant, Ivan, Russell Moore, a
Parkinson's patient who had been nearly house-bound because he fell
so often, became able to take long walks, go grocery shopping,
visit the mall and attend church.

PRICES WERE AMONG THE BEST IMPROVEMENTS AT PC EXPO SHOW  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN MANES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Computers are about as fast as they are likely to get for a
while. Over the next year or so, the megahertz rating of top-of-the
line microprocessors will improve from today's 400 to just 500, a
gain so small as to be invisible with most programs.
</P>
<P>
   But as last week's PC Expo show made clear, computers and the
things that hook up to them are getting cheaper and cheaper. A
person who last looked at price tags a year ago will be astonished
at prices today. Thanks to a consumer-friendly confluence of
oversupply, competition, Asian financial woes and relentless
self-improvement among hardware makers, prices are plummeting in
just about every area of the computer world.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you might think prices on machines themselves cannot
drop further, there they go again. Prices should drop a bit more
before school starts and drop yet again before Christmas. That
means $600 computers with brand names you have heard of will be
commonplace before the end of the year, and no-name machines will
be even cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Bargains will be the rule all the way up and down the price
range. One example at the show at the Jacob K. Javits Convention
Center in New York was Sony's forthcoming VAIO E203, which will
include a DVD-ROM drive that can play movies on television sets as
well as the computer screen. It will also come with a new
300-megahertz Celeron processor, 48 megabytes of random access
memory, and a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive, all for a surprisingly low
$1,300. This machine is among the first in an expected trend to
replace the CD-ROM drive with a much more facile DVD unit on most
computers above the very bottom of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Computer prices typically do not include the monitor, but after
a long era of slowly declining prices, monitors are getting cheap
fast. A year ago, a typical brand-name ``17-inch'' display cost
more than $500; now you can get one for as little as $300, and
there are similar bargains in other sizes. For a small premium,
several makers are beginning to offer a line of what might be
termed ``stubbies,'' units whose shorter front-to-back dimensions
can free up a bit of desk space. Now that Windows 98 can handle
more than one monitor at a time, one strategy that can deliver a
great deal of screen area for the buck is to buy two or more
17-inchers. The biggest problem, once you get them to work, is
where to put them.
</P>
<P>
   If desk space is really at a premium, you can always buy an LCD
display, which typically resembles the screen from a normal laptop
machine stuck on a little pedestal; it may or may not include
speakers. Prices for these range widely, but a few small units have
been sighted at about $800. LCD screens can present problems with
some video cards, tend to cause problems at screen resolutions
other than the specific one they were designed for, cost more than
twice as much as equivalent tube-based models and vary widely in
quality. But the diagonal measurements of LCD screens are reported
accurately, unlike the inflated measurements of their tube-based
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Digital cameras, now made by electronics companies, computer
companies and even camera companies, were all over the show, and
they, too, keep getting better and cheaper. ``Megapixel'' cameras
that can produce decent 5-by-7-inch prints were rare, expensive
birds just a year ago. Now they cost about $800 and come with more
features than ever, and even a cursory inspection of several units
reveals significant differences in every aspect, from output
quality right down to the shape of the case. Though computers have
increasingly become functionally identical commodities, the
designers of digital cameras exercise great creativity to make sure
that no two seem remotely alike, which makes them hard to compare.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a network in one's home has long been attractive only
to the hardest-core of computer geeks, but in theory it can save
time and money by letting the whole family share things like
printers and scanners. Now that there are plenty of
multiple-computer households, some networking ideas about to arrive
on the market do not require festooning the walls and baseboards
with new wiring. The Intelogis Passport system sends its signals
along the A.C. power wires in your home at a rated speed of up to
350 kilobits per second, or about 10 times that of a typical modem;
two computers and a printer can be connected for less than $300.
The Symphony system from Proxim Inc. is designed to transmit its
bits over radio waves significantly faster over a range of up to
150 feet.
</P>
<P>
   For peripheral devices, the Universal Serial Bus, better known
as USB, is slowly gaining the momentum that was expected for it
thanks to software plumbing built into Windows 98. Several monitors
included USB hubs, which allow multiple devices to be plugged in at
once. USB computer speakers also appeared, promising cleaner audio
because they bypass the sound card and accept digital signals
directly, turning the bits into audio far from the festival of
electronic noise found inside most computers. The promise is
cleaner sound, but there are potential drawbacks, like just how the
device handles standard music CD's.
</P>
<P>
   Some ideas are just too good to be left alone. Not far from the
booth where Sony was showing its slim three-pound VAIO 505
notebook, Sharp Electronics Corp. displayed a forthcoming knockoff.
The Actius A100 Ultralite will come with a bigger screen, a bigger
hard drive, more memory and a bigger battery than Sony's $2,000
unit. It will also cost $500 more, but that still seems a good deal
for the money.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, today's computers are becoming so cheap that they are
even being used to control more expensive things. Play Inc. showed
off Trinity, a big case of electronics that costs upward of $5,000
and amounts to a television control room in a box, complete with
the sort of jazzy fade, dissolve and loop-the-loop effects that
infect everything from commercials to the evening news. What
controls this cornucopia of chips? A plain-vanilla Windows computer
no more powerful than the one you bought for your kid last
Christmas.

<P>
   It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of China's place in
the world today, or of the role it is likely to play in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As President Bill Clinton has said, our relationship with China
``will in large measure help determine whether the new century is
one of peace, security and prosperity for the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fourth of the world's population lives in China. It
has the world's third-largest economy. It is a nuclear weapons
state, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and, after
the United States, the world's largest source of greenhouse gases.
China shares borders with 14 other nations _ more than any country
in the world _ and it has unresolved border disputes with four of
them.
</P>
<P>
   From maintaining stability on the Korean Peninsula to resolving
the economic problems of East Asia to addressing global warming,
China will play a key role in the international community.
</P>
<P>
   That role can be helpful or harmful, and it is the task of
American diplomacy to ensure that it is indeed helpful. The manner
in which we engage China will have an important bearing on whether
China becomes integrated as a constructive participant in
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to China presents an opportunity to continue
building a productive relationship with this vast country, one that
will benefit both of our peoples for decades to come.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 26 years, six presidents have all striven to
achieve a proper balance in our relationship with China. But
engagement with China does not mean endorsement. To accomplish our
goals, we need a clear policy that firmly advances American
interests and values.
</P>
<P>
   We must assert our positions on issues ranging from
nonproliferation to intellectual property. We must voice our belief
in the universality of human rights. And we must make clear our
commitment to the peaceful resolution of the differences between
China and Taiwan. Clinton's policy of engagement with China meets
these needs.
</P>
<P>
   Our strategy is based on the premise that it is in our interest
to work toward the emergence of a great, stable, open and
nonaggressive China that embraces political pluralism and global
norms of conduct and that works with us to build a secure
international order, as well as peace and stability in the Asia
Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
   Our policy has thus far achieved significant results. After
decades of rejecting such cooperation, since 1992, the People's
Republic of China has signed on to a variety of nonproliferation
regimes, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the
Chemical Weapons Convention and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, when the five permanent members of the Security
Council met in Geneva to discuss nuclear tests in India and
Pakistan, China _ this month's coordinator for the permanent five _
oversaw efforts that led to a forceful expression of the
international community's determination to stabilize the situation
in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In Korea, where American and Chinese troops once battled, we are
now working together with China in the Four Party Talks aimed at
finally realizing a permanent peace on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   China has also released on medical parole to the United States
such prominent dissidents as Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, signed the
U.N. Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, and has
pledged to sign the U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
</P>
<P>
   However, many differences remain. We continue to push for more
progress on our nonproliferation, trade, human rights and energy
and environment agendas. Clinton's visit offers an opportunity to
energetically press for such progress. Meanwhile, we have seen
China move in the right direction, toward greater acceptance of
international norms.
</P>
<P>
   In our determination to address these challenges, we must not
ignore the achievements. And to make further progress, expand
cooperation and advance our national interests, we should continue
our engagement with the Chinese people and government through firm,
forceful and patient diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   On regional and global issues, in the areas of nonproliferation,
economic cooperation and even human rights _ where much more
progress is still needed _ the achievements are real, and our
policy is working.

TEMPLE ANNIVERSARY PROMPTS CALL FOR BLESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is the 160th anniversary of Congregation
Beth Emeth and the year has been marked with observances and
salutations by its congregants and public figures from President
Clinton on down. The event has religious and secular significance.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Emeth (House of Truth) began life in 1838 as Beth El (House
of God), founded by Albanians who for years had practiced their
faith without the assistance of a rabbi. Their first rabbi was not
hired until eight years later, but he turned out to be a historic
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Isaac Mayer Wise, an immigrant from Germany, brought with him to
his first pulpit the ideas that were shaping the Reform movement in
his native land. Although at Beth El he was the spiritual leader of
a traditionally Orthodox congregation, he began to introduce
elements of Reform observance in Albany during his rabbinate from
1848 to 1851. After he left Albany in a dust of controversy, he
became the chief promulgator of Reform Judaism in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But celebrants this year were not heralding the anniversary of
Beth El, whereby hangs a story about three Jews shipwrecked on a
desert island who establish four synagogues. The joke only
exaggerates substantial reality. In Albany this tendency at schism
was demonstrated before Rabbi Wise arrived on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   In 1841, a small group detached from Beth El to form their own
temple, Beth El Jacob, even though both followed the Orthodox
ritual, as then was commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   When Rabbi Wise showed up five years later and began to
integrate some Reform practices, which radically differed from
Orthodox ritual, there was dissent among the worshipers who had
remained with Beth El. In time, disagreements got so severe that a
public brawl took place, which required the intervention of the
Albany police. Afterward, the modernists headed off on their own,
establishing Anshe Emeth (People of Truth) as a Reform
congregation.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth Reform congregation in America and is the
basis for the distinction claimed today on behalf of Beth Emeth,
because the two congregations reunited in 1885, as Reform was in
ascendancy and while the Orthodox synagogue was losing so many
members it could no longer keep going. In coming together again,
their new name combined the Beth from the one with the Emeth from
the other.
</P>
<P>
   This rich history was recounted recently in a musical review at
the Albany temple.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the audience, it was easy to reflect on the good
fortune of being able to celebrate 160 years of continuity, having
survived the fractures, and having done so in a very special
country. It is a fundamental American myth, based on reality, that
this country welcomed newcomers of all nationalities and faiths,
which made it possible for a group of people, who would never be
more than a tiny minority, to live life according to their ethnic
and religious traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Many _ if not most _ of these immigrants, whether they came in
the 19th or 20th centuries, were more familiar with other
experiences. Instead of being able to live peacefully in one place
for more than decades upon decades, these people were more
accustomed to picking up their shattered belongings and fleeing
pogroms and persecutions from country to country, from place to
place, in search of a haven, however temporary it might turn out to
be in the end.
</P>
<P>
   In our time, such fearfulness reached epic dimensions. That's
why, as I sat there in temple, to see the kids and their parents
and their grandparents performing to everyone's delight, I was
reminded, even in that circumstance, of Kristallnacht, the night 60
years ago when the Nazis burned Germany's synagogues. The thought
struck about the vast difference between America and not only
Germany, but many other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
   These words are written aware that given the history of the
Jewish people, it is tempting fate to speak too loudly about good
fortune. There have been other times and other worlds in which the
Jews flourished only to be brought to utter despair. Ironically,
Germany before Hitler, although suffused with latent anti-Semitism,
was not inhospitable to Jews.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, during the reign of the Moors, Jews contributed
mightily to the general culture and to their own, for hundreds and
hundreds of years. When in the 15th century, the Christians
conquered Spain, the Jews were confronted with a choice that often
faced them: convert or be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   All these thoughts intermingle on the occasion of the 160th
anniversary of Beth Emeth, my temple. It is here that one of my
daughters was confirmed and another was married and where a
granddaughter was named. It is here where our family shares in the
joys and the griefs that mark the life of a congregation.
</P>
<P>
   On occasions of moment, Jews offer a particular prayer. Given
all that has been and the uncertainties of what might yet be, that
prayer fittingly acknowledges the 160th anniversary, blessing God,
``Who has kept us alive and sustained us and brought us to this
season.''

JIVE TALKING WITH THE DIRECTOR OF `LAST DAYS OF DISCO'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 46, ``Last Days of Disco'' director Whit Stillman still loves
the night life, he loves the boogie, and he doesn't think either
fits in well with thunking melons.
</P>
<P>
   As the title of his movie indicates, Stillman is fond of disco
music, but he says it has its place, and that place is in the
clubs. Not in commercials. Not on the radio. Not in any piped-in
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to go to clubs anymore; you can just go to
supermarkets,'' Stillman said during a Dallas stop, loquacious
despite (or maybe because of) a publicity-tour-induced lack of
sleep. ``I remember a lot of the songs that I hear on CD, and I
don't like 'em much. And then I hear them in an auditorium, where
people are dancing, and I think, `You know, this IS good. This DOES
work.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``The Last Days of Disco'' is more about the days than
it is about the disco. It's set in the early '80s, before MTV and
AIDS became two of the decade's defining acronyms, as a group of
young men and women debate the merits of social groups vs.
``ferocious pairing off'' between rounds of dancing at a Studio
54-esque nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Debate'' is a key word here; unlike in disco songs, the words
in the movie are more important than the music. As in Stillman's
other films, ``Metropolitan'' (1990) and ``Barcelona'' (1994), the
characters love to talk, and they're so witty and erudite that they
could be pre-millennial visitors from an Oscar Wilde or Noel Coward
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Like his characters, Stillman is an urbane New Yorker who likes
to talk, although after a day of interviews he's more prone to
tangents than the young, epigram-spouting people who populate his
movies. He says he was a little concerned about how ``Disco'' would
play outside New York, but that it tested well in screenings in
Houston and Austin.
</P>
<P>
   And Stillman has been spending more time in Austin recently,
serving on the advisory board of the Austin Heart of Film Festival,
a screenwriter-centered festival that runs in early October. He's
even considering a Texas project, one with deep personal roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-great-grandfather was the founder of Brownsville,
Texas, and was one of the earliest Texans,'' Stillman said. ``The
historical museum in Brownsville's the Stillman House, and the
museum is the old house Charles Stillman had. The film is not
really about him, but it's that period and it's essentially the
part of the war that's not large-scale. It's not the Alamo, but
it's the Texas war of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   But just because Stillman is switching gears doesn't mean that
he believes his conversation-heavy style is running out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's the opposite,'' he said. ``For me, (''Disco'' is)
the culmination film. This is the film where I got to do everything
I wanted to do, use the music I wanted to use. We actually have
much less dialogue in the film than in the others. There are only
about four really big set-pieces, conversation scenes.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when those conversation scenes include a dissection
of how well ``Lady and the Tramp'' works as a social comedy and a
brief discussion of the sexiness of Scrooge McDuck, it's apparent
that this isn't your run-of-the-mill summer one-liner comedy. But
Stillman believes that the movie's audience will find it, and that
it will complement rather than conflict with this season's other
disco movie, the upcoming ``54.''
</P>
<P>
   If there are similarities, they're in the youthful casts.
``Disco'' stars Chloe Sevigny (''Kids'') as Alice, a demure college
graduate who enters a boogie wonderland accompanied by her brash
roommate Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale of ``Cold Comfort Farm''). They
hook up with a young ad exec (Mackenzie Astin), a corporate lawyer
(Robert Sean Leonard), the club's manager (Stillman regular Chris
Eigeman) and a rookie prosecutor (Matt Keeslar) for nights of
dancing, drinking and talking.
</P>
<P>
   In discussing the on-the-verge-of-a-breakthrough cast, Stillman
makes a comparison to a true disco-era movie _ the 1979 flop
``Thank God It's Friday'' _ although he makes it clear that he's
comparing the casts, not the films.
</P>
<P>
   `` `TGIF' had Debra Winger, Jeff Goldblum, all these great
people,'' he said. ``But I don't think it helps `TGIF.' Maybe the
hope would be that `Disco' would be like `St. Elmo's Fire,' that
launched that whole group of people, without the odium.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Odium'' _ again, like his characters, Stillman gets the
erudite last word.

THE SON ALSO RISES ON COSTA RICAN FISHING TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanied by BC-COSTARICA-TRAVEL-TIPS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HADDAWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUEPOS, Costa Rica _ I had never danced with a fish before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on, Dad!'' said my son, James. He strapped a rod-holder
around my waist, so the butt of the rod wouldn't dig into my
stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep the slack out of the line!'' he reminded me as the
sailfish leaped into a pirouette. The fish was dancing, I was
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you doing all right, Dad?'' he asked after the boat rocked
a little and put me off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   The sweat was rolling into my eyes. He got a towel. He gave the
old man a sip of Fresca. ``Are you sure you're all right?''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   He's 26, I'm 49, and we'd come to Costa Rica for a week of
guyness.
</P>
<P>
   It had been years since we'd had any real time together, ``mano
a mano.''
</P>
<P>
   For so long we'd been busy, on separate tracks,
career-searching, career-building; growing up, growing out. And I
was thinking, as I hung onto that fish for dear life, my son's hand
on my shoulder guiding, instructing _ man oh man, how times have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, wasn't it, when I was wrestling with his diapers? He
was 2. I was getting more powder in his hair than where I'd aimed
it. Finally, I got the darn thing pinned and let him loose, and
with one step he walked out of it and then the dog got the diaper
and ran off with it, and there I was with this little nude dude
running after the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, wasn't it, when we were together on the jetty at Port
Aransas, a cane pole, a cork, fishing for piggy perch. He was 6. I
had my hand on his shoulder, counseling about patience, about
waiting for the full bite of the fish and not the nibble. And he
did, and he got one, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday, too, when we were walking across a field
together, shotguns in hand, waiting for doves. He was 14. I had my
hand on his shoulder, counseling about patience, about hiding till
the last minute, waiting until they come in range, and then the
quick, perfect flow of the end of the gun with the bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hang on, Dad, I think that fish is wearing down.'' He had his
hand on my shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We flew into San Jose on a Sunday evening. We got the car the
next day and headed for the hills.
</P>
<P>
   James is a Spanish teacher. He'd spent three weeks in Costa Rica
the year before, so he knew his way around. He led the way.
</P>
<P>
   First thing was getting the right vehicle. It was a
four-wheel-drive Isuzu Trooper, pretty worn, but we thought it
would do. It looked tough.
</P>
<P>
   Soon I was introduced to what should be the state symbol of
Costa Rica, the ``huecos grandisimos.''
</P>
<P>
   No, those are not some rare bird. They are potholes, some as big
around and deep as bathtubs, some just rough ruts, and they are
everywhere. Driving among them makes everybody look like a drunk.
You go all over the road to avoid as many as you can. ``Ca-lunk,
ca-lunk,'' the jostling is as rude as a New York subway crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It took us four hours to get to Fortuna, in the central
mountains, where the famed Arenal volcano loomed.
</P>
<P>
   The highways were not always paved, never wider than a
farm-to-market road, always busy with livestock and pedestrians and
tractors.
</P>
<P>
   The landscape was lush. This was the green side of the country _
we'd be spending most of our time in the dry, Pacific side. Here
were fields of coffee plants, woods, pasture and cattle. Every
fence post had a canopy of leaves on it. The chopped trees
sprouted.
</P>
<P>
   Road signs were an afterthought, but James could get all the
directions he needed with the charm of his Spanish. Our wrong turns
didn't last long.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Back in Austin, his home, James had gotten to know a gardener
named Rigo Arce. He was from Costa Rica, couldn't speak English;
James didn't have many people he could practice his Spanish with.
They talked up a storm on numerous visits.
</P>
<P>
   It happened that Rigo was from Fortuna and had a dozen brothers
and sisters and cousins there. He wrote a letter of introduction
for James. We brought it with us. It opened doors.

   One brother, Oliver, was a fishing guide, and he took us to Lake
Arenal. It was just like bass fishing in a Texas lake, in an area
something like the rugged hills around Possum Kingdom in North
Central Texas, but here we were in the shadow of a coughing,
smoking volcano. The fish were ``guapote,'' a wide, striped, dark
green bass cousin but with big teeth and a temperament to match. We
caught a half-dozen. Just as many broke free. ``''Gracias a dios!''
Thanks to God!'' Oliver said with each strike.
</P>
<P>
   James had wanted to see the Arenal, the volcano, at night, but a
veil of clouds had kept its red top hidden.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, however, knew the secret. You had to come around to the
other side of it, to the dam, beyond the Tabacon resort, he said.
Then, at night, the clouds often lifted away and you could see the
red spout.
</P>
<P>
   We tried it. Out on the dam, on the side of the road, a family
had stopped for a sort of volcano picnic as they waited for the
darkness. We waited with them, sitting on the side of the road,
listening to the drumbeat of frogs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, high in the darkness, we saw an orange sputter, then a
glow, and then the glow broke up into red pieces _ molten rock
tumbling down the mountain. The fire was alive.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Oliver went with us from Fortuna to help us find the road to our
next stop, the Pacific coastal town of Tamarindo. He went halfway,
driving with us all morning, then took the bus back.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Costa Rican way of doing things. Somebody is good
to your brother back in the States? You have a friend for life in
Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pura vida'' is a phrase you'll hear often here. The pure life.
The good life.
</P>
<P>
   It means other things, too _ ``how are you?'' ``OK,'' ``cool,''
``goodbye.'' ``Pura vida.'' Good people in a beautiful country
where friendship and helpfulness and friendliness are paramount.
The good life.
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher Columbus first wandered into the area in 1502,
the Indians offered him gifts of gold, and the Spanish explorers
began referring to the place as the ``rich coast,'' or Costa Rica.
</P>
<P>
   The Spaniards thought they had an area rich in mineral wealth,
but that was not the case. Costa Rica was rich in other things.
</P>
<P>
   Mountains, rain forests, semiarid plains and stretches of
cropland; the Caribbean on one side, the Pacific on the other, all
of which could be called the Oregon coast of Central America, with
its true blue water crashing into rocks; and a climate that doesn't
stand still, if you don't. Because of the varied landscape, you can
get the tropics on one side of the mountains, West Texas on the
other and Colorado on top. This makes for a tiny country that is
one of the most bio-diverse in the world. It is home to 5 percent
of all the plant and animal species in the world. Rich, indeed.
``Pura vida.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Tamarindo is a resort town famed for its surfing. We spent two
days here.
</P>
<P>
   James was determined to catch a wave. He'd never surfed much
before. He was also determined that I learn, too. I tried.
</P>
<P>
   The board looked too big for me to handle, so we decided that
dear old Dad would start off small, on a boogie board, which is a
sawed-off, bantam-weight surfboard for the wave-disabled _ sort of
a surfboard with training wheels.
</P>
<P>
   At least I could carry it. After a time I snagged a wave or two,
in the shallows, skimming into shore on my stomach.
</P>
<P>
   James left me for the big water. He went out and worked at it,
and in an hour he was standing, bending, turning down the hills of
waves, and I was remembering the old days again.
</P>
<P>
   He was 4. He wanted those training wheels off his bike.
Unmechanical Dad was reluctant. How was I ever going to get them
back on if things didn't go well?
</P>
<P>
   He nagged. I took the little wheels off, and he got on. I held
him upright for a second and then gave him a push. He took off and
never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Dad did three waves on his boogie board and sat on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Our last stop was Quepos, seven hours south of Tamarindo, also
on the Pacific. It's where the best deep-sea fishing is.
</P>
<P>
   The roads were worse than ever, the ``huecos grandisimos''
unavoidable. We lunged and plunged, bumping and grinding, and the
dust was a chalky fog. Cars traveled with their headlights on.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, on a rare stretch of smooth pavement, a herd of goats
bounded across the highway two vehicles ahead of ours. A fruit
truck hit the brakes, a tour bus hit the fruit truck, pineapples
hit the ground and we missed the whole thing by inches. The goats
weren't even startled.
</P>
<P>
   Quepos (''Kay-pose)'' was an oasis. Not green _ the jungle
around it was often brown and crisp because of the dry spell _ but
at least the dust was gone. The ocean was blue and cool. The air
felt lush.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Librett runs an offshore charter outfit called On the
Fly. He's an American expatriate with a forward-thinking philosophy
on fishing. We'd made reservations months in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sport'' is the key word. He uses fly rods (typically used in
trout streams) for catching sailfish _ weighing from 100 to 200
pounds. And he follows a catch-and-release system, taking extra
care when removing the hook and patting the worn-down fish back to
oxygen viability before sending it back to the deep. None of that
winching in of fish like a heavy-equipment operator and heading for
the taxidermist.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't get to use fly rods this time. The fish were slow to
surface and lacked enthusiasm for the baits. When you use a fly
rod, you've got to tease the fish close to the boat with a hookless
lure, then toss some real bait to them with the smaller rod.
</P>
<P>
   We did a lot of sitting that day. The fish showed up hourly or
so, and Marvin the deckhand was supposed to announce fish sightings
and give us directions on which of five baits it was hitting. But
each time Marvin just went nuts and started screaming in Spanish,
and we'd all lunge for the nearest rod.
</P>
<P>
   James caught a 40-pound dorado _ a blunt-headed, rainbow-colored
fish that is known as a mahi-mahi in other ports. We had several
near-misses with sailfish, then James got one hooked.
</P>
<P>
   He played it well. They danced together. His fish was a
ballerina. He got it in, we took a few quick pictures, and she was
on her way. The guide guessed 125 pounds, a nice fish.
</P>
<P>
   Then, toward noon, it was my turn.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   I struggled a little longer with mine, although it wasn't as
big. It took out line again and again, thrashed on the surface,
dived, turned, danced. It was a solid thrill, one of those guy
things, touching the wild.
</P>
<P>
   My son stayed close beside me, guiding, encouraging, gently
showing the way. This was my first sailfish. He'd caught a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   At last I got my fish to the boat. Librett said it was too tired
to bring up for pictures. He had to get the hook out at once. In
seconds it was free and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good job, Dad,'' James said. ``Good job.''

WATER GARDENS CALM THE IRRITABLE 
 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Water. A welcome, cooling thought these hot, dry days.
</P>
<P>
   A water garden can lessen the wallop of three-digit
temperatures. The sight and sound of water magically calms and
cools the irritable and overheated.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians and Persians got the idea thousands of years ago, when
they installed decorative pools in their gardens. The cool,
reflective surfaces were the antithesis to dry desert sands.
</P>
<P>
   Centuries later, wealthy Americans splurged on water gardens _
from the 1880s to about 1920. As we approached the '90s, water
gardening gained a broader audience. Now ponds, pools and
watertight containers filled with aquatics have made their way into
back yards and onto patios and apartment balconies.
</P>
<P>
   There is a water garden for every person, for every budget. It
doesn't have to be expensive, says Leo van Poppel, Texas branch
manager at Lilypons Water Gardens in Brookshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water gardening is not difficult,'' van Poppel says. ``But
there are some basics.''
</P>
<P>
   LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
</P>
<P>
   Place a water garden where it will receive as much sun as
possible. Try to steer clear of tree branches, not only because
falling leaves can be a nuisance, but also because branches block
light. Most aquatics like abundant sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid low spots. A hard rain can carry unwanted fertilizers,
pesticides and other contaminants into a water garden installed in
low areas.
</P>
<P>
   Place a water garden where you can enjoy it.
</P>
<P>
   DECIDE ON SIZE
</P>
<P>
   Once you've determined location, consider size. A water garden
does not have to be large to be enjoyable. You can create a water
garden in most any watertight container or install an in-ground
pond in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that water gardens are ecosystems that contain
debris such as sediments, fish waste, decaying plant parts and
algae. These can alter the balance of the water garden and cloud
the water. While various inhabitants such as filtering plants and
scouring snails can maintain balance in smaller water gardens, more
filtration is often needed to ensure clean, oxygenated water in
larger ponds.
</P>
<P>
   TYPE OF GARDEN
</P>
<P>
   Apartment gardeners can enjoy water gardens in containers. Those
with land have the option of installing in-ground concrete,
preformed or liner ponds.
</P>
<P>
   Installing a concrete pond is labor intensive. Also, the
material must be thick enough _ 4 to 5 inches _ to withstand the
water's weight, which is 8{ pounds a gallon. A 6-foot-by-6-foot
pond that is 18 inches deep will hold 405 gallons of water. That's
3,442 pounds. You may want to call in a professional.
</P>
<P>
   A preformed Fiberglas pond is a quick solution for the homeowner
who wants a water garden. Shapes vary considerably from rectangular
to round, crescent to lagoon. You will need to dig a level hole,
drop in the pond, fill with water, and stock. Preformed ponds also
may be placed on patios or dropped into decks. Prices vary.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of water gardeners select economical PVC or
rubber liners, van Poppel estimates. The heavy-duty materials vary
in thickness and size, giving gardening design options. Sturdy
liners cannot be torn by hand and, even if punctured, are easily
repaired. Most are guaranteed for 20 years. Liners run from under
$25 to hundreds of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   To install a water garden using a liner, first outline the shape
you wish with a garden hose or rope.
</P>
<P>
   Mark the outline with a shovel. Then begin digging, at a depth
no more than 2 feet, from the inside out. Water gardens are 12-24
inches deep. Van Poppel says 18 inches is more than adequate. The
pond can be a uniform depth, or you can carve a shelf for those
plants that prefer shallower waters. As an alternative to an
earthen shelf, Van Poppel suggests a concrete block, painted black,
to display such plants.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure the excavation will not allow pond water to overflow
or runoff from heavy rains to pour in.
</P>
<P>
   Once excavation is completed, drape and shape the liner,
smoothing out wrinkles. Leave the excess for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Begin filling the pond with water, and when nearly full, trim
the excess from the liner. Secure and camouflage the edges with
brick or stone coping. Use plants to enhance the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   Once a pond is installed, there is the fun of stocking the water
garden. Plants, fish and scavengers _ those snails, tadpoles and
clams that help keep the pool clean _ are the inhabitants for this
watery world.
</P>
<P>
   CHOOSING PLANTS
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous aquatic plants to choose from and countless
ways to arrange their textures, lines and colors in a water garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is important, however, to include oxygenating plants in the
water garden. These grow underwater and control algae _ that
unwanted lime-green mossy stuff that clouds the water. Oxygenating
plants successfully compete for these nutrients, starving out the
algae and adding oxygen to the water. These plants also provide
shelter for spawning fish and absorb carbon dioxide given off by
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Oxygenating plants include anacharis (Elodea densa), parrot's
feather (Myriophyllum brasilienese) and red hygrophilia
(Hygrophilia polysperma rubra).
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, 40 percent to 60 percent of the water's surface is
covered with floating plants. The floating foliage gives fish shade
on a hot day, keeps water temperatures down in summer and deprives
algae of the sunlight it needs to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Floating plants may or may not have roots anchored in buckets of
soil placed on the bottom of the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Floaters include duckweed (Lemna minor) and water lettuce
(Pistia stratiotes).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every water garden needs a flower or two. Waterlilies
(Nymphaea spp.) produce exotic, jewellike blooms and circular,
flat, floating foliage. There are hardy waterlilies, those that
multiply more quickly and survive winter here, and tropical
waterlilies, which will pull through a mild winter but succumb to
freezing temperatures. The blooms of the hardy waterlilies open in
late morning and close at night. They come in a variety of colors;
some change in color as they mature.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical waterlilies, which produce more and larger blooms than
the hardy lilies, carry their flowers above the water and come in
pink, red, salmon, yellow, blue, purple and white. Some are
fragrant. Some tropicals open only at night.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical waterlilies can be used as annuals or overwintered,
kept alive but not actively growing, in a greenhouse in a washtub.
</P>
<P>
   Plant waterlilies in buckets of garden soil that is void of
peat, perlite or vermiculite. Sprinkle pea gravel on top of the
soil to keep the dirt in place and to discourage fish from
uprooting your plants.
</P>
<P>
   If you opt for a fountain in your water garden, place the plants
where the water is calm.
</P>
<P>
   Lilies are heavy feeders, and you'll see best results if you
fertilize with time-release tablets once a month. Cut or pinch
spent blooms. Repot when leaves overlap in water and blooms
decrease.
</P>
<P>
   As you shop for oxygenators, floaters and flowers, consider bog
plants to increase vertical, textural and colorful interest. In
nature, bog or marginal plants live in the consistently moist area
at a pond's edge. These are the plants that can perch on that shelf
you created when digging your water garden.
</P>
<P>
   Among the root-hardy marginals are pickerel rush (Pontederia
cordata) with violet-blue bloom spikes; horsetail (Equisetum
hyemale), recognized by its slender, round, jointed stems;
miniature cattail (Typha minima) and sweet flag (Acorus spp.),
which has slender, irislike foliage in heights to 4 feet. Taro
(Colocasia spp.) is a tender perennial with tropical foliage shaped
like elephant ears. Papyrus, (Cyperus spp.) produces clumps of
umbrellalike swirls topped with brown flower clusters in summer.
Louisiana iris bring color and swordlike foliage 2 to 5 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid the use of pesticides in the water garden. Add fish to
take care of mosquito larvae. Van Poppel recommends goldfish for
smaller ponds. Koi need considerable room.
</P>
<P>
   Scavengers help maintain a healthy, balanced aquatic world.
Snails will scour the sides and bottom of the pond. Tadpoles eat
decaying plant material and algae, too.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller water gardens can be balanced, self-sustaining
ecosystems, but van Poppel says it can take a few months to achieve
that balance, so don't panic if the water goes off-color. A larger
body of water may need a filtering system. There are mechanical and
biological filters, both placed outside the pond.
</P>
<P>
   Features such as a waterfall, fountain or bubbler lights and
statuary can be added to boost interest in and around a water
garden.

FANS LOSE PATIENCE WITH COLLINS, SHOW 

</HEADLINE>
 COLLINS-HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDY SUMMA 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Take a look at him now.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Collins, the venerable 47-year-old pop icon, is trying to
reinvent himself _ and his music. And not everybody is happy.
</P>
<P>
   Before an almost-sold-out crowd at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell
Pavilion in The Woodlands Thursday night, classic Genesis and Phil
Collins tracks were performed. And the talented British
drummer/singer was onstage. But Collins, an able drummer in his own
right, was only that for most of the night. He didn't sing until
the very end.
</P>
<P>
   The Phil Collins Big Band took the stage at 8:30 p.m. and
delivered efficient and often sophisticated big-band renditions of
the classic rocker's greatest hits. The orchestration was tight,
the band hit almost every note and the arrangements were sometimes
beautiful. The music that made Collins famous (``Invisible Touch,''
``That's All'') translated perfectly into big-band stylings.
</P>
<P>
   But many in the humid pavilion audience obviously came to hear
the wily Brit's voice trounce along with the music. By 9:30,
smattered, half-hearted boos and yelps of ``Sing!'' were heard
between songs, prompting the normally cool Collins to snap, ``Did
they run out of beer?''
</P>
<P>
   No, but many in the audience ran out of patience and began
leaving in droves. Apparently, their appreciation of big-band
music, Phil Collins-style anyway, had worn thin. But for those who
kept an open mind, the music was personal and well-received.
Collins' music was played in a different style, to be sure, but the
orchestral variations only added depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Invisible Touch,'' the fast-paced melody-driven Genesis
anthem, was a highlight of an easygoing jam session Thursday night.
The song built confidently and methodically, like a slow train to
nowhere. The well-paced song climaxed with a fantastically polished
Gerald Albright saxophone solo.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant Albright caressed the high notes and bussed the
low ones as he wailed through a brilliant performance. His sultry
note-dancing through ``Against All Odds (Take a Look at Me Now)''
was topped only by his breathtaking solo during ``In the Air
Tonight.'' He got a standing ovation for ``Against All Odds,'' but
his soulful play through ``Tonight'' was the high point of the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Next, ``I Don't Care Anymore'' (Collins' ``Take This Job and
Shove It'' homage, perhaps) was performed with playful Pink Panther
undertones. After a forgetful ``Hold On, My Heart,'' the group
strutted through the rhumba-singed ``In the Air Tonight,'' with the
Albright solo stealing the show.
</P>
<P>
   The band segued into ``Georgia on My Mind,'' a bloated
solo-heavy opportunity for a restroom break, and then gave the
stage to Oleta Adams for a curiously long six-song set.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, a talented vocalist and powerful stage presence, did
everything right _ she sang with soul and gave a solid performance.
By the time she slinked onstage, however, many in the audience just
wanted Collins to step up to the mike.
</P>
<P>
   The show, the fourth stop on a 13-city summer tour, had been
advertised as ``instrumental,'' and Collins stayed true to its
definition. He finally did belt out a few numbers (Tony Bennett's
``The Way You Look Tonight''), and the dwindling audience took
notice. But after two hours of ornate orchestration and anxious
anticipation, the vocals lacked the overall impact many had hoped
for. Maybe the encore should have been his 1994 single ``We Wait
and We Wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phil Collins Big Band put on a great show. But the Phil
Collins moniker on the title may have been overemphasized.

HELPFUL HINTS IF YOU'RE GOING TO COSTA RICA
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies COSTA RICA-TRAVEL) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HADDAWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   General information: Costa Rican Tourist Board: (800) 343-6332.
</P>
<P>
   Getting in: You need a valid passport; visas aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out: Departure tax is about $17. People just outside the
airport will take care of you.
</P>
<P>
   Getting around: There are about 50 car-rental agencies in Costa
Rica. We rented an Isuzu Trooper for $350 a week, unlimited
mileage, with $1,000 deposit refunded if you bring the car back in
one piece.
</P>
<P>
   Check your vehicle carefully before you take possession of it.
We didn't. The brake pads were worn down to the metal; the horn
didn't work, nor the heat gauge. The engine light came on and off
for no reason. We had a flat on our last day; the jack didn't fit
the car.
</P>
<P>
   Money: Colones are valued at about 255 to the dollar. To
exchange cash, U.S. bills must be in good shape, not worn or torn.
Take traveler's checks. Cash machines are hard to find in smaller
towns.
</P>
<P>
   Medical: This is a clean country. Although we generally used
bottled water, we weren't absolutely careful, and we had no
problems. Malaria pills are recommended. Check with your doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Where to stay: ``Lonely Planet'' notes that there are more than
200 hotels in San Jose, but accommodations can be tight in the high
season, which is December to May. It suggests making reservations
three months in advance for Christmas and Easter, with rooms
prepaid.
</P>
<P>
   Only blocks from the airport is a Hampton Inn, just like the
ones at home. You can avoid the congestion of San Jose if all
you're interested in is a clean place to stay before or after a
trip into the hinterlands. (800) 426-7866. $65 double occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   We stayed at the Cabina Jireh in Fortuna. New construction, hot
showers, air conditioning. $69 for a double. 011-506-479-9004.
</P>
<P>
   We enjoyed the Hotel Tamarindo in Tamarindo. It's right on the
beach under a canopy of palms, but the rooms are a lot nicer in the
new addition across the street. Doubles $83-112. 011-506-653-0031.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of character at the Hotel California in Quepos. The walls
are painted with murals of Costa Rican national parks. The
architecture is Eurotech. Natural setting at the top of a hill,
with squirrel monkeys as neighbors. Beautiful pool. $60-100.
011-506-777-1234.
</P>
<P>
   Resorts: No, no, you don't have to rough it. Several resorts are
nestled in the hills between Quepos and Manuel Antonio. Hotel La
Mariposa offers 10 villas with big windows that look out on the
white sand beaches and tropical hills. Also ceiling fans, balconies
and bathrooms that incorporate tropical gardens. $220-$240 for a
double. 011-506-777-0355.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, on 42 acres among waterfalls, forests and sand beaches
is Tulemar Bungalows. Kayaks available for wave-running. $180 for a
bungalow that sleeps four. 011-506-777-0580.
</P>
<P>
   Definitely upscale is the Tabacon Lodge outside Fortuna, in the
shadow of the Arenal volcano. As part of the stay, you get free use
of the thermal springs at Tabacon Resort across the highway. Sit
under a warm waterfall or baste in one of the warm pools among
tropical gardens. Massages, swim-up bar, good view of the volcano
at night. Doubles $88-$100. 011-506-256-1500.
</P>
<P>
   Where to eat: We never had a bad meal, but we had a few
mysterious ones. Lots of black beans, fried things. Go in one of
the open-air cafes where the natives hang out and ask for the
``plato tipico'' (blue-plate special) and see what you get.
</P>

   STUDENT LOAN RATES GOING DOWN SOON
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
By Pamela Yip &QL; 
Your money &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU ARE headed for college in the fall or spring, or your
child is, you should be in the heat of filling out applications for
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   There's good news, but timing is important.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that starting July 1, interest rates on federal
student loans drop dramatically to the lowest rates in 17 years.
The decline from about 8.25 percent to 7.46 percent on that date
reflects a change in the formula for calculating the rates.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the rate is based on the yield of the 91-day U.S.
Treasury bill, plus an additional 3.1 percentage points. On July 1,
the spread will drop to 2.3 percentage points. There's a 8.25
percent cap over the life of the loan.
</P>
<P>
   Those will be one of the lowest student loan interest rates in
17 years. However, there's a catch.
</P>
<P>
   These rates apply only for Stafford loans, the most common
college loan program, taken out between July 1 and Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that private lenders making student loans don't like
the new system because they will be paid less by the federal
government for making the loans.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, lenders are paid a 3.1 percentage-point spread above
the 91-day treasury bill yield, but that spread will fall to 2.8
percentage points in July.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders said that's not enough and some may be forced to pull
out of the student loan program if Congress doesn't find a
permanent solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It now makes it more difficult for us to find a reasonable
return for the investment and risk that we take in making these
loans,'' said Jim Gathard, business executive for education loans
at NationsBank in Charlotte, N.C. ``It is very likely that some
lenders will find that they can no longer participate in the
program because the yield margin is so narrow today that they
wouldn't want to make the loans.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenders can't expect what the government pays them to go up
because of budget constraints, so the best they hope for is that
things won't be so up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The key to giving lenders some certainty is Congress'
re-authorization of the Higher Education Act, which would make
permanent the changes and the lower rates.
</P>
<P>
   The House has approved its version of the legislation and the
Senate is expected to take it up this week.
</P>
<P>
   Call your U.S. senator and urge him or her to support
re-authorization of the Higher Education Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Congress were to fail to pass the Higher Education
re-authorization, there would be a problem for loans on or after
Oct. 1, 1998,'' said John E. Dean, attorney for the Consumer
Bankers Association in Washington, D.C., a banking trade group.
</P>
<P>
   However, I don't expect Congress to commit political suicide by
doing nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody anticipates that happening,'' Dean said.
</P>
<P>
   The message for parents and students is don't panic. Loan money
isn't about to dry up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question whatsoever about the availability of
loans for students returning to school this fall,'' Dean said.
``Virtually all students who need loans are going to be able to
find them very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   However, don't dillydally about filling out financial aid
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders I talked to said they don't plan to pull out of the
student loan program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not anticipate major lender withdrawals,'' Dean said.
``It will cause a reassessment of participation by some smaller
lenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger lenders will figure out a way to become more
efficient so they would be able to continue to make student loans,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we decided to stay in the program even with the
30-basis-point (0.3 percent) reduction,'' said Mary Polsley, senior
vice president of corporate relations in Bank One's Education
Finance Group. ``We're pretty dedicated to the student loan
program, and we feel we can make up the 30 basis points.''
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank also will remain in the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to make loans because our customers have a
substantial need to find ways to finance higher education,''
Gathard said.
</P>
<P>
   But what's key to him is that Congress acts on a permanent
solution instead of a temporary fix so that lenders have a firm
guideline to work with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary is the worst way for me,'' Gathard said. ``If I know
I have a fixed index and fixed spread for the next five, six years,
I can try to say let me see how I can work my budget so I can at
least know what my expectations are.''

<P>
   CARVILLE, La. _ Tucked away in a bend in the Mississippi River,
on a quiet two-lane country road, is a place where fever, fear and
hope have intersected for more than 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts occupy these grounds. Ghosts of people brought in
handcuffs to live out their days, under aliases, behind a
barbed-wire fence; of women denied their babies and, sometimes,
motherhood; of lovers who obeyed passion's demands by slipping
through a hole in the fence; and of nuns who loved people for whom
even the Bible has an unkind word, ``unclean.'''
</P>
<P>
   But this is a place of the living, too, and they are facing a
jolting change. This place, once called the Louisiana Leper Home,
but now commonly known as Carville, after the town whose physical
and psychological landscape it dominates, may soon close.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Rep. Richard Baker, R-La., and signed into
law by President Clinton in November, will transfer control of the
site, the Gillis W. Long Hansen's Disease Center, from the U.S.
Public Health Service to the State of Louisiana, which plans to use
it for troubled young people.
</P>
<P>
   The few patients who still live here can accept a $33,000 annual
stipend and leave Carville for good, move to a long-term nursing
home in nearby Baton Rouge, where they will receive much of the
same care they received here, or remain in Carville with fewer
doctors and nurses and less intensive medical care. They will have
until Oct. 1 to decide.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients do not want Carville to change, and at least half
do not want to leave. Once their prison, Carville is now home.
``Some of the patients have never known any other life than this
place,'' said Rachel Pendleton, 63, who has been a patient here for
almost 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the hospital has outlived much of its medical usefulness.
Most people are naturally immune to leprosy, and nowadays it can be
treated on an outpatient basis, thanks to the sulfone drug
treatments pioneered at Carville in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   The stigmas of the infection _ the rotting limbs from repeated
trauma to nerve-damaged extremities; the facial deformities; the
blindness _ are now largely prevented with aggressive multi-drug
therapy and orthopedic management. The number of patients at
Carville has dropped from about 400 at its height in the mid-1980s
to 134 today.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has set the year 2000 as a goal
date for eradicating leprosy as a widespread public health problem.
It wants to see the number of cases in endemic areas like India and
the Philippines drop below 1 in 10,000. There are about 6,000
people with leprosy in the United States, but ``medically they're
cured,'' said Dr. Robert Jacobson, the director of Carville. As
long as they take their medication, their disease is in remission
and they are not infectious.
</P>
<P>
   But Carville has not vanished as quietly as it began, in 1894
when seven lepers were brought by coal barge to slave cabins on an
abandoned sugar plantation. Over the years, many people have argued
that the federal government has a moral obligation to keep the
place open. They say that a government that deprived people of
liberties and a chance to develop basic skills must not abandon
them.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of dollars spent each year to maintain Carville
made it an easy target for budget cutters. But Dr. John Duffy, a
former director and outspoken Carville critic, said that for years
Federal lawmakers were hesitant to take action. Duffy, who argues
that there is no longer a need for a place like Carville, said
public officials lacked ``the will or intestinal fortitude to
confront patients and employees who were living off the federal
largess.''
</P>
<P>
   For some patients, Carville cannot close soon enough. ``I really
want to get out of here and forget this place ever existed,'' Mrs.
Pendleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Leprosy was first diagnosed in Mrs. Pendleton at the age of 5,
when a numb spot developed on her leg, but she went untreated for 9
years. At the age of 14, she says, she was kidnapped by public
health officials and brought to Carville, which, she said, ``robbed
me of the best years of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, Nancy Battista, 69, said she had ``mixed
emotions'' about the impending changes. Ms. Battista, who arranges
books in the Carville library with hands curving and rigid from
leprosy-related nerve damage, recently separated from her husband,
a former Carville patient who now lives in California. She plans to
take the annual stipend and move to San Francisco to live close to
her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Battista said she was lucky to have something most patients
did not have: family. But many of her Carville friends will
probably remain in what is the only home they have ever known. In
Carville, she found a far better place than she had known in her
native Philippines, where she was locked up at night in barracks,
not given medication and was fed a diet of soup and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very bad memories there, very bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Carville, she said, ``we were taken care of, regardless,
whether rich or poor.
</P>
<P>
   In his tiny apartment, the walls covered with his oil paintings,
Johnny Harmon, a stooped 86-year-old with emphysema, remembers how
the doctors who diagnosed his leprosy in 1935 disclosed it to a
local newspaper, despite his pleas. A headline in the newspaper
reported, ``Local Health Official Discovers Case of Leprosy in
Highway department.''
</P>
<P>
   Harmon believes patients are better off staying at Carville.
``If you get diagnosed in a small town, where they don't know
anything about the disease, they get scared to death and scare your
family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon met his wife, Anne, at Carville, where she was a patient,
and they settled in a small cottage there. ``My folks thought I was
crazy for marrying a girl with leprosy,'' Harmon said. ```Well,' I
told them, `I have leprosy, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Francis de Sayles Provancher, 81, a Daughter of Charity
here for 50 years, hopes she will die at Carville. ``The only thing
I want is to be buried at Carville with my patients.'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Francis has lived at Carville for all but seven years
since 1942, when she developed a lifelong passion for treating
leprosy. Fiercely devoted to her patients, she replies sharply when
asked about the Bible's admonitions against lepers: ``The Bible
should be rewritten. It was wrong on that count.''

   RUSSIA-NUKE (Moscow) _ Ignoring American protests, Russia has

officials said on Monday. The nuclear deal, which is worth more
than $2 billion to Russia's cash-strapped nuclear energy ministry,
is part of an broad array of civilian and military technology

More than being symbols of a sexual revolution, this young couple
signals a growing realm of personal freedom in China that allows

   SCOTUS-HARASS (Washington) _ A sharply divided Supreme Court set
a highly restrictive standard for determining when school districts
can be found liable under Federal law for a teacher's sexual
harassment of a student. A harassment victim can recover damages
from the school district only if a school official with the
authority to intervene actually knew of the teacher's misconduct
and, acting with ``deliberate indifference,'' failed to stop it,
the Court said in an opinion by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The
vote was 5 to 4. The decision came in a case from a school district
near Austin, Texas. By Linda Greenhouse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court struck for the first
time against the federal government's aggressive use of forfeiture,
ruling that a forfeiture intended as punishment is unconstitutional
if the amount seized is ``grossly disproportional'' to the gravity
of the offense. Applying that test in a sharply contested 5-4
ruling, the court went on to declare that the government could not
constitutionally seize $357,144 in undeclared cash that a Los
Angeles man and his family had attempted to bring in their luggage
on a flight to Cyprus to repay a family debt. By Linda Greenhouse.

American Free Trade Agreement lowered trade barriers, the cities
along Texas's long border with Mexico that had hoped to benefit are
instead struggling to become more than glorified truck stops as
they watch their manufacturing jobs go south by the thousands.
Almost everywhere else in the United States, the economy is booming
and the national unemployment rate is the lowest in nearly 30
years. But along the border unemployment persists at two and three
times the national rate, and incomes remain far below state and

   FISH-LOGO (Republic, Mo.) _ Eight years ago, on a whim, Marilyn
Shexsnayder entered the contest to design a logo for her hometown.
She was a stockbroker, not an artist. But using her colored pencils
and her computer she drew an oustretched hand, a family of four in
silhouette, and, to portray the centrality of religion in this old
railroad town with more than 25 churches and about 8,000 people,
she sketched the simple fish that she had regarded from childhood
as a universal symbol of faith. She won the logo contest and $100
prize. Now, suddenly, the little fish is causing an awfully big
splash. Someone complained about the fish to the American Civil
Liberties Union, and in February the organization sent a letter
asking the mayor to delete the fish from the logo because the fish
was ``unmistakably identified with Christianity.'' By Laurie

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lee Janzen sat down and dandled the U.S. Open
trophy on his right knee, as though it were his son, Connor, or in
a more playful mood, his wife, Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it was an unconscious but loving gesture.
</P>
<P>
   It had been nearly an hour since he had completed one of the
most remarkable comebacks in major tournament history, turning a
seven-shot deficit to Payne Stewart into a one-stroke win at the
Olympic Club. And though he had pretty much emptied himself of his
rawer emotions, Janzen still could cloud up when he thought of what
he had done, where he had done it, and most of all, how.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I feel right now,'' he said, still tanning himself in the
glow of his final-round 68, ``is complete satisfaction, knowing
that I played my absolute best in the tournament I love the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He isn't kidding about any of that, either. He stepped out of
the blow-dried pack in 1993 by winning the Open at Baltusrol,
coincidentally beating Stewart on the last day of that tournament
as well, then won the Players Championship in 1995 to move to the
short list of great-player candidates, then went three years
without winning anything but hugs from the family and a series of
sizable thanks-for-coming checks.
</P>
<P>
   Which is right where he, and everyone else in the field, thought
they would be when day dawned over the Olympic Club in San
Francisco. Stewart wasn't too far ahead, necessarily, but he was
playing too well to be run down, and especially after Janzen
bogeyed the second and third holes to fall the equivalent of two
holes behind even before Stewart had cleared his throat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I bogeyed 2 and 3, my only thought was honestly to hit
some good shots, play some good holes, and see if I couldn't
somehow get back into it,'' he said, making whistling in the
graveyard look optimistic by comparison. ``I wasn't thinking about
winning, but I wasn't counting myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, why duplicate the efforts of the rest of the
golf-speaking world? They all knew that Stewart had this one packed
in dry ice and ready for shipping, because nobody in a position to
challenge had shown much gumption to actually do so.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, though, was an odd duck among the flock this week. While
most of the chorus was scatting away about the USGA, its rulebook
and for all we know, its catering, Janzen was standing foursquare
for fast greens, hard fairways, improbable roughs and thick trees
that take balls and never give them back.
</P>
<P>
   Well, most of the time, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The bogey on 3 set him back mentally, but had he known it would
be his last, he might have been a lot giddier about the way the day
was going to turn out. He birdied 4. He put a ball in a tree at 5,
walked for more than a minute toward the tree, then back toward the
tee box, when a gust of wind blew the ball out and into the rough,
which no matter how thick or high is still a better lie than a
branch 30 feet above ground.
</P>
<P>
   This reminded many observers of how Janzen beat Stewart at
Baltusrol in '93, by putting a shot between two trees to save a par
that looked hopeless. It reminded him of nothing but how much more
work there was to do.
</P>
<P>
   He birdied 7. He birdied 11. And then he birdied 13, and told
himself he no longer would watch the leaderboard to see how Stewart
was coming along. This was a departure for him, since like any
modern control freak, Janzen wants all the information in his hands
ahead of time. Now, though, he wanted the solitude _ just him, his
caddie and the club in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped looking when I was on the 13th green,'' he said. ``I
just made a point of not doing it after that. I didn't want to
think if I got the lead ... I didn't want to play it safe.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he didn't. There is no reason not to believe him, what
with the evidence there bouncing contentedly on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   For Stewart, well, he left town suspecting, if not out-and-out
knowing, that he would be remembered as the fourth member of an
Olympic Club quartet of failed favorites, with Ben Hogan, Arnold
Palmer and Tom Watson. Stewart said all the right things about
Janzen's winning, as you knew he would, and he spent a few minutes
passionately disputing the concept of the fairway sand divot, one
of which helped pull a bogey out of him at 12.
</P>
<P>
   The sand divot debate we will leave to The Golf Channel's
``Nothing Else On At This Hour Of The Night Theater.'' As for his
testimonial to Janzen, it bears repeating, because it explains how
the professionals will remember Janzen's performance for years to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the third-to-last group, and he shot 68,'' Stewart
said, resisting the temptation to add, ``right on my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody in contention in the golf tournament that shot
under par today expect for Lee Janzen, so he deserves to be the
champion today.''
</P>
<P>
   And later: ``Let me just show you something right here. Now I
hit six fairways in regulation today, and Lee Janzen hit 12. I hit
nine greens in regulation, and Lee Janzen hit 14. Bingo. That's why
I didn't win the golf tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, because for Janzen this had just a tinge
of a labor of love, rather than a sandbag fight with a bouncer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know why I was emotional today?'' he said. ``Because it
says `United States Open' on it. This is the national championship,
and this is just the best one to win. I feel extremely lucky to be
playing golf for a living, and to win the U.S. Open here, well, you
can't do anything better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then someone asked him about the importance of Father's Day, and
having his father, Larry, as well as Connor and Beverly on hand,
and he waxed even more philosophical than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every day that I'm the luckiest guy going,'' he said.
``There's nothing better than being loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Which made a person wonder, if only trophies could talk ...

   Louise Woodward, the British nanny, now back home in England.
Gee, I wonder if any of those people who were cheering for her in
that pub will help her out now, maybe give her a babysitting job.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about brave new world. I don't know whether this is creepy
or science or what, but for the first time ever, a woman has given
birth on the Internet. She's fine, the baby's fine, the keyboard's
a mess.
</P>
<P>
   And, God bless him, 78-year-old Tony Randall became a father

   Paula Jones is getting a nose job. Which I think is great. Now,
she'll finally be able to turn around in her trailer.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown announced they are
separating. Apparently, it's over career differences. I guess she
has one.

   ``After the Bulls won their sixth NBA championship, Chicago
police had to arrest more than 400 people for overturning cars,
looting stores and throwing bottles. In fact, things were so bad,
police ran out of mace and had to spray people with Michael
Jordan's cologne.''
</P>

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I was hurrying toward Union Square during the rainy spell we had
a few weeks ago. My umbrella had collapsed in the wind and my hands
were full of packages.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling rather sorry for myself when I saw a homeless man
lying on a sleeping bag on the side of the street and talking to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, all my self-pity was replaced by guilt. How could I
have felt sorry for myself? I continued to walk along, chastising
myself, and began to search my pockets for change. As I approached
him, I looked more closely and realized that he was not talking to
himself at all _ he was on a cell phone.

<P>
   Sister Sheila Campbell is a native New Yorker but she had never
been to the Aquarium at Coney Island until a friend visited.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely day and the two were enjoying the indoor and
outdoor display of the sea lions, but Sister Sheila didn't want to
miss the shark feeding, whether it was indoors or out.
</P>
<P>
   She asked the attendant standing next to the indoor shark tank
where the sharks would be fed that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady, today we're taking them to Nathan's,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Vargas describes himself as a mature gentleman who has
never taken an interest in the pricey hair salons that cut, blow
and style. He goes to no-frills men's barbershops and opts for the
shortest cut possible. Recently, he came to the conclusion that his
hair style had limited appeal, that perhaps he was the only person
who appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   This sad fact was made clear to him by an unusual experience
while he was sitting in his barber's chair. A little boy was in the
next chair and he was giving both his mother and the barber a hard
time.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, in desperation (Vargas' words), pointed to Vargas
and said in a threatening tone to her son, ``If you don't behave, I
will tell the barber to cut your hair just like his.''
</P>
<P>
   Things eventually settled down and the mother, realizing that
she might have offended Vargas, attempted an apology. ``I just
wanted to scare him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything! Six visiting sailors, out for a night on
the town, recently got on the subway at West 4th Street. They were
gazing around wide-eyed and clearly excited to be in the big city,
said a fellow passenger, Patricia Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   A panhandler entered the car and began his speech: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, sorry to disturb you, but has anyone here had to eat
government cheese day after day, every day?''
</P>
<P>
   Six arms in crisp white uniforms shot up, the other occupants of
the car burst into laughter and the panhandler beat a hasty
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   As Pauline Trigere was walking into the hotel where she usually
has her hair done, a young couple, obviously tourists and
accompanied by their luggage, were awaiting a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy Airport?'' the doorman asked them.
</P>
<P>
   The woman drew herself up indignantly _ no rube she. ``No,'' she
said. ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague's 2-year-old son was visiting him at the office. The
child sat at a nearby desk playing with a cup of pencils, and a
Mickey Mouse pencil caught his eye. He tried to draw with it but it
made no marks. It was unsharpened. ``What's wrong?'' he asked.
``Nothing comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been sharpened yet,'' his father replied.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's face looked blank for a moment but suddenly it lit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get new batteries,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ SCOTT BANE
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Brick Swid was carefully preparing to negotiate the last
step as she went down the escalator at the Port Authority terminal.
A tall young man in blue jeans, directly ahead of her, turned
around and gently helped her off. No words were spoken and he
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swid, who says she is a small older lady, was naturally
curious. She caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you do that?'' she asked. ``I wasn't in need of
assistance. I've traveled all over the world and no one has ever
needed to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my mother in 12 years,'' he said. ``She lives
in the Philippines. I miss her terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And once again, he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   We have taught our 2{-year-old son, Elliot, to be friendly with
the people who live in our apartment building, especially in the
lobby and in the elevators. Those we don't know he refers to as
``neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, distinguished-looking, balding man stepped on the
elevator recently and Elliot immediately greeted him with ``Hello
neighbor,'' but then he added, ``What happened to your hair?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I almost choked. Not getting an answer, Elliot
turned to me and said clearly, ``Mom, what happened to that guy's
hair?'' There was no escape; our floor was still a way off. I was
just about to stammer something when the neighbor replied: ``I lost
my hair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot exclaimed: ``You lost your hair? Will you find it?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I held in our embarrassment and hysteria with
difficulty until we finally arrived at our floor. Getting off the
elevator, Elliot patted his own hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his hair,'' he repeated in amazement and added,
perhaps to reassure us: ``I won't lose mine.''
</P>
<P>
   _ ROXANNE BOK
</P>
<P>
   Maryanne M. Garbowsky was in the checkout line at a supermarket
the other day, just behind the counter waitress at her local deli.
Ms. Garbowsky greeted her.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress smiled in recognition. ``You're the large tea,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garbowsky, more than somewhat surprised, congratulated the
woman on her good memory and said she couldn't wait to relate the
encounter to the friend who usually accompanied her to the deli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the turkey on rye,'' the waitress replied.
</P>
<P>
   They had finished lunch and Muriel Lilker's friend Ina Shivack,
who had walked to the nearby ladies' room, returned almost
immediately. She had no sooner told Mrs. Lilker that it was
occupied than she spotted another customer heading for the same
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on line,'' Mrs. Shivack called out, running after her. The
other woman kept on walking and Mrs. Shivack repeated that she was
on line.
</P>
<P>
   When they both reached the bathroom door, Mrs. Shivack explained
that she had been waiting to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' the other woman replied, ``I thought you were talking
about a computer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A LITTER OF KITTENS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A three-year-old boy went with his dad to see a new litter of
kittens. On returning home, he breathlessly informed his mother,
`There were two boy kittens and two girl kittens.`
</P>
<P>
   `How did you know that?` his mother asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Daddy picked them up and looked underneath,` he replied. `I
think it's printed on the bottom.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRAVY LADLE --- Oldie but greatie &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly priest invited a young rabbi over for dinner. During
the meal, the young rabbi couldn't help noticing how attractive and
shapely the housekeeper was. Over the course of the evening, he
began to wonder if there might be more between the elderly priest
and the housekeeper than met the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the young rabbi's thoughts, the elderly priest
volunteered, `I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you my
relationship with my housekeeper is purely professional.`
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, the housekeeper came to the elderly priest
and said, `Father, ever since your young rabi friend came to
dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful sterling silver
gravy ladle. You don't suppose he took it, do you?`
</P>
<P>
   The priest said, `Well, I doubt it, but I'll write him a letter
just to be sure.` So he sat down and wrote:
</P>
<P>
   `Dear Rabbi:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that you DID take a sterling silver gravy ladle
from my house, and I'm not saying you DIDN`T take it. But the fact
remains that one has been missing ever since you were here.`
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the elderly priest received a letter from
the young rabbi which read:
</P>
<P>
   `Dear Father:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that you DO sleep with your housekeeper, and I'm
not saying that you DON`T sleep with your housekeeper. But the fact
remains that if you were sleeping in your own bed, you would have
found the gravy ladle by now.`

lying on a sleeping bag on the side of the street and talking to

   Sister Sheila Campbell is a native New Yorker but she had never
been to the Aquarium at Coney Island until a friend visited.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely day and the two were enjoying the indoor and
outdoor display of the sea lions, but Sister Sheila didn't want to
miss the shark feeding, whether it was indoors or out.
</P>
<P>

   Luis Vargas describes himself as a mature gentleman who has
never taken an interest in the pricey hair salons that cut, blow
and style. He goes to no-frills men's barbershops and opts for the
shortest cut possible. Recently, he came to the conclusion that his
hair style had limited appeal, that perhaps he was the only person
who appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   This sad fact was made clear to him by an unusual experience
while he was sitting in his barber's chair. A little boy was in the
next chair and he was giving both his mother and the barber a hard
time.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, in desperation (Vargas' words), pointed to Vargas
and said in a threatening tone to her son, ``If you don't behave, I
will tell the barber to cut your hair just like his.''
</P>
<P>
   Things eventually settled down and the mother, realizing that
she might have offended Vargas, attempted an apology. ``I just
wanted to scare him,'' she said.

   Timing is everything! Six visiting sailors, out for a night on
the town, recently got on the subway at West 4th Street. They were
gazing around wide-eyed and clearly excited to be in the big city,
said a fellow passenger, Patricia Hirsch.

<P>
   A panhandler entered the car and began his speech: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, sorry to disturb you, but has anyone here had to eat
government cheese day after day, every day?''
</P>
<P>
   Six arms in crisp white uniforms shot up, the other occupants of
the car burst into laughter and the panhandler beat a hasty
retreat.

   A colleague's 2-year-old son was visiting him at the office. The
child sat at a nearby desk playing with a cup of pencils, and a
Mickey Mouse pencil caught his eye. He tried to draw with it but it
made no marks. It was unsharpened. ``What's wrong?'' he asked.
``Nothing comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been sharpened yet,'' his father replied.

   Dorothy Brick Swid was carefully preparing to negotiate the last
step as she went down the escalator at the Port Authority terminal.
A tall young man in blue jeans, directly ahead of her, turned
around and gently helped her off. No words were spoken and he
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swid, who says she is a small older lady, was naturally
curious. She caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you do that?'' she asked. ``I wasn't in need of
assistance. I've traveled all over the world and no one has ever
needed to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my mother in 12 years,'' he said. ``She lives
in the Philippines. I miss her terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And once again, he walked away.

   We have taught our 2{-year-old son, Elliot, to be friendly with
the people who live in our apartment building, especially in the

``neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, distinguished-looking, balding man stepped on the
elevator recently and Elliot immediately greeted him with ``Hello
neighbor,'' but then he added, ``What happened to your hair?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I almost choked. Not getting an answer, Elliot
turned to me and said clearly, ``Mom, what happened to that guy's
hair?'' There was no escape; our floor was still a way off. I was
just about to stammer something when the neighbor replied: ``I lost
my hair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot exclaimed: ``You lost your hair? Will you find it?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I held in our embarrassment and hysteria with
difficulty until we finally arrived at our floor. Getting off the
elevator, Elliot patted his own hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his hair,'' he repeated in amazement and added,
perhaps to reassure us: ``I won't lose mine.''

she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garbowsky, more than somewhat surprised, congratulated the

   They had finished lunch and Muriel Lilker's friend Ina Shivack,

   &UR; GRAVY LADLE --- Oldie but greatie &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly priest invited a young rabbi over for dinner. During
the meal, the young rabbi couldn't help noticing how attractive and
shapely the housekeeper was. Over the course of the evening, he
began to wonder if there might be more between the elderly priest
and the housekeeper than met the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the young rabbi's thoughts, the elderly priest
volunteered, `I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you my
relationship with my housekeeper is purely professional.`
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, the housekeeper came to the elderly priest
and said, `Father, ever since your young rabi friend came to
dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful sterling silver
gravy ladle. You don't suppose he took it, do you?`
</P>
<P>
   The priest said, `Well, I doubt it, but I'll write him a letter
just to be sure.` So he sat down and wrote:
</P>
<P>
   `Dear Rabbi:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that you DID take a sterling silver gravy ladle
from my house, and I'm not saying you DIDN`T take it. But the fact
remains that one has been missing ever since you were here.`
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the elderly priest received a letter from
the young rabbi which read:
</P>
<P>
   `Dear Father:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that you DO sleep with your housekeeper, and I'm
not saying that you DON`T sleep with your housekeeper. But the fact
remains that if you were sleeping in your own bed, you would have
found the gravy ladle by now.`

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  SCHOOL DISTRICT ISN'T LIABLE FOR TEACHER WHO MOLESTED STUDENT,
COURT RULES
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Note: If there is a question about identifying the victim, her
name was included in the case title and documentation with her
familiy's consent.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
By STEVE LASH &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Texas girl who was molested by her high school
teacher lost her lawsuit against the school district Monday when a
sharply divided Supreme Court ruled the district cannot be held
liable because the teacher's supervisors did not know of his
abhorrent behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the court narrowly interpreted a 1972
federal law aimed at prohibiting sex discrimination in public
schools. That law, Title IX of the Education Amendments, permits
the federal government to restrict funds to schools that
discriminate, but gives students only a limited right to sue
because of harassment and discrimination, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   For a school board to be found liable, students must prove
someone with supervisory responsibility, such as a principal, knew
of and deliberately did nothing to prevent the harassment, the high
court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   No supervisors in the Lago Vista Independent School District
near Austin knew that teacher Frank Waldrop was molesting student
Alida Star Gebser, 15, until a police officer caught the teacher
and student having sex in January 1993, the justices said.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the high court rejected Gebser's argument that
schools should be held liable for abuse committed by teachers. The
justices also were unpersuaded by the federal government's
contention that districts should be held liable when they ``should
have known'' of a teacher's misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, the justices said Title IX is primarily a funding
statute that allows the federal government to restrict funds when
it can show that a school board displayed deliberate indifference
toward sexual discrimination in the classroom and on the playing
fields. Students who sue a school must prove that the board knew of
the harassment but chose to do nothing, the high court held.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one questions that a student suffers extraordinary harm
when subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by a teacher, and
that the teacher's conduct is reprehensible and undermines the
basic purposes of the educational system,'' Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor wrote in the court's majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue in this case, however, is whether the independent
misconduct of a teacher is attributable to the school district that
employs him under a specific federal statute designed primarily to
prevent recipients of federal financial assistance from using the
funds in a discriminatory manner,'' she added. ``Until Congress
speaks differently on the subject ... we will not hold a school
district liable in damages under Title IX for a teacher's sexual
harassment of a student absent actual notice and deliberate
indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia,
Anthony M. Kennedy and Clarence Thomas joined O'Connor's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment that gave rise to the Supreme Court case began in
the spring of 1992, Gebser's freshman year, when Waldrop kissed and
fondled the student after stopping by her home ostensibly to give
her a book. The pair had sex several times during the rest of the
school year and summer.
</P>
<P>
   The student never reported the behavior to school officials.
After the policeman arrested Waldrop, the school district fired him
and the Texas Education Agency revoked his teaching license.
</P>
<P>
   The girl and her mother sued the school board in November 1993,
but lost in both the U.S. District Court for Western Texas and the
5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Both courts held, as the Supreme
Court did, that Title IX holds school boards liable only if they
knew of the harassment and failed to respond.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the school
district should be held liable for the behavior of its employee,
even if supervisors had no actual knowledge of what Waldrop was
doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case presents a paradigmatic example of (an injury) that
was made possible, that was effected, and that was repeated over a
prolonged period because of the powerful influence that Waldrop had
over Gebser by reason of the authority that his employer, the
school district, had delegated to him,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a secondary school teacher, Waldrop exercised even greater
authority and control over his students than employers and
supervisors exercise over their employees,'' Stevens added. ``His
gross misuse of that authority allowed him to abuse his young
student's trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer joined Stevens' dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate dissent, Ginsburg reiterated that school boards
should be held liable for teachers who molest students. However,
she added that a board could escape liability if it had a strong,
well-publicized policy prohibiting and redressing instances of
harassment. A school district with such a policy could not be held
liable for the harassment of a student who ``unreasonably failed to
avail herself'' of the district's procedures, Ginsburg wrote. She
was joined in dissent by Souter and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Gebser's attorney, Terry L. Weldon of Austin, assailed the
Supreme Court's decision, which he said marks ``the end of the
road'' for his client's claim against the school board and rewards
schools that ignore their teachers' misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling ``will allow school districts to cultivate ignorance
of their teachers' wrongdoing and then to assert that ignorance as
a complete defense to any (Title IX) litigation,'' Weldon said.
``This unfairly places all the burden on students who are in most
cases immature and emotionally vulnerable to teachers who exploit
their position of trust and power.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Lago Vista's attorney, Wallace B. Jefferson of San
Antonio, praised the high court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court properly refused to hold school districts
liable for the concealed criminal conduct of abusive employees,''
Jefferson said. ``Most school districts would be financially
devastated by jury verdicts holding them liable for sexual
harassment which they could not have prevented.''

outdoor display of the sea lions, but Sister Sheila didn't want to
miss the shark feeding, whether it was indoors or out.
</P>
<P>
   She asked the attendant standing next to the indoor shark tank
where the sharks would be fed that afternoon.
</P>

   ``Lady, today we're taking them to Nathan's,'' he replied.

   Luis Vargas describes himself as a mature gentleman who has
never taken an interest in the pricey hair salons that cut, blow
and style. He goes to no-frills men's barbershops and opts for the
shortest cut possible. Recently, he came to the conclusion that his
hair style had limited appeal, that perhaps he was the only person
who appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   This sad fact was made clear to him by an unusual experience
while he was sitting in his barber's chair. A little boy was in the
next chair and he was giving both his mother and the barber a hard
time.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, in desperation (Vargas' words), pointed to Vargas
and said in a threatening tone to her son, ``If you don't behave, I
will tell the barber to cut your hair just like his.''
</P>
<P>
   Things eventually settled down and the mother, realizing that
she might have offended Vargas, attempted an apology. ``I just
wanted to scare him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything! Six visiting sailors, out for a night on
the town, recently got on the subway at West 4th Street. They were
gazing around wide-eyed and clearly excited to be in the big city,
said a fellow passenger, Patricia Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   A panhandler entered the car and began his speech: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, sorry to disturb you, but has anyone here had to eat
government cheese day after day, every day?''
</P>
<P>
   Six arms in crisp white uniforms shot up, the other occupants of
the car burst into laughter and the panhandler beat a hasty
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   As Pauline Trigere was walking into the hotel where she usually
has her hair done, a young couple, obviously tourists and
accompanied by their luggage, were awaiting a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy Airport?'' the doorman asked them.
</P>
<P>
   The woman drew herself up indignantly _ no rube she. ``No,'' she
said. ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   A colleague's 2-year-old son was visiting him at the office. The
child sat at a nearby desk playing with a cup of pencils, and a
Mickey Mouse pencil caught his eye. He tried to draw with it but it
made no marks. It was unsharpened. ``What's wrong?'' he asked.
``Nothing comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been sharpened yet,'' his father replied.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's face looked blank for a moment but suddenly it lit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get new batteries,'' he said.

   Dorothy Brick Swid was carefully preparing to negotiate the last
step as she went down the escalator at the Port Authority terminal.
A tall young man in blue jeans, directly ahead of her, turned
around and gently helped her off. No words were spoken and he
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swid, who says she is a small older lady, was naturally
curious. She caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you do that?'' she asked. ``I wasn't in need of
assistance. I've traveled all over the world and no one has ever
needed to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my mother in 12 years,'' he said. ``She lives
in the Philippines. I miss her terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And once again, he walked away.
</P>
<P>
   We have taught our 2{-year-old son, Elliot, to be friendly with
the people who live in our apartment building, especially in the
lobby and in the elevators. Those we don't know he refers to as
``neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, distinguished-looking, balding man stepped on the
elevator recently and Elliot immediately greeted him with ``Hello
neighbor,'' but then he added, ``What happened to your hair?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I almost choked. Not getting an answer, Elliot
turned to me and said clearly, ``Mom, what happened to that guy's
hair?'' There was no escape; our floor was still a way off. I was
just about to stammer something when the neighbor replied: ``I lost
my hair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot exclaimed: ``You lost your hair? Will you find it?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I held in our embarrassment and hysteria with
difficulty until we finally arrived at our floor. Getting off the
elevator, Elliot patted his own hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his hair,'' he repeated in amazement and added,
perhaps to reassure us: ``I won't lose mine.''

   Maryanne M. Garbowsky was in the checkout line at a supermarket
the other day, just behind the counter waitress at her local deli.
Ms. Garbowsky greeted her.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress smiled in recognition. ``You're the large tea,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garbowsky, more than somewhat surprised, congratulated the
woman on her good memory and said she couldn't wait to relate the
encounter to the friend who usually accompanied her to the deli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the turkey on rye,'' the waitress replied.
</P>
<P>
   They had finished lunch and Muriel Lilker's friend Ina Shivack,
who had walked to the nearby ladies' room, returned almost
immediately. She had no sooner told Mrs. Lilker that it was
occupied than she spotted another customer heading for the same
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on line,'' Mrs. Shivack called out, running after her. The
other woman kept on walking and Mrs. Shivack repeated that she was
on line.
</P>
<P>
   When they both reached the bathroom door, Mrs. Shivack explained
that she had been waiting to get in.

   A three-year-old boy went with his dad to see a new litter of
kittens. On returning home, he breathlessly informed his mother,
`There were two boy kittens and two girl kittens.`
</P>
<P>
   `How did you know that?` his mother asked.
</P>
<P>
   `Daddy picked them up and looked underneath,` he replied. `I
think it's printed on the bottom.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRAVY LADLE --- Oldie but greatie &LR;
</P>
<P>
   An elderly priest invited a young rabbi over for dinner. During
the meal, the young rabbi couldn't help noticing how attractive and
shapely the housekeeper was. Over the course of the evening, he
began to wonder if there might be more between the elderly priest
and the housekeeper than met the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Reading the young rabbi's thoughts, the elderly priest
volunteered, `I know what you must be thinking, but I assure you my
relationship with my housekeeper is purely professional.`
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, the housekeeper came to the elderly priest
and said, `Father, ever since your young rabi friend came to
dinner, I've been unable to find the beautiful sterling silver
gravy ladle. You don't suppose he took it, do you?`
</P>
<P>
   The priest said, `Well, I doubt it, but I'll write him a letter
just to be sure.` So he sat down and wrote:
</P>
<P>
   `Dear Rabbi:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that you DID take a sterling silver gravy ladle
from my house, and I'm not saying you DIDN`T take it. But the fact
remains that one has been missing ever since you were here.`
</P>
<P>
   Several days later, the elderly priest received a letter from
the young rabbi which read:
</P>
<P>
   `Dear Father:
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying that you DO sleep with your housekeeper, and I'm
not saying that you DON`T sleep with your housekeeper. But the fact
remains that if you were sleeping in your own bed, you would have
found the gravy ladle by now.`

UNPREDICTABILITY AT THE OLYMPIC CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Payne Stewart tipped his very distinctive cap to
Sunday's two winners. Lee Janzen had the U.S. Open trophy all to
himself, but he shared Stewart's respect for San Francisco's most
famous golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Olympic Club really won,'' Stewart said, ``because
there was one person even-par for the tournament. So I think this
golf course stood up to the test of being an Open championship.''
</P>
<P>
   For three days, though, Stewart pulled a con. He led with ease
before Sunday's final round, four strokes ahead of anyone. He
defied the convention that at the Open, and especially at the
Olympic Club, there is no convention. He banished the craziness and
lived in the fairways. Very rarely did he let the bushy rough
obscure the cut of his knickers.
</P>
<P>
   He had us all going for a while there. Admit it. You were
fooled. The endless rains had finally ended. The fog kept a polite
distance. Stewart was cruising. In this naturally unruly city, on
this inherently rambunctious course, in this purposely confounding
event, there was a perceptible lull.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Sunday, and out went stability. Janzen continued the
hoax for a while, bogeying the second and third holes, playing
possum golf.
</P>
<P>
   At No. 5, he hit into a tree, lost his ball in the leaves. He
seemed truly a goner. But just as he was marching back to the tee,
ready to take a penalty shot, the wind kicked up, a little San
Francisco treat. The ball fell from the tree, and the game was on
at last.
</P>
<P>
   ``After five, when his ball fell out of the tree, you could see
his confidence,'' said Steve Stricker, Janzen's playing partner.
``He walked with a purpose, it looked like.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who led Janzen by seven strokes early in the final
round, started to falter. Janzen just kept charging. He finished
the day at 68, 2 under par for the round, even for the tournament.
He watched on a television monitor as Stewart missed a birdie putt
at 18 for a tie, and he sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   He bent over and kept crying, letting go of the composure that
had carried him to this point. He had conquered the Open, and now
it was getting him back.
</P>
<P>
   ``My greatest emotion right now?'' Janzen said at his news
conference. ``I would say complete satisfaction that I went out and
played my absolute best and then won in the one championship I love
more than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   His comeback was the third-best in U.S. Open history, but it
wasn't all that shocking. On Friday, he foreshadowed the whole
thing. Almost every other contender complained that day about the
pin placement on 18 for that round. The pitch of the green sent
balls rolling all over the place, wildly and unpredictably.
</P>
<P>
   Only two notable contestants made a case for stoicism on 18 that
day. The first was Jack Nicklaus, who sent a 40-foot birdie putt
curving to the left of the hole. It broke in, sneaking toward the
opening like a burglar and then rested on the lip of the hole,
teasing the gallery before it took an obedient dive into the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Until Janzen put on his charge, that putt was the moment of the
tournament. It let Nicklaus make the cut and hang around for two
more days. And it sent a message, from the 58-year-old legend to
all the whiners, pampered by the usual PGA Tour courses: This hole
can be beaten. If you can't do it, that's your problem.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever a player gripes about the course, Nicklaus said, it
means that he is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart complained. Janzen didn't. He and Nicklaus were the big
holdouts at the pity party. Janzen shot a 66 that day, a par on 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are professional golfers,'' he said. ``We should be tested
to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said: ``(The Open) is a test of wills, to find out who
overcomes adversity the best and who has the most patience.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that seemed immediately prophetic. Janzen swooned a bit
on Saturday. By shooting a 73, he erased the chance of becoming
Stewart's playing partner on the last day, which could have been
reprise of their head-to-head battle at Baltusrol in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen won that Open, and four months later, his only child,
Connor, was born. It was a big year. Today, Janzen's custom-made
golf balls have ``93'' printed on them.
</P>
<P>
   As a previous winner, Janzen broke an Olympic custom for the
Open. He wasn't another Jack Fleck beating Ben Hogan (1955) or
Billy Casper surprising Arnold Palmer (1966) or Scott Simpson
defeating Tom Watson (1987).
</P>
<P>
   But if 1998 didn't follow the pattern of absolute
unpredictability, then that was the point. Once it had become a
pattern, the unpredictable was the expected. It had to go.
</P>
<P>
   In its place were other delights: the beaming face of amateur
Matt Kuchar, Nicklaus' breathtaking putt on 18 to make the cut
Friday, Casey Martin's cart and how it didn't ruin golf as we know
it. And then, finally, Janzen's tears.
</P>
<P>
   His co-winner didn't break down. The Olympic Club's Lake Course
can't cry. It can steal and cheat and crush, fold, spindle and
mutilate. But as an inanimate object, it can't express emotion. If
it could, though, it wouldn't have been bawling on Sunday. It would
have been gloating.

PROPER PRUNING REJUVENATES PLANTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We purchased an older home, and there are two plants in the
front yard I would like to save. I believe they are called Japanese
jasmine. They produce small yellow blooms in spring and have a
fountain shape. One is pretty spindly, but it had the most blooms.
The other is quite large, but the growth is all on top, and the
center is full of bare wood. I would like to rejuvenate these, but
I am not sure how to go about it. _ R.P., Crosby, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A. You may have primrose jasmine, Jasminum mesnyi. This
evergreen shrub has arching branches and can reach 12 feet in
height and width. The yellow blooms appear around February. The
similar Florida jasmine, Jasminum floridum, flowers later and
longer and usually matures to 4 or 5 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cut a third of the oldest wood to the ground to make way for new
shoots and encourage denser growth. It's best to prune after
flowering. New growth will then mature over summer and fall and
produce blooms next year.
</P>
<P>
   These plants prefer sun or partial sun and some moisture. Soak
the soil around the roots once each week during this hot, dry
period. It's a good idea to fertilize early in the spring, but if
your plants have not been fertilized in some time, an application
now of a balanced fertilizer, watered in well, will replenish
nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a beautiful poodle tree about 5 years old. The cats
are using it for a scratching post. I am afraid they will kill the
plant. Can you recommend anything to discourage the cats? _ O.W.,
Houston
</P>
<P>
   A. One old-time ``remedy'' is to place cotton balls saturated in
lemon oil furniture polish or dampened with ammonia at the base of
the plant you're hoping to protect. Or try mothballs.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise you may have to resort to a physical barrier _ pine
cones or some of the decorative wire edging offered at some garden
centers and through catalogs. The edging comes in varying lengths,
and you simply install it by pushing it into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a healthy hibiscus that produces approximately two
blooms each day, but for every bud that opens, about 15 fall off.
Can you tell me what causes this and what might cure it?
</P>
<P>
   I have two 5-foot oleanders planted nearly a year ago and then
moved in January. The plants have beautiful blooms and put on new
growth, but the leaves have brown spots, turn yellow and fall off.
_ T.J., Richmond, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A. Bud drop is not uncommon. This physiological problem is worse
in some seasons, sometimes when it is hot, and it affects some
varieties more often and more severely than others. Too much water
and fertilizer _ or not enough of either _ can cause bud drop. So
can too much nitrogen. If you are practicing good culture, I'm
guessing the culprit is the heat. You might want to look for a
variety that better holds its blooms in summer.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if your oleanders are in an extended state of
transplant shock. The drought we're experiencing can slow oleander
growth and blooms, but since yours have been growing and flowering,
make sure the soil drains well and that you are not overwatering
them. Too much moisture can encourage fungal leaf spots and cause
yellowing and leaf drop.
</P>
<P>
   Established oleanders need 1 to 2 inches of water a week.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you repeat the recipe for hummingbird feeder syrup? _ A
reader
</P>
<P>
   A. Use one part sugar to four parts water.
</P>
<P>
   Do not substitute honey or artificial sweeteners. The former has
been implicated in fungal diseases; the latter has no nutritional
value.
</P>
<P>
   Boil the water first to inhibit the growth of bacteria and
fungi. Let the solution cool before filling the feeder. You can
store any excess in the refrigerator for up to a week.
</P>
<P>
   There's no need to add red food coloring. Most commercial
feeders have red containers or accents.
</P>
<P>
   Hang the feeder out of the reach of cats and away from
reflective windows.
</P>
<P>
   Clean and rinse the feeder thoroughly at least twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   Once you start, do not stop feeding as long as birds are
present.

<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. _ Perhaps nowhere else in the
United States outside Alaska can nature be seen at work so readily,
so completely and so authentically as in Yellowstone when the
world-famous landscape has just fully awakened from winter and is
at its vibrant best.
</P>
<P>
   On a brisk evening in late spring, with clouds enfolding
mountains still capped with snow and a setting sun gilding newly
green hillsides and meadows, a remarkable drama between predator
and prey plays out right by the roadside: A pronghorn antelope,
defending her newborn from a coyote, rushes at him fearlessly and
repeatedly. Soon she has chased him many yards away, and he gives
up.
</P>
<P>
   A bit farther along the road, again within easy sight of it, a
black bear steadily and persistently scoops ants from under a
fallen log, a casualty of one of Yellowstone's occasional fires,
and stuffs them in her mouth while her cub patiently squats on its
haunches nearby. Still farther down the road, a magnificent bull
elk, his antlers in velvet, serenely crops tender new four-inch
grass shoots, severing them with a soft ripping sound.
</P>
<P>
   It is a remarkable concentration of activity in a span of 20
minutes or so, but it is a mere hint of the bafflingly complex web
of energy transfers _ from sun to grass, grass to plant-eater,
plant-eater to predator, fire-felled tree to insect and microbe _
that define what many experts say is the most complete large
ecosystem (since wolves were re-introduced in 1995) in the
contiguous 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   But how natural is it, really? And what does it mean to be
natural, in this day and age? These questions lie at the heart of a
contentious debate over how to manage Yellowstone, and, more
broadly, over how people should relate to nature.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has crystallized around a policy known here as
natural regulation. This is the 30th anniversary of its inception,
and natural regulation has grown to encompass a broader reach than
in 1968, when it was applied more narrowly to management of the
park's famous elk population.
</P>
<P>
   Natural regulation means different things to different people.
As applied to the elk herds, it means letting the size of the herds
fluctuate naturally according to changes in climate, food supply
and pressure from predators rather than trying to manage the herds'
size by culling elk or propagating them artificially.
</P>
<P>
   To some critics of the park's management, natural regulation
means a laissez-faire, hands-off policy of letting nature take its
course, and they say it is causing much ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
   To the present Yellowstone management, natural regulation means
letting nature take its course most of the time, but intervening as
necessary to correct problems resulting from human encroachment.
``If nature is making all the right decisions, then you let nature
make the decisions,'' said John Varley, the park's chief scientist.
But ``if there is something dysfunctional caused by humankind, then
we need to go in and fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter is a succinct statement of the prevailing philosophy
among conservation biologists today: Because pervasive human
activity is unavoidably altering nature, people have a
responsibility to intervene when something they do causes things to
go wrong.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   INTRUSIONS ON AN ISLAND: DESPITE INTERFERENCE, SPECIES SURVIVE
</P>
<P>
   This is no less true in Yellowstone, many experts believe, even
though the park may be, as Varley says, ``as close to authentic
nature as we have in the lower 48.'' Not even magnificent
Yellowstone has escaped major effects of human impact. For this
reason, and because Yellowstone park is big (2.2 million acres) and
is under public management, advocates of natural regulation as
defined by the park managers argue that this is one of the best
places in the country to test it.
</P>
<P>
   Civilization's inroads on Yellowstone come in many varieties.
First, the park's boundaries have never enclosed the entire
ecosystem. In creating the park as the world's first national park
in 1872, Congress used the supposed boundaries of its famous
geothermal features as a guide. But the migration ranges of the
park's big animals, especially its elk, bison, wolves and bears,
extend far beyond the park. When the animals leave, they are at the
mercy of people who hunt them (in the case of elk and bison) and,
increasingly today, eliminate their habitat by development. Many of
Yellowstone's birds, like the white pelican, peregrine falcon and
numerous songbirds, migrate to the tropics and subtropics, where
they are vulnerable to a range of environmental dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the park is an ecological island subject to insults from
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Many non-native species have invaded the park and continue to do
so because of accidental and purposeful introduction by people.
</P>
<P>
   Exotic plants _ even dandelions _ crowd out those native to the
park. A few years ago, an Asian disease reduced populations of
bighorn sheep in the park and throughout the West. A prolific New
Zealand snail has lately invaded the Madison and the Firehole, two
of the park's famous trout streams, threatening to overwhelm native
organisms. Whirling disease, a scourge fatal to trout by the
thousands, has infiltrated the Yellowstone region but has not been
detected in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Park managers themselves have interfered drastically with the
ecosystem in the past. First they raised elk artificially to build
up the herds after hunters in the park had severely reduced them.
Then, judging that there were too many elk, they began killing them
deliberately until a public outcry in the 1960s ended that policy
and ushered in the present era of natural regulation. The managers
also once allowed people to feed bears. By the 1920s, in an
extermination campaign, park rangers had eliminated the ecosystem's
top predator, the wolf.
</P>
<P>
   After years of work to correct these intrusions, Varley
maintains, all the major species known to live in Yellowstone when
Columbus landed in the New World live there again; it is, he says,
``the only scrap of land in the lower 48 that can make that
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   A LIGHT HAND ON THE TILLER: DETERMINING WHAT KIND OF
INTERVENTION &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big argument over Yellowstone involves what kind of
intervention, and how much, is necessary. The less the better, says
Michael Finley, the park superintendent, ``It's not hands-off; it's
hands lightly on the tiller.'' The reason for restraint, he says,
is that too little is known about the ecosystem's functioning to be
confident of the ultimate impact of any action. Finley paraphrases
the conservationist John Muir, ``When you go to pull one thing out
of the universe, you find it's attached to everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, it is clear how light or heavy a touch might be
required. For instance, fires are essential to the ecosystem's
regeneration and to the creation of different habitats for
different species, and so the park managers let them burn _ unless
they threaten people and structures.
</P>
<P>
   Long ago the managers prohibited feeding the bears and closed
garbage dumps where bears foraged. Using gill nets, the managers
are clearing Yellowstone Lake of lake trout, non-natives that were
presumably introduced by fishermen, and which now threaten to
out-compete the lake's native cutthroat trout. On another front,
the managers routinely dispatch workers in what look like
spacesuits to spray non-native plants with herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   They have also adopted regulations protecting grizzly bears, a
threatened species. They have acquiesced in allowing elk to be
hunted when they leave the park in winter. This reduces the herd
and has an inevitable impact on the ecosystem. And they have
reintroduced wolves. Several packs with a total of 75 to 80 adults
and an indeterminate number of pups, possibly more than 100 wolves
in all, now roam the park.
</P>
<P>
   How bison should be treated when their winter migration takes
them outside the park remains unsettled and controversial.
Ranchers, fearing that the bison will infect their cattle with a
disease called brucellosis, insist that they be killed or returned
to the park, and until now that has been the policy.

<P>
   THE ELK WARS: NATURAL REGULATION PUT TO THE TEST
</P>
<P>
   The most contentious point, however, involves the elk herd on
the park's northern range, a lovely stretch of partly open, partly
tree-covered hills and swales encompassing the Lamar and
Yellowstone river valleys. Although the northern range comprises no
more than about 10 percent of the park, its elk herd is the largest
in the world. In winter, the herd contains 10,000 to 20,000 elk. At
the end of last winter it was at a low ebb, with about 11,000 elk.
</P>
<P>
   Park managers operate on the premise that the size of the herd
fluctuates naturally, within broad limits, in response to predators
and to climate (hard winters kill many elk, as happened in 1996-97,
and drought deprives them of forage). When times are hard, the
managers say, many more elk die, and the survivors produce fewer
offspring _ the population regulates itself. So elk in the park are
simply left alone. Outside the park, about 2,000 members of the
northern herd are killed by hunters each year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics like Dr. Charles Kay, a wildlife ecologist at Utah State
University, charge that this policy has failed. Too many elk
inhabit the northern range, and they have overgrazed the land, the
critics say. Citing scientific studies, they argue that the elk
have also browsed aspen and willows to the verge of disappearance,
that the loss of these species has deprived beaver of their
principal food supply, and that a loss of willows along streams has
allowed shores to erode, degrading the streams. As a result, Kay
says, the northern range has become an ``ecological slum.''
</P>
<P>
   Kay argues that before Europeans came to Yellowstone, there were
few elk in what is now the park. The reason, he says, is that
predators contained the population. The chief or ``keystone''
predators, he says, were not wolves but American Indians, and he
advocates allowing them to hunt in the park today to control the
elk population. ``Let a band of Crow camp in there all summer and
shoot all they want,'' he says, adding that Indians kept the
ecosystem functioning for 12,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials, citing other scientific studies that they say
represent the majority opinion among scientists, say the impact of
American Indian hunting on the herds is simply unknown and that elk
always grazed the northern range (though the numbers cannot be
gauged). The weight of scientific evidence, they argue, shows that
the range is not overgrazed. One problem is the definition of
overgrazing. Park managers say that the critics expect a natural
ecosystem to look the same as one managed to produce maximum grass
for cattle. This standard, the park officials argue, is
inappropriate for a wild landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Some light might be shed on the natural regulation of elk once
the newly introduced wolves have been at work for some time.
Computer modeling has suggested that wolves might reduce the elk
population by as much as 30 percent. The wolves have specialized in
preying on elk even more than had been assumed, said Dr. Mark S.
Boyce, an ecologist formerly at the University of Wyoming and now
at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point, who has long
studied Yellowstone. But he said it was still too soon to gauge the
wolves' impact.
</P>
<P>
   The long-standing argument over what science says and does not
say about Yellowstone will be addressed in a congressionally
required study by the National Academy of Sciences, Varley said.
``We applaud that.''
</P>
<P>
   NATURE GOES ON: ANSWERS MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE OR RELEVANT
</P>
<P>
   But it is problematical whether the study will provide
definitive answers, and especially whether it will provide a clear
enough idea of what the pre-Columbian ecosystem was like. That may
be irrelevant anyway, not only because it is impossible to go back
but because nature, if mainstream ecologists are right, is never in
balance but rather is in a constant state of upheaval and change.
How Yellowstone would have evolved in the absence of European
colonization, according to this view, is not clear. In any case,
what has happened in the past cannot be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, another perspective is emerging. It holds that
``even though this might not be the original nature, it is a hell
of a robust nature,'' and that while ``a lot of things have
happened, here we are today, and let's get on with it,'' says Paul
Schullery, a writer who works part-time for the park and wrote
``Searching for Yellowstone,'' a book about the park's history and
ecology (Houghton Mifflin, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Crabtree, an independent ecologist in the Yellowstone
area, contends that ``the park is too small to manage naturally.''
Varley agrees that people will always have to intervene in the
ecosystem ``to one degree or another.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the ecosystem, natural or not, churns along. Early on
a spring morning, the signs abound. Ducks dabble in ponds. Coyotes
freeze, listen, pounce on ground squirrels. The air is filled with
birdsong. Beetles go about their work underfoot. Three wolves, one
gray and two black, come down from the hills, lope across the road
only a few yards away and wade across the Lamar River, patrolling
their turf. A young grizzly, brown with gray trim, soon follows.
The hillsides are alive with elk, even though their fluctuating
population is in a trough. Bison numbers were also reduced by the
harsh 1996-97 winter. But they are there, grazing the lower levels.
</P>
<P>
   In some spots there is utter silence, broken only by the birds
and the rush of rivers and creeks, and in the crystalline air, with
rocky cliffs and forests shimmering in the distance, it is easy to
imagine that this must have been the way things were a thousand
years ago, even if in every detail they were not.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come here and they look at Yellowstone, and they go,
`My god, this is paradise,''' Crabtree said. ``But for those of us
here, we can do better as a world ecosystem. We've got problems,
but I believe they're solvable.''

SCIENTISTS ARE DISPUTING THE FATE OF THE GRIZZLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mont.)   (The Science Times)  
(mk) 
 By JIM ROBBINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. _ A new report by two respected
wildlife biologists warns that the number of grizzly bears in and
around Yellowstone National Park may be much lower than previous
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, one of the report's authors, David Mattson, a wildlife
biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey Biological Resources
Division, warns that the outlook for critical elements of grizzly
bear habitat, including whitebark pine nuts, is poor. ``The odds
are not good that we will see a stable to increasing population of
bears over the next 100 years,'' Mattson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which will be published this year in the journal
Ecology, is controversial, because it runs contrary to the widely
accepted belief that grizzly bear numbers in the park have
increased since the bear was listed as threatened under the
Endangered Species Act in 1975. And it comes at a time when the
Fish and Wildlife Service says the population is healthy enough to
begin the process of removing the bear from the list of threatened
species.
</P>
<P>
   Mattson began collecting data for the report in 1979. He and his
co-author, Craig Pease, a zoologist at the University of Texas,
have spent the last five years analyzing data. Using a counting
method that differs from past studies, they concluded there has
been little gain in total bear numbers in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had as much of an increase in the population as
many people would like to think,'' Mattson said. He said that in
1975 ``the best guess is there were something in excess of 300
bears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' he continued, ``we still have something in
excess of 300, perhaps as many as 400.'' Further, he said, any
increases in the population are the result of fluctuations in food
supply and not management of the population, placing the future
further in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Mattson said his method does not rely on random sampling, as
past models have.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Servheen, the Grizzly Bear Recovery coordinator for
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Missoula, Mont., said the
numbers are ``totally wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are between 400 and 500 bears in the system,'' he said,
``and we're seeing them in places we've never seen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going well now and we should take advantage of
that'' by removing the grizzly from the threatened list, he added.
``If all goes well, we'll propose a status change next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmentalists fear removing the bear from the list
would offer it less protection, allowing, for example, more logging
and oil and gas development on federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Servheen, who predicts the bear could be removed from the list
by the year 2000, expects to release a draft of a document this
fall that will spell out how the grizzly will be managed by
Montana, Wyoming and Idaho once the bear is off the list.
</P>
<P>
   A battle is expected because the bear is one of the most
charismatic animals in the American West, and it arouses fierce
emotions on both sides of the issue. ``De-listing is premature,''
said Louisa Wilcox, a coordinator of the Sierra Club Grizzly Bear
Ecosystem Project. ``It's going to be a classic Yellowstone
knock-down, drag-out fight.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the debate are the numbers. Grizzly bears are
secretive and unpredictable, making a truly random sample extremely
difficult. Complicating the issue further is the fact that the
greater Yellowstone ecosystem is an ecological ``island'' with no
link to other grizzly bear populations. And there are many opinions
on how many bears are necessary to assure long-term survival.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is not the present population level alone that concern
Mattson. The outlook for critical elements of the bear's habitat is
poor on almost every count, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitebark pines are the cause of most concern. Not only are the
nuts from these trees a critical fall food for the bears, but they
draw the bears to higher elevations and keep them in these remote
places, away from people. Conflicts between bears and people are
the leading cause of bear mortality in the Yellowstone ecosystem,
and there is a direct correlation between bad pine nut crops and
mortality rates, Mattson said.
</P>
<P>
   A disease called blister rust, which kills whitebark pines, has
made its way into areas north and west of Yellowstone, destroying
most of the trees. At the same time, some studies indicate that
global warming is causing the range of the pines to shrink.
Moreover, Yellowstone lost roughly 27 percent of its whitebark
pines in the 1988 fires, and the trees will take about 100 years to
replace.
</P>
<P>
   Global warming may also affect another prime food source, the
army cutworm moth. These moths feed on the nectar of high altitude
flowers at night. During the day, grizzlies find them under the
rocks in talus slopes. Biologists have seen as many as 50 bears
eating moths at one time. Alpine areas are sensitive to global
warming, and there is concern the moth's food source could
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of hundreds of bison outside the park by Montana
livestock officials could also have an impact on bears. The state
fears that the bison harbor a disease that could be passed on to
cattle, and hauls the carcasses away, effectively removing a
critical source of protein.
</P>
<P>
   Damage to the fishery in Yellowstone Lake could also affect the
bear. Lake trout were discovered in the lake in 1994, probably
illegally introduced by fishermen. The huge fish prey on the
cutthroat population which spawns in the lake's tributaries where
as many as 30 or 40 bears may feed on them. Lake trout spawn in
deep water in the lake, and therefore don't provide food for the
bears.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat loss may be the single biggest threat to the grizzly.
The Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks make up only half of the 6
million-acre grizzly bear ecosystem. In the mix of other land
ownership there are large tracts of private property. Some counties
around the park are among the fastest growing in the country. Farms
and homes can attract bears with garbage and dog food, and when a
bear becomes habituated, or loses its fear of humans, it often
needs to be moved out of the ecosystem or ends up being shot. Elk
hunters who find a grizzly, and shoot it in self-defense, also
account for a large share of grizzly deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Servheen believes that Mattson and environmental groups opposed
to removing the bears from the list are exaggerating possible
threats to food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's saying there might be declines, and there might be,''
said Servheen. ``We'll monitor all these foods and have a response
protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the bear is taken off the list, Servheen said, the three
states around the park, the Park Service and the Forest Service
must agree to a plan to protect the bear. If numbers drop or a food
source seems imperiled, the bear can be placed back on the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a misperception that de-listing means there's n open
season, with timber cutting and oil drilling in the forests around
the park,'' Servheen said. ``That's far from the case.''

<P>
   In the near future, buying a Bible as a wedding or confirmation
gift or for one's own personal study may involve more than choosing
which version or edition is the best translation of the original
Hebrew and Greek.
</P>
<P>
   If some scholars in the field of biblical criticism have their
way, the best-selling book of all time may undergo some radical
changes and additions.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionists are also toying with the idea of adding the Temple
Scroll, one of the Dead Sea Scrolls, to the Old Testament.
</P>
<P>
   German scholar Hartmut Stegemann, along with others, regards the
Temple Scroll as a sixth book of Moses. However, this proposed
addition to the Pentateuch -- the five books of Moses -- does not
contain, as Stegemann admits, subjects basic to the Judaism of the
period.
</P>
<P>
   Hershel Shanks, in ``Understanding the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' tells
us that the Temple Scroll ``contains many other laws as well as
descriptions of religious festivals not mentioned in the Bible or
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanks also tells us, ``The scroll contains detailed plans for
the building of the Lord's temple; hence its name, the Temple
Scroll.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can this scroll speak of elaborate plans for the
construction of the Temple, when in the time of the scrolls'
writing -- supposedly from 300 BC to 50 AD -- the temple was still
standing?
</P>
<P>
   Such anomalies raise serious questions about the dating and
purported Jewish authorship of the Temple Scroll. Yet those who
endorse the authenticity of the Temple Scroll and apocryphal texts
found among the Dead Sea Scrolls could bring unprecedented changes
to the canon of Scripture, 66 books of the Bible, traditionally
held to have been divinely inspired.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1996 book ``Secrets of the Dead Sea Scrolls,'' Randall
Price writes, ``The Scrolls ... imply that the list of books which
were accepted as part of the Bible at Qumran apparently differed
from ... the official canon of the Hebrew Bible ... It is also
possible ... that such works as the Temple Scroll were...
canonical.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient Jewish and Christian position, however, is that the
Old Testament canon was completed by 400 BC, long before the
existence of the Dead Sea Scrolls.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. News &AMP; World Report, ``...about 70 liberal
scholars who since 1985 have been examining the historicity of the
Gospels will likely recommend that at least some of the 27 books
(of the New Testament) be jettisoned and that other ancient texts
be added... Behind the move... is the modern discovery of
...documents, such as the Dead Sea Scrolls....''
</P>
<P>
   Since that 1993 article, the pseudo-gospel of Thomas has been
added to the four Gospels in some new Biblical translations. This
fifth gospel corrupts the New Testament canon established by the
early church.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   At stake in all of this is the credibility of the Bible. There
is today a concerted effort to alter the Holy Scriptures. Yet it is
the consistency with which the Bible has been handed down to each
generation that has established its validity.
</P>
<P>
   Judaism has always regarded the Torah as inviolable.
Torah-making was not just a scribal art but a sacred profession.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``scribe'' in Hebrew means counter, for he had to count
how many words and letters there were to the center point of the
five books of Moses, and from there to the end, to ensure no
errors. He had to follow precise rituals, such as declaring that he
was writing the Torah ``in the name of its sanctity.''
</P>
<P>
   If the scribe made an error in writing the name of God, he had
to put that parchment away and start anew. And no word could be
written from memory. There were many other checks that were used in
copying the Old Testament books to insure preservation of the
sacred words of God.
</P>
<P>
   First-century Jewish historian Josephus wrote: ``We have given
practical proof of our reverence for our scriptures. For, although
such long ages have now passed, no one has ventured to add, or to
remove, or to alter a syllable; and it is an instinct with every
Jew, from the day of his birth, to regard them as decrees of God,
to abide by them, and if need be, cheerfully to die for them.''
</P>
<P>
   One can go anywhere in the world today and find the exact same
Biblical texts among all Jewish communities.
</P>
<P>
   The writers of the New Testament also were Jews. Paul, in Romans
3:1-2, wrote the following: ``What advantage then hath the Jew?...
Much every way: chiefly, because that unto them were committed the
oracles of God.''
</P>
<P>
   To understand the great effort throughout history to preserve
the original texts of the Old and New Testaments, we have only to
read what gentile translators of the King James version of the
Bible wrote to the English monarch in 1611.
</P>
<P>
   They note it was the great labor ``out of the Original Sacred
Tongues... [that] there should be one more exact Translation of the
Holy Scriptures into the English Tongue... ``
</P>
<P>
   The King James version is considered by scholars to be the most
accurate and theologically correct translation of the New Testament
written in the English language.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts now to change not only the canon of the traditional
Bible, but existing passages in the Bible as well, are already
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Revised Standard Version adds a significant passage to
1 Samuel 10:27 from the text of the Qumran Samuel scroll,''
according to Dr. David Scholer, division chairman of Biblical
studies at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a paragraph from the book of Judges, Chapter
6, may be deleted because of the Qumran text.
</P>
<P>
   And in the New Testament, Luke's recording of the annunciation
-- the words spoken by the angel to the shepherds regarding the
birth of the Messiah -- is now being changed in texts coming from
the Jesus Seminar Group.

</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve of 1996 and Easter 1997, two of the most sacred
days on the Christian calendar, ``The News Hour with Jim Lehrer''
on PBS presented, in a positive light, the Jesus Seminar's
debunking of the New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   During Easter week this year, PBS (America's Public Broadcasting
System) presented revisionists scoffing at the New Testament in a
four-day Frontline series, ``From Jesus to Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   ``By presenting only modern critical scholars whose reductionist
ways are as spiritually arid as the hills of Judea, the producers
have given traditional believers a rather discombobulating picture
(of the New Testament),'' said Jim Remsen, the Philadelphia
Inquirer's religion editor.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard professor Allan D. Callahan, one of Frontline's
on-camera sources, said the series gave the false impression that
there is a scholarly consensus on the slant the program took on the
New Testament.
</P>
<P>
   Remsen said the absence of evangelical Christians and their line
of scholarship was glaring.
</P>
<P>
   In the chaos of scholarly errors, such as the assertion that
Jesus was born in Galilee, not Bethlehem, the positive aspect of
the series is that it presented a Jewish Jesus who ``was born,
lived, died, taught as a Jew.''
</P>
<P>
   And His teachings were represented as a Jewish movement with a
universal message of salvation through ``a Jewish Messiah come to
save all mankind -- Jew and Gentile alike....''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Paul Engle, editor of religious books at Baker Book House,
distributor of the Cambridge Bible, states, ``If you don't accept
the Bible as the inspired, inerrant Word of God, it can easily
color how you look at the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning the canon, Engle asks, ``Do you throw out all that
ancient rabbis, the church fathers, the Reformers (Calvin, Luther,
Zwingli, etc.) have established?
</P>
<P>
   ``The book of Revelation warns against such a thing and
establishes the principle of not adding to or subtracting from the
Word of God. Therefore, the canon is not something one adds to or
subtracts from in each generation.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring in Philadelphia, The Jewish Exponent's Inside
Magazine carried an article entitled ``Debunking 'Ancient Israel'''
that was originally published in the Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the biblical revisionists, writer Christopher Shea
stated that ``... for the past half-century, scholars have steadily
chipped away at the Old Testament's credibility as a historical
document.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea's article exposes the fact that the revisionists would
undermine the very basis of Judaism, the nation of Israel and
Christianity by denying that David and Solomon ever lived.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, the scholars add two of ancient Israel's most
important kings to a roster of biblical figures they say never
lived that includes Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, the fathers of Jewry,
nation of Israel, and those of the Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figure of King David is about as historical as King
Arthur,'' says Phillip R. Davies, a professor of religious studies
at Britain's University of Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Davies and his allies in the revisionist camp seem to be winning
the war.
</P>
<P>
   And, as Shea writes, ``The fight has ramifications far beyond
the ranks of biblical scholars. David sits atop the genealogy of
Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew, so he is vital to Christian
theology.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's very existence is based upon the covenant that God made
with the three patriarchs and the promises to kings David and
Solomon, and without them there is no historical justification for
the state of Israel, Jewry or Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   William G. Devor, professor at the University of Arizona,
considered by some to be the dean of American archaeologists
working in the Middle East, is quoted in Shea's article as saying,
``I think it's important to unmask (the revisionists).
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not biblical scholars. They are certainly not
archaeologists .... They are ideological: They are social engineers
manipulating the biblical texts for their own goals.''

   Whether the United States can ever come to terms with China and
forge the ``strategic partnership'' the Clinton administration
envisions rests on one crucial issue: China's record on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since its 1994 decision to ``delink'' human rights from China's
``most favored nation'' trading status, the Clinton administration
has been struggling to find a credible way to address human rights.
It has yet to come up with an effective strategy that is clearly
based on principle and consistently carried out. Only such an
approach has a chance of being taken seriously _ in Beijing or on
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the White House has pressed for token gestures by China
that give the appearance of making progress, while overall
human-rights conditions remain essentially unchanged:
</P>
<P>
   _ There has been some loosening of restrictions of free speech
and assembly, but overt challenges to Communist Party rule are
routinely suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worker unrest is growing and the government has squelched any
attempts to organize independent trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Repression of ethnic minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang remains
intense. Though officially sanctioned religious groups are
thriving, state controls on unofficial religious activity remain in
place.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-crime campaign, called ``Strike Hard,'' has resulted in
hundreds of thousands of arbitrary arrests and thousands of
executions. Torture and ill-treatment in prisons and labor camps is
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legal reforms have instituted greater protections of
defendants' rights, at least on paper, and the elimination of some
political crimes. But with the party and the state firmly in
control of the judicial system, China is a long way from meeting
international legal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this dismal record, in March the Clinton administration
dropped sponsorship of a critical resolution on China at the annual
meeting of the U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva. Every
year since 1990, the United States and other governments had pushed
a China motion in Geneva, triggering a worldwide lobbying effort by
Beijing, anxious to avoid U.N. censure and a loss of face.
</P>
<P>
   But when China agreed to release Wang Dan and other dissidents,
and promised to sign a key U.N. human-rights treaty, the
administration backed off. Not only was Beijing let off the hook,
but the prospects of using the U.N. forum as an incentive to get
China to make more far-reaching human-rights reforms are now
virtually nil.
</P>
<P>
   The president says that summitry and high-level meetings offer a
more ``practical'' and productive route to encourage change than
criticism, and the outcome of the summit may reinforce his argument
that ``constructive engagement'' works. But if the visit is long on
photo opportunities but short on results, it will raise questions
about a policy toward a China that shrugs off virtually all forms
of pressure.
</P>
<P>
   What can the president realistically achieve at the summit? It's
important that Clinton speak out publicly about human rights while
he is in China. He should reconsider participating in an official
welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square, and he should meet with
family members of the victims of the 1989 massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other things Clinton can do to address human rights on
his visit:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek agreement to release or review the sentences of some
2,000 persons imprisoned on vague charges of
``counter-revolutionary activities.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Convince the Chinese government to grant unrestricted access
to Tibet and Xinjiang by foreign journalists and human-rights
monitors.
</P>
<P>
   _ Persuade Chinese officials to review current regulations
requiring all religious bodies to register with the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Press Beijing to protect the rights of Chinese workers,
including those seeking to exercise their rights under the
International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
(which China signed last October).
</P>
<P>
   _ Promote the lifting of restrictions on Chinese citizens living
abroad who have been blacklisted and forbidden to return to China
because of their pro-democracy activities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Seek a commitment to end the system of re-education through
labor.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. relations with China have reached a critical point, but
where they go from here will depend, at least in part, on how
successful the White House can be in translating its rhetoric about
human rights into meaningful policy and action.

IN `X-FILES' THE MOVIE, NO GREAT ANSWERS TO GNAWING QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Movies _ particularly summer blockbusters _ come and go. But
good television shows hang around for years.
</P>
<P>
   What has gone unreported in the hype for ``The X-Files'' feature
film is that a great television show is now forever altered.
</P>
<P>
   Can fans of the television show live with the fact that basic
tenets will change when ``The X-Files'' returns in the fall? If so,
by all means cough up the eight dollars, because there's no way you
can start watching the new season without having seen the movie.
Call it the pay-off for years of patience seeking the truth that's
out there _ or call it a devious marketing ploy.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of ``The X-Files'' movie is to show where an
investigation into a massive bombing at a Dallas office building
truly leads. Hint: Out there.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's weird web will split the audience into two
distinct categories _ fans of the show and people with little or no
knowledge of the characters and what they've been up to for five
years. Although Chris Carter, who created the series and the film,
says that non-fans will have no problem finding an entree, it's
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   What about the show's metaphorically rich Cigarette Smoking Man,
who appears unexplained in the movie, lingering around all the
chaos, puffing longingly and saying almost nothing? If you've never
seen the show, you'll think you're watching a pretentious French
art film.
</P>
<P>
   And the other ambiguous characters _ like The Lone Gunmen, The
Syndicate, etc. _ will stand out as odd narrative additions to the
uninitiated. If you're a non-fan, then, here's a movie with a
wonderfully confusing plot, a little bit of action and two
mismatched, stone-faced stars (David Duchovny as Mulder, Gillian
Anderson as Scully) whose emotional relationship seems
unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   If you walk in cold to ``The X-Files,'' you'll see a classic
example of an anti-blockbuster. Most ``Godzilla'' types have zero
plot, lame dialogue and special effects that scare God. In this
movie, the special effects are nice but not eye-popping and the
plot is a Byzantine conspiracy that leaves your imagination with
painful stretch marks.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't ``Independence Day.''
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, ``The X-Files'' movie is geared to fans of the
show. It has a built-in audience of more than 20 million who should
give it a healthy box-office boost. But the danger in a television
show leaping onto the big screen is that viewers now have
heightened expectations. In this case, they'll expect answers to
questions that have been raised and allowed to fester for five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, in the film, Carter delivers the goods to diehard
fans. The ``mythology'' episodes, as Carter and fans call them _
with all the obligatory red-herrings and blarney _ for the most
part bear fruit in the movie. But many of the most pertinent
questions _ what happened to Mulder's abducted sister, is the
Cigarette Smoking Man really Mulder's dad, are Mulder and Scully
actually in love with each other _ are given Carter's patented
sleight-of-hand treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' movie does answer one question raised in the
show for an hour a week, five years running: Is the government
conspiring to keep the truth about extraterrestrials from the
public? You bet. That's certainly been the implication from the
start, and since paranoia fuels the show, it's no great leap on the
big screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the ramifications are immense. Because ``The X-Files'' as a
television show succeeded mainly because of the juxtaposition of
Mulder's little-green-men beliefs and Scully's stick-to-science
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Now she knows.
</P>
<P>
   But the ambiguity of Mulder's visions and encounters week to
week was the great sustaining factor of the television show. Did he
really see what he thinks he saw? Was that a monster, an alien, a
freak of nature _ or just his imagination and a trick of light?
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Mulder and Scully have seen the future and it's a
giant leap for each of them to comprehend. Now, when ``The
X-Files'' returns _ probably in November after Fox airs the World
Series _ their relationship will have completely changed.
</P>
<P>
   Scully, the scientist, can't use a microscope and an autopsy to
prop up her stoicism. Also, Mulder may have to face his true
feelings about Scully. And the two have learned enough about the
darker forces _ particularly The Syndicate and alien colonization _
that they can't simply go back to the everyday minutia without
losing credibility with viewers. Perhaps a little truth is a good
thing and whatever direction it leads the characters in will be
fresh and appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But how does it stack up as a movie? ``X-Files'' fans will love
it but are unlikely to do cartwheels in the lobby, and non-fans may
be left wondering what the fuss was all about.

NOT SO FAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans were shamelessly and
irresponsibly grandstanding last week when they voted to eliminate
the federal income tax system in one fell swoop, without so much as
suggesting how to replace it.
</P>
<P>
   Do they really believe the government can function, armies can
be fed, highways can be paved, borders can be patrolled and their
own salaries provided if nobody pays any federal taxes?
</P>
<P>
   Of course not. The country does not run on fumes. It runs on
money, which must be raised somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Do they really believe voters will take such political fakery
seriously? Only if their heads are in the sand.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans once thought voters would cheer if the
government shut down, but when they actually tried that, it turned
out people missed their familiar public services and wanted those
``horrible'' bureaucrats back. Now the same legislative loonies
think voters so loathe the Internal Revenue Service that they want
it abolished altogether, regardless of the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are out on this limb virtually alone. Passage
was largely along party lines, with only 15 Democrats supporting
it. The GOP intends to take the campaign credit for it and, by
golly, it ought to be made to take the blame for such silliness,
too.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans made only a minor gesture toward sanity,
directing Congress to come up with an alternative system before
their edict to wipe out the 350 million words of the present tax
code goes into effect on New Year's Day 2003. That instruction has
no enforcement provision and includes no specific recommendations
for reaching its goal.
</P>
<P>
   Our thoughtful GOP legislators offered not a clue as to how the
tax code is to be boiled down to practically nothing. These are the
same people, remember, who have been ignoring the dream of
simplifying things for years by merrily offering up new tax breaks
that further complicate the code, from ending the so-called
marriage penalty to offering vouchers for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   It is politically easy to denounce federal taxes, particularly
after the tales of IRS abuse brought out by congressional hearings
last fall and this spring. But it is almost impossible to reach a
consensus on the way to simplify, reduce or rearrange those taxes
in ways that are fair and realistic and that still raise enough
revenue to run the government.
</P>
<P>
   If it were easy, Congress would have done it by now. Even
Democrats can figure out the political charm of bashing the IRS. No
politician wants to be condemned as defending the dreaded tax
collector.
</P>
<P>
   But the tax code has become complicated in part because members
of Congress themselves have insisted on inserting an ever-expanding
array of loopholes for favored causes. A lot of those causes are
socially worthwhile and beloved by the middle class, such as the
deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable donations.
Other tax breaks reflect the eternal political payback system,
doing favors for constituents and rewarding industries and special
interests that are big campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The hidden agenda of conservative House Republicans may be to
force Congress to act under deadline to shift to a flat-tax system,
under which rich and poor alike would pay at the same rate and all
special deductions would die. Many experts point out that this
would mostly benefit the wealthy, disproportionately cutting their
overall taxes compared with those of folks with lesser incomes.
</P>
<P>
   The flat-tax idea is popular with conservatives, who would just
as soon cut off resources in order to starve federal services and
shrink the size of government anyway. But it is a radical, risky
departure from our traditional graduated-tax system and a flyer
into the unknown that could destabilize the economy and ruin the
present national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   If the flat-tax base is set too low, the federal treasury will
dry up. If it is set too high, the middle class will find itself
with increased taxes and no deductions as an offset.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Congress is likely to agree on a way to simplify
the tax code within the five-year deadline is a pipe dream. In the
meantime, as President Clinton and other opponents point out,
neither individuals nor corporations will have a stable tax
framework on which to base investments and other economic
decisions. Nobody will know what to expect or what to do.
</P>
<P>
   House GOP leaders know perfectly well that the Senate is thus
far cool to the IRS-elimination idea, preferring more temperate and
reasoned reforms. The Senate, as is often the case, is likely to
sit on this particular folly and rescue the House from itself.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the House cynically left a loophole through which
it could delay the close-down of the system if indeed Congress
doesn't come up with an alternative in time. That concession in
itself is an acknowledgement that the lawmakers are aware that this
whole exercise is a phony meant for campaign talk, not the
legislative walk.

 (Attn.: Fla.)  
 BOSTON: ... that consistency.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regardless of when or if he is drafted, Jackson can rest assured
that he is a known talent throughout the NBA. McRae is working on
becoming the same. Enrolling at UTEP (which will leave the Western
Athletic Conference after next season), McRae will get an
opportunity to play twice against heralded point guard Andre Miller
of perennial WAC power Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention matchups against league foe Fresno State and
guard Chris Herren of Fall River, who was a teammate of McRae's on
the BABC squads. ``Going against two of the best guards in college
basketball, that gives me a chance to show the world I can play,''
McRae said, ``and if I can play well maybe that will open a few
scouts' eyes and maybe they will come look at me.''
</P>
<P>
   That could help distance him from allegations in Utah that
almost cost him any chance at fulfilling his dream.
</P>
<P>
   McRae was arrested April 19, 1996, on two charges of forcible
sexual abuse, one charge of burglary (both second-degree felonies)
and one charge of aggravated kidnapping (a first-degree felony).
</P>
<P>
   In the attempted burglary/forcible sexual abuse charge, a
19-year-old student at Dixie accused McRae of entering her room
uninvited, climbing into her bed, and fondling her before being
asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   In the aggravated kidnapping/forcible sexual abuse charge, a
17-year-old high school student accused McRae of pulling her into a
room, detaining her, and fondling her before she demanded to be let
out of the room.
</P>
<P>
   McRae was held on $75,000 bail; bail was placed so high because
he once failed to appear in a Boston court on a cocaine possession
charge. He spent 13 days in a Utah jail and was able to post bail
after it was reduced to $10,000. McRae said his aunt put her home
up as collateral to bail him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really difficult, being so far from home, not close to
family and friends. That was the toughest thing about it,'' said
McRae. ``All along I knew one day, even if it wasn't the next day,
that the problem would resolve itself. I just prayed to God every
night one day it would work out and it did.''
</P>
<P>
   When the case against McRae went to trial Sept. 26, 1996, it
took several unusual twists. Defense attorney Mitchell Barker
requested to have Deputy Washington County Attorney Marlynn B.
Lema, the prosecutor, disqualified after he discovered he needed to
call her as a witness for the defense. Lema was asked to testify
about an April 19 taped interview she conducted with McRae during
his time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   According to court documents, Lema said she told McRae she would
do everything possible to investigate the incident. The assertion
was not recorded on the interview tapes. Barker also asserted that
witnesses McRae said could clear him were not interviewed by the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Judge James Shumate to declare a mistrial and
disqualify prosecution from the case. The case was set for trial
twice afterward and canceled both times, then turned over to the
Attorney General's office.
</P>
<P>
   It was there that McRae plea-bargained to two counts of gross
lewdness (a first-degree misdemeanor). He was given 18 months
probation and sentenced to time served, and required to undergo
psycho-sexual counseling, to write a letter of apology to the
plaintiffs, and to send monthly letters to the court. Assistant
Utah Attorney General Paul Graf said both sides were satisfied with
the outcome of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McRae still insists the incidents in question never took
place, and added he only pleaded to misdemeanor charges because he
was no longer able to afford legal counsel (transcripts show
Mitchell had withdrawn from representing him for that reason).
</P>
<P>
   McRae asserts the charges were levied after he overheard his
accusers use racial slurs in conversations about athletes at the
school they were secretly having relations with.
</P>
<P>
   He said he informed the players about what was said, the players
confronted the women, and the women concocted the allegations
against McRae to get back at him. ``When they were in court, they
acted as if they never met each other, and they were best
friends,'' McRae said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opened my eyes up as far as the friends I choose to keep my
company in. And it helped me grow up a lot and see the world for
what it is. It taught me that one minute everything can be going
nice and fine and rosy, and the next minute the whole world can be
caving in.''
</P>
<P>
   McRae said he hasn't undergone a court-ordered psychological
evaluation because he is still awaiting paperwork from the courts,
but he said he doesn't think it is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing me stupid for counseling. Counseling for
what?'' he said. ``I don't even need any counseling. If this had
been anywhere else, it wouldn't have even gone to court. People
think I don't want to talk about it. But I'm willing to go on the
radio, or TV, because nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   When told about McRae's assertion that his accusers fabricated
both incidents looking for revenge, Graf said, ``This is new
information to me. The factual basis, as I understood it to be, was
him being in the bedroom and on the bed of one of the girls and
taking the other girl in the apartment and barring the door, not
letting her out. I have not heard the allegation you have made to
me, that this is a racially motivated type of situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had excellent legal counsel, and I think he would have
brought it to me. That was not mentioned.'' Graf said he would
investigate whether legal paperwork has been sent to McRae so he
could comply with the terms of the plea agreement. ``It's his
responsibility, but I will see if there is something I need to do
and take care of it,'' Graf said.
</P>
<P>
   According to McRae, the cocaine charge is behind him. ``That was
a case of being at the wrong place at the wrong time,'' he said,
adding that police broke up a party he was at and when one of those
present dropped some cocaine, everyone was taken in and charged.
</P>
<P>
   Tallahassee College coach Mike Gillespie said there were some
concerns about McRae's troubles at Dixie College and that the
school, which began its basketball program seven years ago,
conducted its own investigation before admitting him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to a lot of people, and everyone said Eggie probably
had not been guilty and a lot of the things that were being said
about him had not been done,'' Gillespie said. ``I think he was
ready to get back into school. He had been treated unfairly at
Dixie. He's a young man who needed an opportunity to prove he's a
good man.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, McRae averaged 13 points and 9 assists a game, and
guided a 25-6 team that was ranked No. 1 among junior colleges for
most of the season before being upset in the state tournament.
``He's still a tremendous penetrator with the ball, he has great
upper body strength, and is a great leader,'' said Gillespie.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, McRae said had it not been for his legal troubles,
he probably would not have taken his college studies as seriously.
He says he now is on track to receive an associate's degree from
Tallahassee College.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say I have any regrets, although I wish that in high
school maybe I could have studied a little harder,'' said McRae.
``Maybe then I would have passed the SAT. But maybe this is a
blessing in disguise. My mom always told me if you take the harder
route good things happen. This is not the path I would have took
earlier, but I'm making the best of it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and McRae spent Memorial Day weekend in sultry South
Florida, visiting friends who had moved there from the Boston area.
They have spent much of the offseason in summer school while
preparing to venture along The Path alone again. Jackson said the
pair's friendship will help them both along the way, no matter how
far they drift apart.
</P>
<P>
   McRae doesn't sound so certain. ``It's going to be hard,'' he
said. ``If I ever needed anything here, I could call on Ran and he
could call on me. I'm backing his decision, and I know we can talk
on the phone, but it's not the same as face to face.''

JACKSON, MCRAE STILL DREAMING OF NBA 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS  
 (Attn.: Fla.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ At this point, there is no getting off The Path. They
dreamed of becoming NBA superstars, and the visions were replayed
over and over, each time becoming more colorful and captivating and
seemingly closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
   They now venture toward the dream the way small boats in choppy
waters sail toward a distant glimmer at shore, braving obstacles,
not knowing if they will ever make it, too determined to see a
positive result to cease trying.
</P>
<P>
   Randell Jackson didn't embark on The Path in earnest until his
talents had developed to the point where Basketball America rated
him the 25th-best player in the country as he entered his senior
year at Boston's Madison Park High School, and scholarship offers
came by the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   As a youngster, he didn't even like basketball, and the only
reason he began playing was that he was a flagpole, who would grow
to 6 feet 11 inches, when most other kids in his Mission Hill
neighborhood were yardsticks, and folks steered him toward the
court. But before that senior year he left Madison Park and
followed The Path to the Winchendon School in western
Massachusetts, in part because it had a core curriculum that would
virtually ensure his reaching NCAA eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on to Florida State, where he often struggled on the
court, and was much maligned by the local media. The criticism
continued this spring following his junior season at Tallahassee,
when he placed his name in the NBA Draft pool but vowed to return
to school if he wasn't projected as one of the first 15 picks.
</P>
<P>
   Winford ``Eggie'' McRae came aboard The Path when he was 6,
shortly after his first Shoot-Straight camp at the Shelburne Center
in Roxbury. The gritty kid from Roxbury was so enamored with the
sport that he proclaimed himself willing to play in the CBA or
overseas if he didn't reach the ultimate goal of the NBA _ as long
as he was playing professionally some day.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of determination comes in handy when you are the
Globe's 1992 Division 3 Player of the Year as a junior point guard,
then your school, Mission High, closes. Or when your career has a
brief hiatus because of academic troubles, then resumes at East
Boston but never reaches those heights.
</P>
<P>
   Or when you follow The Path to Redemption Christian Academy in
upstate New York to work on your grades before heading to Dixie
(Junior) College in St. George, Utah, with hopes of transferring to
Nevada-Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Or when you find yourself behind bars in St. George, facing two
counts of forcible sexual abuse and other charges from two separate
incidents he says never took place. At one point, McRae thought he
had been derailed from The Path for good.
</P>
<P>
   But the case against him was declared a mistrial, and McRae
searched high and low for a reputable, winning program to which to
transfer. Tallahassee College sparked his curiosity, and he called
Jackson, who told him there was an opening on the team since
Tallahassee's point guard was transferring to Florida State. So
McRae transferred to Tallahassee College, and he and Jackson became
roommates who have helped each other along the journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever one of us needs help on our game, we take our bags,
go over to the gym, and shoot,'' said Jackson, who first played
with McRae in a 13-and-under all-star game at the Mission Hill
Recreation Center. The two won several national AAU titles together
while playing for Leo Papile's Boston Amateur Basketball Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living with Eggie has been encouraging because we're from the
same area,'' said Jackson. ``You don't have to worry about somebody
stabbing you in the back. I have friends there, but I have one
friend I know I can depend on. And vice versa.''
</P>
<P>
   Pretty soon, the two will go their separate ways. McRae is
enrolling at the University of Texas-El Paso in August with two
years of playing eligibility remaining. Jackson signed with an
agent following the NBA predraft camp in Chicago, voiding his
option to return to Florida State for his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me while at the predraft camp and told me he was
coming out regardless,'' said McRae. ``I told him that he knows
it's up to him. Nobody can live his life for him, and that I was
behind him no matter what he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, I feel more and more if he makes it maybe I can go
and play with those guys. Randell's a person I grew up playing
with. Someone I know making it gives me incentive to push harder.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There was no real reason to limit his options, but after the
predraft camp, Randell Jackson decided he was finished with college
basketball, and while he said he will obtain his degree someday,
right now he says he wants only one egg in his basket. He signed
with No Limit Sports Management, the athletics arm of a group whose
clients include rap artist Snoop Doggy Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said to myself, `Whatever happens happens.' I've been
hearing that I will go in either the late first round or early
second round,'' said Jackson, who said he had a lot of ups and
downs at Florida State and felt stagnated while playing under
first-year coach Steve Robinson this past season. ``Whatever the
situation will be, I'm hoping for the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson posted his best collegiate campaign last season,
averaging 12.7 points and 5.5 rebounds, shooting 49 percent from
the floor, with 37 blocked shots and 26 steals, in leading the
Seminoles to the second round of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   As a sophomore, Jackson showed some promise before suffering a
hip injury against Georgia Tech Feb. 9. He missed the following
game against Maryland and played sparingly against Duke the next
game. By the season finale against Wake Forest, he had scored just
35 points on 13-for-32 shooting in six games after the injury.
</P>
<P>
   But against the Demon Deacons and their senior center Tim
Duncan, he scored 16 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. He went on to
lead the Seminoles to four National Invitation Tournament wins,
averaging 11 points and 11 boards a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``For his size, he's a most intriguing player,'' said former
Florida State coach Pat Kennedy, who is now at DePaul. ``He's very
good in transition and he became a much better shooter. He has
worked on his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it appears Jackson will likely be chosen in the second
round of Wednesday's NBA draft. ``I think that he is a talent, he's
long and very athletic,'' said Celtics general manager Chris
Wallace. ``The question with Randell is what position does he play?
Who is he in terms of the NBA game?''
</P>
<P>
   There are some Florida State followers who felt Jackson could
have done much to answer those questions had he come back for a
senior season, that he would have been a dominant player in the
Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Local columnists have taken it a step further. Tallahassee
Democrat writer John Nogowski referred to Jackson as a
``now-you-see-me, now-you-don't forward'' and added that Jackson is
no more ready for the NBA ``than Michael Jordan is to quit the NBA
and become president of the Hair Club For Men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how they are at Florida State. When I say the ups and
downs I've had, that's what I mean, the media,'' said Jackson.
``For me I'm always going to be focused and do what I have to do. I
have no trouble keeping my head on straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, the critics down there badmouth you. I don't
get to the point where I blow up and get down on myself, but I know
I have a family to support, and that's my ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing for a better life for his family is one of the reasons
Jackson is on The Path. He said he had planned to forgo his senior
season before enrolling at Florida State. ``It wasn't something
written in stone. I just said that I would try to leave in three
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two seasons weren't as good. I could have gotten more
out of them. My junior year I was more consistent. Now it's about
keeping that consistency.''

COOL BOOKS FOR A HOT SUMMER DAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By FRITZ LANHAM 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's getting hotter outside. Forget mowing the lawn. Forget
softball. Confine your exertions to the imagination: What could be
cooler than a hot book on a summer day?
</P>
<P>
   Whether you go in for thrillers, romances, literary fare,
biographies, current events or good mysteries, you can't walk
through a bookstore without tripping over something of interest.
It's a good summer for books.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainments abound. Among the proven practitioners of
commercial fiction with new releases are Anne Rivers Siddons, who
journeys to the ``Low Country'' (HarperCollins, $24); and Nora
Roberts, who tells ``Genuine Lies'' (Bantam, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   Olivia Goldsmith (``The First Wives Club'') works the
``Switcheroo'' (HarperCollins, $24), in which a look-alike wife and
mistress change places. With ``Caprice and Rondo'' (Knopf, $27.50),
historical novelist Dorothy Dunnett continues her ``House of
Niccolo'' sequence about the life and times of 15th-century
merchant-adventurer Nicholas de Fleury.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, publishers of thrillers and crime novels have loaded
up the shelves with these summer favorites. Tom Clancy fans will
have to wait until early August for his latest novel (Putnam,
$27.95), in which ex-Navy SEAL John Clark of ``Without Remorse''
reprises his role as savior of all things decent and right.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving earlier are Jeffrey Archer's ``Eleventh Commandment''
(HarperCollins, $26), in which CIA operative Connor Fitzgerald
discovers his boss is very bad news.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eagerly awaited mysteries of the season has been
James Lee Burke's just-released ``Sunset Limited'' (Hyperion, $24).
This is the 17th book for the Louisiana novelist, who won the Edgar
for best novel for last year's ``Cimarron Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Sunset Limited,'' Burke brings back Cajun detective Dave
Robicheaux in a tale that involves a 40-year-old murder by
crucifixion and the dead man's photojournalist daughter, who won't
leave the past alone.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the most popular and prolific female mystery writers
have new books. Sue Grafton has made it to the downhill side of the
alphabet with ``N'' Is for Noose`` (Henry Holt, $25). Patricia
Cornwell has chief medical examiner Kay Scarpetta battling a baddie
who uses fire to mask his misdeeds in ``Point of Origin'' (Putnam,
$25.95).
</P>
<P>
   And August will bring Faye Kellerman's ``Moon Music'' (Morrow,
$25.50). Not one of her Peter Decker/Rina Lazarus mysteries, this
one features a team of Las Vegas police detectives trying to solve
the mutilation murder of a Vegas showgirl.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1979 best seller ``Dress Gray,'' Lucian K. Truscott IV
had West Point cadet Ry Slaight investigating the murder of a gay
fellow student. Now a middle-aged lieutenant general, Slaight is
superintendent of his alma mater when a female cadet drops dead on
the parade ground. Adultery, sexual harassment and right-wing
conspiracies contribute to the murk in ``Full Dress Gray'' (Morrow,
$25).
</P>
<P>
   Two debuts deserve special mention. In Jonathan Robb's ``The
Overseer'' (Crown, $25), a 16th-century Swiss monk's master plan
for world domination survives but falls into the wrong hands.
Suddenly air-traffic control screens go blank, bombs explode in the
National Gallery, the grain market teeters on the verge of
collapse. Will the cabal's mastermind, known as the Overseer,
destroy society as we know it and forge a new world order?
</P>
<P>
   Don't bother addressing fan mail to ``Jane Harvard,'' the name
on the spine of the second debut, ``The Student Body'' (Villard,
$23). JH is the nom de plume of four Harvard University friends who
cooked up this mystery, inspired by the 1986 Brown University
prostitution scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard Crimson's brightest reporter, Toni Isaacs, gets a
tip: Harvard students are turning tricks for money. She digs for
the dirt, aided by her Latina roommate, Chelo; Van, who is
Vietnamese and bisexual; and the monied Cabot Winthrop.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this multicultural Mod Squad for the '90s discovers will
jeopardize much more than their academic futures,'' blurbles the
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Philip Kerr (Esau) has a new thriller, ``A Five Year
Plan'' (Henry Holt, $23), which his publisher touts as more
mainstream than his previous books; Brad Meltzer, whose debut,
``The Tenth Justice,'' was a best-selling legal thriller, returns
with ``Dead Even'' (Weisbach/Morrow, $25); and in ``L.A. Noir''
($25), Mysterious Press has reissued in one volume three of James
Ellroy's early novels featuring hard-boiled police detective Lloyd
Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lit lite'' is the dismissive term sometimes applied to summer
fiction. Publishers, the idea goes, save their literary offerings
for the fall and load the warm-weather lists with bonbons.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, as every year, readers wanting more than pure
escapism have plenty of choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cities of the Plain'' (Knopf, $24) is the final volume of
Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy. John Grady Cole and Billy Parham,
familiar from ``All the Pretty Horses'' and ``The Crossing''
respectively, are the young cowboy-heroes of this tale. It's set in
the West Texas-Mexico border country and involves Cole's falling in
love with a Mexican prostitute, with predictably tragic results.
</P>
<P>
   The critical consensus seems to be that ``All the Pretty
Horses'' is the best of the three books. But here as elsewhere,
McCarthy fashions compelling characters and hypnotic prose.
</P>
<P>
   John Irving (``The World According to Garp,'' ``The Hotel New
Hampshire'') has roared to the top of best-seller lists with ``A
Widow for One Year'' (Random House, $26.95), a sprawling 542-page
novel full of sex, humor and violence. We meet the central
character, Ruth Cole, in 1958, when she is 4 years old. The
narrative picks her up again in 1990, when she is a novelist of
``international stature.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Price (``Clockers'') writes crime novels that manage to
be both harrowing and elegantly crafted, bearing a greater moral
and psychological weight than you find in typical specimens of the
genre. ``Freedomland'' (Broadway, $25), like ``Clockers,'' is set
in gritty urban New Jersey but hearkens to real-life events farther
south _ the notorious Susan Smith case in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The novel begins with a white woman bursting into a hospital
emergency room claiming that she's just been carjacked by a black
man and that her 4-year-old son was asleep in the back seat. Police
detective Lorenzo Council has his doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Another stylish contribution to crime fiction is ``The Seville
Communion'' (Harcourt Brace, $24), the third novel by Spain's
Arturo Prez-Reverte. A computer hacker breaks through Vatican
security and messages the pope about plans to demolish an old
Seville church and about the suspicious deaths of two of the
church's defenders. The Vatican dispatches Father Lorenzo Quart to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Wally Lamb and Jacquelyn Mitchard, whose first novels earned the
imprimatur of talk-show host Oprah Winfrey _ and thus sold millions
_ have new books.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's ``I Know This Much Is True'' (ReganBooks, $27.50) is an
897-page epic about identical twin brothers, one a paranoid
schizophrenic, the other torn between resentment and love for his
sibling. One early review praised it, saying ``thanks to
well-sustained dramatic tension, funky gallows humor and some
shocking surprises, this sinuous story of one family's dark secrets
and recurring patterns of behavior largely succeeds in its
ambitious reach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Midwesterner Mitchard turns to Texas for the setting of
``The Most Wanted'' (Viking, $24.95), which centers on a
14-year-old girl who corresponds with and then marries a prison
inmate.
</P>
<P>
   Onetime Texan Rick Bass has been remarkably prolific in his
short writing career, producing a dozen well-received books of
fiction and nonfiction, but ``Where the Sea Used to Be'' (Houghton
Mifflin, $25) is his first full-length novel. Set in Montana, where
Bass makes his home, the story follows the lives of Old Dudley, an
aging Texas wildcatter who is drilling dry holes in Big Sky
country; his daughter; and two geologists who are employees of the
former and lovers of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Another first novel worth noting is ``Bombay Ice'' by Leslie
Forbes (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux, $23), in which a radio journalist
returns to her native India to investigate her sister's fear that
her husband, a famous Bombay film director, murdered his first
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the South's most engaging writers, Kaye Gibbons and
Bailey White, have novels this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a Year for Plums'' (Knopf, $22) is the first novel for
White, who is best-known for her National Public Radio commentaries
on the eccentricities of small-town Georgians. Darkly droll, the
novel plows similar ground.
</P>
<P>
   The life of a plantation owner's daughter is the stuff of ``On
the Occasion of My Last Afternoon'' (Putnam, $22.95) by Gibbons
(``Ellen Foster,'' ``Sights Unseen''). Born in 1842, Emma Garnet
has a pampered childhood. Although she gradually comes to
understand the brutality of slavery, she loyally serves the South
in a military hospital during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   One early review said Gibbons ``has gone back to that
still-smoldering conflict and imagined it from a wholly personal
and feminine perspective, concerned not with politics but with
blood and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the blood and suffering of the Civil War seem
everywhere in fiction. While ``Cold Mountain'' continues to hang on
to a slot on the best-seller list, ``Jacob's Ladder'' by Donald
McCaig (Norton, $25.95) resembles ``a collaboration between Shelby
Foote and Margaret Mitchell,'' according to Publishers Weekly. The
novel follows the scion of a white slaveholding family and two of
its slaves through the course of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other literary offerings this summer: Joanna Trollope
(``The Rector's Wife,'' ``The Choir'') has another domestic novel,
``The Best of Friends'' (Viking, $23.95); Gloria Naylor, whose
``Women of Brewster Place'' was a big best seller in 1982, returns
with ``The Men of Brewster Place'' (Hyperion, $22.95); and Alison
Lurie (``The War Between the Tates, Foreign Affairs'') chooses a
Key West setting for her latest, ``The Last Resort'' (Henry Holt,
$22).
</P>
<P>
   Last month saw the publication of Robert Stone's ``Damascus
Gate'' (Houghton Mifflin, $26), which combines political intrigue,
religious fanaticism and the hallucinatory appeal of Jerusalem.
``Erudite eschatological noir'' is how one admiring fellow writer
described it.
</P>
<P>
   And weighing in at 1,281 pages is Norman Mailer's ``The Time of
Our Time'' (Random House, $39.50), which brings together essays,
journalism and fiction produced over the past half century.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling this book, Mailer didn't necessarily intend a
``best of'' volume. Rather, he says, ``I would like the book to
offer some hint at a social and cultural history.'' Thus he chooses
to organize the anthology by date of setting rather than date of
composition _ it opens with a 1966 essay about an Ernest Hemingway
boxing match in 1929. A few pages later comes a long excerpt from
``The Naked and the Dead,'' the 1948 World War II novel that put
Mailer on the literary map.
</P>
<P>
   All the classic Mailer is here, in excerpts: ``Armies of the
Night,'' `` Of a Fire on the Moon,'' ``The Executioner's Song,''
``Harlot's Ghost.'' Self-indulgent he can be, but Mailer writes
prose that bristles with intelligence and energy. ``The Time of Our
Time'' should serve to introduce this great American writer to a
new generation of readers.
</P>
<P>
   Turn from fiction to nonfiction, and you'll find equally varied
fare this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Biographies and memoirs are always popular. In ``A Pirate Looks
at Fifty'' (Random House, $24.95), the man from Margaritaville _
Jimmy Buffett _ chronicles a trip he took through the Caribbean and
South America to celebrate his 50th birthday. Along the way he
talks about how he got his start in music and his passion for
flying airplanes, a love that survived a crash near Nantucket
Island, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Equally fun and accessible is Malachy McCourt's ``A Monk
Swimming'' (Hyperion, $23.95), memoirs of the Irish-born
actor/reconteur whose older brother is Frank McCourt (``Angela's
Ashes'').
</P>
<P>
   The younger McCourt, who arrived in the United States in 1952
after an impoverished childhood, tells raucous tales of acting
gigs, parties and smuggling gold into India. Liberal doses of drink
seem to have accompanied every adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Entertaining but with somewhat more heft is humorist Roy Blount
Jr.'s ``Be Sweet: A Conditional Love Story'' (Knopf, $24). Known
for his 14 books and his comedy routines on Garrison Keillor's ``A
Prairie Home Companion,'' Blount here offers a sportive take on his
upbringing in Georgia and his relationship with his mother.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Light My Fire: My Life With the Doors'' (Putnam, $26.95),
keyboardist and band co-founder Ray Manzarek gives a close-up look
at the brilliant but self-destructive Jim Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Lorian Hemingway, Ernest's granddaughter, weaves together her
love of fishing and her battle against alcoholism in ``Walk on
Water: A Memoir'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $23).
</P>
<P>
   But certainly the most notable memoir by an entertainment figure
this season remains Christopher Reeve's ``Still Me'' (Random House,
$25), the actor's candid, gutsy account of his life since a
horse-riding accident left him a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary Cooper: American Hero'' by Jeffrey Meyers (Morrow, $26)
is a detailed and straightforward rendering of the actor's public
and private life. Meyers is a respected biographer whose subjects
have included Humphrey Bogart, Joseph Conrad and Robert Frost.
</P>
<P>
   An even more distinguished biographer turns her hand to a much
more eccentric subject in ``Suits Me: The Double Life of Billy
Tipton'' (Houghton Mifflin, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wood Middlebrook, whose books include the award-winning
``Anne Sexton: A Biography,'' tells the life story of the female
jazz musician who, from age 19 until she died at 74, lived as a man
(and ``married'' five women).
</P>
<P>
   Another gender-bending eccentric, Marion ``Joe'' Carstairs, is
the subject of ``The Queen of Whale Cay'' by Kate Summerscale
(Viking, $21.95). Carstairs, who died in 1993 at age 93, held the
record as the fastest woman speedboat racer in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Having inherited a Standard Oil fortune, the cross-dressing
Carstairs spent her money on female lovers, fast boats and cars,
and the Bahamian island that she ruled like a queen. She had an
affair with Marlene Dietrich, numbered the Duke and Duchess of
Windsor among her friends, and was obsessively devoted to a leather
doll she named Lord Tod Wadley.
</P>
<P>
   Carstairs' grandfather amassed his fortune as treasurer to one
of John D. Rockefeller's companies in the late 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller's life is put under intense but fair-minded scrutiny
in Ron Chernow's superb ``Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller
Sr.'' (Random House, $30).
</P>
<P>
   Chernow, whose previous books include the National Book
Award-winning ``House of Morgan,'' delves into Rockefeller's
private life and personality as well as his business dealings to
produce a nuanced, multifaceted portrait.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a best seller, ``Titan'' should earn
major-award attention and is certainly the most important biography
of the spring-summer season.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the socioeconomic scale is Cedric Jennings.
Considered a ``nerd'' at his Washington, D.C., ghetto high school,
Jennings eschewed drugs and gangs and gained a place at Brown
University, where he has faced both opportunities and challenges.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street Journal reporter Ron Suskind, who won a Pulitzer
Prize for a newspaper series on Jennings' high school years,
followed the young black man to college and produced ``A Hope in
the Unseen: An American Odyssey From the Inner City to the Ivy
League'' (Broadway Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   New Yorker writer Lillian Ross has had the Big Apple atwitter
with the memoir of her decades-long affair with longtime New Yorker
editor William Shawn. The book is ``Here But Not Here'' (Random
House, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Other major titles in the biography/memoir category include
``Helen Keller: A Life'' by Dorothy Herrmann (Knopf, $30), an
early-August release; ``Badge of Courage: The Life of Stephen
Crane'' by Linda H. Davis (Houghton Mifflin, $35); and Ian Gibson's
``Shameful Life of Salvador Dali'' (Norton, $45), billed as ``the
most thorough and ambitious biography'' yet of the surrealist
artist.
</P>
<P>
   For Texas-history buffs, the biggest book of this season and
several past is ``Three Roads to the Alamo'' by William C. Davis
(HarperCollins, $35). This exhaustively researched joint biography
of David Crockett, James Bowie and William Barrett Travis will
appeal to readers who prefer complicated truths to simplistic
myths.
</P>
<P>
   European-history buffs should seek out Alexandra Ritchie's
``Faust's Metropolis: A History of Berlin'' (Carroll &AMP; Graf, $35).
Mammoth (976 pages) but eminently readable, the book chronicles the
city from its pre-Roman roots but concentrates on its tumultuous
20th-century history. (The author, a fellow of Wolfson College at
Oxford University, is a member of the von Moltkes, a famous German
military family.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Greatest Benefit to Mankind: A Medical History of
Humanity'' (Norton, $35) sounds forbidding, but historian Roy
Porter blends erudition and anecdote to produce an engaging volume.
</P>
<P>
   Political junkies have ``Nixon in Winter'' (Random House, $30),
the second volume in Monica Crowley's Boswell-like renderings of
the ex-president's views. From 1990 to 1994, Crowley served as
Nixon's foreign-policy assistant and sounding board. She published
``Nixon Off the Record'' in 1996. In this second volume, Nixon
delivers himself on subjects ranging from the breakup of the Soviet
Union to President Clinton to the death of his wife, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Kinder tells the story of the sinking of the gold-laden
sidewheel steamer Central America off the Carolina coast in 1857
and the recovery of the ship's treasure by inventor Tommy Thompson
in 1989. The book is ``Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea''
(Atlantic Monthly Press, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ellis examines the origins and evolution of the Atlantis
myth in ``Imagining Atlantis'' (Knopf, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Bill Bryson, an Iowa-born journalist who spent 20 years
in England, has written perhaps the most delightful book of the
season, ``A Walk in the Woods'' (Broadway Books, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Having been out of the country for so long, Bryson decides to
reconnect with his American roots by walking the 2,100-mile
Appalachian Trail from north Georgia to Maine. Together with an
equally out-of-shape buddy, Stephen Katz, he takes to the woods,
fending off bears, yuppies and a preternaturally annoying hiker
named Mary Ellen.
</P>
<P>
   Funny and enlightening about the people and places of the trail,
``A Walk in the Woods'' might inspire you to poke your nose out the
door despite the heat. &QL;

ACTIVITIES MAKE TRAVEL LESS TEDIOUS FOR KIDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By SYD KEARNEY 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are we there yet?
</P>
<P>
   Those may be the most-uttered words this summer as American
families hit the road in search of recreation, relaxation and good
old fun. According to a recent poll by the Travel Industry
Association of America and AAA Travelometer, more than half of all
pleasure trips planned this summer will include children.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the favorite activity? According to the 1,500 U.S.
adults polled, beach- and lake-oriented vacations are most
appealing for families, followed by camping and theme parks.
Florida, California and Hawaii are the most alluring destinations.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning a child-centered holiday, consider these
resources:
</P>
<P>
   1) Rand McNally for Kids produces a collection of travel games
and activities for ages 3-7.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged in a colorful, kid-size suitcase, the Vacation Fun Pack
($15) features two travel books, activity pads, a sheet of reusable
stickers and crayons. Other Rand McNally products include the
series ``My First Backseat Books,'' with titles such as ``Alphabet
Travels'' and ``Things on the Go'' ($3.95 each), and KidCards,
decks of 52 cards that can be used to play I Spy, Road Sign
Dominoes, Wild Card Old Maid and other games. Each deck features
several games and costs $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   2) ``Outside Magazine's Guide to Family Vacations'' (Macmillan,
$15.95) and ``The Kids' Book of 50 Great States'' (Scholastic,
$14.95) might be good to have along.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Magazine's Guide to Family Vacations'' outlines more
than 150 adventures, including white-water rafting, mountain biking
and backpacking. In addition to information on guides, outfitters
and park services, the book offers fun features such as rainy-day
activities, calming words for hysterical parents and suggested
itineraries.
</P>
<P>
   3) ``50 Great States,'' written by children across the country
for their peers ages 8-12, is fun and informative. Maps, puzzles,
poems, games, trivia, songs, cartoons and jokes are all part of the
mix, which also includes information about state heroes and
heroines, tourist spots with kid appeal and useful Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   4) ``Clap, Tickle, Tug'' and ``Radio Bingo'' are just two of the
250 activities featured in ``FamilyFun's Games on the Go`
(Hyperion, $9.95). Activities for car, plane and train travel are
included, as well as travel, packing and dining tips designed to
ease nerves and make family travel fun.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the games require no supplies. In the road game Counting
Cows, for instance, players count the cows (or mailboxes, dogs or
grocery stores) on their side of the road. You agree on an ending
destination, and the player who has counted the most cows wins. Oh,
and if you pass a cemetery on your side of the road, you lose all
your cows.
</P>
<P>
   5) Electronic games can pass many dull hours of driving across
Oklahoma or waiting in an airport terminal. Hasbro offers several
hand-held electronic games suited for travel, including Trivial
Pursuit, Mastermind and Totally Twister. With three skill levels,
Battleship Electronic Hand-Held features spiffy sound effects when
you sink a ship.
</P>
<P>
   Other electronic titles are available. Prices range from $13.99
for Yahtzee to $24.99 for Monopoly.

   Most accommodations are in the ``Country Club,'' accented by
gardens and a courtyard pool. Rooms include two televisions and a
marble bath with separate whirlpool tub and shower.

 By LINDA VILLAROSA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deborah Gregory, a Manhattan writer who describes herself as in
her late 30s, is a big woman. Stylish and attractive, Ms. Gregory
is noticed when she walks into a room. She eats a balanced diet,
sleeps well and works an hour of exercise into her busy schedule
almost every day. She considers herself fit and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But at 5 feet 11 and 227 pounds, Ms. Gregory is also obese, at
least as obesity is now defined under new federal guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The question for Ms. Gregory and others like her is this: Can a
person be both fit and fat?
</P>
<P>
   That question, which was argued publicly at a standing-room only
forum at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting
this month, is at the heart of a debate among doctors, fitness
experts and other health professionals.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides agree that being overweight _ or worse, obese _
is associated with many serious health risks, the argument centers
on whether the real problem is being fat or being unfit.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregory admits she would like to shed a few pounds and would
be delighted if her workout regimen allowed her to do that. But it
is not her prime motivation as she hops on the treadmill at her
health club or goes for fitness walks with her dogs. ``I work out
because it makes me feel better over all,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As for weight loss, Ms. Gregory said, ``I've been about this
size for the last 14 years, and I never imagine myself being really
thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing of Ms. Gregory, Dr. Claude Bouchard, an obesity
researcher at Laval University in Quebec, said it was ``marvelous''
that she exercised regularly, but stressed that exercise alone was
not going to prevent heart disease, cancer or diabetes. To reduce
those risks, he said, Ms. Gregory must lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does a lot of good for herself by exercising,'' Bouchard
said, ``but at this weight, she remains at great risk of having
medical difficulties down the road. Good, solid, safe medication
that would be capable of inducing weight loss of perhaps 25 or 30
pounds could help her dramatically, but for the moment we don't
have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Steven N. Blair, an epidemiologist with the Cooper Institute
for Aerobics Research in Dallas, disagrees. ``I am darned confident
that her exercise habit is improving her health even if she remains
heavy,'' said Dr. Blair.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize his point, Blair cited his own research, the
Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, which looked at the association
of physical fitness to mortality risk in 25,000 overweight and
normal weight subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is better off as she is than if she were lean and unfit,''
Blair said. ``Healthy bodies come in all shapes and sizes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fit vs. fat debate has been renewed in recent weeks with the
release of new definitions of overweight and obesity that use body
mass index _ a measure of weight in relation to height - as a
primary measuring tool. The 24-member expert panel convened by the
National Heart Lung and Blood Institute lowered the point at which
a person is defined as overweight to a body mass index of 25 from
27 and obese to 30 from 35. According to the new standards, with a
body mass index of 32, Ms. Gregory is clearly obese.
</P>
<P>
   The revised definition also means that many more Americans are
classified as overweight and obese _ a total of 97 million _ up
from 72 million under the former guidelines. And the Surgeon
General's 1996 report on physical activity and health estimates
that 25 percent of Americans are totally sedentary and another 46
percent are not regularly active.
</P>
<P>
   With these numbers in mind, the American Heart Association this
month upgraded obesity to a major risk factor for a heart attack
from a contributing risk. A sedentary lifestyle has been listed as
a major risk factor since 1992. ``It was about time obesity moved
from a backseat position,'' said Dr. Robert Eckel, vice chairman of
the American Heart Association's Nutrition Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both the heart association and the heart lung institute panel
relied on a number of large studies linking obesity to heart
disease, stroke, diabetes, gall bladder disease and some cancers.
The statement released by the panel noted that obesity leads to
more preventable deaths than all other causes, second only to
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   In the fitness camp, Glenn A. Gaesser, Ph.D., an associate
professor of exercise physiology at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, is quick to counter that obesity has been
overestimated and inactivity underestimated as a risk factor for
illnesses like heart disease and diabetes and for early death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible that some of the people in these studies are in
ill health not because they're fat, but because they're unfit?''
Gaesser said. He quoted 1993 data from the Harvard Alumni Study in
which a group of men who were initially unfit increased their
fitness levels and experienced a 44 percent reduction in risk of
early death.
</P>
<P>
   He also cited Blair's research, which found that heavy but fit
men lived longer than thin, sedentary men. ``Weight didn't matter,
it was fitness level'' Gaesser said. ``If we're going to send a
message to the public, it should be to become fitter and not
necessarily worry about losing weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist at the Harvard School of
Public Health and Harvard Medical School, says that though she is a
tremendous proponent of exercise, obesity is a stronger risk factor
than physical inactivity for diabetes, hypertension and
postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is strong compelling evidence in random clinical trials
that weight loss through reducing caloric intake had a more
favorable effect on blood pressure, cholesterol and insulin
sensitivity than physical activity without weight loss,'' Manson
said. ``As far as preventing mortality,'' she added, ``if you had
to pin me down, later in life _ after 65 or 70 _ maintaining
physical activity may be more important than avoiding weight gain.
Earlier in life avoiding obesity may be slightly more important.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard said that he thinks all this back and forth over fit
vs. fat might be moot. ``Even if we have five studies saying that
if you're fit you alleviate some of the consequences of obesity,
the obese people, by and large, are not fit and they don't
exercise,'' Dr. Bouchard said. ``Ninety percent of them will never
be active. If they were, they would not be obese in the first
place. That's the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair remains steadfast for fitness. Pointing to his own
physique, he said: ``I run every day, but I'll always be short, fat
and bald. But being fit sure seems to protect against many of the
hazards of obesity.''

NEW CIVIL WAR BOOK SPROUTS FROM A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This would've been in 1964, when Jeff Shaara was 12 years old,
his father, 35.
</P>
<P>
   They stood on Cemetery Ridge, at the spot where General Lew
Armistead collapsed after leading his men over the low wall, life
leaving him as he watched the last of his soldiers stop and scatter
and fall back down the hill _ as good a parable for the death of
the Confederacy as there would ever be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid, you know, I had my rubber sword and musket from
the gift shop, I wasn't even sure where I was,'' Shaara said. ``But
my father ... he was absolutely consumed by it. He had no idea,
when he was walking through the battlefield, that it would change
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I can tell you the moment, the exact moment. We were
standing at the high-water mark, next to the Armistead monument, me
with my little musket, and he started to tell me what happened.
He's looking back, at the ground they came over, at the place where
they died, and while he's talking he starts getting emotional. His
voice ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara stopped, looked up, and said, ``I'd never seen my father
emotional. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara's father, Michael, would go on to write what is
considered the best novel about the Civil War, ``The Killer
Angels,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize after its publication in
1974. Michael Shaara, who died of heart disease in 1988 at the age
of 59, never saw his novel become a popular success. But his son
has seen ``The Killer Angels'' reach its 79th printing and has
followed in the wake of his father's words, writing the
best-selling Civil War novel ``Gods and Generals'' and ``The Last
Full Measure,'' just out from Ballantine Books (512 pages, $25.95
hardcover).
</P>
<P>
   During a recent reading of ``The Last Full Measure'' in San
Francisco, Shaara told the audience, ``I have no illusions. If not
for heart disease, if not for my father's untimely death, he would
have written these books. I would not be standing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Michael Shaara was able to hand down his
passion for the Civil War to his son, who graduated from Florida
State with a degree in criminology and went on to deal in rare
coins before writing ``Gods and Generals.'' The novel follows
officers and men through the battles before the three days of
Gettysburg _ the storm at the heart of ``The Killer Angels,'' and
the beginning of the end of war ``by the rules'' of standing
stock-straight through a hail of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the war they called Robert E. Lee `Granny' Lee,
because he wanted to put fortifications in front of Richmond,
because he wanted to dig in for defense,'' Shaara said. ``After
Gettysburg, you couldn't get enough shovels.''
</P>
<P>
   To Shaara, ``The Killer Angels'' is part of a trilogy, started
by ``Gods and Generals,'' completed by ``The Last Full Measure'' _
a novel of the war after Gettysburg, seen through the eyes of Lee,
Joshua Chamberlain and Ulysses S. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a history book. I am not a historian,'' Shaara
said. ``This is the story of people, real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara smiled a little, saying, ``My father used to say that
during the writing of `The Killer Angels,' he was visited by every
character in the book. Not `ghost' visits, just ... a sense of
being with them.'' He's felt the same thing, said Shaara, standing
inside the house in which Stonewall Jackson died.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Fredericksburg, Va., for the writing of ``Gods and
Generals,'' Shaara found that the town has overgrown the
battlefield. ``If you want to stand where Lee stood at the top of
the hill,'' he said, ``you're in somebody's back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few miles south, Shaara spotted a sign reading,
``Stonewall Jackson Shrine,'' which led to a small, two-story house
watched over by a single park ranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me what happened there and then let me be,'' Shaara
said. ``The bed was the same, the blanket on the bed, the clock in
the room was the same, as the day Jackson died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hard to imagine that when the rasping of his breath
stopped _ he died of pneumonia, not from the wound _ every head
turned toward the ticking of that clock. Without trying to make it
sound too melodramatic, I stood there, listening to the ticking of
the clock, the same clock that had been in the room with Jackson,
and it changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara plunged into writing ``Gods and Generals,'' which hit the
best-seller charts within weeks of being published. ``The Killer
Angels,'' despite its critical success, despite the Pulitzer Prize,
did not make it to the best-seller list until the first week of
October 1993 _ the week the film based on the novel,
``Gettysburg,'' made its debut.
</P>
<P>
   His father had written four novels and more than 70 short
stories, Shaara said, ``but he was not, in his mind, a success.
`The Killer Angels' was turned down by 15 publishers before it was
finally printed ... when I was growing up, my memories are of all
the rejection letters, my mother trying to hide them so he didn't
see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote other pieces, magazine pieces, at a penny a word,''
Shaara said with a quick smile. ``I know, because as a boy I had to
count them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when you win a Pulitzer Prize, the doors open up. Not
for him. In 1975, the end of the Vietnam War, absolutely nobody
wanted to read a book about war. The critics were like, `How can
this man dare write a book glorifying generals?' They called it a
`cult' book.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after ``Killer Angels,'' started to sell, Shaara's father
had to run the historical gauntlet. ``He'd catch hell in the North
for being sympathetic to Lee, catch hell in the South for his
positive portrayal of Longstreet, which you just did not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also had people get in my face, saying, `That war was
about slavery.' And I say, `You're telling me a lumberjack from
Vermont is fighting the war because of slavery? What does he know
or care about slavery?' ... It was never that simplistic, but it's
one of those things they teach kids in the fifth grade, so they can
pass a test.''
</P>
<P>
   There had to be more to it, to explain the slaughter on both
sides, Shaara said. ``Why would these guys keep marching into the
guns, year after year, when their wives are writing to them,
saying, `Enough already. The farm needs you. The kids need you.'
These men, most of them, wrote back to say, `This is for honor, for
my honor.'''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Civil War still holds its spell half a dozen
generations later, Shaara said, is ``because they are us. Some of
us have ancestors from the war, but that's the easy answer. It's
because we can relate to these people as humans. They are us. This
is who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Northerners and Southerners fought for ``the power of an idea,''
he said _ fought to protect the same Constitution handed down from
generation to generation, war to war, through the worst and best of
this country's history.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who won't accept that, Shaara said, or accept
the concept of a historical novel. ``I've had people say, `How dare
you put words in the mouth of Robert E. Lee?' So I said to myself,
`OK, the only way you can do that is if you get to know the
characters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara did, and he liked what he saw, with some exceptions. ``My
father liked Longstreet ... he saw a lot of himself in Longstreet.
They were both brooding men, bothered by depression. I had a
problem _ I didn't find the same man my father did. He saw Lee
through the eyes of Longstreet. I saw it the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Phil Sheridan? Phil Sheridan was a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara didn't see any of that when he was playing with inch-high
soldiers as a kid. ``I used to put the blue troops in the folds of
a blanket, call it the mountains, put the Confederates on the
floor, then roll marbles at 'em. Whoever was left standing, won.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Shaara grew to learn the complexities of the war and
the everyday demands of staying alive. He remembered his father
working on a definitive volume of Shakespeare as his life wore down
_ ``He would sit at the typewriter, 10 minutes would go by, and
he'd be done. He had his first heart attack at 36. I'm 46. I take
this seriously.''

By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Every time Ally Sheedy drifts on screen in the
acclaimed new independent film ``High Art,'' our attention is
riveted. Painfully thin, with a manner that oozes resignation and
psychic agony yet also projects a steely sense of self-knowledge,
Sheedy's dissolute Lucy Berliner has everything going for her,
attention-getting-wise, that the movies love about self-destructive
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's something about Sheedy's performance that doesn't
exploit the cliches, that places Lucy's drug abuse and
misunderstood-genius angst within a natural, proportioned
framework. It's an impressively well-judged job, the kind of
spectacular, specific acting that feels lived, not created.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from ``The Breakfast Club.'' And it's something
the onetime Brat Pack star, now 36, had to go through certain hells
in order to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``A character who is this dark, who has a drug problem and a
sort of death wish going on, there are just so many possibilities
to get fussy and self-conscious playing her,'' says Sheedy, who's
as animated and engaged as Lucy is tentative and zoned out. ``And
there's enough in there that's really just a part of me and part of
my entire experience of my life. I felt like all I had to do was be
there, stay out of the way and let it just play.''
</P>
<P>
   A few disclaimers here about the differences between Ally and
Lucy. Sheedy long ago kicked an addiction to the prescription drug
Halcion but has never had a Lucy-like heroin problem. The actress
is happily married to New York stage actor David Lansbury and has
spent most of the last four years being a hands-on mother to their
daughter, Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   She confesses, though, to having had a toxic relationship with
Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora that she claims informs Lucy's
dysfunctional romance with a junkie German actress (played with
languid wit by Patricia Clarkson). Sambora has disputed Sheedy's
recollections about their time together.
</P>
<P>
   Where Ally and Lucy really intersect, though, is in their take
on art and commerce. Lucy is a photographer who went into a 10-year
drug haze rather than cope with the compromises of New York's
commercial art scene. Sheedy, whose editor mother raised her in
Manhattan's literary world (Ally wrote a best-selling children's
book, ``She Was Nice to Mice,'' at the age of 12), turned her back
on Hollywood after appearing in a string of successful '80s movies:
``Bad Boys,'' ``WarGames,'' ``Breakfast Club,'' ``Short Circuit,''
``St. Elmo's Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   When she talks about Lucy's creative views, Sheedy can't help
commenting on her own career as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucy just takes pictures purely out of love, and the buying
and selling of that would have destroyed her art,'' she says. ``As
far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what happened to me here. Lucy
has this line where she says, `I made it impossible for myself to
continue,' and I made it impossible for myself to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Brat Pack _ a loosely associated cadre of young '80s
actors that included Emilio Estevez, Molly Ringwald, Judd Nelson,
Rob Lowe and future superstars Tom Cruise and Demi Moore, among
others _ lost its collective cachet, Sheedy, like many of her
contemporaries, found it difficult to segue into more mature roles.
She was especially hampered by her girl-next-door image, which
prevented her from being seriously considered as both a Hollywood
leading lady and _ what she really wanted _ in the burgeoning field
of edgy, independent films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to play more interesting characters
that had more going on, that weren't simply sex objects,'' she
explains. ``But because of the way I look, my outside and inside
did not work together. I wanted more complex, darker, deeper work _
and what was coming my way was so banal.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few offbeat films that failed to succeed either
artistically or at the box office, Sheedy retreated to her native
New York, where she intensively studied her craft, did some stage
work and returned to writing. A book of poems, ``Yesterday I Saw
the Sun,'' was published in 1991, and she's just finished a satiric
novel aimed at young adults.
</P>
<P>
   To pay the bills, Sheedy has made a series of films for the USA
cable network. ``High Art'' won acclaim at this year's Sundance and
Cannes film festivals, but she actually overcame the Brat Pack onus
with indie filmmakers a few years ago. Sheedy has appeared in five
other low-budget productions, all of which are still seeking
theatrical distribution.
</P>
<P>
   It's nothing like the heyday of the John Hughes teen flick, but
Sheedy loves it just the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to be a Movie Star with a capital M and a capital
S,'' she says. ``Acting is something that I really love to do, but
the problem is that when you marry something that is creative with
a business, it's a really uneasy marriage. To decide that you're
going to become this huge commercial success, it usually means that
you're going to have to do movies that appeal to the lowest common
denominator and become grossly successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be very content to find these kinds of roles in
independent films and just keep working on them.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one would ever invite the human genome to a party. It is long
winded, highly repetitive and frustratingly full of intriguing
stories that it has no idea how to tell in an organized way.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the genome has suddenly become hot property. There are
new ways of making it talk, and it holds a lot of secrets. Some are
merely worth billions to drug companies. Others are priceless, such
as those that tell how and when the human species evolved.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to decipher the 3 billion letters of DNA that are the
human genome unexpectedly became a race last month when the Federal
Human Genome Project acquired a rival, a joint venture of the
instrument maker Perkin-Elmer of Norwalk, Conn., and Dr. J. Craig
Venter of the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) of Rockville,
Md.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a competitive scientist who is not averse to tweaking
the establishment's tail on occasion, announced on May 10 that he
would start and essentially complete the human genome in three
years, four years ahead of the government's target date of 2005.
Because of his previous record in deciphering the small genomes of
bacteria, his claim had substance, although some academic
scientists say his method will not work and others that it will not
be sufficiently accurate.
</P>
<P>
   The response to the Perkin-Elmer-TIGR threat by those involved
in the Human Genome Project is still in a state of development. The
choices: Get the full genome done even faster, or do a quick,
``first edition'' version to pre-empt the Venter end run.
</P>
<P>
   On the public front, Venter has been persuaded to play down
assertions of finishing first and join in professions of
collaboration. He told the House subcommittee on energy and
environment last week that the Human Genome Project's sequencing
effort was not a waste of money (as it might seem if Venter should
finish first) and that ``by working closely together'' the two
efforts would ``complete the sequence sooner than anyone ever
imagined.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of
Health's part of the Human Genome Project, told the House
subcommittee that ``the private and public genome sequencing
efforts should not be seen as engaged in a race.''
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, it is difficult for the academic
scientists financed by Collins' office to ignore Venter's
challenge. One response is the suggestion that the university
sequencing centers should produce a quick first edition of the
genome on a time scale competitive with Venter's. This means, in
essence, doing all the easy parts of the genome first and then
filling in the gaps.
</P>
<P>
   One advocate of this approach is Dr. Leroy Hood, a biologist at
the University of Washington at Seattle and a co-inventor of the
DNA sequencing machines sold by Perkin-Elmer. ``Low pass sequencing
would allow us at lower cost to march much more rapidly through the
human genome,'' Hood said in an interview, referring to a strategy
of using fewer overlapping sequences than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy would also be less accurate, but its error rate
would be similar to the natural rate of variation in DNA among
individuals and not of significance in defining the genes, Hood
believes.
</P>
<P>
   If further tests showed that a first edition of the genome was
feasible, ``We could go to Congress and say we could get something
useful done very quickly,'' Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Venter's announcement of his unilateral effort, academic
scientists had tended to rebuff suggestions for quick solutions,
favoring high quality and accuracy over speed. Always at the back
of their minds has been the fear that if the obviously interesting
parts of the genome were sequenced first, money might evaporate
before the remaining regions could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Only 3 percent of the DNA in the human genome codes for genes,
and much of the rest is apparently meaningless clutter that
evolution has neglected to clear out of the genetic attic.
Biologists want to sequence the noncoding DNA because it may well
contain unexpected information, and in any case its variations help
tell the story of human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Collins noted in an interview that it might be worth trying to
focus for now on the gene-rich regions of the human chromosomes,
leaving the gene-poor regions for later.
</P>
<P>
   Though many scientists now favor accelerating the genome
project, some assert that Venter's effort is a publicity machine
that will not deliver promised results. Warning of the danger of
overreacting, Dr. Maynard Olson of the University of Washington at
Seattle told the House hearing last week that the Perkin-Elmer/TIGR
project would produce data of poor quality, inadequate for the
long-term needs of scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The Venter strategy ``will encounter catastrophic problems''
when he tries to assemble component parts into a full sequence,
resulting in more than 100,000 serious gaps, Olson told the House
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Venter is not the only player whose actions need to be taken
into account. Another participant is the Sanger Center in
Cambridge, England. The center is financed by the Wellcome Trust of
London to sequence one-third of the human genome in collaboration
with the Federal Human Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   Its director, Dr. John Sulston, is committed to producing a
full, high-quality archival sequence. Dr. Malcolm Morgan, the
trust's program director, has said it would finance the Sanger
Center to do the whole genome if its American partners should
recede from the goal of a complete, high-quality sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Players of another sort are companies like Incyte and Human
Genome Sciences that have specialized in fishing out and sequencing
just the segments of DNA that code for genes. The method for
stripping out the genes was developed by Venter when his nonprofit
institute was allied to Human Genome Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences (also
in Rockville, Md.), says that his company has already pulled out
and sequenced more than 90 percent of the human genes. He has
infuriated many university scientists by saying he sees no
practical reason for sequencing the DNA in between the genes.
</P>
<P>
   He also disputes the position of the Human Genome Project's
scientists that their finished DNA sequences have fewer than one
error in 10,000 base pairs of DNA; comparing them with his own gene
sequences, Haseltine says that the sequences deposited by
university scientists in public databases have one error in every
500 bases.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine's statements cannot be verified because Human Genome
Sciences does not publish its data. The principle that motivates
the Human Genome Project's university sequencing centers is the
antithesis of Haseltine's. The centers' scientists believe that the
human genome data should be in the public domain. The centers make
no private use of their own data, and by agreement publish it
immediately for the free benefit of other researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Haseltine's claim that he has already found most of the human
genes is strongly disputed by his former partner. Venter said that
Haseltine's collection probably consists mostly of the common
house-keeping genes that are easy to fish out because they are so
active. Genes that flick on less often, such as interesting
regulatory genes, are less likely to be picked up, Venter said.
Haseltine said his method picked up rare genes too.
</P>
<P>
   Neither scientist is without self-interest. Haseltine's company
would benefit if all rival sequencers vanished; Venter has
presumably convinced his sponsor, Perkin-Elmer, that at least some
patentable genes remain to be found so as to help defray the
company's investment.
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize their continuing differences, as well as how
little still is known about the human genome, Venter and Haseltine
differ by a factor of almost two as to how many genes it contains.
Venter estimates there are 60,000 to 80,000 human genes; Haseltine
insists there are 100,000 to 120,000.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists say the dispute demonstrates another reason for
sequencing the whole genome.
</P>
<P>
   The dilemma for those involved in the Human Genome Project is
that they need to produce a first edition to protect themselves
from Venter, yet such an effort would probably delay the goal of
obtaining a complete sequence by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Though the university sequencing centers have made big strides,
it is far from certain that the 2005 goal will be achieved. None of
the centers have achieved the production rates promised two years
ago, and some are much less efficient than others, according to
production and cost figures reported last month by Elizabeth
Pennisi in Science.
</P>
<P>
   The academic sequencers' problem would be resolved if Congress
provided more money so they could pursue fast and slow approaches
in parallel. Some scientists who at first resented what they saw as
Venter's declaration of war have now come around to believing his
work might help jump-start their own efforts. But Rep. John Edward
Porter, R-Ill., chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee
that approves the National Institutes of Health's budget, said in
an interview, ``I don't see it as a race, and so I don't see any
need to change our funding.''

WHAT, NO `TITANIC' LOVE SONG?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ June is traditionally the month to be merry _ and
get married.
</P>
<P>
   In the spirit of union comes a new CD compilation that collects
the most popular wedding songs of all time.
</P>
<P>
   You already know some of these tunes _ ``Promises Ain't Enough''
by Hall &AMP; Oates, ``A Whole New World (Aladdin's Theme)'' by Peabo
Bryson with Regina Belle, ``Endless Love'' by Diana Ross &AMP; Lionel
Richie, ``I Pledge My Love'' by Peaches &AMP; Herb, and ``Best Thing
That Ever Happened to Me'' by Gladys Knight &AMP; the Pips.
</P>
<P>
   Bookending the 15-track disc, titled ``Modern Bride Presents the
Wedding Album'' (Columbia), are the two most familiar pieces of
traditional wedding music: the ``Bridal Chorus'' from Richard
Wagner's ``Lohengrin'' and the ``Wedding March'' from Felix
Mendelssohn's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Op. 61.
</P>
<P>
   The making of the album was a group effort, said Dave
Santaniello, vice president of special marketing at Columbia
Records in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The initial list of songs was compiled by Santaniello's
assistant, Lauri Pearson, who came up with the titles from memory
after having spent several years in radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew the songs from the number of on-air requests they
received,'' Santaniello said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Wedding Album'' is being marketed with Modern Bride
magazine, the nation's top wedding mag. In fact, 350,000 copies of
the August/September issue will contain a sampler featuring spoken
word from Pearson and samples of romantic songs from some of
Columbia's new artists, including Chantal Kreviazuk and Bic Runga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choosing the music you'll hear at your wedding and your
reception is surely one of the most personal wedding-planning
decisions of all,'' said Stacy Morrison, editor of Modern Bride.
</P>
<P>
   But where's Celine Dion's ``My Heart Will Go On,'' the
international smash that just may be this summer's most popular
wedding song?
</P>
<P>
   Santaniello said ``The Wedding Album'' was being created six
months ago, just as the blockbuster ``Titanic'' was taking off, so
it was too soon to include Dion's song.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to do this on a yearly basis,'' Santaniello said,
adding that next year's package would probably include the
``Titanic'' love theme.

SAY HELLO TO THE MEANIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEESUN WEE 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; From her first stuffed animals as a child to
Beanie Babies as an adult, Anne Sidell has been hoarding stuff as
long as she can remember. But after years of collecting saccharine
cute and retro cool items, Sidell has discovered gross.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about Meanies, a collection of small, stuffed
critters that are crude and hilarious, or offensive _ depending on
your sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're gross and they're a riot,'' said Sidell, who owns the
entire first, 12-character series and is anxious to get her hands
on the second dozen, which went on sale earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanies' fans don't rival the masses of Beanie Babies
collectors. Local buyers and sellers of Meanies say they know of no
trading groups. But nearly a year after their debut, Meanies are
attracting followers. Proof of their growing popularity: In May,
the New York City-based idea factory, the manufacturer of Meanies,
also released teeny weenie meanies attached to key chains at
7-Eleven stores nationwide. And there will be more.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the month, the manufacturer is scheduled to unveil
a special collection parodying celebrities. The aptly titled group
of four Infamous Meanies will feature Bull Clinton, who sports
patriotic underwear _ below his knees; Buddy, Clinton's dog, its
mouth around pink panties monogrammed with the initials ML; Mike
Bison, who has an ear stuffed in his mouth; and Donkeying, a
combination of boxing promoter Don King and a donkey. So far, fans
only have been able to preview the celebrity collection on the
Internet at www.meanies.com.
</P>
<P>
   Each Meanie critter sells for about $5 and some eventually
disappear from the retail market, as has been the successful
marketing tactic for other collectible toys. But unlike a Beanie
Baby that retires, a Meanie's retail end appropriately is more
gruesome and violent. They're ``terminated.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Collectors and merchandisers say Meanies appeal to an audience
seeking something distinctly un-Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the boy's answer to the Beanie Babies,'' said Don
Aquilino of Acta Game Guys in Van Nuys, one of many Valley novelty
and toy shops selling Meanies.
</P>
<P>
   While some Meanies buyers collect all kinds of toys, Meanies
also attract boys and men who are tired of cuddly Beanie Babies and
want revenge, Valley toy store owners say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are saying, `I now have something to put on my desk,' ''
said Allen LeWinter, the originator of Meanies and president of
TOPKAT entertainment marketing company New Jersey. LeWinter has
been in the toy business for more than a decade and helped push
purple Barney into our lives through licensing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LeWinter created Meanies with males in mind. In
contrast, Beanie Babies seem to have an especially loyal fan base
among girls and women, he said. ``I kept thinking, `Where are the
boys'?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the concept of Meanies was established, LeWinter and 10
staff members developed the characters. For ideas, they keep
abreast of news events and trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see who's on top, throw out ideas and see what's funny,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   LeWinter admits the Series II plush toys are more in-your-face
than their initial counterparts. The dirtier dozen includes Peeping
Tom Cat, with eyes that bulge out like binoculars; Donnie Didn't
Duck, a blue-and-white bird with no head _ just what looks like
blood; and the Velocicrapper, grimacing and trying to, uh ... you
know.
</P>
<P>
   LeWinter said Meanies are selling because Americans' tolerance
for foulness seems to have shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten into a period where gross is acceptable. Who
would have thought (the cartoon series) `South Park' would be
acceptable?'' he said. ``There's a trend toward the grosser. If
it's gross or yucky, it sells.''
</P>
<P>
   But Holly Carson of Sylmar, who owns about a dozen characters
and sells collectibles at Holly's Hobbies inside the Country
Antique Fair Mall in Saugus, stressed she wouldn't buy a Meanie for
a child. ``They're not for everybody,'' Carson said.
</P>
<P>
   And Sidell admits she keeps her Meanies collection in her
bedroom because not all her guests would appreciate them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, executives at Ty, manufacturers of Beanie Babies,
don't seem to be getting the joke. The publicity department did not
return telephone requests for comments about Meanies.

OF HIGH MOMENTS AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, June 28.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
(lh) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This case is of  &UR; high moment &LR; ,'' wrote Independent Counsel Ken
Starr to the Supreme Court, because it involved ``fundamental
constitutional issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fallen upon times,'' promulgated Pope Leo XIII in an
encyclical a century ago, ``when a violent and well-nigh daily
battle is being fought about matters of  &UR; highest moment &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   ``Considerations of  &UR; high moment &LR;  call on the American,'' wrote
The Southern Literary Messenger in 1839, ``... to extend and
disseminate every facility which our country can afford, for the
promotion of information. Upon this pillar rests the question of
man's capability for self-government.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy stuff. In dealing with the voguish, momentary popularity
of  &UR; moments &LR;  in this space recently ( &UR; senior moments &LR; ,  &UR; Zen
moments &LR; ,  &UR; Maalox moments &LR; ), I neglected the essence of the word
expressed in the adjective  &UR; momentous &LR; : ``of great weight; of major
significance.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Moment &LR; , in this sense, seems like one of those Janus words
with opposite meanings, like  &UR; sanction &LR;  (penalty; approval) or
 &UR; sanguine &LR;  (bloody; optimistic). How can  &UR; moment &LR;  be both
``fleeting'' and ``of consequence''?
</P>
<P>
   Look to the Latin  &UR; momentum &LR; , ``movement.'' When you place a
tiny particle on a perfectly balanced scale, you cause it to move;
thus, even a time of incalculable briefness or the lightest weight
of an argument, when added to one of the scales in equilibrium,
breaks the balance and creates movement, which gains momentum,
changes minds and moves the world. That's how a transitory moment
can be of  &UR; high moment &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; High &LR; , in this phrase, means ``significant'' _ more than in
``high official,'' as much as in ``high crimes'' or ``high
dudgeon.'' Fred Shapiro, co-editor of ``Trial and Error: An Oxford
Anthology of Legal Stories,'' tracks  &UR; high moment &LR;  back in legal
usage to an 1861 opinion condemning a Confederate ship for
violating a Union blockade.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when  &UR; important &LR;  has lost its zip,  &UR; significant &LR;  is
too lightly bandied about, and even  &UR; consequential &LR;  lacks gravamen,
it's comforting to see  &UR; moment &LR;  regaining its moment.
</P>
<P>
   AND THE HORSE YOU RODE IN ON
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, the best-selling author and keen debater who is
President Clinton's most unwavering loyalist, is writing a book for
Simon &AMP; Schuster about a group he calls ``the president's
enemies,'' foremost among them prosecutor Ken Starr. The Louisianan
whose sobriquet is ``the Ragin' Cajun'' has chosen a tentative
title: ``... And the Horse You Rode In On.'' That title is intended
to strike a note of defiance. As Thomas Bowdler might expurgate it,
``Be off with you and, for emphasis, take with you whatever brought
you to this point.'' As the ellipsis indicates, the obscene
beginning of the line is cut: The missing words can be any of a
variety of contemptuous imprecations, none of which are suitable
for book titles or family newspapers. But because the concluding
trope is so widely known _ and its origin such a mystery to
students of English as a foreign language _ the burden of
explication falls to the linguistic mavenim.
</P>
<P>
   The country-music songwriters D. Rock, C. Blake and B. Fischer
titled their 1989 ditty ``You and the Horse (You Rode In On).'' A
year later, the group called Soul Asylum used the phrase as an
album title, and a variant was the title of a 1993 mystery novel by
Martha Grimes. A 1992 self-help paperback by Bill Wear used it in a
subtitle: ``Recovering From Divorce: And the Horse You Rode In
On,'' presumably expressing the confrontational attitude of an
offended former spouse.
</P>
<P>
   The first use in fictional dialogue that I can find is in George
V. Higgins' 1972 classic hard-boiled novel, ``The Friends of Eddie
Coyle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard it when I was driving a truck for Coca-Cola,''
recalls Higgins, whose most recent novel is ``A Change of
Gravity.'' ``It must have been about the summer of 1960.'' The late
'50s appears to be the time of the phrase's genesis; Michael
Seidman, editor of Charles Durden's 1976 ``No Bugles, No Drums,''
another novel using the entire line, remembers the insult he heard
growing up in the Bronx in that post-Korean War era: ``... and the
white horse you rode in on and all your relatives in Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   The key word is  &UR; in &LR; . ``The horse he rode on,'' without the
necessary  &UR; in &LR;  to conjure the image of a scene, is an ordinary
phrase that can be found in use as far back as Shakespeare. (``Some
hilding fellow, that had stolen the horse he rode on,'' with
 &UR; hilding &LR;  meaning ``bent downward, twisted waywardly aside.'') But
 &UR; rode in on &LR;  suggests a startling entrance.
</P>
<P>
   A clue to the term's origin is immortalized in the halls of the
Treasury Department in Washington. In the background of the oil
painting that hangs as the official portrait of Donald Regan, who
served as secretary of the Treasury in the Reagan administration,
can be found a book titled ``And the Horse You Rode In On.'' No
other book title is visible. In their 1987 book, ``Showdown at
Gucci Gulch,'' Jeffrey H. Birnbaum and Alan S. Murray, then
reporters for The Wall Street Journal, note that it was not a real
book title but rather a favorite saying of Regan's. He attributed
it to his friend, John ``Buck'' Chapoton, who claimed he heard the
phrase appended to its obscene imperative during a poker game in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This is an example of a vestigial metaphor. It occurs in such
phrases as ``my turn in the barrel'' or ``where were you when,
etc.'' The jokes or anecdotes are deservedly forgotten, but the
punch lines, or portions of them, live on. In this case, though the
sentiment is not as elegantly expressed as in Churchill's
alliterative ``in defeat, defiance,'' the intensifying message
stands tall in the linguistic saddle.

EXPLORING THE LAST YEARS OF THE CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While he was writing ``Gods and Generals,'' Jeff Shaara stayed
away from his father's novel, ``The Killer Angels,'' so he wouldn't
be tempted to steal the rhythms of that book. ``Still, my sister
said `Gods and Generals' was being written by the ghost of our
father,'' Shaara said.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of Shaara's latest book, ``The Last Full
Measure'' (Ballantine Books. New York. 560 pages. $25.95.) While
``Gods and Generals'' describes the years leading up to Gettysburg
and ``Killer Angels'' deals with the three days of the battle,
``The Last Full Measure'' takes the war across its last two years,
to the surrender at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Full Measure'' offers two of the same voices heard in
``Gods and Generals'' and ``The Killer Angels'' _ Joshua
Chamberlain of the 20th Maine and Confederate commander Robert E.
Lee. It adds the voice of Ulysses S. Grant, taking the place of
Southern generals Stonewall Jackson, who died after
Chancellorsville, and James Longstreet, wounded in the Wilderness.
But the most important voice in the book is Shaara's, brought from
father to son.
</P>
<P>
   Lee sounds the same as he did under the pen of Michael Shaara
(``There is no time''), trusting to the Lord and the rightness of a
cause gone wrong. There's also a straight line through Chamberlain,
from ``Gods and Generals'' to ``The Last Full Measure,'' as he
grows with each passing battle to the final surrender of arms at
Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   But the voice of Grant is not as certain. Jeff Shaara can't
quite deal with all the layers of the man _ a butcher who sends
7,000 men to be cut down at Cold Harbor, whose muddled plan for the
Crater leads to more wasted lives, who loses almost half his army
on the killing floor before finally cornering Lee across the James
River. Grant comes through most forcefully in his defense of
all-out war _ ``There is only one way to make war, Colonel. You
have to hurt somebody. Maybe you have to hurt everybody ... If we
fight, men will die. If more of them die, then we will win. It has
nothing to do with cities, or government, or what is barbaric and
what is civilized.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy would find its way to Verdun, to Stalingrad, to
the massed attacks below the Yalu, putting the lie to Shaara's
argument that something was learned from the wholesale slaughter of
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Killer Angels'' was able to do justice to Gettysburg's
three days. But ``The Last Full Measure'' is crippled by the width
and breadth of a war winding down. Jeff Shaara can spend time in
the Wilderness, at the Crater and a few battles around Petersburg,
but he has to pass over the storied assault on Missionary Ridge,
the Battle of Franklin, Sherman's march and a dozen other landmarks
of the last months of the war.
</P>
<P>
   He does more than justice to the final scenes, though, as Grant
and Lee meet at Appomattox to call an end to their war. Shaara
packs emotion into Grant's exchange with Lee, into his order to
silence Union celebrations _ ``They do not need to be told they are
beaten, they do not need us to tell them we have won. He began to
move, and the men were quiet now. There were still a few cheers, a
few hats waving, but around him men were watching Grant move past,
and they began to absorb what was in his face, began to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to name the best compliment to his writing, Shaara pointed
to a review from the Nashville Banner (which recently ceased
publication) that called ``Gods and Generals'' ... ``a work of
which Jeff's father would have been proud. It did something `The
Killer Angels' did not; it made me cry.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of ``The Last Full Measure.''

   Although the violence has subsided in Indonesia, the political
and economic situation remains unsettled, and the State Department,
in a June 11 public announcement, advises Americans to avoid crowds
and areas where violence has been reported. The announcement
replaced a June 3 travel warning urging Americans to defer
non-essential travel to the country.
</P>
<P>
   While Jakarta, Indonesia's capital and the site of most
demonstrations against former President Suharto _ who resigned May
21 _ is not included on most group-tour itineraries, many tour
companies are rescheduling or canceling their tours to other
sections of the country. For example, Volcano Tours canceled its
Indonesian trips scheduled for June and August, with full refunds.
Overseas Adventure Travel also canceled its trips to Indonesia for
the rest of the year, with a full refund plus $200 toward any other
trip during 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Bali has not experienced violence, although there have been some
demonstrations on the island. Spice Island Cruises, which offers
trips that originate in Bali and then travel to remote islands, has
not had any cancellations or drop in bookings, according to Jill
Potash, a spokeswoman, and sees no reason not to conduct business
as usual, far removed from the disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   Journeys Off the Tourist Track in Fairfax, Calif., canceled one
trip to Bali for June, but still plans to take two groups there in
August. Travelers booked on a trip to Indonesia through Asia
Transpacific Journeys in Boulder, Colo., have been given the option
to reschedule. One tour set to depart the weekend after the
disturbances in Jakarta was canceled, and refunds were offered.
Since then, the company reports almost no cancellations, but its
bookings to Indonesia have been lower than usual this year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   Updated information on Indonesia is available from the U.S.
Embassy in Jakarta, www.usembassyjakarta.org. Call (202) 647-5225

<P>
   If your luggage was lost on a Delta Air Lines flight _
``delayed'' is Delta's euphemism _ there is now something to do
other than call an 800 number and listen to recorded messages. The
airline has added a feature to its Web site that allows a traveler
to learn the status of the bag search. But it can be tracked on the
Web only after a passenger arriving at an airport reports the bag
missing, describes it and its contents and receives an
identification code for what Delta calls a property-irregularity
report.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, www.delta-air.com/baggage, passengers enter

   The designers at Disneyland have seen the future, and it is
digestible. After a year of work, renovations to Tomorrowland _ one
of eight themed areas at the Anaheim, Calif., park _ were completed
last month. It now has new rides, attractions, decor _ even new
edible landscaping.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can ride rockets that orbit spinning brass planets,
watch a special-effects film called ``Honey, I Shrunk the
Audience'' in a theater featuring a floor that moves, and take part
in technology demonstrations. There is also a new maze of water
jets shooting from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The building facades have been updated with paint schemes
designed to evoke the ``futuristic'' visions of H.G. Wells.
Landscaping now consists of only edible vegetation, from orange
trees to herbs, as part of an effort throughout Tomorrowland to
make the future seem inviting rather than, in the words of
designers, alien and hostile as portrayed in movies.
</P>
<P>
   How inviting? When asked if park visitors could snack on the
landscaping, Bob Deuel, a Disneyland spokesman, said: ``We wouldn't
encourage it, but it would be safe to do. We don't use
pesticides.''
</P>
<P>
   Deuel pointed out, in fact, that some lettuce plants are
temptingly close to hamburger stands.

   Bungee jumping, hang gliding or tightrope walking from the top
of the 1,815-foot-high CN Tower to neighboring downtown Toronto
office buildings has become possible _ in visitor's minds, that is.
The aptly named Thrill Zone digital-animation attraction, at the
observation level near the top of the CN Tower, is part of an $18.4
million expansion and revitalization of the 22-year-old landmark.
For $12 visitors will also be able to have themselves digitally
photographed in such simulated daredevil poses as hanging by their
fingertips off the tower, with a 10-minute wait for the print. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the tower, other diversions include two new
five-minute rides in a flight simulator, a 144-seat theater showing
a new movie about Canada co-produced by IMAX and the National Film
Board of Canada, and arcade games, some of them of the virtual
reality variety.
</P>
<P>
   A package including the two rides, the movie and admission to
various observation levels costs $20, $17.50 for children
(admission to the Thrill Zone is free). New retail space with a
300-seat cafe, a duty-free shop (for international air passengers)
and a shop featuring Inuit art opened this month. Information:
(416) 868-6937.
</P>
<P>
   New this year among the crop of rail passes in Europe is the
Balkan Flexipass, offering unlimited first-class train travel in
Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia and
Turkey. Three durations are available: 5, 10 or 15 days within a
single month at fares ranging from $152 to $317. For people younger
than 26, the range is $90 to $190. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also available to travelers headed for Greece are two packages
that combine either rail and air travel or rail, rental car and air
travel within the country. Greek Flexipass Rail and Fly provides
first-class train travel on any three days plus two air journeys in
Greece in a single month at a cost of $202. Holders of that pass
can fly to any Greek island served by Olympic Airways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With Greek Flexipass Fly Rail and Drive, the visitor gets three
days of first-class rail, two air trips in Greece and two days in a
minimum-category rental car starting at $278. The travel must be
used within a month. Larger cars and additional days are available
at extra cost.

   The fascination with things Titanic continues this summer and
fall with two exhibits, one devoted to the movie and the other to
the ship itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic, the Movie on Tour,'' a 15,000-square-foot show of
film memorabilia, will travel to several Paramount theme parks in
North America. It features the 44-foot model of the ship used in
filming, sets such as Rose's stateroom, and behind-the-scenes
footage documenting the making of the movie. More than 150 props
and costumes include the ``Heart of the Ocean'' necklace.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition will go to Kings Island in Cincinnati, July 3 to
19; Canada's Wonderland in Toronto, July 29 to Aug. 12; Kings
Dominion in Richmond, Aug. 22 to Sept. 7; and Carowinds in
Charlotte, N.C., Sept. 19 to Oct. 31 (weekends only). The exhibit
is free with admission to the theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, ``Titanic _ the Artifact Exhibition'' will present
more than 300 artifacts recovered from the vessel between 1987 and
1994, including the bronze cherub from the ship's grand staircase,
a gilt chandelier, an unopened bottle of Champagne and delicate
paper items such as a stock certificate and personal letters (found
in a passenger's luggage). Displays will illustrate the stories
behind the artifacts and the technology used to explore the ship's
resting place at the bottom of the North Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   The show runs from July 1 to Nov. 1 in a 30,000-square-foot
temporary structure at 164 Northern Avenue, adjacent to the World
Trade Center Boston, which organized the show. Tickets are $13.95,
$12.95 seniors, $6.95 ages 5 to 12, free under 5. Information:

NEW CIVIL WAR BOOK SPROUTS FROM A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This would've been in 1964, when Jeff Shaara was 12 years old,
his father, 35.
</P>
<P>
   They stood on Cemetery Ridge, at the spot where General Lew
Armistead collapsed after leading his men over the low wall, life
leaving him as he watched the last of his soldiers stop and scatter
and fall back down the hill _ as good a parable for the death of
the Confederacy as there would ever be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid, you know, I had my rubber sword and musket from
the gift shop, I wasn't even sure where I was,'' Shaara said. ``But
my father ... he was absolutely consumed by it. He had no idea,
when he was walking through the battlefield, that it would change
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I can tell you the moment, the exact moment. We were
standing at the high-water mark, next to the Armistead monument, me
with my little musket, and he started to tell me what happened.
He's looking back, at the ground they came over, at the place where
they died, and while he's talking he starts getting emotional. His
voice ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara stopped, looked up, and said, ``I'd never seen my father
emotional. Ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara's father, Michael, would go on to write what is
considered the best novel about the Civil War, ``The Killer
Angels,'' which won the Pulitzer Prize after its publication in
1974. Michael Shaara, who died of heart disease in 1988 at the age
of 59, never saw his novel become a popular success. But his son
has seen ``The Killer Angels'' reach its 79th printing and has
followed in the wake of his father's words, writing the
best-selling Civil War novel ``Gods and Generals'' and ``The Last
Full Measure,'' just out from Ballantine Books (512 pages, $25.95
hardcover).
</P>
<P>
   During a recent reading of ``The Last Full Measure'' in San
Francisco, Shaara told the audience, ``I have no illusions. If not
for heart disease, if not for my father's untimely death, he would
have written these books. I would not be standing here.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his death, Michael Shaara was able to hand down his
passion for the Civil War to his son, who graduated from Florida
State with a degree in criminology and went on to deal in rare
coins before writing ``Gods and Generals.'' The novel follows
officers and men through the battles before the three days of
Gettysburg _ the storm at the heart of ``The Killer Angels,'' and
the beginning of the end of war ``by the rules'' of standing
stock-straight through a hail of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the war they called Robert E. Lee `Granny' Lee,
because he wanted to put fortifications in front of Richmond,
because he wanted to dig in for defense,'' Shaara said. ``After
Gettysburg, you couldn't get enough shovels.''
</P>
<P>
   To Shaara, ``The Killer Angels'' is part of a trilogy, started
by ``Gods and Generals,'' completed by ``The Last Full Measure'' _
a novel of the war after Gettysburg, seen through the eyes of Lee,
Joshua Chamberlain and Ulysses S. Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a history book. I am not a historian,'' Shaara
said. ``This is the story of people, real people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara smiled a little, saying, ``My father used to say that
during the writing of `The Killer Angels,' he was visited by every
character in the book. Not `ghost' visits, just ... a sense of
being with them.'' He's felt the same thing, said Shaara, standing
inside the house in which Stonewall Jackson died.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit to Fredericksburg, Va., for the writing of ``Gods and
Generals,'' Shaara found that the town has overgrown the
battlefield. ``If you want to stand where Lee stood at the top of
the hill,'' he said, ``you're in somebody's back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few miles south, Shaara spotted a sign reading,
``Stonewall Jackson Shrine,'' which led to a small, two-story house
watched over by a single park ranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me what happened there and then let me be,'' Shaara
said. ``The bed was the same, the blanket on the bed, the clock in
the room was the same, as the day Jackson died.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't hard to imagine that when the rasping of his breath
stopped _ he died of pneumonia, not from the wound _ every head
turned toward the ticking of that clock. Without trying to make it
sound too melodramatic, I stood there, listening to the ticking of
the clock, the same clock that had been in the room with Jackson,
and it changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara plunged into writing ``Gods and Generals,'' which hit the
best-seller charts within weeks of being published. ``The Killer
Angels,'' despite its critical success, despite the Pulitzer Prize,
did not make it to the best-seller list until the first week of
October 1993 _ the week the film based on the novel,
``Gettysburg,'' made its debut.
</P>
<P>
   His father had written four novels and more than 70 short
stories, Shaara said, ``but he was not, in his mind, a success.
`The Killer Angels' was turned down by 15 publishers before it was
finally printed ... when I was growing up, my memories are of all
the rejection letters, my mother trying to hide them so he didn't
see them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote other pieces, magazine pieces, at a penny a word,''
Shaara said with a quick smile. ``I know, because as a boy I had to
count them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally when you win a Pulitzer Prize, the doors open up. Not
for him. In 1975, the end of the Vietnam War, absolutely nobody
wanted to read a book about war. The critics were like, `How can
this man dare write a book glorifying generals?' They called it a
`cult' book.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after ``Killer Angels,'' started to sell, Shaara's father
had to run the historical gauntlet. ``He'd catch hell in the North
for being sympathetic to Lee, catch hell in the South for his
positive portrayal of Longstreet, which you just did not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've also had people get in my face, saying, `That war was
about slavery.' And I say, `You're telling me a lumberjack from
Vermont is fighting the war because of slavery? What does he know
or care about slavery?' ... It was never that simplistic, but it's
one of those things they teach kids in the fifth grade, so they can
pass a test.''
</P>
<P>
   There had to be more to it, to explain the slaughter on both
sides, Shaara said. ``Why would these guys keep marching into the
guns, year after year, when their wives are writing to them,
saying, `Enough already. The farm needs you. The kids need you.'
These men, most of them, wrote back to say, `This is for honor, for
my honor.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason the Civil War still holds its spell half a dozen
generations later, Shaara said, is ``because they are us. Some of
us have ancestors from the war, but that's the easy answer. It's
because we can relate to these people as humans. They are us. This
is who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Northerners and Southerners fought for ``the power of an idea,''
he said _ fought to protect the same Constitution handed down from
generation to generation, war to war, through the worst and best of
this country's history.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who won't accept that, Shaara said, or accept
the concept of a historical novel. ``I've had people say, `How dare
you put words in the mouth of Robert E. Lee?' So I said to myself,
`OK, the only way you can do that is if you get to know the
characters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara did, and he liked what he saw, with some exceptions. ``My
father liked Longstreet ... he saw a lot of himself in Longstreet.
They were both brooding men, bothered by depression. I had a
problem _ I didn't find the same man my father did. He saw Lee
through the eyes of Longstreet. I saw it the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Phil Sheridan? Phil Sheridan was a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaara didn't see any of that when he was playing with inch-high
soldiers as a kid. ``I used to put the blue troops in the folds of
a blanket, call it the mountains, put the Confederates on the
floor, then roll marbles at 'em. Whoever was left standing, won.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Shaara grew to learn the complexities of the war and
the everyday demands of staying alive. He remembered his father
working on a definitive volume of Shakespeare as his life wore down
_ ``He would sit at the typewriter, 10 minutes would go by, and
he'd be done. He had his first heart attack at 36. I'm 46. I take
this seriously.''

A HEALTHY TOURIST THINKS AHEAD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever the destination, a prime requisite for maximum
enjoyment of travel is good health. And our precautions should
begin before leaving home.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because travel is so much a part of my life _ or maybe
through pure luck _ I rarely become ill on the road. And yet I
routinely pack a portable medicine chest crammed with Immodium,
Pepto-Bismol, Tylenol and Advil, insect repellent, sunscreen, cough
syrup, NyQuil, DayQuil and all sorts of other remedies that usually
go unopened.
</P>
<P>
   I take all the appropriate inoculations, too. (Ouch!)
</P>
<P>
   But during a travel editors' workshop this spring in San Diego,
I attended a seminar at which a past president of the International
Society of Travel Medicine made a recommendation I had never
considered:
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone traveling outside the United States should take along a
prescription antibiotic,'' said Dr. Jay Keystone of Toronto, a
specialist in tropical medicine and a consultant to several major
travel health organizations in the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CURE FOR MANY ILLS
</P>
<P>
   Keystone suggested that a physician familiar with an
individual's overall health history should be consulted to
prescribe an antibiotic for potential bowel, bladder, respiratory
or skin ailments.
</P>
<P>
   And the antibiotic should be used only if the traveler becomes
ill.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to a recent European vacation, I asked my doctor about
Keystone's recommendation. He seconded the notion and prescribed an
antibiotic to take if the co-pilot or I developed a respiratory
infection. As fate held, the co-pilot got sick and the antibiotic
likely helped avert a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
   Health concerns, much like safety, are topics many who make
their living in the travel industry prefer unaddressed. The
Caribbean beach resort wants us to imagine soft, white-powder sand,
not painful, beet-red sunburn. The company promoting tours of a
rain forest emphasizes lush, green foliage and romantic adventure,
not infectious mosquitoes feasting on our arms and legs. The
airline touts gourmet meals and service with a smile _ oops, that
was another era, wasn't it? _ not air recycling again and again in
crowded cabins.
</P>
<P>
   Keystone says some never learn an important lesson:
</P>
<P>
   ``A healthy traveler will travel again,'' he says. ``An
unhealthy traveler won't travel again. Neither will his family, his
neighbors or his friends.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TAKING PRECAUTIONS
</P>
<P>
   A main concern is travel to what Keystone terms ``the developing
world.'' Of 100,000 visitors to these areas, he says, ``50,000 will
develop a health problem; 8,000 will see a doctor; 1,100 will be
incapacitated in their work during or after their trip; 300 will be
hospitalized during or after the trip; 50 will be evacuated by air;
and one will die.''
</P>
<P>
   But without proper precautions, we court trouble even on a Texas
beach. ``By the year 2,000, one in 75 Americans will have malignant
melanoma, and that's a scary figure,'' says Keystone.
</P>
<P>
   Keystone has compiled what he labels ``Ten Commandments for
Tropical Travel,'' and most apply for any journey:
</P>
<P>
   1) Thou shalt consult with thy physician. Inquire about required
and recommended inoculations and other appropriate medications.
Immunize, Keystone suggests, ``according to risk, not according to
the country visited. Two people may go to Thailand; one may need
half-a-dozen immunizations and another hardly any. Joining the
Peace Corps creates a different set of circumstances than staying
in luxury hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Thou shalt acclimate thyself. Get adequate rest before
departure. To guard against jet lag, go to bed later and awaken
later in advance of a trip if traveling westbound; go to bed
earlier and awaken earlier if traveling eastbound. Ask a doctor
about light-exposure alteration procedures and about medications to
help combat jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   3) Thou shalt protect thyself against insects. Malaria has long
been a major concern, and dengue fever is an emerging problem.
Keystone says DEET is the most effective repellent. ``But there is
90 percent DEET and 20 percent DEET. What's the difference? The 20
percent DEET lasts about half the time (offering 4-6 hours
protection).''
</P>
<P>
   4) Thou shalt purify the water that thou drinkest including thy
cubes of ice. Remember that even in first-class hotels, no
guarantee of adequate water purification exists, says Keystone.
</P>
<P>
   5) Thou shalt cook well thy food and peel thine own fruit and
vegetables. ``Studies show that 98 percent of travelers make a
`faux pas' involving food within 48 hours of leaving home,'' says
Keystone. Avoid leftovers, raw shellfish, unpasteurized milk, food
from street vendors and cold meats in restaurants. ``Boil it, peel
it, cook it or forget it,'' says Keystone.
</P>
<P>
   6) Thou shalt carry self-treatment for travelers' diarrhea.
``Don't leave home without Immodium and an antibiotic,'' says
Keystone.
</P>
<P>
   7) Thou shalt take and wear thy prophylactics.
</P>
<P>
   8) Thou shalt swim not in fresh water nor walk in thy bare feet.
</P>
<P>
   9) Thou shalt be concerned about thy security.
</P>
<P>
   10) Thou shalt be wary of thy conveyance.
</P>
<P>
   Keystone emphasizes that ongoing research is producing new
medications to help combat each form of hepatitis, malaria and
other illnesses. Several Internet sites provide up-to-date
information. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention:
http://www.cdc.gov/travel/travel.html.
</P>
<P>
   2) International Society of Travel Medicine:

WHY JOHNNIE CAN'T BASEBRAWL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, June 24)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Psychologists say that violence in professional sports is worse
than ever and that some of it may be rubbing off on impressionable
youngsters who try to emulate their athletic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The bad role models include a basketball player who choked his
coach, a major league pitcher who intentionally drilled a batter in
the back and Olympic hockey players who trashed their hotel room
after a loss.
</P>
<P>
   As another Little League season draws to a close, my impression
is that many of youngsters still don't ``have what it takes'' to
make it in professional sports, at least in terms of acting like
raging, out-of-control, homicidal maniacs.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the parents if you will, but far too many youngsters
today treat sports as ``just a game'' rather than the life and
death struggle in which winning is everything, no matter what the
cost.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each game, players on both sides form a line and
shake hands, and then dash off in search of the mom who brought
soft drinks and snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the kids sit around afterward and swap baseball cards,
much like kids did when I was growing up, except that a pack of
baseball cards costs $5 today compared to a nickel back then.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of behavior that gets one promoted to the
professional ranks or gets one's name mentioned in the police
briefs of the local newspaper. If our children are going to achieve
the low standards of professional athletes, they need to start
working on their bad attitudes now.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, it would be nice if the pitcher did not cry when
he accidentally hits a batter in the leg.
</P>
<P>
   Major league pitchers do not cry when they hit someone, though
they may whimper a little bit if the batter comes after them with a
bat.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the subject of the baseball brawl, something
we've seen quite a bit of on TV lately, but which you seldom if
ever see in Little League.
</P>
<P>
   Few sights in professional sports are more inspiring than a
benches-clearing baseball melee where 50 grown men rush onto the
field in order to hug each other in as aggressive a manner as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   I have been watching Little League games for four years now and
I have yet to see a coach teach his players the subtle nuances of
the classic baseball brawl, which is a lot like ballroom dancing,
only with more spitting.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of spitting, I have also never seen a Little Leaguer
spit in the face of an umpire, even though such things happen from
time to time in the major leagues. One can only assume that we're
going to experience a severe shortage of accomplished
umpire-spitters in the near future if Little League coaches do not
stop wasting so much time on the hit-and-run, proper bunting
techniques and other silly stuff and devote more attention to this
valuable skill.
</P>
<P>
   Little Leaguers can also prepare themselves for the Big Time by
forgetting about all this ``team'' nonsense and concentrating on
themselves instead. For example, there is no need to show up for
practice if you've been out partying late the night before or get a
sudden urge to jet off to Las Vegas for a little gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson to be learned here is that if you have some talent,
just about any form of boorish, selfish, antisocial behavior is not
only acceptable, but will be richly rewarded with fat contracts,
product endorsements and maybe even a movie deal.
</P>
<P>
   America is a land of great opportunity for young athletes if
they just open their eyes and get with the program.

`REQUIEM' FOR A WAR, AN ERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: REPLACES previous with correct story)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The man walked over to Horst Faas, leaned across the table,
excused himself for interrupting, and started talking about an
argument between members of his fraternity over the Vietnam War.
``This was 1962,'' he said. ``Laguna Beach, California. I was a
hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   It was important to the man to convince Faas that he had changed
his mind, that he had come to see the human loss of the war. He
switched his wine glass from one hand to the other, blinking,
waiting for an acknowledgment of that change. Faas nodded, saying,
``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   For Faas, the scene has been repeated time and again over the
past few months _ with veterans, with former refugees, with sons
and daughters of those who fought, with hundreds of people who have
brushed up against the Vietnam War in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   Faas, who edited _ along with Tim Page _ the recently published
``Requiem,'' a book of photographs from Vietnam and Indochina taken
by men and women killed in action, shakes his head over the
response to ``Requiem,'' from city to city.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx chapter of veterans from the 173rd Airborne, coming up
to him to relive the war. A crewman in one of the Marine tanks
pictured in during Tet. People who knew the photographer or someone
in a photograph, or knew the countryside or the battle. People who
were there, just out of the frame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I did this I got questions like, `Why? Why stir up old
memories?''' Faas said. ``Then they see the book and say, `Oh. OK.
I understand.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Requiem'' features dozens of photos taken by French,
Vietnamese and American photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Faas, former head photographer for the Associated Press in
Vietnam, said ``Requiem'' came about when Page tried to find out
what happened to fellow photographers Sean Flynn and Dana Stone,
who disappeared while covering the spread of the Vietnam War to
Laos and Cambodia. That led to talks with the North Vietnamese, who
pointed Page to pictures taken by their own photographers during
the war, and Page carried the photos to Faas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I was seeing something nobody had seen before,''
Faas said. ``Some of these pictures had never been printed. Slowly,
photo by photo, we were digging material out of Vietnam that had
been forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Faas, 65, expanded the project to include the French defeat in
Indochina and the satellite wars in countries bordering Vietnam,
then took the package to Harry Evans of Random House. ``The
accountants told him, `Nobody wants to buy a Vietnam book.' ...
Their tastes are more for artsy-fartsy things, um? ... but he said,
`We're going to do this, and we're going to do it big.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since its publication, Faas has seen his book reviewed favorably
across the country, including two takes in the New York Times.
Photo exhibits have brought written responses that include ``I was
there; the photos depict the horror,'' ``This is the true Vietnam
memorial,'' and ``These pictures stand in stark contrast to the
absence of pictures from the Gulf war. The new media in that
conflict abdicated its responsibility to tell the harsh truth.''
</P>
<P>
   And at each exhibit, Faas has been approached by people with
their own memories, people wanting to talk. In San Francisco, he
was surprised by Jimmy Lo Hung, who took pictures for AP as a
12-year-old during the Tet offensive and now runs his own photo
shop.
</P>
<P>
   Hung had brought a picture of himself in a helmet with PRESS
across the front, and a laminated story headlined ``Boy, 12, in
Dangerous Jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid me $10 a picture,'' he said, ``and that was big
money in Vietnam. It could support my whole family for one month.''
</P>
<P>
   Hung lost all his pictures and negatives when the North
Vietnamese invaded the South. ``I only had a few minutes to
escape,'' he said, remembering that ``I was pulled aboard a
helicopter filled with soldiers. They held my leg while it took
off. So many soldiers trying to get on ... some didn't, some
dropped down.''
</P>
<P>
   Faas, sitting beside Hung, said, ``This kid, I didn't even know
he was alive. I'm happy, really happy, to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the book and the exhibits of ``Requiem'' seem to lead to
these kinds of reunions, Faas said, to a sharing of memories buried
for years. But that's what photojournalism can do, he said _ ``Give
you that one, uncompromising moment, that image that cannot change,
no matter what side you are on, win or lose.''
</P>
<P>
   History will make its own judgments on events like the Vietnam
War, Faas said. There will be other wars, just as cruel, despite
the stark cruelty shown in ``Requiem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A picture is taken not to change anything. It is taken to show
what is happening,'' Faas said. ``We are not there to change the
world. We are there to report the world.''

   Barcelona Festival
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you have information on a cultural festival to be held in
Barcelona this summer? _ Sam Betelio, Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. The city's summer arts festival, called the ``Grec,'' after
the Greek-style, 2,000-seat outdoor amphitheater on Montjuic
mountain, started in 1976. The initial season featured a few dozen
shows at the Grec Theater; this year's edition, Grec '98, offers
138 theatrical, dance and musical shows from June 25 to Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highlights are these: the National Ballet of Cuba will
perform ``Swan Lake'' from July 29 to Aug. 8 and ``Cinderella''
from Aug. 11 to 15 at the Tivoli Theater, 8 Caspe, at 10 p.m.
Tuesday to Friday and 6:30 and 10:30 p.m. on Saturday. Tickets are
$13 to $26. The Argentine dance company called the New Tango
Passion will present a revue featuring tango styles from the past
100 years, from Aug. 11 to 19 at the Grec Theater, 36 Paseo Santa
Madrona, at 10:30 p.m. Tickets cost $13 to $26. B.B. King will
perform on July 21 at 10 p.m. in the outdoor plaza of Pueblo
Espanol, 25 Avenida Marques de Comillas. Tickets cost $23. The
festival's most expensive ticket costs $40, for a concert by the
pianist Friedrich Gulda on July 11 at 10:30 p.m. at the Grec
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   More information is available at www.grecbcn.com. The festival

   Pearl Harbor Tours
</P>
<P>
   Q. My father-in-law was a Navy officer serving at Pearl Harbor
when it was bombed in 1941. My husband and I are planning a trip to
Hawaii in December and look forward to visiting the Arizona
Memorial. Are there any tours that would take us onto the naval
base at Pearl Harbor and Ford Island? We also understand the
Missouri will soon be on display at Pearl Harbor. _ Carroll Guitar,
Milton, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   A. Pearl Harbor Naval Base, the scene of the Japanese attack on
Dec. 7, 1941, that caused heavy losses to the United States fleet,
including the sinking of the battleship Arizona, is still an active
military installation. As a result, tours are limited and often
require reservations or special arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The only formal program for individual visitors is a free tour
of a Navy surface ship (the type of ship varies depending on what
is in dock). It is held the first Saturday of each month between
noon and 4 p.m. Visitors must go to the main gate for directions to
the designated ship (for safety reasons, children must be at least
8 years old).
</P>
<P>
   There is also a similar weekly program, typically held on
Wednesdays. Though this program is primarily for organized groups,
exceptions are sometimes made for individuals who have been given
advance notice.
</P>
<P>
   With your family ties to Pearl Harbor you have a chance of
getting a more extensive tour of the base, including Ford Island
and the Utah Memorial, which is dedicated to the training ship that
sank just offshore with 50 people aboard during the 1941 attack.
Permission to take such tours is granted by the Navy on a
case-by-case basis, with preference given to veterans. Information:
(808) 471-0281.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri, the battleship on which Japan formally surrendered
in 1945, will indeed be docked in Pearl Harbor as a memorial, and
is scheduled to enter the harbor this month. The ship will be
moored near the Arizona Memorial for at least three years until a
permanent location is prepared at Ford Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of the Missouri, (admission $12), are not scheduled to
begin until sometime in January. Information: (808) 545-2263.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tuscany Cooking Schools &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you know of any fall cooking classes in Tuscany that
involve spending a week or two in a villa or a small hotel? _
Shirley Lowell, Westbury, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cooking tours are popular throughout Italy, especially in the
spring and fall, and especially in Tuscany. ``Your Guide to 82
Decadent Cooking Holidays in Italy,'' a selective listing by
Margaret Cowan, a travel consultant, lists some 30 tours in the
region. The 1998 guide, published in Vancouver, British Columbia,
by Margaret Cowan, is among the most comprehensive available and
can be ordered by calling (604) 878-0318 or (800) 557-0370. It
costs $42.77, including shipping.
</P>
<P>
   A series of weeklong cooking classes focusing on traditional
Tuscan cuisine will be held at Villa Michaela in Vorno, just south
of Lucca. Dishes you might prepare include melanzane (eggplant)
alla parmigiana, risotto and grilled vegetables with gorgonzola.
The instructor and chef, Valter Roman, has been associated with
restaurants in Italy and Britain. Participants dine in a frescoed
dining room or in the garden. There will also be opportunities to
tour Lucca, Florence, the Etruscan town of Volterra and Vorno. The
19th-century Villa Michaela, surrounded by 50 acres of olive trees,
gardens and pine forests, has nine guest rooms in the main house
and three in the coach house. All have private bathrooms. There are
tennis courts and a swimming pool on the property. This fall's
classes are scheduled to begin Oct. 10, 17, 24 and 31 and Nov. 7.
Prices begin at $2,295, double occupancy, excluding air fare. For
information, contact Cuisine International in Dallas: (214)
373-1161, fax (214) 373-1162.
</P>
<P>
   The medieval hamlet of Villa a Sesta, about 20 miles east of
Siena, is the site of another series of weeklong classes and
excursions, offered by the husband and wife team of Helene
Stoquelet and Franco Camelia, owners of Bottega del 30, one of two
restaurants in the village. Dishes you might prepare include
ravioli with pigeon filling and pine nut sauce, rabbit stuffed with
bread and prunes and timbale of grilled eggplant. Accommodations
are in private apartments with separate sitting rooms. Classes are
held in a separate building, which also houses Camelia's wine
cellar and gastronomic library. Excursions to wine cellars and
castles in the surrounding area will also be offered. The classes
begin on Sept. 26, Oct. 3, 17 and 24, and the cost is $2,575 a
person, double occupancy. Information: The International Kitchen in
Chicago, (800) 945-8606, fax (312) 654-8446.

WALKING TOURS RUN OUT FAST  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If here at the brink of July you are still only dreaming about a
bracing stroll in Tuscany, Ireland or perhaps Provence, it is time
and possibly past time to act. Some companies report a doubling of
demand for walking tours, both circular walks going out from one
inn, and from inn to inn. The popularity of walking as a way to see
the countryside is linked to the rise of ``soft adventure,''
walking's health benefit and the attraction of making friends on
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   A few openings still exist on various companies' walking tours
for summer and fall, and if you are lucky, you may find just what
you want. Here is a glimpse at some offerings from established
companies whose officials say there are still spaces.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Smithsonian Study Tours &LR;  has a  &UR;  &LR; new catalog with three walking
tours with openings this fall: the Cotswolds, Provence and Tuscany.
Tuscan Countryside, with 10 nights in a Siena pension and generally
rugged city walks in daytime, is scheduled for Oct. 1 to 12. The
catalog says the program involves a great amount of walking, often
up fairly steep hills. The cost, with air fare from New York and
departure taxes, is $3,959 for one of two people in a room. All
breakfasts, two lunches and eight dinners are included.
</P>
<P>
   The Walks in the Autumn Sun tour in Provence involves pretty
rugged country walks, up to eight miles a day, sometimes with
elevation gains of 800 feet. The departure date is Oct. 1, with
nine nights in a hotel in St.-Remy-de-Provence near Avignon.
``Associates will need to be in good health and able to walk five
to eight miles a day over undulating, rocky terrain, frequently
with steep inclines and descents,'' the catalog says. The cost,
with air fare from Washington, is $4,595 for one of two people in a
room. Continental breakfasts, four lunches and five dinners are
included.
</P>
<P>
   The longest walk on the Cotswolds trip, Sept. 3 to 12, is 7.5
miles. The eight nights are spent in Chipping Camden, and this is
easier over all than the two on the Continent. The cost for one of
two in a room, air fare from New York included, is $4,115.
Smithsonian Study Tours, 1100 Jefferson Drive, S.W., Washington,
D.C. 20560; (202) 357-4700; on the Web: www.si.edu/tsa/sst.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; British Coastal Trails,  &LR; a walking-tour company in Carlsbad,
Calif., warns that it is hard to book any trip closer than 30 days
off, but it has space on several later trips (the company's usual
limit is 18 participants). A Week in Provence, actually six nights
starting Sept. 26, is listed as a moderate level of walking, with
undulating terrain, some steep ascents and dirt paths. The first
night is spent in a hotel in Aix-en-Provence, with three nights at
a farmhouse hotel near Lourmarin and two nights in
Vaison-la-Romaine. Prices do not include air travel, although the
company can arrange it. The Provence price is $1,895 for one of two
people in a room, with breakfast and dinner daily.
</P>
<P>
   A slightly tougher walk _ 4 on the company's 1-to-5 scale of
difficulty _ follows the Amalfi Coast, where winding footpaths
along craggy trails connect seaport towns. This seven-night trip
has openings on Sept. 5 and Oct. 10 departures. Three nights are
spent in Sorrento, two on the Isle of Capri and two in Ravello. A
walk up Vesuvius and in the up-and-down town of Positano are
included. The price is $2,185 for one of two people in a room, with
two meals daily; air fare is not included.
</P>
<P>
   This company also has openings for western Ireland walks, 11
nights, with departures Aug. 1 and Sept. 5; without air fare, it's
$2,795 for one of two people in a room. British Coastal Trails
Scenic Walking, 703 Palomar Airport Road, Suite 200, Carlsbad,
Calif. 92009; (800) 473-1210; on the Web: www.bctwalk.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Wayfarers,  &LR; a British company with offices in Newport,
R.I., has openings on its Dordogne six-night walking trip leaving
Sept. 27. This company, founded in 1984, does only walking trips
(limited to 16 participants), and these are generally more focused
and demanding than those provided by general tour companies. The
village-to-village walks average 10 to 12 miles a day, with mostly
family inns and hotels used. The towns visited are
Sarlat-la-Caneda, Vitrac, Belves, St.-Cyprien and Bordeaux. The
cost, with all meals but no air fare, is $1,880 for one of two
people in a room. There are also openings for Provence, the Loire
Valley and Burgundy; 12 departures on two Italian walks have sold
out. The Wayfarers, 172 Bellevue Avenue, Newport, R.I. 02840; (800)
249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Alternative Travel Group &LR; , an organization in Oxford, England,
has openings this fall. It offers walking trips for groups of 16 in
Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   These are not cream-puff trips: the most vigorous, Path to Rome,
covers 175 miles; the shortest is Renaissance Tuscany, 45 miles in
seven days, with days of varying difficulty. This Tuscany trip has
openings Oct. 24 to 31. The price of $2,730 includes all meals,
wine and accommodations, but not air fare. This trip is also
offered Dec. 20 to 27.
</P>
<P>
   A Sicily walk, from Enna in the mountains to Cefalu on the
coast, has openings for Sept. 12 to 19. This cost is $1,890, again
with meals, wine and accommodations, but no air fare. Alternative
Travel Group, 69-71 Banbury Road, Oxford, England OX2 6PE. The
company has a United States toll-free number, (800) 527-5997, in
addition to its British number, (44-1865) 315665. It closes at 5
p.m., and the time is five hours ahead of Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Overseas Adventure Travel,  &LR; a division of Grand Circle in
Boston, serves travelers over 50. It began walking tours only last
year, and is moving into the field cautiously. It has just added to
this year's schedule a pretty easy 12-night walking trip in the
west and south of Ireland. Three departures are available: Aug. 20,
Sept. 3 and Sept. 24. The limit is 16 participants. This trip is
listed as moderate, the middle of the company's three levels. There
is walking on eight days, and the longest walk is seven miles. The
nights are spent in small hotels or guesthouses with private baths:
four nights in Cork, four in Killarney and four in Limerick. The
prices, with air fare from New York or Boston, are $3,190 for Aug.
20, $3,090 for Sept. 3 and $2,990 for Sept. 24; these are for
anyone willing to share a room with another partipant. Twenty-eight
meals are included. Overseas Adventure Travel, 625 Mount Auburn
St., Cambridge, Mass. 02138; (800) 955-1925.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Country Walkers  &LR; in Waterbury, Vt., was created in 1990 by Bob
and Cindy Maynard, who earlier operated Vermont Country Cyclers and
sold it. The company's Valleys of Central Vermont, six days of
walking and a half-day of horseback riding, has openings through
September and October; five nights in inns in Stowe and Waitsfield
and all meals, but not air fare, will cost $1,425 for one of two
people in a room.
</P>
<P>
   King Arthur's Cornwall, a six-night coastal walking tour in
Penzance, Land's End, Mousehole and St. Ives, has openings on July
19 and Aug. 16 departures. The average walk, Maynard says, is six
to eight miles a day, but there are shorter options. The cost,
without air fare, is $2,050 for one of two in a room; it includes
all breakfasts and all but one dinner. Country Walkers, Post Office
Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676; (800) 464-9255; Web site:

STOCKS SHOW THEIR LONG-TERM STAMINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: It's impossible to say where the stock market is going
in its currently pixilated state, but investors can at least take
heart from the long view.
</P>
<P>
   As a study updated recently for Market Logic shows, stocks
outperformed other investments spectacularly from 1871 through the
end of last year. According to the investment newsletter, stocks
provided a 33,770-fold total return. Put another way, $1 invested
in broadly diversified portfolio of U.S. stocks 127 years ago would
have increased in real value to $33,770 by the end of 1997. More
impressively, this is after adjustment for the loss of purchasing
power because of inflation, which caused the general price level to
increase 13 times during the 1871-1997 period.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a dollar invested in Treasury bills would have grown
to only $9.88, and a dollar invested in gold would have declined in
value to only 57 cents after adjusting for storage costs and
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers chose 1871 as the benchmark year because that
was the first year for which a reliable method was available to
measure the total return of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the performance of this theoretical investment in
stocks all the more noteworthy is the dramatic rebounds from
crashes that were required for it to happen. From 1929 to 1932, for
instance, stocks lost 81 percent of their value using the Market
Logic calculation.
</P>
<P>
   While the newsletter doesn't get into the 1930-54 period of
stagnation by the Dow Jones industrial average, the Money Logic
measure does show a remarkable difference in performance between
the small number of Dow Jones industrial average stocks and the
broad universe used for its study. While the Dow Jones industrial
average went nowhere during the quarter century after the Great
Crash, the Market Logic table shows its measure of stock prices
swelling by a 16-fold total return during that period.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, on the other hand, peaked at
381 in September 1929, and didn't return to that level until late
1954. It closed that year at 404, which was only about half that in
terms of real value after adjusting for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the stock market reversals during the 1969-74 period,
for which Market Logic shows a 71 percent decline after adjusting
for inflation, the market began its most spectacular sustained
ascent in history. When the Dow Jones industrial average hit its
all-time high last month, it was up 22-fold from the 1974 low,
without any inflation adjustment. Meanwhile, the Market Logic
measure was 15-fold higher after adjusting for purchasing power
lost to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   While the study confirms the perception that T-bills are an
ultra-safe but minimally rewarding haven for investors, the shocker
is how it debunks gold as a refuge for those concerned about
inflation. Conventional wisdom has always assigned gold the role as
a store of value that would protect consumers and investors against
the ravages of rising price levels. Even at gold's peak price of
nearly two decades ago, it only outperformed stocks momentarily on
the long continuum of 127 years. Then it fell back to Earth with a
resounding thud.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market continues to slide, this discussion probably
isn't much solace for those whose paper profits are shrinking.
Looking on the bright side, however, keep in mind that if you live
long enough, your fortunes are likely to turn out even better than
you ever imagined in your wildest dreams.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Fast-forward, now, into the imaginary future.
</P>
<P>
   The state's high court has long ago ruled that boats in puddles
are not to be confused with boats upon rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The voters, contrary creatures, have refused to rewrite the law
to suit the gambling industry.
</P>
<P>
   And the casino operators _ with appeals exhausted and no
politicians left to buy _ have packed up and traveled on to mulct
the populace of some other municipality.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind are several grotesque edifices which, like the
Hoover Dam or the pyramids of Giza, are visible from space. By any
reasonable standard, they are among the most unsightly
constructions ever erected by the hand of man.
</P>
<P>
   Now a mournful wind keens through the spokes of the false paddle
wheels and eddies around the flaking pink heads of the gigantic
flamingos that tower over the valley of the river.
</P>
<P>
   The asphalt acreages of the parking lots have been turned into
vast open-air flea markets like those seen on the outskirts of
cities in Russia, where commerce in counterfeit icons and antique
samovars has replaced the real economy.
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned structures themselves are occupied by the
homeless, who break up the furnishings for sticks to fuel their
fires and defend themselves from the creeping things that inhabit
any neglected place.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the city, weaned from the teat of the gaming industry,
has sunk into a lamentable state. The treasury is empty. Public
services are a memory.
</P>
<P>
   There no longer is any hope of patching potholes, collecting
trash, putting down insurrections, holding parades or treating the
water supply. Angry gangs prowl the street, demanding to know why
we have sunk to 227th place in the ranking of most-livable cities.
</P>
<P>
   In this hour of distress, a little clutch of community leaders
has assembled on the bluff above the river.
</P>
<P>
   Spread below them is a dreadful panorama _ those enormous
cartoon boat-buildings, unsuitable for any known use, each one
surrounded by its murky pond.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders stare down sadly at the ruin of their hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's to be done?'' groans one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tear them down,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're huge, and there's no money for it. We'd have to
close the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Close them then! Life is choices.''
</P>
<P>
   They are agreed. Whatever the cost, every reminder of the bad
dream must somehow be erased.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the moats?'' someone else asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fill them in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How? Our machines are all broken. The city workers haven't
been paid in weeks. We're insoluble.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Insolvent,'' someone corrects him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   A profound silence comes over the group _ the silence of
bottomless, soul-searing despair. The light of civilization, at
this bend of the river, is about to flicker out.
</P>
<P>
   The late sun reflects from the moats strung out one after
another along the valley, and turns their surfaces to copper.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at those pools, one of the city fathers experiences a
sudden epiphany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have it!'' he cries out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish! We'll start a catfish farm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Catfish!'' shout the others. ``Merciful providence, YES!
Catfish!''
</P>
<P>
   From the whoop of joy they send up, you'd almost think they've
drawn a fourth ace.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard work, raising catfish, and not nearly as glamorous as
gambling parlors. But it's a way back, and a more dependable
enterprise than blackjack or roulette.
</P>
<P>
   So, almost by a whisker you might say, the city is delivered
from ruin after all.

   940&AMP;ADD  UNINFORMED SCHOOLS NOT LIABLE
FOR TEACHER SEX HARASSMENT, COURT SAYS
 &HT;     Not for Austin.
 &HT;     By CHRISTI HARLAN 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former Texas high school student, whose teacher
drew her into a sexual affair, cannot collect damages from the
school district because none of the teacher's supervisors knew
about the sexual harassment, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 ruling gives all school districts new protection from
harassment claims by students. Harassment victims will now have to
show that they complained to a supervisor with authority to punish
the harasser and that the supervisor refused to take action after
receiving the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   School officials hailed the decision as insurance against the
actions of renegade teachers whose conduct cannot be predicted or
controlled by officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court properly refused to hold school districts
liable for the concealed criminal conduct of abusive employees,''
said Wallace B. Jefferson, a San Antonio lawyer who represented the
Lago Vista school district near Austin, Texas, which was sued in
this case. ``Most school districts would be financially devastated
by jury verdicts holding them liable for sexual harassment which
they could not have prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was denounced by women's groups and the ex-student's
lawyer as a setback for the most vulnerable of harassment victims _
underage students for whom teachers are among the most trusted
authority figures.
</P>
<P>
   The decision ``will allow school districts to cultivate
ignorance of their teachers' wrongdoing and then to assert that
ignorance as a complete defense to any litigation,'' said the
ex-student's lawyer, Terry Weldon of Austin.``This unfairly places
all the burden on students who are, in most cases, immature and
emotionally vulnerable to teachers who exploit their position of
trust and power.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing the majority opinion,
acknowledged that ``harassment unfortunately is an all-too-common
aspect of the educational experience. No one questions that a
student suffers extraordinary harm when subjected to sexual
harassment and abuse by a teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue in this case, however, is whether the independent
misconduct of a teacher is attributable to the school district that
employs him,'' O'Connor wrote. The majority ruled that the district
is not liable unless a district official refused to act on a
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Four justices, led by Justice John Paul Stevens, said the
majority decision ``ranks protection of the school district's purse
above the protection of immature high school students.''
</P>
<P>
   The majority, Stevens said, ignored the intent of federal
anti-discrimination law ``to induce school boards to adopt and
enforce practices that will minimize the danger that vulnerable
students will be exposed to such odious behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule that the Court has crafted (with Monday's decision)
creates the opposite incentive,'' Stevens wrote. ``Indeed, the rule
that the Court adopts would preclude a damages remedy even if every
teacher at the school knew about the harassment but did not have
`authority to institute corrective measures on the district's
behalf.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Weldon said the Supreme Court's ruling ``amounts to the
closing of the courthouse door'' for a case that began in 1992,
when Lago Vista high-school teacher Frank Waldrop initiated an
affair with student Alida Star Gebser, who was then 14. (The Cox
News Service does not typically name victims of sexual crimes, but
Gebser's attorney said she gave permission to have her name used in
the Supreme Court case and in news reports.) Gebser, now a student
at the University of Texas, was not granting interviews on Weldon's
advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had prepared her for bad news,'' he said. ``She was
disappointed but not embittered. She's a survivor kind of kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebser told no one of her affair with Waldrop until after the
two were caught by Lago Vista police in a park in January 1993.
Waldrop was arrested, quit his teaching job and later pleaded
guilty to sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Gebser later filed suit against the school district, seeking
damages for Waldrop's sexual harassment under Title IX of the
federal education code, which prohibits sexual discrimination by
schools that receive federal money. Courts have long considered
sexual harassment as a form of sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   The Lago Vista school district, with about 800 students in all
grades, receives federal money totaling less than $20,000 a year.
Part of the student's lawsuit alleged that the district had failed
to follow a section of Title IX that requires schools to establish
and distribute policies for complaints about sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The student's effort to hold the district liable for Waldrop's
conduct was rejected first by U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks of
Austin, then by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans. In an earlier case involving a teacher's molestation of a
second-grade student during class, the appeals court set the
standard for schools' liability for sexual harassment. In that
case, the student's parents had complained to another teacher, not
a supervisor, which was deemed insufficient by the appeals court.
The court threw out a $1.4 million damage award to the parents,
saying they should have told a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court adopted the 5th Circuit's reasoning in the
Lago Vista case, saying that school officials with power to act on
a sexual-harassment complaint must know of _ and reject _ the
complaint before a victim can pursue damages.
</P>
<P>
   The high court said Congress created a similar standard to
govern the cutoff of federal aid when a school is suspected of
practicing discrimination covered by Title IX. Officials must be
notified and given a chance to correct the conduct before aid is
ended, O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a general matter, it does not appear that Congress
contemplated unlimited recovery in damages against a funding
recipient where the recipient is unaware of discrimination in its
programs,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Lago Vista and other school districts had raised the possibility
of crippling damage awards _ which would have to be paid by
taxpayers _ in urging the court to rule as it did.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a common-sense decision,'' said Gwendolyn
Gregory, counsel to the National Association of School Boards. The
teacher's affair was ``a terrible thing to have happened, but to
have to pay out of the public coffers is not what Title IX was
designed for,'' Gregory said. ``Title IX was designed to stop
discrimination, not bankrupt school districts.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court said harassment victims could continue to use
state laws to pursue claims against school, but Texas ``doesn't
have any protection on the state level for girls and young women
who are sexually harassed in their schools,'' said Jeanne
Sommerfeld, president of the Texas chapter of the National
Organization for Women.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas NOW chapter plans to seek legislation that would
create a statute similar to Title IX in Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking Gov. (George W.) Bush and all candidates to
reject this ill-conceived policy and ensure that rights of students
in Texas rank higher than the purses of school districts,''
Sommerfeld said.

VOCATIONAL INDUSTRIAL CLUBS OF AMERICA MEETING IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Who will build the house your children will
someday buy? And who will fix the plumbing when it springs a leak?
</P>
<P>
   Those 21st century workers could very well be alumni of the
Vocational Industrial Clubs of America.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 members and associates of the quarter-million
strong job training and leadership organization convene in Kansas
City this week for its 34th annual conference and Skills USA
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   This is the event's fifth consecutive year at Bartle Hall.
National champions will be selected in 66 competitions, in skills
such as auto collision repair, carpentry, cosmetology, public
speaking, dental assisting, commercial photography and computer
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the olympics of everyday life. The public is invited to
watch the contests all day Thursday at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   Forty high school and post-secondary students from Missouri and
Kansas are among this year's national finalists, up from 23 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters and electricians union members are donating hundreds
of hours to help set up Bartle Hall. The city slashed Bartle's
rental rates by 30 percent, and most hotels offered discounts.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual who's who among Kansas City's top corporations makes
up a VICA advisory panel to help fund the games each year to the
tune of around $200,000 in grants.
</P>
<P>
   That's a sound investment. The VICA event draws a greater
percentage of adults than the FFA does, including 1,000 contest
judges, and those attending are projected to spend around $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   All told, Kansas City's convention industry attracts 14 million
visitors a year with a combined pocketbook effect of $2.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's local VICA contestants is Yesenia Felix, a
graduating senior this year from Kansas City's Metro Tech.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year-old is also VICA's 1998 Missouri champion in the
commercial sewing division. After college she hopes for a career in
the fashion design industry.
</P>
<P>
   Felix made her own prom dress this year _ and her younger
sister's. Her specialty, she said, is ``nice dresses, sun
dresses...girl stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got into it when I was little,'' she said. ``My mom always
made my clothes and my sister's clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   VICA has encouraged that childhood interest. ``Winning awards,''
she said, ``is good for my self-esteem.''
</P>
<P>
   A positive attitude and a solid work ethic are what VICA
emphasizes to its 239,000 members, said Thomas H. Holdsworth,
director of VICA's post-secondary programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to an American businessman, they will tell you
that is a significant concern,'' especially in today's tight labor
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses these days also are hiring more skilled workers than
ever before. Holdsworth cited a recent study by the U.S. Department
of Labor that found the number of professionals in the U.S. labor
force had remained unchanged since the 1950s, around 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But skilled and unskilled workers have changed demographic
places in those four decades. Skilled workers now fill more than 60
percent of all American jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that has not changed, however, is Americans'
unrelenting ``second-class citizen'' perception of those who work
mainly with their hands, Holdsworth said. And VICA is working hard
to change that perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earning power (of skilled jobs) is definitely there,'' he
said, and many trades pay $50,000 a year and more to experienced
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's lathe worker, for instance, must be computer-literate.
The same is true for auto mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   College graduates now make up the fastest-growing group of
junior college and trade-school enrollees, Holdsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of them are returning home to live with their parents and
getting the same jobs in the retail industry that they could have
had right out of high school.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor market is crying for young, skilled workers, said Gary
Kemp, executive secretary and business manager for the Greater
Kansas City Building and Construction Trade Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We push our children to go to college and come away with more
professional skills,'' Kemp said. ``But sometimes we forget about
the skills that are necessary for everyday life. It would be hard
to imagine life without plumbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, also a member of a VICA advisory committee of local
corporations and support groups, said: ``The exciting thing about
this (Skills USA) is that you'll see young people who are the very
best in the country at what they've been learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The championship rounds Thursday will be from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
on the exhibit floor at Bartle Hall. Contestants, who are state
high school and college champions, will compete against each other
and the clock in skills contests _ such as cooking a gourmet meal,
building sections of homes according to blueprints and manicuring
nails.
</P>
<P>
   Winners will receive gold, silver and bronze medals _ plus
scholarships, textbooks, cash prizes and ``tools of the trade''
merchandise. Companies at the conference will recruit the winners
as if they were top athletes.
</P>
<P>
   VICA convention participants will attend seminars and specialty
meetings, take field trips to businesses and hear from keynote
speakers such as U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger, 1996 Miss America
Shawntel Smith and Joseph Galli, president of DeWalt Industrial
Power Tool Co., a main corporate sponsor of VICA.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's school-to-work program, a joint effort
of the U.S. Labor and Education departments, will have its annual
meeting here this week for 400 participants at Harrah's North
Kansas City Casino &AMP; Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 U.S. companies support VICA with year-round
assistance, including training and equipment. The list of sponsors
reads like a page from the Fortune 500 _ General Motors Corp., E.I.
DuPont Co., Sprint Corp., John Deere Co., Aluminum Company of
America and J.C. Penney Co. Inc. among them.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have lent or donated more than $15 million worth
of equipment and materials for this year's competition. That tally
includes 654 computers, 10,000 bricks, 25,000 pounds of mortar, 100
stoves and 50 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing companies at the local level include Gateway, US
Rentals, Rich Mix Products Inc., Miller Material Co., and Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Denny Pinnell, sales representative for US Rentals, called the
company's contribution a logical investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the long-term good of the industry you need to keep these
kids in the business and give them opportunities.''

WORLD'S OLDEST CITY WILL BECOME NEWEST GAMBLING MECCA
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By DEBORAH HORAN &QL; 
1998c. Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JERICHO, West Bank _ The card tables are set, the slot machines
ready and dozens of young men and women are learning how to play
poker, roulette and blackjack in snappy Las Vegas style.
</P>
<P>
   With cash from private international investors, Palestinians are
about to turn the world's oldest city into the Middle East's newest
gambling destination, say representatives of an Austrian-based
casino company that has set up shop in Jericho to train croupiers,
bouncers and security guards.
</P>
<P>
   By fall, the luxury Oasis Casino, now a four-story unfinished
colossus at the edge of this sleepy West Bank town, will be
operational.
</P>
<P>
   Planners hope it will attract high rollers from Israel, Egypt,
Jordan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   By 2000, the casino will be flanked by two or three five-star
hotels and surrounded by a three-square mile compound complete with
swimming pools, an entertainment center, tennis courts and golf
course. Just in time, the promoters note, for the millennium
celebrations when more than 2 million tourists are expected to
descend on the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The $150 million project likely will bring in millions of
dollars in tourism and gambling revenues to the Palestinian
Authority's cash-strapped government. That should help to free it
from dependence on foreign donors, who have pitched in more than $1
billion since it was established in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of tourists would be a boon to the Palestinians'
sagging economy, which has been hit hard by repeated
Israeli-imposed security closures that severely hamper the movement
of Palestinian goods and people.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea has struck a nerve with many in this conservative
biblical town. Islamic leaders condemn the casino as ``haram,''
forbidden by Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is against God and against our religion,'' said
Sheikh Ismail Jamal, the mufti, or high religious leader, of
Jericho.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want hotels and gardens and tourists,'' he said. ``We want
people to come to Jericho to visit. But we don't want gambling. It
leads to other crimes _ to corruption and adultery and drinking
alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Casino planners seem to be considering that sentiment. No signs
have been posted at the site to announce the coming attraction,
gruff foremen try to keep Palestinian workers from talking to
passers-by and croupiers-in-training are taught how to deal cards
and spin roulette wheels at a local restaurant with the curtains
tightly drawn.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Palestinian Authority officials are keeping tight
control over information about the project by refusing to name
investors or to estimate the amount of gambling revenues they
expect to receive. Nor will they say whether the authority will put
up any of the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Local religious leaders have not been accurately informed.
Palestinian officials have told Sheikh Jamal that the site would
house only a hotel and golf course. There was no mention of the
casino.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal says he will preach against the casino _ but nothing else,
a stance echoed by leaders of the militant Muslim Hamas
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Started at the end of last year, the casino is by far the most
ambitious attempt by Palestinians to woo tourists _ and Israelis _
to areas under their control without bringing them too deeply into
Palestinian-held territory, where many Israelis are afraid to go.
The site is only 200 yards from the nearest Israeli checkpoint and
will extend south to the Dead Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no problem going into the area because the whole
resort is right at the entrance to Jericho,'' said Dana Tadmor, a
spokeswoman for Gitam Porter Novelli, a public relations firm hired
by Casinos Austria International, Ltd., the company managing the
casino and training its staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no access problem, nobody should hesitate in getting
there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are likely to form the base of the casino's clientele.
Until Turkey banned gambling in February, about 250,000 Israelis
visited annually, spending $200 million each year. Many traveled on
four-day tours set up for casino visits.
</P>
<P>
   The work on the casino already has boosted the Palestinian
economy. Every day workers from the Akabat Jaber refugee camp, a
crumbling and half-abandoned group of rose-colored mud houses,
traipse across the main street to the casino site. Planners say the
casino, hotels and manicured grounds eventually will employ 1,200
Palestinians and 400 international workers.
</P>
<P>
   The job creation is crucial to an economy in which one-fifth of
the population lives on less than $2.50 a day and unemployment has
hovered around 30 percent for years, according to U.S.
Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, who spoke here last week
about what he termed the Palestinians' ``dire'' economic situation.
</P>
<P>
   The hardship has put the preachers in difficult straits. Most
say Palestinians can work to build the casino but not enter it to
gamble.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a gesture to Hamas and other conservative elements,
Palestinian officials may prevent their countrymen from entering
the casino, as is the practice at gambling sites in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   At the casino site, young Palestinian workers draped in the
black-and-white checkered ``kefiya'' worn by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, say they do not like the idea of bringing gambling
so close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad for Jericho,'' said Samir Hussein, a 20-year-old from
the Akabat Jaber camp. ``It will bring bad things, like drinking
alcohol. It's forbidden for us. It's for foreigners only.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one said he would role the dice if he could. ``If I had the
money I would play,'' Khalil Muhammad, 19, said with a grin.
``Naturally.''

ISSUE OF TRIBAL FISHING RIGHTS DIVIDES WHITE COMMUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEABECK, Wash. _ Among white fisherman and waterfront landowners
in Washington, grumbling about the special perks of American Indian
heritage comes as regularly as the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Why, goes the usual beef, should a tribal identification card
give one American the first shot at harvesting salmon? Why should
Indians have the right to pick the oysters and dig the clams from
somebody else's beach?
</P>
<P>
   Because, say Bill and Judy Matchett, a deal is a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Matchetts don't have an ounce of Indian blood. They do own
about 400 feet of waterfront on Hood Canal.
</P>
<P>
   But they accept that the rocky beach is not entirely theirs.
</P>
<P>
   They refer to an 1855 treaty that handed over great areas of
Indian land in western Washington to incoming white settlers. In
return, the treaty said, ``the right of taking fish at usual and
accustomed grounds and stations is further secured to said Indians,
in common with all citizens of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In common'' has been interpreted to mean half for Indians,
half for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   That includes half the salmon in Puget Sound, half the crabs and
shrimp on the bottom of Hood Canal, half the oysters and clams on
the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court early this year clarified that the
treaty applied to Washington tidelands, the part of a beach between
high and low tides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not special rights; it's treaty rights,'' said Bill
Matchett. ``We've considered ourselves friends of the tribes and
sympathetic to them for years. We couldn't feel that way and then
deny them what was legally theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   They went to the Point No Point Treaty Council, a coalition of
four tribes, and worked out a contract that left it to the tribes
to determine how many shellfish could be plucked from the Matchett
tideland.
</P>
<P>
   It requires tribal members to notify the Matchetts a month in
advance of their harvest and to arrive by water and by daylight.
The Matchetts, in turn, are to log how many clams or oysters they
take.
</P>
<P>
   In practice the beach is too small for commercial harvesting,
and the Matchetts take too few shellfish to bother keeping track.
So far, three tribal members have made a single, 90-minute visit to
take clams for a ceremonial dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to set an example,'' Matchett said.
</P>
<P>
   So far they are alone among Washington's 60,000 shoreline
property owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our beach is our front yard. We pay taxes on the beach. We
have deed to them, you know, the rights to them,'' said Art Price,
a retired civil engineer on Marrowstone Island. ``Having people
wandering on your beach and taking your clams is like having people
take half of your vegetable garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Lindsay, executive director of United Property Owners of
Washington, said the treaties were made by the federal government
but affected only a small minority of Americans, those with
shoreline tracts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``All U.S. citizens ought to bear whatever treaty burdens there
are,'' Lindsay said. ``All the rest of you in Oregon and California
and Montana and Kansas don't bear this burden.''
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety builds as area catches of all seafood have dropped
significantly from overfishing and growing pollution _ making
fishing rights ever more precious.
</P>
<P>
   Across Hood Canal from the Matchetts' place, hard at the edge of
Dabob Bay, 40-year-old Victor Tuson of the Jamestown S'Klallam
tribe was poking holes in cans of Puss 'n Boots Supreme cat food in
a tiny boat overflowing with wire baskets. The punctured cans go
into the baskets as bait for spotted shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Tuson is new to shrimping. He and his half brother, Butch
Williams, bought two old and small boats after recent court rulings
made clear that members of certain tribes enjoyed rights to the
waterway's bounty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It beats punching a time clock, and it's one of those rare
things these days where the harder you work, the more money you can
make,'' said Williams. ``And it's something I can take from my
heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   State fisheries officials designate certain days for Indian
fishing, and Hood Canal is dotted with a few dozen boats. Anybody
dropping shrimp pots or crab pots must be ready to flash tribal ID
cards when tribal ``fish cop'' Doug Lux floats by.
</P>
<P>
   Other days are open to anyone, but with thousands of sportsmen,
too few shellfish are left to support non-Indian commercial
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Onshore and unable to join in the weekend's Indian-only
shrimping, 67-year-old Ken Harris is one angry white man. He
suspects that the tribes take more than their half and suggests
that something is wrong with the treaties and their two-tier
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've given the Indians super rights,'' Harris said. ``To do
that, they've taken away from all us natives who have lived here
our entire lives.''
</P>
<P>
   His white neighbors tend to agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's people who have been around here all these years who
you never knew were Indians until the court made these decisions,''
said Julie McClanahan, who has lived on the waterfront near
Quilcene since 1952. ``It really put a strain on old friendships.''

DUMP DISPUTE POINTS TO CONFUSION OVER LAND OWNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE ANDES, S.D. _ It might smell like a Dumpster and look like
your teen-ager's room on steroids, but to the people who fought the
Yankton Sioux to heap garbage here, this trash pit is a thing of
beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're mighty proud of this landfill,'' said Jack Soulek,
Charles Mix County commissioner. ``It was a long time coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the Lake Andes landfill solve the trash-disposal
problems of four counties, but for its champions, the dump also
represents a limit to American Indian authority.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill spat began as another not-in-my-back-yard argument.
But the court rulings it generated held much wider ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, in fact, the case allowed the Sioux to seize domain
over thousands of acres the tribe had sold to the federal
government more than a century before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly a landfill case blew up into this huge issue of who
had jurisdiction in all these places, the tribe or the county,''
said Ken Cotton, the lawyer who represented the trash district.
``It was a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the process the authority of police departments was thrown
into question, and minor crimes such as burglary became the
business of the FBI. The dispute stirred up new resentment between
the Sioux and their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe says its intentions were misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want direct control over tribal members,'' said Robert
Cournoyer, vice chairman of the tribe. ``We don't want anything
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Identifying Indian land here is not as simple as it may sound.
The reservation's crazy-quilt boundaries come from an 1858 treaty,
a federal law passed in 1894, and thousands of subsequent and small
private transactions.
</P>
<P>
   There is land held in trust for Indians by the federal
government, land ceded by the tribes through treaties, land
allotted to individual Indian families and allotted land that ended
up being sold to white people.
</P>
<P>
   And marking where Indian country starts and stops is vitally
important, because tribal self-rule is tied inexorably to the land.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of Indian land became critical in fall 1992, when
a new trash district chose for its dump a few agricultural acres
about a mile and a half west of Lake Andes.
</P>
<P>
   Sioux leaders began objecting the following summer, saying the
landfill design needed to add a plastic liner. That would boost the
cost almost $2 million, and the trash district balked.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the tribe sued in federal court, contending that the
landfill site was under control of the tribe and, as such, subject
to federal environmental regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe noted its 1858 treaty with the U.S. government that
exchanged 11 million acres for domain over the 430,000-acre
reservation. But a deal clinched with the 1894 law paid the tribe
$600,000 for almost half the reservation _ land including the
landfill site that was ceded to the government and, in turn, sold
to white settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the remaining 230,000 acres of Indian land allotted to
members of the tribe also was, over time, sold to non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district judge ruled in favor of the tribe in 1995,
saying that although the Sioux ceded the land in 1894, they did not
surrender authority over it, because of the expansive language of
the treaties. The appeals court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight the issue became more than a dump liner.
Generations-old patterns of law enforcement across the checkerboard
of the reservation were upset.
</P>
<P>
   Whites complained that between the tribal police and a few FBI
agents stationed in Sioux Falls, many crimes like burglary and
vandalism passed without serious investigation. The tribe, in turn,
responded that it was more a perception than a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fear factor here,'' Cournoyer said. ``People don't
understand the tribe, and they tend to fear Native Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Confusion followed. In one case two men murdered a 16-year-old
on a road that marked a border between land that was once in the
reservation and land that never was. Because one killer claimed
Indian heritage, he went through the federal judicial system and,
partly because he cooperated with prosecutors, received a 10-year
sentence. The other went through state courts and received a
40-year prison term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you'll have the lines of jurisdiction running right
through someone's home,'' said Matthew Gaffey, the Charles Mix
County state's attorney. ``It gets complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In January the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the lower court
rulings, clearing the way for the landfill to open on the land the
tribe ceded in 1894. That put the Charles Mix Sheriff's Department
back in charge of its old territory.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' 9-0 ruling, however, did not address the question
of the allotted land sold to whites by individual Sioux families
years after the last treaty. The tribe filed another lawsuit in
March, leaving the issue of jurisdiction over that territory still
contested.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to stake the ground that's ours,'' said Cournoyer.
``We have to make a stand.''

ZONING DIFFERENCES FOSTER GAP BETWEEN RESERVATIONS, NON-INDIAN
AREAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   ENUMCLAW, Wash. _ No signs mark where Washington 164 winds on
and off the Muckleshoot Indian Reservation. It is obvious
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Postcard-pretty country cottages, the ones so often with horses
grazing nearby, dot the landscape off the reservation.
Less-prosperous homes, often barely more than shacks and frequently
paired with plywood fireworks stands, punctuate the Muckleshoot
territory.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly money has a great deal to do with the differences. For
the most part the Muckleshoots don't have much of it. By contrast
the non-Indians live here in large part because they can afford to
escape the crowded urban sprawl of Seattle and Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   Different zoning and building codes, too, explain the aesthetic
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, the White River Amphitheatre.
</P>
<P>
   If it were planned for the nonreservation side of the
Muckleshoot boundary, as was a proposal shouted down by neighbors
five years earlier, the amphitheater probably would not yet amount
to more than blueprints and artists' renderings.
</P>
<P>
   But it is on Indian land, so earth has been moved, concrete
poured and steel girders bolted together to frame the skeleton of
the $30 million, 23,000-seat concert spot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet not a single King County building permit or zoning variance
has been granted. Or applied for. Or needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our treaties are not with King County. Our treaties are with
the U.S. government,'' said Virginia Cross, a member of the tribal
council. ``It's our land. It's our decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, after all, is a sovereign nation and need not concern
itself with the statutes of Washington any more than the people of
Detroit mind the laws of Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't said we do or we don't have jurisdiction,'' said
Chuck Mize, director of government and external affairs for King
County. ``We have just stayed back from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead the county lobbied the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and
the federal Environmental Protection Agency to step in. The project
is stalled midway through construction for a federally required
environmental review.
</P>
<P>
   Non-Indian neighbors hope federal wetlands protections, for
example, manage to halt the amphitheater project completely so that
issues ordinarily covered by zoning and building codes _ noise,
traffic, sewage _ won't spill across the reservation's zig-zagging
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about sovereignty; it's about land use,'' said Jill
Cook Jensen, part of the anti-amphitheater Citizens for Safety and
Environment group. It contends concerts would clog two-lane
Washington 164, trapping residents in or out of their homes while
blocking routes for police and ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents complain also that the tribe can't guarantee the
safety of the amphitheater's construction, the reliability of its
sewers or the sobriety of its patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just something that's going to be used by the tribe
on their property,'' said Janet Devlin, another member of the
anti-amphitheater group. ``We can't just say, `Oh, it's on your
land, so we trust you to do it right.' &UR; ''
</P>
<P>
   That, responds the tribe, smacks of chauvinism. Cross, the
tribal leader, says the opposition is driven by the same racism
that she thinks shuts Muckleshoots out of jobs in the towns of
Auburn and Enumclaw, that leads to the mistreatment of their
children in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still don't like us, and they never will like us,'' Cross
said.

AMERICAN INDIAN TRIBES MOVE TO REAFFIRM SOVEREIGNTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROW AGENCY, Mont. _ First the Crow were bullied by the Sioux
from these red cliffs and rolling yellow hills of buffalo grass.
Later they struck an alliance with the United States and fell here
alongside Custer.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Washington force-fed treaties to the Crow, bunching
them on the reservation while inviting in white settlers as models
of how to run a store or farm the land.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity has yet to reach the undulating horizon of
south-central Montana's Indian country, but the Crow have caught on
to that most loathed of European imports _ the tax.
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at the tourist trade, a tribe-levied surcharge sets white
fishing guides, shopkeepers and service station owners to griping
about taxation without representation.
</P>
<P>
   To those whites who feel unwelcome on the 2.5 million-acre
reservation, who feel officially less than Indians living under the
same huge sky, the Crow say tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't like it,'' said Carl Venne, the Crow's director
of public safety, ``then get the hell out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the Crow, tribes throughout the country move with new
resolve to exercise an old asset: sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   It is that dominion that makes them not just another census
category, but hundreds of nations within a nation.
</P>
<P>
   This peculiar status stems from a time when Indians controlled
more than three-fourths of what would become the United States,
prompting the writers of the Constitution to place tribes on an
equal footing with foreign nations. The ``white fathers'' in
Washington underlined that status in 371 treaties that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1830 the Supreme Court has affirmed that although tribes
are domestic and dependent, they are still part of an American
family of governments entitled to self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   That sovereignty opens the way for casinos, guarantees American
Indians extraordinary fishing and hunting rights, allows them to
sell gasoline and cigarettes on Indian territory free of state
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Those Indians-only enterprises, in turn, give new resources to
some of the poorest Americans in the United States. That money also
serves as life support for hundreds of dying languages and offers a
sliver of hope for the survival of customs overwhelmed by
European-bred culture.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show of treaty-backed authority cues wails of protest
from non-Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't participate in their government,'' said Gordon Rose, a
former lawyer who runs an outfitters shop and a small group of
cabins near the Bighorn River. The Crow have put a lien on his
business for not paying the sales tax they first imposed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I be subject to their control?''
</P>
<P>
   That argument, say tribes, overlooks history and the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear people talking about special rights that are
anachronistic or ancient,'' said Steven Tullberg, who directs the
Washington, D.C., office of the Indian Law Resource Center, based
in Helena, Mont. ``Most of those rights are younger than our
Constitution. We don't disparage the Constitution by saying it's
ancient.''
</P>
<P>
   Assigning different rights to one group based on bloodlines may
seem anomalous in this republic born of a declaration that ``all
men are created equal.''
</P>
<P>
   But sovereignty clearly means recognizing Indians as not only
Native Americans but also as special Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Indians working on reservations avoid state income taxes but pay
federal income and Social Security taxes. They can vote in local,
state and federal elections _ a right that didn't exist for them in
New Mexico, for instance, until 1948. But a non-Indian resident of
a reservation has no say in tribal government.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian who commits a crime outside a reservation is destined
for the usual federal, state or local courts. Indian authorities
deal with tribal members for minor crimes on reservations but turn
to the FBI or the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs police to deal with
murders, armed robberies or organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   That can get confusing when, for instance, a non-Indian is
burglarized on a reservation. If the burglar is a member of the
tribe, then tribal police handle the case. If the burglar is white,
then a county sheriff might step in. But who's in charge until you
catch the thief?
</P>
<P>
   It isn't always clear, either, what constitutes Indian country.
Treaties dating sometimes to the 18th century often contradict each
other. But on land that is theirs, tribes can decide whether to set
zoning, to ban alcohol or to open casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (reservations), and the claim to separate government
they represent, Indians would, for all practical purposes, be no
different from other ethnic minorities in the United States,''
wrote Fergus Bordewich in ``Killing the White Man's Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with granting tribes self-rule and reserving them land,
the federal government still pays for vast territory taken from
tribes with a promise of sustenance. Mostly that takes the form of
services _ clinics, schools, welfare _ like those provided to poor
people elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Some tribes, such as the Cherokee in Oklahoma, have worked to
wean themselves from federal dependency as funding for Indian
programs has waned. The Cherokee, for instance, generate more than
half their tribal income from enterprises that include a ranch, a
lumber company and several plants that manufacture wire for
corporations and the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I really feel discouraged when I imagine our
ancestors hearing us saying that we can't live without the (Bureau
of Indian Affairs),'' said then-Cherokee Chief Wilma Mankiller to
other Indian leaders in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Indians account for less than 1 percent of the U.S. population
today, spread mostly across the West on 314 reservations. The
differences in culture and prosperity among the Hopi, the Mohawks,
the Seminoles are as varied as those among the British, the
Italians, the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, gambling has reversed the
fortunes of only a few tribes. Congress' General Accounting Office
estimates that 40 percent of Indian gambling revenue comes from
eight of 184 tribal casinos. The country's largest tribe, the
Navajo, twice rejected gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty among the Sioux on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in
South Dakota makes theirs the poorest county in the country. Less
than a day's drive to the east finds Minnesota's Mille Lacs band of
Chippewa awash in casino profits.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those differences a new Indian movement grows that sees
salvation in sovereignty and its foundations in U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, up to three dozen Indians practiced law. Now
most estimates put that number at more than 1,000 _ still small
compared with the rest of the population, but a dramatic increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tribes are trying to come into the modern world,'' said
Lawrence Baca, president-elect of the Native American Bar
Association. ``Using the law is something just to get the tribes
out of a situation of poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribes' new pragmatism also shows in more than $2 million in
political donations made in the 1996 election cycle. Their
assertiveness is seen in different ways in different places:
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut used their location near
large eastern cities to build the country's largest casino _ Indian
or otherwise _ and now can guarantee each tribal member a job worth
upward of $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The success of those Pequots and a few other tribes in the
gambling business has prompted competitors, most vocally developer
Donald Trump, to complain that Indians hold an unfair advantage
because they pay no taxes on their profits and enjoy different
standards of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors to a new prison in south-central Missouri battled
mightily, but unsuccessfully, to stop the $73 million project. But
the Iowa tribe of Oklahoma was able to halt construction last
month. The tribe said excavation could upset the remains of their
ancestors _ some of the 70,000 American Indians forced to move
cross-country by the Indian Removal Act of 1830.
</P>
<P>
   Navajo leaders prompted outrage for briefly considering blocking
all the roads into their expansive lands in Arizona, New Mexico and
Utah as a declaration of their rule.
</P>
<P>
   The Omaha tribe in Macy, Neb., has converted its failed bingo
hall into a cigarette manufacturing plant and is marketing its
cigarettes on reservations throughout the country. An Indian-made
product sold on Indian land is exempt from state taxes.
Consequently, full flavor, menthol, light and ultra-light Omahas
can undercut the non-tribal competition.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Supreme Court case soon will decide whether eight
Chippewa tribes may continue hunting and fishing free of any state
regulation in Minnesota. While state officials worry that ruling
with the tribes could lead to a plundering of Minnesota's wild
game, the tribes insist they've held the right to hunt and fish at
will for 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when states fight bitterly to keep out nuclear
waste, the Skull Valley band of Goshutes, barely 100 strong, is
inviting the country's radioactive spent fuel rods onto its small
and barren reservation southwest of Salt Lake City. Taking in the
nuclear trash could create an annuity for members of the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Although Utah hasn't explicitly conceded that the tribe can
legally store the waste, the governor and the Legislature have
chosen to point their efforts at the transportation of radioactive
material over public lands rather than challenge outright what the
Goshutes can do on their reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, meantime, feel frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough fighting somebody like the Goshutes who have that
authority,'' said Chip Ward of nearby Grantsville, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   So often, reservations appeared all but worthless until oil or
some other bonanza was discovered. Today, sovereignty and the power
to govern a patch of land is the great find.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Coeur d'Alene tribe in northern Idaho and the lake
that bears its name.
</P>
<P>
   Treaties made between the tribe and federal government in 1887
and 1889 reduced the reservation's boundaries but granted the lake
to the Coeur d'Alenes.
</P>
<P>
   When Idaho was admitted to the union in 1890, however, it became
entitled to the Constitution's promise that new states are granted
all the beds, banks and waters of navigable lakes or rivers within
their boundaries.

   Congress didn't get around to ratifying the 1887 and 1889
treaties until 1891, a year after Idaho became a state. To
complicate things further, a presidential executive order in 1873
promised the lake to tribes, but that action never sought or gained
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Supreme Court has said that the northern two-thirds
of the lake belongs to Idaho, but the tribe is still pressing a
claim on the southern third.
</P>
<P>
   Why does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tribe owns a portion of the lake, you could have
competing water quality standards, disputes over fishing seasons,
questions over easements for docks and power lines,'' said Clive
Strong of the Idaho attorney general's office. Likewise, logs
floated to sawmills would need to pass through tribe-controlled
water.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe, meantime, jealously defends the exercise of
sovereignty it credits for turning around the prospects of its
members in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, before the Coeur d'Alene tribe opened a casino,
unemployment among its 1,600 members was nearly 65 percent. Now,
despite legal challenges from attorneys general in Missouri and
other states, the tribe is operating an on-line worldwide lottery

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I try keep current on trends in management, and I
just read an article by some guru, and he said that it is important
for managers to set goals for employees. I thought employees were
supposed to play a role in goal-setting. Can you clarify this?
M.C. &QL; 
A. As a manager, you will rue the day you follow that guru. On the
one hand, he is correct in his view of the importance of goals at
work. Goals have been consistently found to have a positive impact
on motivation, productivity, and satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   However, when goals are unilaterally dumped on employees, they
can have the exact opposite impact. In such cases, employees feel
ignored, interchangeable, and somewhat useless. If the goal of
management is to generate employee resistance and resentment, this
is an excellent way to do it.
</P>
<P>
   It makes more sense for an organization to have clearly defined
overall goals. complete with priorities, performance expectations,
benchmark dates, and measurement standards, and for managers to
work with their employees to jointly establish strategies that will
help each individual meet his or her objectives while
simultaneously linking them with the organization's objectives.
</P>
<P>
   Any guru worth his of her salt (and fees) emphasizes the
importance of treating employees with respect and trust. Setting
goals for the employees tends to neutralize rather than empower
employees, and that's definitely not guru-worthy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I told my manager that I needed more time for a particular
project, but he pushed me to complete it, and it ended up with
several errors. How do you deal with a manager who keeps rushing
you, and then complains about your mistakes? P.A. &QL; 
A. Before you rush to draw any conclusions, it is important to
consider two key possibilities: If you are already operating at
full-throttle, and your manager expects you to somehow perform
super-human speed, this is something to discuss with him; however,
if you are not really pushing yourself, this is something to
discuss with yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the first step is for you to honestly and objectively
look at your own productivity and try to determine if there is
anything about it that may be putting your manager into his rush
mode.
</P>
<P>
   If you honestly feel that you are exerting full effort, you
should discuss the matter with your manager. Let him see the
documented amount of time that you put into the project, and let
him know how you would have handled the sections that were in error
if you had been given the time. One strategy for the future may be
for both of you to review each project more thoroughly at the
outset, and to establish more points for discussion along the way.
It may also help to break some projects into more manageable
components and establish benchmarks from here.
</P>
<P>
   A managerial style that rushes employees is not exactly
motivational, and it can actually interfere with productivity. With
more planning and communication, perhaps you both can avoid the
rush.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I just went through a job interview and then completed a test
that asked me to check boxes that best described the way I would
handle various stressful situations. I thought the test was an
annoying waste of time, and I'm beginning to wonder about a company
that would use it. What do you think? L.S. &QL; 
A. There is some irony associated with a test for stress that can
actually be a source of stress. However, before passing judgment or
passing on this job possibility, it will be helpful to consider
some key points about pre-employment testing.
</P>
<P>
   If this test was randomly thrown into the hiring process because
a topsider somewhere in the company heard about it, read about it,
or stumbled across it, then you have real grounds for concern.
Tests today should be job-related, and they should be statistically
validated to prove that they are predictive of specific aspects of
job performance, and they must do so on a non-discriminatory basis.
</P>
<P>
   In the event you are called back for another interview, you can
ask about this. Most progressive companies will gladly give you
information on their hiring techniques. And, if your inquiry meets
resistance, that can be an important piece of data to factor into
your employment decision.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is important to note that the problem with
paper-and-pencil personality tests like the one you described is
that they are often fakable. In many cases, people know how they
should react in a stressful situation, and they have no trouble
checking a box that describes such behavior, while their actual
ability to cope with such situations would knock them out of the
box altogether.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Arm your imagination
 &HT;    for trek to Risk Level 3
 &HT;    By MIchael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The shots in the arm were no problem. I'm a big boy. And the
only thing that troubled me about the malaria pill was the thought
of ravenous mosquitos and tsetse flies buzzing around the netting
at night. I'm a light sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   Then I got to reading a little booklet called Travel Health
Planner. ``In a perfect world,'' it said, ``travelers wouldn't need
to worry about becoming targets of crime.'' Whenever I read the
words ``in a perfect world,'' I prepare for its imperfections.
</P>
<P>
   My concentration clicked on and I started reading more
selectively, my eyes fastening on the ominous. There were
advisories about hepatitis and lockjaw _ that's what the shots were
for. It advised taking an insect repellent containing something
called DEET.
</P>
<P>
   I went to the pharmacy and bought the strongest stuff it had, a
cream used by the Special Forces. It's the closest I've ever been
to the military.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Travel Health Planner, I was given a printout of
information from the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violent crime as well as petty crime is prevalent,'' it said.
``Armed assaults and carjackings take place. ... Criminals often
become violent quickly. ... Frequently, victims who argue with
assailants or refuse to give up their valuables are shot.''
</P>
<P>
   I go where they tell me to go, so I'm packing for a trip to
Central America, although it rather sounds like metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   There's a difference between a tourist and a real traveler, and
I know which one I am. Show me your ruins. Where's your best
restaurant?
</P>
<P>
   There's also a difference between a routine and a rut. A routine
is not always a bad thing. It lets you know where you'll be from
day to day. When I wake up I want to know the paper will be on the
drive and the coffee will be in the cup.
</P>
<P>
   I should be embarrassed, but am not. One of my heroes, the late
V.S. Pritchett, would have disowned me, but the British are a
different breed. Post a Brit to a remote fastness in the Khyber
Pass, and he'll be rattling around on the edge of cliffs in a car
with bad tires. Within a fortnight he's sending home dispatches on
the cuisine and the local women, rifle shots ricocheting in the
background.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not refuse to drink the water,'' Pritchett once wrote.
``I do not see bacteria everywhere. I do not suspect everyone who
speaks a foreign language of being a thief. I do not scream that I
cannot get a good steak in Morocco ... a decent haggis in Naples or
an edible chop suey on Ascension Island.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been fine for Pritchett, who traipsed all over the
globe and somehow lived to be 96. But I've got it here in black and
white from the U.S. government: Don't drink the water. Don't rinse
your toothbrush in tap water. Don't open your mouth in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know that I'm going to shower at all.
</P>
<P>
   For three days somebody might just have to live with me the way
I am. Or I'll sponge off, like my kids want to do when they're told
to get in the bath.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, don't use scented soap _ the insects will find you
like a heat-seeking missile. Maybe they need a taste of Tilex.
</P>
<P>
   I lived in Miami for eight years and spent a little time in the
Caribbean. But I'm not a tropical kind of guy. If I'm going
anywhere remote, I'm comforted by the sight of snow.
</P>
<P>
   In my Travel Health Planner, a map divides the world into shades
of white, gray and black. The white areas are Risk Level 1, meaning
``low risk from food, water and insects.'' The gray areas are Risk
Level 2 and the black areas, Risk Level 3.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't surprise me that the white areas are all of North
America, Australia and New Zealand and most of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Where I'm going is one of the black areas.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the natives ``are armed,'' the State Department's
printout frankly tells me, ``and shootouts are not uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   And I'm not even allowed to pack a firearm for self-defense. A
lot of good the Second Amendment is going to do me there.

 &HT;    Are Women looking up to ``Ally McBeal'' or ``Xena: Warrior
Princess''
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women have come a long way, baby, but have they come far enough?
Time ($2.95) reporter Ginia Bellafante writes that the 1970s
feminism of Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan has been supplanted by
the feminism of ``Ally McBeal''. Instead of crusading for social
change, equal pay and better day care, Bellafante says, today's
young feminists are more concerned with their bodies and their sex
lives. According to a Time/CNN poll, women are split on whether
feminism is relevant still. Some say feminism is dead because the
battle has been won.
</P>
<P>
   So what does this mean for the next generation of young women?
In a companion story, Time's Nadya Labi looks at girl power and the
marketing of feminism to teens and preteens. The Spice Girls may be
fading, but they are being replaced as role models by empowered
``grrrls'' such as ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'', ``Xena: Warrior
Princess'', and Disney's Chinese heroine Mulan. And, on a promising
note, a record 2.5 million girls are competing on high school
sports teams, compared with 300,000 in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   BACK TO BEIJING: As President Clinton heads for China and a
summit with President Jiang Zemin, Newsweek ($2.95) explores the
changes that have taken place since the Tiananmen massacre. In an
essay, Clinton explains why he's going to China _ ``America's
future will not be secure if Asia's is in doubt'' _ and what he
hopes to accomplish. One of the more interesting articles in the
package is Jonathan Alter's report on the Chinese society.
Communism is dead, he writes, and crony capitalism lives. China is
now a country of cell phones and pagers, McDonald's and bowling
alleys.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($3.95) also looks at the China summit
with a feature on Shanghai. White House officials hope to showcase
the Westernization of Shanghai as a way of de-demonizing China in
the minds of Americans. But, says magazine correspondent Steven
Butler, in the midst of an economic boom millions are unemployed
and destitute.
</P>
<P>
   SANDERS ON SHANDLING: ``Narcissism was our first bond,''
comedian Garry Shandling says in an Esquire ($3) essay about alter
ego Larry Sanders. Elsewhere in the issue, Ron Suskind interviews
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas about obstacles that face
minority youths today and how they can be overcome. Also of note:
Restaurant critic John Mariani rates the nation's best cities for
dining out, eliminating New York for being too obvious. The best?
San Francisco. Runners-up are Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, Los
Angeles, Washington, Miami, Seattle, Philadelphia, Dallas, Boston
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S ENTERTAINMENT: People ($2.79) focuses on Christina
Onassis' 13-year-old daughter, Athina, and the battle for the
family fortune. Athina's father, Thierry Roussel, has accused his
fellow trustees of plotting to kidnap his daughter. The Greeks
claim that the Israeli commandos they hired to watch Roussel were
simply checking on Athina's safety. Meanwhile, the teenager will
inherit $600 million when she turns 18. ... In an article that
makes us wonder if some magazines have full-time ``list'' editors,
Entertainment Weekly ($3.50) lists the 100 Most Creative People in
Entertainment. On the ``It List'' are Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz,
Christina Ricci, Madonna, Julie Taymor and CD-ROM's ``Tomb Raider''
heroine Lara Croft. Oh, and Taco Bell's talking Chihuahua, Gidget.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE: There are more than 300,000 interracial
married couples in the United States today, according to Essence
($2.75), but there are still problems when a black man marries a
white woman. ``We're treated as if we're traitors in somebody's
grand scheme of things,'' writes New York Times reporter Garry
Pierre-Pierre, who is married to a white woman. ``I'm nobody's
traitor. I simply followed my heart.''

 &HT;    Take this job and love it
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--Sandi Turner dreams about working at Six Flags Over
Georgia. ``You have to be 16 to work the rides,'' says the
14-year-old. ``But I could walk around and sell cotton candy.''
</P>
<P>
   Another teen, Jon Elder, wants a job at HiFi Buys because, he
grins, ``You get discounts on stereo equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Falk thinks he already has the world's best summer job.
``I'm getting $12.50 an hour working construction for my father's
friend,'' he boasts.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the world of summer jobs. Many industrious teenagers
have already found employment; others are still checking out the
scene. This year they can afford to be a little picky. Because of
the booming economy, jobs are so plentiful that some employers are
even offering small ``signing bonuses'' to join their work force,
and teen job seekers don't have to settle for minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   But the extra money doesn't make the jobs any more glamorous.
For the most part, they still involve repetitive tasks such as
waiting on fast-food customers, cleaning cages at an animal
hospital or giving safety instructions to thrill-ride patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Sisters Maryann and Melissa Calhoun discuss the summer jobs
they'd never take and the ones they'd love to have.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa: I'd never do fast food.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann: I agree. They make you wear those dorky outfits.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa: They don't treat you that good at theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann: Plus you lose your hearing working the roller coaster.
(Note to Six Flags lawyers: Don't take this literally. We checked
with an audiologist, who said roller coasters pose no threat to
hearing.)
</P>
<P>
   Melissa: Baby-sitting?
</P>
<P>
   Maryann: Baby-sitting would stink. I'd take them to a neighbor's
house and plop them down.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa: I'd like a desk job.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann: I think they pay you $9.60 an hour to work in the
collection department at Car Max. You read from a script.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa: That sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Johnston and her best friend, Ashley Odom are sitting in
the food court at Town Center mall.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda: She busted her mother's Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley: So I need a job. I gotta make money. I'd work for $6 an
hour. That's decent. But I won't work fast food, and no grocery
stores, either. I'd like to work in an office at Circuit City. A
lot of kids like working at Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch, but you have to
wear their clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda: Yeah, that sucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley: It does. It does.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda: Also, I don't think it's fair that some places say you
have to be 18 to work. I don't see the difference between someone
who's 16 and someone's who's 18 _ I mean, working.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley: I should look in the newspaper for a job. My mom said as
soon as I get a job she'll get me a car. I need that car 'cause we
want to go to Panama City (Fla.) in July to celebrate my birthday.
On July 17th I'll be 17. So I gotta get a job. I just gotta.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Burns, boyfriend Steven Tipton and Steven's brother, Matt,
discuss their summer employment plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah: Right now I'm working for Subway for $6 an hour, but I'm
looking for a job at a day care center. I love working with kids.
That's what I want to do as a career, work with children.
</P>
<P>
   Matt: I just quit Wendy's. I was making $6.15 an hour, but
starting Monday I'm working for Mrs. Winner's at $6.60 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Steven (cracking up) : $6.60 at Mrs. Winner's? Way to go, bro'!
</P>
<P>
   At a Dunkin Donuts in Fayetteville, Ga., Abby Snauwaertdrinks a
cappuccino cooler and tells friend Lauren Walker about her summer
job.
</P>
<P>
   Abby: I work at Dixieland Fun Park.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren: I'm going to apply there for a job, too.
</P>
<P>
   Abby: Well, it's great there. My friends come to visit me. I
work there for the money, for when I start driving and I need gas
and stuff, and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm the boat girl for the bumper boats.
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while, they give you a nickel raise. Hey, I'm
getting there. A nickel is a nickel. I make $5.30 an hour now.
Every three or four weeks I'll cash one of my paychecks. I put the
rest in the bank. I like knowing it's there, you know, my money.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Dodson, 17, just graduated from Riverwood High School and
plans to attend Morehouse College.(Ga.) In past summers, he worked
for several athletic-shoe stores and, during the Olympics, for
Anheuser-Busch. This summer he got a job selling audio equipment at
a Best Buy . With manager Mike Dircks looking on, he talks about
his new job.
</P>
<P>
   Milton: I just couldn't see myself flipping burgers somewhere.
The best summer jobs for kids are usually at music and clothing
stores. You always get a great discount on the merchandise, and
they're fun to work at.
</P>
<P>
   Mike: That's the thing. This is a fun place to work because of
the music and the friendships they make here. I like bringing in
young people because they're not set in their ways. They're willing
to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Milton: And there's the cash. This job is an opportunity to gain
extra funds for college. That's why a lot of kids work, because
once you're out of high school, Mom and Dad say, ``Hey, you're on
your own.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the challenge of it. Every day of my life I get up in the
morning and think, ``What's the best way I can earn money today?''
My mom taught me that. And with the promotions and raises I get
here _ I make $12 an hour now _ I just feel there isn't anything I
can't do here. It's a great summer job.
</P>
<P>
   Mike: I think the best summer job is being a lifeguard at a nude
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Milton: Aha.

salon owned by Diane Burdett, shortly after her family moved to
Stockbridge, Ga. in January.
</P>
<P>
   Cox: What do you do at Lady Di's?
</P>
<P>
   Alicia: I help with anything that needs to be done. I run the
tanning beds, help with Diane's chemicals. I'm just like a second
hand for her when I'm here.
</P>
<P>
   Cox: Why do you like it there so much?
</P>
<P>
   Alicia: I've always wanted to work in a beauty salon. But I
don't want to do this forever. I really want to make something out
of my life. I plan on going to college.
</P>
<P>
   Cox: What's the best summer job a teenager can have?
</P>
<P>
   Alicia: Everybody wants to work at the mall. If they're guys,
they want to work at a sports-shoe store. They get discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to work fast food, though. Nobody.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise engaged
</P>
<P>
   Kayla Strother, Mary Dawkins, Stephanie Schmit and Jill Giles
talk summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Kayla: I think I want to be a vet's assistant because I'd love
working with animals. But truthfully, I want the money, not the
job. I think the best summer job would be to work as a professional
gum taster.
</P>
<P>
   Mary: I think the best summer job is being a lifeguard. You sit
there all summer and get a tan. My sister's a lifeguard and she has
the perfect tan. But I work in the nursery at my church, and
everyone says I'm really good with kids, so I get a lot of
baby-sitting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie: I'd baby-sit. Everyone likes being around little
kids. But I don't want anything to interfere with my summer plans.
</P>
<P>
   Jill: Me either. I do color guard in the summer and then spend
two weeks in California with my whole family. I don't have time for
a summer job.
</P>
<P>
   Cat boy
</P>
<P>
   Nick Roeker spent the last two summers working at the Cat Clinic
of Roswell (Ga.) as a volunteer. This summer, he's getting paid,
cleaning cages, sweeping floors, mowing the lawn and doing whatever
else needs to be done. With supervision, he'll even perform minor
medical procedures, such as ear cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Cox: Why do you like working here?
</P>
<P>
   Nick: Some of my friends are working at McDonald's, but I
couldn't do it. I'd rather work with the cats.
</P>
<P>
   (To a black and white kitten playing with his shoe: ``What are
you doing down there?'' He picks her up. ``You're so adorable.'')
</P>
<P>
   The first summer I worked here I was walking by a cage and a
gray calico swatted me. I had to get seven stiches in my ear.
</P>
<P>
   Cox: So it's dangerous working here?
</P>
<P>
   Nick, laughing: No, it's fun. There's always something going on
and it's always interesting. I think I may want to become a vet
some day, so this is great.

 &HT;    Split personality accused of murder: Is the body held
accountable?
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Dateline'' (10 p.m. EDT on NBC) departs from its
usual format to focus on one story _ and it's a strange one.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Dennis Murphy's watchably Springer-esque ``Alter Ego''
tries to explore the deepest recesses of one criminal's mind. And,
in a mindboggling twist, one of the sexual assault victims of that
criminal is also his staunchest defender.
</P>
<P>
   In spring 1994, Bill Greene attacked Maryalyce Stamatiou in his
Everett, Wa., apartment. She immediately reported the crime, but
now says Greene, who's appealing a life term without parole, wasn't
the one responsible. She says the real culprit was Tyrone.
</P>
<P>
   Stamatiou is Greene's therapist. Who's Tyrone? One of Greene's
alleged 23 personalities.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. Since Greene's assault of Stamatiou, the prisoner
has married a woman whom he told he has been diagnosed with
multiple personalities _ including trash-talking protector William,
shy little-boy Willy and take-charge Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's wife seems to accept her husband's condition _ even
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't introduce them,'' she says of meeting several of his
alleged personalities during their courtship. ``They just came when
they were ready.''
</P>
<P>
   It was alter ego Frank who first told her he loved her. And the
Romeo character Anthony who gave her an engagement ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my life so I guess it isn't odd to me at all,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Twilight Zone'' are the words ``Dateline's'' Murphy uses
to describe all this. It's as bizzare as ``Springer,'' but more
honestly intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   In a testy prison interview with Greene (who morphs in and out
of personalities), Murphy wonders whether Greene is scamming him.
</P>
<P>
   Greene's responses, like his alleged personalities, are varied:
</P>
<P>
   ``That's your call,'' Sam challenges. ``I think you're blowing
it, that's what I think.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really like you,'' little Willy pouts.
</P>
<P>
   And Bill Greene, the personality who stands convicted? He says,
``We're not trying to get away with nothing. People with an
insanity defense spend an average of six, nine years in a mental
institution. What are we getting away with?''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Seeing Shakur through the years
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so confident and so sure about the man that I am that
you can watch me,'' the late rapper/actor Tupac Shakur says at the
opening of MTV's ``BIOrhythm'' (10:30 EDT tonight). ``You can watch
me when I fall, when I cry, when I get shot, when I go to jail,
when I die. You can watch it. And that's what you're gonna do.''
</P>
<P>
   Watch this show and you'll basically hear the same story MTV and
countless others have told about Shakur's short, intriguing life.
</P>
<P>
   What really works are the images. You get to see Shakur through
the years: in grainy still pictures with his godfather, former
Black Panther Geronimo Pratt; in a home video at 17 two weeks
before he was homeless in Oakland; and at 11:30 p.m. that night in
Las Vegas he was shot. (On the way to an anti-violence event, no
less).
</P>
<P>
   The images are powerful to viewers already familiar with the
story behind them. But if you're only first learning of Shakur
here, consider ``BIOrhythm'' just a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-

SCHOOLS NOT LIABLE FOR TEACHER MISDEEDS THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ School districts cannot be held responsible when a
teacher sexually harasses or abuses a student if the school
authorities were not informed of the misconduct, the Supreme Court
ruled Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision in a Texas case means that in order to collect
monetary damages, a student must prove that school officials knew
of the teacher's misconduct and chose to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Congress speaks directly on the subject, we will not
hold a school district liable in damages ... for a teacher's sexual
harassment of a student absent actual notice and deliberate
indifference,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court.
</P>
<P>
   She noted, however, that the ruling will not affect any right
that a harassed student has to recover monetary damages from a
guilty teacher, or against a school district under some state laws.
But such state cases have proved virtually futile.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to hold school districts liable, O'Connor
acknowledged that ``harassment unfortunately is an all too common
aspect of the educational experience ... and that a student suffers
extraordinary harm when subjected to sexual harassment and abuse by
a teacher, and that the teacher's conduct is reprehensible and
undermines the basic purposes of the educational system.''
</P>
<P>
   A women's legal organization decried the decision, saying that
unless school districts are held financially responsible, they will
have no reason to enforce sexual harassment policies strictly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the court is saying to schools is, `Stick your head in
the sand and ignore these problems,''' said Jocelyn Frey, legal
director of the Washington-based National Partnership for Women and
Families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that when a person is allowed to collect damages,
that really gets the school going to correct the probelm. If
schools don't have to worry about being liable, they have no reason
to push strong enforcemnt of sexual harassment policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Shapiro of the American Civil Liberties Union called the
decision ``unfortunate and wrong.'' He said it left ``no effective
remedy for students who are sexually victimized by their
teachers.'' He called on Congress to provide such a remedy.
</P>
<P>
   But Virginia Collier, who was superintendent of the Lago Vista,
Texas, school district when it was sued in the case, said officials
there ``had absolutely zero reason to know what was going on.
Schools can't protect students from everything,'' she added. ``We
love and care for the children in our schools and we are doing our
best to protect them, but we are only human. We can't be all
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling rejected a harassment claim against the
public school district near Austin over a teacher's sexual
relationship with a ninth-grade student.
</P>
<P>
   Because the decision focused exclusively on a school setting
involving teachers and students, it does not apply to on-the-job
sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the justices are expected to say more on that subject in a
pair of decisions to be announced before the court ends its 1997-98
term this week or next.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the justices are considering whether employers
should be held financially responsible for a supervisor's sexual
misconduct when the victim complained to another supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, the question is whether a company is
responsible if one of its supervisors harassed a woman and
threatened to make her job difficult unless she succumbed to his
sexual advances but never carried out the threat. She alleged that
even though she received a promotion, she felt compelled to resign
because of a hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's case, police found Frank Waldrop, then 52, a social
studies teacher at Lago Vista High School, nude in the woods with a
15-year-old student, Alida Star Gebser, in January 1993.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit that Gebser and her mother later filed
against the Lago Vista school district, the sexual relationship had
lasted for about six months. Gebser, now a college student, had
apparently told no one about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, in October 1992, parents or guardians of at least two
other girls had complained about what they called inappropriate
comments Waldrop made to their daughters. He met with the adults
and said he had meant no offense. The school principal admonished
Waldrop and considered the matter resolved, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   After the police discovered Waldrop and Gebser having sex,
Waldrop was fired and stripped of his teaching certificate. He
eventually pleaded no contest to a charge of attempted sexual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge threw out Gebser's suit against the school
district, however, after noting a lack of evidence that any
administrative official knew about the sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the
dismissal of the suit, rejecting arguments that school districts
should be held responsible whenever a teacher sexually harasses a
student.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Joining O'Connor's majority opinion were Chief Justice William
H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy and
Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg
and Stephen G. Breyer dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the four, Stevens attacked the majority decision,
saying: ``As a matter of policy, the court ranks protection of the
school's district's purse above the protection of immature high
school students that those rules would provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also said the decision ``thwarts the purposes of Title
IX'' of a 1972 law denying federal aid to schools that allow
discrimination against girls in sports and other school activities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that under the 1972 law,
sexually harassed students may collect monetary damages from their
schools and school officials. But it did not say what standard
should be used for imposing liability on a school district for the
intentional acts of one of its teachers.

   FLORIDA-FIRES _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The firefighting

beef prices. (Palm Beach Post)

LAWSUIT SAYS TEXAS LOST $1 BILLION IN MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Stands for MEDICAID-FRAUD)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MacCORMACK  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Texas and the company that administers Medicaid in
the state have failed to collect $1 billion over the past decade,
according to a lawsuit filed by a former lawyer for the Texas
Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, brought by James M. Churchill of Austin, alleges
that state health officials and the National Heritage Insurance Co.
resisted his repeated efforts to compel private insurance companies
to reimburse Medicaid for their share of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 2 1/2 years, I tried to get people to do what they were
obligated to do. It's a shame it has to get down to this sort of
thing, but I was just totally frustrated,'' Churchill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last 10 years, an extremely conservative estimate
would be a billion dollars not collected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill, 57, retired a year ago and filed the lawsuit in
federal court in Pecos. Because it was filed on behalf of the
federal government, the lawsuit was sealed until late this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, senior U.S. District Judge Lucius D. Bunton
III rejected arguments by the defendants that the lawsuit should be
dismissed. The case is set now for trial in October in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General Dan Morales, who is defending
the state and the various state agencies involved, declined to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to appeal Judge Bunton's ruling regarding the
state's immunity, but we're not going to get into a discussion of
the state's defense,'' Morales spokesman Ron Dusek said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for National Heritage Insurance also would not
discuss the allegations in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the claim is legitimate, and we certainly
plan to vigorously defend ourselves,'' said Delbra Bristol of
Electronic Data Systems, parent company of National Heritage.
</P>
<P>
   EDS was founded by Ross Perot, the Dallas tycoon and former
presidential candidate. Perot sold the company to General Motors
more than a dozen years ago. EDS since has been spun off from GM.
</P>
<P>
   National Heritage has administered Medicaid in Texas since 1977.
Its current contract dates from 1988.
</P>
<P>
   About 2.8 million people in Texas are eligible for Medicaid,
which is a state and federal health program for the poor and
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1997, the most recent for which statistics are
available, Medicaid paid $10.7 billion in Texas. About two-thirds
of it came from the federal government and the rest from the state.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, National Heritage received $91.4 million from
the state to administer the program.
</P>
<P>
   According to Churchill's lawsuit, the state and the federal
governments would have paid out far less if efforts had been made,
as required by federal law, to collect from commercial insurance
companies when they were responsible for medical bills.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if a passenger in an automobile was injured in a
collision and the driver of either vehicle was found at fault, that
driver's liability insurance should pay for the treatment of the
passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in numerous cases, Medicaid paid for the passenger's
treatment, and neither National Heritage nor the state sought
reimbursement, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply a matter of contacting the appropriate insurance
company and making a claim, but that has never been done,''
Churchill said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Churchill said the problem first came to his attention in late
1994 when a Health Department supervisor asked him to examine
collection guidelines as outlined in the contract the state had
with the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill said he found very little money was being collected.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, he said, numerous meetings were held with
National Heritage and Health Department officials to try and figure
out ways to increase collections from third parties.
</P>
<P>
   One idea was to have an outside law firm collect the money for a
percentage of the collections, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there were lots of law firms willing to do it,''
Churchill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then in late fall of 1995, we were told it wasn't going to
happen. I was real concerned. I thought the problem had been
solved. They had given us promises that by the first of January
1996 they would have a contract law firm in place doing this,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill said his own collection efforts proved his point.
According to the lawsuit, he negotiated $13.5 million in
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the lawsuit claims, senior Health Department
officials told him to stop discussing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such action constituted an active attempt by the Texas
Department of Health Health Care Financing to conceal and cover up
(National Heritage Insurance's) and the other defendants' failure
to comply with the requirements of federal law,'' he said.

J. BAKER THINKS BIG WITH PLANS FOR NEW CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Grande Central Big and Tall Clothing Co. is cq; budgeted as
JBaker-Acquire)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once known as a retailer that sold shoes, J. Baker Inc. took
another step Monday toward transforming itself into a merchant that
may someday be more famous for selling clothing to big men.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker currently operates Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall, a chain of
459 stores that outfits outsized chaps in low-cost apparel.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, the Canton, Mass. retailer plans to open a second
chain, to be known as Grande Central Big and Tall Clothing Co.,
that will aim at big guys who are willing to spend more money on
their wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for Grande Central to open about 40 stores in August
1999 and feature brand-name casual attire, in contrast to the
greater emphasis on house brands at Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall, said
Alan I. Weinstein, J. Baker's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the company's plans forced the timing of the
Grande Central announcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Weinstein said he was unprepared Monday to disclose
more information about Grande Central's store format and what brand
names it is likely to stock.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the decade, J. Baker sold shoes in such company-run
chains as Fayva and Parade of Shoes. These chains have since been
sold off, but the company continues to run licensed footwear
departments for such retailers as Bradlees Inc. and Ames Department
Stores Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As competition intensified and the likes of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.
started selling more shoes, J. Baker has sold some of its shoe
business and looked to emphasize big-and-tall clothing.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dry vegetation will continue to fuel brush fires over portions
of Florida Tuesday. The droughty conditions will abate in a few
spots as towering cumulus clouds yield potent afternoon
thunderstorms. The strongest storms will erupt near the east
Florida coast where a developing sea breeze front lifts the very
sultry air. Large hail and frequent lightning are possible.
Meanwhile, ample sun will cover the interior Southeast with some
isolated thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds and fog will plague eastern New England Tuesday as
moist onshore breezes persist. Clouds will yield to hazy sun over
the interior where isolated afternoon thundershowers are possible.
Overcast conditions will hug the southeast New England coast much
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of showers and strong thunderstorms will accompany a
jet stream disturbance crossing the upper Ohio Valley and central
Appalachians. Very heavy rain will occur in a few of the
thunderstorms. Farther west, plenty of sunshine and slightly less
humid air will spread into the northern Great Lakes as high
pressure arrives from Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Brisk winds from the south will transport hot and increasingly
humid into the central and northern Plains Tuesday. As the muggy
air intercepts a slow-moving front, severe thunderstorms capable of
spawning tornadoes will develop over the Dakotas and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated thunderstorms will form in parts of the northern
Rockies as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead. The remainder
of the West will be dry and mainly sunny though low clouds will
cover sections of the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Pennsylvania Deluge
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm stalled over the southern Poconos on Sunday
afternoon and deposited 5.5 inches of rain in three hours on
Lehighton. There were estimates of as much as 7 inches in parts of
Carbon County in northeastern Pennsylvania with serious flooding.
The storm formed along the boundary between marine air covering
much of southern New England and a steamy air mass over the Middle
Atlantic states. A weather balloon launched from New York City at
daybreak on Sunday indicated winds were less than 15 miles an hour
from the ground to 30,000 feet, and this was the prime ingredient
for sluggish storms. Only minor changes in the weather pattern
Tuesday could raise the risk of more slow-moving storms near the
East Coast. &QL;

 &HT;    Creatine just part of daily diet for many athletes
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Creatine has become the food of the gods. The
nutritional supplement, little-known or used before this decade,
has become almost standard issue for our athletic heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is helping to fuel Mark McGwire's home-run binge. John
Elway and the Denver Broncos gulped it down on the way to their
first-ever Super Bowl win. Sprinter Michael Johnson used it on his
way to running a stunning world record in the 200 meters in the
1996 Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Texas, while some coaches remain leery of
it, creatine is being counted on to help a 4-7 team return to
football glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creatine is the hottest thing on the market,'' said Jeff
Madden, UT's new assistant athletic director for strength and
conditioning. ``It works extremely well. I've been using it for
years. I've had guys put on 20 or 30 pounds and they're gaining
lean muscle mass ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to name the football programs that aren't using
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Texas, as with other college and professional programs,
players can choose whether or not to use creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine, an amino acid compound, has been touted as a safe and
legal alternative to steroids and can easily be purchased as a
powder, tablet or in a drink at health food stores. It's estimated
that 50 percent of NFL players and 25 percent of pro baseball,
basketball and hockey players use it. Proponents of the supplement
say that it might be helpful in just about every sport except
bowling and billiards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, no one really knows what its long-term effects on the body
are, particularly as its use filters down to younger and younger
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say 80 to 85 percent of the athletes at our high school
camps have used creatine or some other supplement,'' Madden said.
</P>
<P>
   Salesmen now call local high schools about buying creatine in
bulk, and one company even has a product, Crea-TEEN, aimed at
athletes from 19 years on down to 8 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine was first identified in 1832 by a French scientist who
found it to be a naturally occurring organic compound in meat. Its
name is derived from the Greek word for flesh.
</P>
<P>
   It is produced naturally by the liver and kidneys, about two
grams a day in humans. Another gram or so can can be obtained by
eating meat and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine is stored in muscles and allows muscles to regenerate
adenosine triphosphate, the major fuel used in explosive movements.
It is also thought to inhibit the buildup of lactic acid, which
contributes to muscle fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some steroids, creatine does not make a person faster or
stronger almost automatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a magic bullet,'' said Dan Pfaff, a UT assistant
track coach who has worked with Olympic 100-meter champion Donovan
Bailey and other world-class athletes. ``But there's no doubt it
works. There are weight gains and strength gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have claimed performance strength and speed gains as
great as 5 and 10 percent and there are anecdotal reports of
strength gains of 20 percent and more. At the elite level of
competition, a 3-percent edge is huge. It's the difference between
running a 10.1-second 100 meters and maybe missing the Olympic
final, or running a 9.8 and getting the gold medal and the lion's
share of the lucrative endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Although synthetic creatine was manufactured as early as the
late 1950s, it was decades before it came into vogue. More powerful
performance enhancers, anabolic steroids, became the rage, starting
in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 the International Olympic Committee began testing for
anabolic steroids and in Seoul in 1988, the drug problems came to a
head. Among the 10 athletes who tested positive at the Games was
Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson, a hunk of bulging muscle who
exploded to a 9.79 100 meters. Just as disturbing as Johnson's
disgrace were rumors that other gold-medal winners had escaped
detection. With the reputation of the Olympics, and ultimately its
mega-million TV contracts at stake, a crackdown was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992 in Barcelona, performances by both the West and the
former Eastern Bloc athletes were something less than eye popping.
In the showcase event, the men's 100 meters, only one competitor
was able to break 10.0 seconds and that was 32-year-old Linford
Christie, who became by far the oldest 100-meter winner in Olympic
history. Christie had been using creatine, as had another British
athlete who had good results that year, hurdler Colin Jackson.
Jackson would go on to set a world record in the 110-meter hurdles
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   British researchers had been working with creatine, as had Dr.
Eric Hultman at Sweden's prestigious Karolinska Institute. The
Karolinska Institute awards the Nobel Prize for physiology or
medicine. Hultman has studied how muscles work for more than 30
years and was a pioneer of carbohydrate loading, which became a
tactic for elite athletes and even recreational 10-kilometer
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Hultman was working on creatine loading in the late 1980s,
although results were not published until 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 1, 1992, the year began in the worst way imaginable for
the Nebraska football team. In the Orange Bowl the University of
Miami football team, aiming for yet another national championship,
was trying to name its own score against the Huskers. The
Hurricanes handed Nebraska its first shutout in 221 games and held
the vaunted Nebraska running game to a puny 82 yards. The nation
saw Husker strength mocked by Hurricane speed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, 1991 and 1992 the Cornhuskers were stuck on nine wins,
a good season for most teams, but the fewest games Coach Tom
Osborne had won in Lincoln and hardly an acceptable number for a
program that considered itself on the cutting edge of athletic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Also stuck at a plateau was the strongest guy in Nebraska's
weight room, shot putter Kevin Coleman. In 1990 he was throwing
just less than 60 feet, but couldn't improve on that in 1991.
Coleman, now the strength coach at Kansas, began using creatine. In
1992 he bettered 65 feet, and won the NCAA indoor championships in
both 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, half a dozen Nebraska football players were trying
creatine. Then dozens were downing it. Then, most of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that's getting overblown,'' said Boyd Epley,
Nebraska's assistant athletic director of athletic performance.
``It's a food, not a drug. It's not a steroid. Your body produces
it naturallly. It's just one of five supplements we use.''
</P>
<P>
   Epley said the Cornhuskers recently made a change in the way
they did sets and repetitions that produced more strength gains
than creatine did. Still, the Huskers, who were unable to win a
national championship in Osborne's first two decades as Nebraska
coach, have won three in the last five years, during which time
they are 60-3.
</P>
<P>
   Madden said some of his athletes first began using creatine when
he was at Colorado in the early 1990s. In 1993 a Golden, Colo.,
company, Experimental and Applied Sciences, began marketing
creatine. A year later the Dietary Supplement Health and Education
Act was passed. The result of it was that supplements, including
creatine, no longer had to prove they were safe and effective. The
burden of proof shifted to the Food and Drug Administration to
prove they weren't.
</P>
<P>
   As for the athletic arena, Pfaff said, ``I think the governing
bodies of some sports were glad it came out. It got a lot of
athletes away from steroids. They finally had a legal substance
they could use for an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1995 creatine was a $30 million-a-year business and EAS had
90 percent of it.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 at the Olympic Games the use of creatine was widespread
among male and female athletes from a variety of countries. After
the Olympics creatine demand started swelling in local health food
store and even more college football teams began using it. Some
encountered problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the heat of two-a-days, cramping became almost epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Ellis, coordinator of performance nutrition for Nebraska,
blamed much of that cramping on a 1995 NCAA rule that allowed
players to practice in half pads, rather than beginning two-a-days
in shorts and shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis explained, ``Luckily we had a head coach who saw that
cramping was not unique to athletes who used creatine and so we
turned our focus to hydration feeding protocols. Unfortunately, at
a few schools creatine didn't survive the transition and I have
witnessed them literally throw the baby out with the bath water.''
</P>
<P>
   Epley said, ``We've never had cramping problems. It's like a
salt. It soaks up water. You just need to drink more water.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other side effects can include diarrhea and bloating. Dana
LeDuc, a former strength coach at Texas who is now with the NFL's
Seattle Seahawks, said that concerns about possible cramping and
even muscle tears are why some Seahawks, epecially those in the
speed positions, have not used creatine. LeDuc estimates that about
50 percent of the Seahawks use creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine use is heavier on the Broncos. After the Broncos became
a rare AFC Super Bowl champion with a powerful NFC-style ground
game, the Broncos were shown on national TV wearing EAS caps.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, McGwire is just one of several weightlifting
aficionados using creatine. Superstar catcher Mark Piazza is
another and Baltimore's Brady Anderson was one of the sport's
earliest converts. In seven years bouncing between Baltimore and
the minors Anderson had hit only 41 career home runs. Then he
discovered creatine in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Anderson hit 21 homers with Baltimore and slugged 50 in
1996. While expansion and diluted pitching have contributed to the
home run binges changing baseball, some experts feel weightlifting
and creatine also have altered the game. At the College World
Series, where the championship game was won by Southern California
with a football-sized score of 21-14, all eight coaches said there
were players on their teams who had used creatine.
</P>
<P>
   Creatine has now seeped down to the high schools, and not
everyone is pleased. Ron Schroeder, Westlake football coach, said
he gets calls from salesmen who want to market it through his
program. If it is not bought in bulk by a school, creatine can
typically cost an athlete from $30 to $60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said that there might be some individuals on the team
who use creatine or other supplements, but, ``What we push is three
square meals a day. You want your kids to be dedicated, but you
don't want them to sell their souls.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said: ``I'm against giving it to high school athletes.
They use it like it's a magic tablet.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pfaff said: ``The inherent danger is that kids get into a
psychological state that if a little is good, more is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, no one seems to know how much creatine is too
little or too much. Jackson reportedly uses 20 grams a day, an
amount recommended only in the early loading stage. Nebraska,
however, doesn't believe in loading and bases its doses on weight.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of the success linked to creatine there are still some
skeptics. Texas women's swim coach Jill Sterkel said, ``I've been
around long enough to know there's usually a side effect to
something ... I don't think there's anything that replaces hard
work. I don't feel it's appropriate for me to tell them what to
take when I don't know what the long-term effects are.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas women's track coach Bev Kearney added, ``I get notes on it
all the time. People say ``You've got to do it. You've got to do
it.' I would prefer our athletes depend on what's in their
hearts.''

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Ocean of information available for boating
enthusiasts
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Long before there were brave surfers navigating
cyberspace, there were men -- and women -- who went to sea in
boats.
</P>
<P>
   While you might not be ready to go to sea today, this is the
right time of the year to spend some time on a lake, river or pond
in a boat. Whether you are an old hand or just now considering
taking up boating, you can use the sea of information on the World
Wide Web to set a fun and safe course.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go boating. In fact, let's go to Lets Go Boating, a Web
site at http://www.letsgoboating.com/. This is a good starting
point because most of the information is aimed at the beginner.
You'll find topic areas such as ``How much does it cost?'' ``Where
can I go?'' and ``How do I learn?'' There's also a link that will
take you to an area that will let you search for local marinas (a
great resource, since many both rent and sell boats).
</P>
<P>
   Our next port of call is called Boating America, and you can
find it at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .boatingamerica.com/. This is really a fine place to spend some
time. One of the few things associated with boating that doesn't
cost money are the stories boaters tell each other, some of 'em
true. You'll find a selection of these stories on this page.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the start. You'll also be able to get
information about boating conditions in each of the states, browse
classified ads for boats that are for sale, and view sections
featuring gadgets that can soon deplete even the most generous
budget and tips on boating safety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the handiest features here is the bulletin board section
at http://www.boatingamerica
</P>
<P>
   .com/bbs/. You'll be able to leave notes for other users, asking
for advice or giving it. Things get really specific here. Where
else could you find a heated discussion about the valve adjustments
for a Mercury 3.0-liter Mercruiser engine? The value of this area
is the ability to get the sort of exact information and help you
wouldn't be able to find in the articles and features.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best boating water around can be found in Army Corps
of Engineers lakes. That's why you may want to bookmark a site at
http://www.gorp.com
</P>
<P>
   /gorp/resource/us(underscore)nra/ace
</P>
<P>
   /ga.htm that lets you search these lakes and recreation areas by
state. You'll find 10 entries for Georgia, starting with Lake
Allatoona and finishing up with West Point Lake. Once on that page,
you can click on any of the 10 entries for screens full of really
specific information -- everything from fees, to a breakdown of the
recreational facilities and launching areas, to information about
hiking and camping.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Mall at http://
</P>
<P>
   www.themarinemall.com/ is mostly about buying stuff, but then so
is boating. There's a discussion forum that has areas for topics
such as fishing, boat handling and mechanical and maintenance tips.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find also links here to various retailers and
manufacturers as well as a classified ad listing. But there is
more, including links to various other boating pages as well as
links to weather information and a boating events calendar.
</P>
<P>
   One link that should come in especially handy is to the U.S.
Coast Guard. You'll find tips for boating safety here as well as
help understanding the rules and regulations for boating.

 &HT;    Just for Fun: Philips' hand-held unit performs many functions
worthy of PC
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTANTA _ The Velo 500 from Philips is a hand-held PC whose
price and functions land it midway between a personal digital
assistant and a laptop PC.
</P>
<P>
   Using Windows CE (the pared-down version of Windows) as the
operating system and 24 megabytes of memory, the Velo can perform
many of the tasks of a portable PC, including light word
processing, connecting to the Internet and sending and receiving
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Equipped with a large, bright screen, the Velo is easy to see
and use. It has a built-in 28.8k bps modem, which is accessed
through a pop-up phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   With miniature card slots for memory expansion and system
software upgrades, the unit is totally upgradable and will be
useful for years to come. Like other PDAs, the Velo has a tiny
keyboard, which reduces typing to hunt-and-peck.
</P>
<P>
   A docking station, AC adapter, phone cable and rechargable
battery pack are included.
</P>
<P>
   The Velo 500 has a suggested retail price of $650. For more
information, visit the Web site http://www.velo.philips.com.
</P>
<P>
   Saving your memories
</P>
<P>
   The Snapshot Photo Scanner can help you turn that shoebox full
of snapshots into a digital photo album in your computer. When
digitized, the images can be stored for posterity, edited for fun
and profit, or incorporated into other documents.
</P>
<P>
   Just plug the scanner into any Windows-compatible PC (sorry Mac
users) and the unit is ready to go. It will accept photos up to 4
inches by 6 inches and deliver images with an 800-by-1,200 pixel
resolution, in a rainbow of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Bundled with a variety of image-editing software, the package
contains everything you need to organize and store images or create
dazzling documents, snazzy images and other special effects. You
can also use the software to drop your pictures into pre-designed
greeting cards, invitations, certificates or awards. Or you can
create your own cards and calendars and send them all as e-mail
messages.
</P>
<P>
   For information, visit the Web site http://www.kodak.com.
</P>
<P>
   Quick, grab that image
</P>
<P>
   Another good way to get images into your computer is with the
QuickClip from Connectix. The difference between this unit and a
scanner is that QuickClip is an image-capture device, able to grab
video images as well as still images from a source and transfer
them to a computer file.
</P>
<P>
   QuickClip will grab images from a camcorder, VCR or laser disc
and place them into Web pages, newsletters and e-mail messages. It
comes with all the necessary software to capture images and store
them in a number of sizes and formats.
</P>
<P>
   Though it works well with Windows 95, QuickClip is designed
primarily for use with Windows 98 and is one of the first USB
devices available for video capture. It can grab up to 15 frames
per second and digitize them to a PC image in less than a minute.
</P>
<P>
   QuickClip retails for $99 and can be seen at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .connectix.com.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanical helper
</P>
<P>
   Emiglio is a multitalented, remote-controlled robot that can
serve as waiter or the life of the party. His eyes light up and his
helmet flashes as he roams about the room doing his master's
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   With movements directed with a wireless remote control, this
2-foot-tall robot can carry refreshments on a removable tray and
transport small objects in his spring-loaded digits or larger
objects in his included backpack.
</P>
<P>
   A microphone in the remote lets users supply Emiglio's voice. He
can speak in your voice or transform your words into a futuristic
digitized voice or a mechanical-sounding robot voice.
</P>
<P>
   When the party's over, Emiglio becomes a sentry night light.
Just plug in the included AC adapter and his helmet glows to
illuminate a hallway, entry or child's room.
</P>
<P>
   Available from the Sharper Image, Emiglio retails for $99.95.

 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- If you're looking for a powerful yet inexpensive
alternative to Microsoft's Word 98, check out Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   The price of this word processor has been lowered to $85.95,
making it a heck of a good deal. Nisus (pronounced ``nicest'') not
only offers most of Word's features, it can do many things the
market leader cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus, for example, has 10 editable clipboards, unlimited undos,
synchronized scrolling between windows and the ability to rename a
document without closing it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Nisus has a more-powerful find feature, letting you
search and change things across several documents at the same time.
And it has an interactive page preview feature that immediately
updates a document as you change margins, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Upgrading to Word 98 would cost $149. A new stand-alone version
of Word costs $399.
</P>
<P>
   Some features missing
</P>
<P>
   While strong, Nisus does have some glaring weaknesses that make
it a poor choice for some tasks. It lacks, for example, the
powerful outlining feature in Word. Nor does it support
multiple-column formats in a single document view.
</P>
<P>
   Its table feature is also weak compared with Word's, which now
lets you draw tables of any size in a document.
</P>
<P>
   But for writing -- whether a one-page letter or a 1,000-page
book -- Nisus is hard to beat.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, the program is lean. Nisus needs 5.5 megabytes of
internal memory to run, while Word takes nearly twice that amount.
It's also faster and more responsive than either Word or
WordPerfect.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that, unlike its competitors, Nisus runs out of a
computer's internal memory. Sometimes that can cause problems, but
most of them can be fixed by giving Nisus more internal memory.
</P>
<P>
   Uncluttered look
</P>
<P>
   Unlike any other word processor, Nisus sports a simple, clean
look. Your screen is not cluttered with bars of buttons as with
Word and ClarisWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus has plenty of buttons and toolbars, but they are hidden
until you call them up. Most of them reside as tiny buttons drawn
into the right margin and bottom left corner of a document.
</P>
<P>
   One of Nisus' greatest strengths is the ease of adjusting it to
your personal working style. You can assign keyboard commands to
any function. Automating repetitive chores is also a breeze. You
can also assign a keyboard command to any automated task.
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike Word 98, Nisus works with any Mac. That includes
older models such as the IIsi, the Classic and the LC.
</P>
<P>
   You can try out Nisus Writer by downloading a free demo from the
company's Web site at
http://www.nisus.com/nisus(underscore)writer.html. Give it try
before automatically opting for Word 98.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Get ready for the inevitable visit of Windows 98
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Back when I was a kid, the arrival of my Uncle Bill
at our house was a great event.
</P>
<P>
   He lived in Alaska and -- to folks living in Arkadelphia, Ark.
-- that was every bit as exotic as if he were a permanent resident
of Mars or Paris, France ... both places seemed about as far away.
</P>
<P>
   The house was cleaned, we stocked up on the sort of food we
usually ate on Sundays, and my brother and I got new blue jeans.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to tell you that Windows 98 is anything as
important as the arrival of my Uncle Bill. After all, he usually
gave us silver dollars and told stories about Alaskan-grown
strawberries that got danged near as big as heads of lettuce. Uncle
Bill was a storyteller and free with his money.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is merely an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But some of you will need to get ready for its arrival. You
probably won't need new blue jeans, but you do need to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   As the arrival of Windows 98 draws near, let's talk about how
you can get your computer ready for the newest version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you've already taken care of the first item on my list,
adding RAM. All the versions of Windows, including 95, are about as
hungry as a puppy with a tapeworm. Forget all the minimum
requirements and make sure you have at least 32 megabytes. Get 64
if you possibly can. With either version of Windows, RAM works a
lot like a supercharger when it comes to speed. You will notice a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Next you need to take a hard look at your hard disk. Truth is,
even 1-gigabyte disks are becoming too small for folks with a full
complement of programs. The good news is that hard disks -- just as
is true with RAM chips -- are cheaper than ever. The bad news is
that all these cheap prices can sure add up if you need RAM and a
bigger hard disk.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also want to consider a faster modem if you have anything
less than a 56k bps modem. Now what, you ask, does upgrading a
modem have to do with installing Windows?
</P>
<P>
   Besides the fact this is an Internet world nowadays, Windows
uses the Web for a remarkable feature that automatically looks for
updates to Windows itself and then helps you install them. That
means that, if you use the built-in feature, it's less likely
you'll miss an important bug fix or software update. But some of
these updates are huge -- 6 or more megabytes. You'll want to make
the download fast enough to make the process relatively pain-free.
</P>
<P>
   Next, make a quick inventory of multimedia accessories such as
video card, sound card and the like. Windows makes good use of
graphics and sound, but if your computer is more than three years
old, you'll likely want updates here.
</P>
<P>
   One thing I wouldn't worry about is rushing out to buy a new
computer to take advantage of the USB (universal serial bus)
technology. Don't get me wrong. It's neat stuff -- with USB you'll
be able to connect a lot of gadgets to your serial bus without
worrying about conflicts. But you'll be buying a new computer soon
enough, so don't use USB as an excuse. If your PC is at least a
Pentium running at 166 megahertz, it should do just fine with
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, check your wallet. If you are like most people, you'll
soon need to find about $109 because -- no matter what you think
now -- you'll almost certainly upgrade to Windows 98 within the
next three or four months.

 &HT;    ConsumerWatch: Texas at odds with self-help publisher
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Another showdown is building in Texas, but this time
it's not between the sheriff and the outlaw. Rather, it's between
Nolo Press Inc. and the state legal establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Nolo Press, a major publisher of self-help law books and
software, has been summoned to a hearing in August with the Texas
Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee to determine if Nolo Press
is violating its rules.
</P>
<P>
   All states have laws or court rulings that prohibit
non-attorneys from engaging in the practice of law, including
personally representing or advising others on legal matters. Nolo
Press contends it is not practicing law.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, several states have acted against firms or
individuals that describe themselves as paralegals and that sell
legal services to individuals -- services such as the completion of
divorce or bankruptcy papers.
</P>
<P>
   The California-based publisher, which has sold more than 7
million copies of its books and software, contends its materials
are written to help individuals handle their own legal affairs --
which is generally legal, especially in civil matters -- and such
publications are protected under the free press provisions of the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nolo Press is a publisher of basic legal tools and information
designed to allow Americans -- many of whom cannot afford to pay
lawyers upward of $175 an hour -- to gain the information necessary
to cope with their everyday legal problems,'' said Ralph Warner,
publisher of Nolo Press, which was founded in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Warner cites a ruling by a New York court to support his
contention that Nolo Press' activities are protected by the First
Amendment. A lower court had ruled previously that a do-it-yourself
legal book on avoiding probate constituted the unauthorized
practice of law. But the decision was overruled in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we are to extend a rule of suppression beyond the
obscene, the libelous (or) utterances tending to incitement, there
is no warrant (to ban the book),'' the high court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no federal court decision on the issue. Self-help
law books and software, published by Nolo Press or other firms, are
sold in all states.
</P>
<P>
   John T. Adams, clerk of the Texas Supreme Court, said the
Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee is not an arm of the court,
and the court does not direct its activities, although it appoints
the committee's members.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the committee believes it has found an instance of
unauthorized practices, its remedy, if the unauthorized
practitioner does not agree to cease the activity, is to seek an
injunction in court,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   If Texas does enjoin the sale of Nolo Press materials in the
state, it would be a difficult ruling to enforce. Texas retailers
could be stopped, but the state would also have to try to enjoin
Internet sales by several online book and software sellers.

 &HT;    Shoulder yet to slow down Norman's fast lane
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   He flew across the country and back.
</P>
<P>
   He looked at a boat he's thinking about buying.
</P>
<P>
   He posed, with his dogs, for a calendar shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman, in other words, has spent U.S. Open week being Greg
Norman, with one notable exception. He's not golfing.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, who underwent surgery on his left shoulder in April to
clean out stuff the guys with the scalpels say they usually see in
quarterbacks or tennis players, doesn't expect to start hitting
balls until August. And even then, he'll only chip them.
</P>
<P>
   Norman is aiming at his own Shark Shootout in November as the
time he'll return to competition, but the 1998 PGA Tour season is
long lost.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the forced hiatus, Norman said he would use
the time away from golf as a gauge to see how much he might miss
the game when he gives it up (of his own accord) for good. Though
he'll be only 44 years old next February, Norman has spoken of
getting out of the game by the turn of the millennium or soon
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   So?
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't missed it,'' Norman said. ``I've turned my mind off
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   What that means is Norman has had to work at missing golf, which
probably means he misses it more than he cares to let on.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Norman seldom strays into his golf room on the
family's Hobe Sound estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That way, I don't look at my clubs and don't touch them,''
Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   But when he happened to visit San Francisco this week _ site of
Olympic Club and the U.S. Open, which began Thursday _ Norman's
interest was piqued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in my hotel room watching interviews from the
course, and I thought, `I should be there. I wish I could be
playing,''' said Norman, who was in the area in conjunction with
his design work at The Course at Wente Vineyards in suburban
Livermore. ``I missed it there. I did. I'll admit that.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was something Norman noticed while watching those
television interviews that reminded him of part of the game he has
grown to despise. It didn't seem to him that many guys were having
much fun getting ready to deal with Olympic Club and the annual
U.S. Open test featuring deep rough, fast greens and frayed nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was on Tuesday,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that major championships, save for two British Open titles,
have been a laughfest for Norman through the years. He's endured
his share of trauma, some of it self-inflicted and some of it
heaped upon him in unbelievable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But all those experiences, plus the extended period of
recuperation in which he now finds himself, have brought Norman to
the edge of the final stages of his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so different on the outside looking in,'' Norman said.
``When you're inside, you're so busy trying to build to an edge
that you don't always see what's happening. You just know you feel
tired. Well, it's because things get stale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll go back re-invigorated, but I hope I can keep the
perspective I have now.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll watch some golf this weekend _ ``I'd be a liar if I said I
wouldn't,'' Norman said _ but won't plop himself in front of the
set for hours on end. Later this summer, he'll work for CBS during
the network's PGA Championship coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's the new-fangled jet he's going to test.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Norman being Greg Norman.
</P>
<P>
   Golf or no golf.

   ATLANTA -- Technology breeds technology.
</P>
<P>
   The more big advances in high tech become a part of our lives --
offering new methods to communicate, work and play -- the more
little devices come piggy-backing into view, offering themselves as
ways to do all those things a tad more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Television gave us the remote control. Computers have spawned
all manner of software, not to mention the Internet and e-mail. And
then there are phones. For decades, families were happy to have a
working phone line that led to the black square phone sitting on a
desk.
</P>
<P>
   Bt times have changed. Now there are cordless phones for home
and wireless phones for the road. Along with those advances come
some potential problems. For instance, you can't be in two places
at once -- at least, not yet -- and if you are on the road, you're
missing calls at home. Oh, sure, you have an answering machine or
voice mail, but to get the messages you'll either have to go home
or remember to dial in.
</P>
<P>
   But for some people -- especially those running home offices or
small businesses -- it would be nice to hear the phone ring right
away. Even better would be a way to screen calls. For mobile
professionals, a combination of those services could be very
useful. Especially for those people who are paged each time they
get a message, yet don't want to talk to everyone who calls.
</P>
<P>
   Phone analysts have talked for years about a future in which
everyone will have one number, a system that will follow you around
from one phone to another. And some phone companies -- including
MCI and BellSouth -- have offered services in which calls can be
forwarded to wherever you are.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the hardware option. You will need at least
two phone lines, but SoloPoint, a California-based company, offers
a device that is meant to give users both screening and ``real
time'' access to home calls from the road.
</P>
<P>
   The SoloPoint M-200 hooks to your home phone. When a call comes
in, the M-200 immediately dials your wireless phone -- or a remote
wired phone, if you like -- which should ring within a few moments.
After picking up whichever line you are near, you are given a
chance to listen to the caller leave a message. Then it's up to you
whether you want to connect to the caller by pushing a button. If
you just hang up, the caller never knows you were listening in,
says Don Nanneman, a vice president at SoloPoint.
</P>
<P>
   The M-200 costs $250 and can be ordered directly from the
company (1-888-765-6225). For more information, call Solopoint
(408-364-8850) or visit its Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .SoloPoint.com).

<P>
   Newsprint, the Net and truth
</P>
<P>
   The Net is bad for the truth. We have all heard the concerns --
self-righteous and otherwise -- about truth as a victim in the
development of technology. The Internet has been targeted as the
scourge of responsible journalism, blamed for the death of
credibility, the demise of good reporting and the end of facts as
we know them.
</P>
<P>
   There was Pierre Salinger and his reliance on Net sources for
saying the U.S. military shot down TWA Flight 800. There was The
Dallas Morning News posting false reports about Secret Service
agent voyeurs. There was Matt Drudge and his false reports about
Sidney Blumenthal. There was Matt Drudge and his true reports about
the investigation of President Clinton. There was ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   You also may have noticed the recent embarrassment The New
Republic suffered as the result of stories written by Stephen
Glass. The reporter apparently spent a lot of time making things
up, while creating evidence such as notes, Web sites, voice mail
messages and faxes to support his stories. According to New York
Times reporter Robin Pogrebin, Glass spent as much time creating
fiction to lend his stories believability as he would have taken to
do them correctly.
</P>
<P>
   The work of young Glass -- by all accounts, a talented writer --
raises questions about journalism and technology and shows the
dangers of making assumptions -- which is, by the way, the first
principle of journalism. Neither the Net nor print seems to have a
monopoly on truth-telling. Glass' concoctions ran, not on the Net,
but in the mainstream and respectable printed press. His pieces
were in Rolling Stone, George and Harper's, and he had a story
scheduled for The New York Times Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   His deception came to light as the result of work by Forbes
Digital Tool, an online news operation.

   AOL settles sailor's complaint
</P>
<P>
   There's been a settlement with Tim McVeigh -- not the Oklahoma
bomber, the sailor who had the beef with America Online.
</P>
<P>
   That McVeigh, who listed his marital status as ``gay'' in an
online profile, was identified to Navy officials by AOL after the
online service had promised its users anonymity. The Navy lost a
court case over its investigation of McVeigh and gave him full
retirement benefits. Now AOL has admitted settling McVeigh's
complaint against it, saying the breach of privacy was caused by a
human error and that customer service reps will undergo ``scenario
training'' so they don't give out any more personal data, according
to The Industry Standard's Media Grok.
</P>
<P>
   AOL will pay an undisclosed amount in damages to McVeigh,
according to Media Grok, which covers and comments on the Internet.

device that lets notebook and personal computers wirelessly connect
from distances up to 800 feet to ``a remote computer, modem,
printer or other peripheral.'' The link is made using a 900 MHz
signal, which can transmit data at a rate of 85k bps, according to
InnoMedia.

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Page design program hidden behind layouts
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- I haven't looked at Microsoft Publisher in several
years, and my first glimpse of Publisher 98 was something of a
shock; it appeared to have been dumbed down rather severely.
</P>
<P>
   It has more wizards than the last five Tolkien rip-offs put
together. You want to do a nice newsletter? Fine. Here are two
dozen possibilities, each just a little different from the other,
and none anything like what you have in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It resembles, in fact, programs from what Microsoft apparently
views as its chief rivals, PrintMaster and Print Shop. Both of
those programs are intended to help people put together simple
broadsheets, greeting cards and the like.
</P>
<P>
   I had always thought of Publisher as standing between those very
simple and relatively inflexible layout programs and the high-end,
highly complicated productions like PageMaker.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it does not come with a manual; rather, there is a thin
booklet called a Companion. It seems more oriented toward design
philosophy than program instruction, although the latter can be
found there.
</P>
<P>
   I had just about decided Microsoft had thrown Publisher to the
dogs when things began to fall together and I discovered the old,
relatively muscular page design program lurking under all the
layers of generic, pre-masticated layouts.
</P>
<P>
   You can still set up your own text and picture frames quite
easily, and build a newsletter your own way, if you have a good
idea of how you want it to look. This seems a lot easier than
taking one of the pre-formatted designs and trying to hammer it
into your own concept, unless your concept is pretty similar to the
set piece.
</P>
<P>
   If you select Blank Publications, you can then pick from a full
page, a postcard, a business card, a book fold, side fold or top
fold card, a tent card, a poster, a banner or an index card, which
should cover everything you might need. You can also do a Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Web page creation, though, appears to be the most important new
thing about Publisher 98. It does Web pages easier, if not as
elaborately, as Microsoft's Front Page.
</P>
<P>
   You can build a Web page the same way you make a newsletter --
using frames for text, objects and graphics. Any of these frames
can be made into links to other pages or other sites or to large
blocks of text. It seems the only significant things missing are
the Web-bot features of Front Page.
</P>
<P>
   Unification is also emphasized in Publisher. If, for instance,
you have set up a standard newsletter format in Publisher, you can
translate that directly into a Web page design. The program will
examine the newsletter for elements that won't work properly on the
Internet, point them out and suggest what you can do about them.
</P>
<P>
   The program has been unified, itself, to look like the core
Microsoft Office programs. Creating text works the way it does in
Word, with background spell-checking and auto-correction. Of
course, it brings in text from Word readily.
</P>
<P>
   The program assumes the output is going to be sent to a color
inkjet printer. Most folks using a program like this don't expect
to be sending their output off on disk for high-end offset
printing. Nonetheless, if that's what you have in mind, it includes
an Imagesetter print driver, with the option of installing a print
driver from your printer.
</P>
<P>
   Publisher 98 is a really slick piece of work, especially for
people who want to set up a Web site and then have some paper goods
-- the ever-present newsletter or even a restaurant menu -- that
follows the same style.

WEBER TRULY WORLDWIDE WITH GERMAN ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: pr bonn Public Relations GmbH is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the acquisition of a German public relations firm Monday,
Weber Public Relations Worldwide seems within striking distance of
its stated goal to become one of the world's five largest PR firms.
</P>
<P>
   Weber acquired pr bonn Public Relations GmbH, a firm with
revenues of $2.4 million. Terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed. Weber said the deal will increase its ability to provide
a wide range of PR services to global clients.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, if Weber can make a few more acquisitions, it's possible
a guy who once served a brief stint as a bodyguard for the Rolling
Stones two decades ago could be running the world's largest PR firm
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll almost certainly be in the top five by the end of the
year,'' said Larry Weber, the former bodyguard who is now the
chairman of Weber Public Relations Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996 the Cambridge, Mass. PR firm that Weber founded was
bought by a unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos., the New York
holding company that recently agreed to buy Hill Holliday Connors
Cosmopulos, Boston's second largest advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   When his firm was bought, Weber's new bosses issued him a
mandate: Through acquisitions, he was to transform a regional shop
into a global firm that could provide multinational giants with
one-stop shopping for a full range of PR services.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 18 months, Weber has made eight acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   For a firm that once specialized in helping high-tech companies,
acquisitions have given Weber expertise in such fields as health
care, investor relations, and government affairs. Acquisitions have
also given Weber entry into new geographical markets such as Latin
America and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few months trade publications and British
newspapers have reported that London-based Shandwick International,
the world's second-largest PR firm, may be an acquisition target,
along with its US sister company, Golin/Harris Communications of
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   News reports have identified Weber as one of several likely
Shandwick suitors. Weber declined to comment on Shandwick.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming conflict-of-interest issues could be resolved, an
acquisition of Shandwick and Golin/Harris could give Weber nearly
$300 million in annual revenues; in 1997, the tracking firm J.R.
O'Dwyer Co. ranked Burson-Marsteller as the world's largest PR firm
with 1997 revenues of $265 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Weber reported revenues of $61 million, good for 10th
place on O'Dwyer's list. Weber is now on pace to project 1998
revenues of about $90 million, an amount that would have landed
Weber in 7th place on last year's list.

DEMOCRATIC OPPONENT OF TEXAS GOVERNOR IN WASHINGTON FOR
FUND-RAISERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Democrats haven't exactly flocked to Garry
Mauro's campaign for governor, but the Clinton White House is
rallying to Mauro's defense in a big way this week.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and first lady Hillary Clinton will join Mauro
Tuesday night at back-to-back Washington fund-raisers that are
expected to raise about $250,000 for Mauro's uphill battle against
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore is scheduled to join Mauro in El Paso on
Thursday for a dinner that is expected to generate about $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro's foray to the nation's capital comes less than a week
after Bush raised more than $1 million at similar Washington
events. The dueling fund-raisers reflect the extent to which the
Texas contest has become a proxy war for the next presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By helping Mauro, the Clintons and Gore can reward a loyal
Democrat while sparring with a Republican governor who is
considered one of the top GOP prospects for the year 2000. Bush,
who leads the Republican pack in early presidential polls, has said
he will not make up his mind about a possible White House run until
well after the Texas re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   James Riddlesperger, a political science professor at Texas
Christian University, said the Clinton White House has a strong
self-interest in helping Mauro dent Bush's commanding lead. A Bush
rout could carry dozens of other Texas Republicans to victory and
boost Bush's national standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're trying to do is damage control. It's bad news all
the way down the ballot if your gubernatorial candidate is a
no-show,'' Riddlesperger said. ``In terms of national politics, you
don't want Bush to walk in uncontested to the governorship and be
able to use that as a springboard for a possible presidential
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to join Mauro and his donors at
dinner Tuesday night at the Sheraton Carlton Hotel, a few blocks
from the White House. The first lady will greet the guests at a
pre-dinner reception. Tickets are $1,000 for the reception and
$5,000 for the reception, the dinner and ``briefing sessions'' on
the Texas campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who met with Washington reporters Monday, said his
high-placed Washington allies are motivated by ``old-fashioned
friendship.'' Mauro has known the Clintons since 1972, when the
three of them worked on the Texas campaign of presidential
candidate George McGovern.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who has served as Texas land commissioner since 1983,
headed the state Clinton-Gore campaigns in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I've earned the right to run for governor, and
they're going to help, just like I helped them,'' Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   A White House aide agreed with Mauro's assessment but conceded
that the chance to tweak Bush ``makes it more fun'' to aid the
Texas Democrat. Tuesday night's fund-raiser will be the eighth time
that Hillary Clinton has attended a reception or dinner for Mauro.
President Clinton and Gore joined him at a Washington reception
last year, and Clinton recently signed a fund-raising letter on
Mauro's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Mauro's fellow Texas Democrats have not been nearly as
loyal. Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who is godfather to one of Mauro's
children, has endorsed Bush. More than 100 Democratic officeholders
in the state's 254 counties have also abandoned the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears the Washington Democrats _ specifically, President
Clinton, Hillary Clinton and Al Gore _ are propping up Garry
Mauro's campaign,'' said Mindy Tucker, a Bush campaign spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro will get a chance to energize Texas Democrats this weekend
when the party holds its state convention in San Antonio. Mauro
will speak to the delegates Saturday after introducing Gore on
Friday. The Democratic candidate shrugged off recent polls showing
Bush with a commanding lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's only one thing folks in Texas are talking about right
now, and that's 100-degree temperatures,'' Mauro said. ``When the
people of Texas stop talking about the weather and start talking
about the governor's race, they're going to look at the issues and
I'm going to do just fine.''

THE QUEEN IS BACK AT CENTRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Duchess of Kent didn't show up, and the Princess of
Tabloids called in sick. But the Queen of Forehands, who had felt
``seven or eight weeks ago that I couldn't make it, that it was all
over for me,'' returned to her grass-paved throne room, and
everything seemed right and proper on Wimbledon's sun-splotched
opening day after all.
</P>
<P>
   As the Garden of Eden of the game, where tournament tennis began
121 years ago, the Big W has been the apple of the eyes of numerous
queens, but none has seemed so snakebit as Steffi Graf. Yet here
she was, at a decrepit 29, seeking the social security of a tennis
court again _ the tennis court, Centre Court _ starting another
trek upward toward a Saturday 11 days distant where the
championship lies. It would be her eighth, one short of Empress
Martina Navratilova's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I can win,'' said Graf. ``I don't have any
feel, I'm nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   She never talked like that before. But then, she'd never been
away from her passion, her greatest love _ this game _ for so long,
and had her body and psyche so badly battered.
</P>
<P>
   Graf's score Monday _ 6-4, 6-1, over a lefthanded Spaniard, Gala
Leon Garcia _ would normally be a so-what? However, two years had
passed since she last gamboled on Centre, beating another Spaniard,
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, for another title in a run that began in
her Grand Slam year, 1988. So when Graf reappeared and made the
customary curtsy toward the Royal Box, the full house of 13,800
raised voices loud and warmly clapped for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   The Queen was unexpectedly back, and it was good to see her. Her
heart as big as the arena pumped grandly and the huge forehands
zinged damagingly. Abruptly her presence in the afternoon's second
engagement on Centre made Pete Sampras seem the warmup act as he
dusted Dominik Hrbaty, 6-3, 6-3, 6-2, with 17 aces in 83 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the radiant Duchess of Kent, she couldn't make
it. The Duchess, who usually graces the royal roost and has
presented the seven championship platters to Graf, sent her
roommate, the Duke, to do the family clapping. He has bad, if
earnest, hands, but gets them together somehow.
</P>
<P>
   The Princess of Tabloids _ 16-year-old Anna Kournikova _ was
another matter. When she was thumbed out Monday before striking a
ball, most of the scores of photographers on hand wept and wanted
to walk out with her.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was during Kournikova's career highlight victory
over Graf at Eastbourne last week that she took herself out of
Wimbledon by tumbling in the third set. That spill, as it turned
out, tore a ligament in her right thumb, and No. 10 Kournikova, a
semifinalist last year, withdrew at the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   The misfortunes of that defeat five days ago had Graf
uncharacteristically raging at line calls that went against her and
cursing herself audibly in German.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so uncertain, slow to react, didn't play my game,'' said
Graf, who typically was demanding much more of herself than
reasonable. It was only her fifth match since breaking down for a
second time within 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the insistence that her body support her for possibly one
last charge at Wimbledon got her here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it, but I'm 100 percent physically,'' said
Graf. ``Nothing hurts.'' But she wouldn't tell you if it did. No
tennis champion has played (and won) hurt more than she.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz Gunthardt, her coach, glowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes she can play again,'' said Gunthardt. ``She
wasn't sure it would happen, but now she believes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago I was in a clinic in Austria after surgery,'' said
Graf, who came apart in losing at the French to Amanda Coetzer and
had to have her left knee rebuilt. ``I was rehabbing for hours,
early morning to night. Treatments, treatments _ lasers,
acupuncture, magnetic fields, all kinds of stuff I never heard
of.''
</P>
<P>
   She was on court again in February. Two tournaments, then
another TKO. More leg problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would recover, try to practice and something else went
wrong,'' she said. ``I thought then I couldn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse than her body's disobedience was the emotional hammering
of her father's misdeeds: philandering, alcoholism, tax evasion,
jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's home now, it's fine,'' she said. Of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much hurt and anger within Steffi,'' said a
colleague, ``but she goes on. Tennis is her escape.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can stay healthy I'd like to play at least three more
years,'' said Graf. ``The records? I don't think about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 21 majors are three behind Margaret Court's all-time pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the playing, the being on court _ being here _ that
keeps me going,'' she said. ``That's what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Duchess and the Princess were missing, the Queen
was in her counting house, counting one more victory than most of
us would have bet on. You can't count her out.

GOVERNORS SPAR OVER COAL EMISSIONS RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A leaked computer message outlining how coal-burning utilities
should pretend to be upset over an air pollution plan that they
actually support has set off a nasty dispute between Northeastern
governors and their counterparts in the Midwest and South.
</P>
<P>
   The fight, part of a larger war over chemicals that travel on
the wind to New England from coal plants, centers on a US
Environmental Protection Agency plan to clamp down on emissions of
nitrogen oxide that contribute to summertime smog and acid rain.
States where the coal industry has long provided abundant, cheap
power say the EPA plan will cost thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The computer message, written by an executive at the biggest US
coal-burning utility, describes West Virginia Governor Cecil
Underwood's strategy to substitute a much less strict nitrogen
oxide plan. To make the plan seem tougher, Underwood ``believes it
would be most helpful if ... utility groups could audibly grumble
about the stringency of the proposal,'' according to the memo, sent
to members of a utility lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   The memo assures readers that Underwood's substitute plan, to be
unveiled this week by Underwood and other governors, would have
only ``minor alterations'' from the position of the
utility-controlled Alliance for Constructive Air Policy.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern officials said the memo revealed what they
suspected: that Midwestern and Southern politicians and power
companies are working in concert to defeat clean air standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned by the appearance ... of some kind of behind
the scenes conspiracy to both weaken EPA's program, but also to
present a potentially misleading appearance of the impact of the
(Underwood) plan,'' said Maine Department of Environmental
Protection Commissioner Ned Sullivan, who supports the EPA plan.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. Underwood denied that the governor is doing
anything improper, but he made no secret of his scorn for the EPA
plan, accusing Northeastern and EPA officials of waging economic
war against coal states.
</P>
<P>
   ``EPA and the Northeastern states seem to be pretty much intent
on putting the screws to industry in the Midwest and South,'' said
Underwood spokesman Rod Blackstone, estimating that his state would
lose 11,000 jobs under the EPA proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Southern environmentalists are also crying foul over the
strategy memo, noting that any weakening of nitrogen oxide
standards means more smog for the Southeast and Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole story is pitched as a Northeast versus Midwest
battle and the reality is we have serious'' smog problems in the
South, said Jeff Gleason of the Southern Environmental Law Center
in Virginia. He said Virginia had violated standards for ozone, the
key ingredient in smog, 25 times so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nitrogen oxide, a chemical by-product of combustion, forms ozone
when exposed to hot sun, and can increase water's acidity. Though
the EPA nitrogen oxide curbs would apply to 22 states, impact would
be heaviest on states that burn or produce coal.
</P>
<P>
   The June 18 message, written by Dale Heydlauff of American
Electric Power in Columbus, Ohio, and based on a talk with a top
West Virginia state official, lays out Gov. Underwood's ``strategy
to sell their package to other states and in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Underwood's alternate proposal would allow
substantially more nitrogen oxide emissions than the EPA plan,
Heydlauff wrote that Underwood's chief of operations Corky DeMarco
called for utilities to publicly gripe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utilities should be prepared to complain about the costs and
the difficulty of complying with the established deadlines (in the
Underwood plan),'' writes Heydlauff, on the steering committee of
the Alliance for Constructive Air Policy, ``but (Underwood)
obviously does not want us to oppose the proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   American Electric Power spokesman Pat Hemlepp said Heydlauff had
done nothing wrong. ``It's no different than any other lobbying
activity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection
Commissioner David Struhs said the computer message is an
embarrassment to foes of the EPA plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This illustrates the sophistication of the people with whom
we're dealing. They think they can send an e-mail to 118 people and
keep it confidential,'' Struhs said.

EX-FBI SUPERVISOR DENIES PROTECTING MOB FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As he ended two weeks of testimony Monday, the former
head of the FBI's organized crime squad in Boston reiterated that
he had no reservations about prosecuting his squad's top informants
_ James ``Whitey'' Bulger and Stephen ``The Rifleman'' Flemmi.
</P>
<P>
   But he also admitted that neither he nor his agents went out of
their way to quiz the criminal partners about their activities.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up his testimony before US District Judge Mark L. Wolf
in federal court, former FBI supervisor James A. Ring denied that
he kept the FBI out of an investigation of alleged drug dealing and
illegal gambling by Bulger and Flemmi in late 1984 so their roles
as informants would not be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That thought didn't cross my mind,'' Ring replied when asked
by Wolf if the FBI declined to take part in the Quincy-based probe
to avoid telling the judge considering a wiretap application that
Bulger and Flemmi were informants. ``I considered them to be fair
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, in the final series of questions put to Ring, wanted to
know how deeply the FBI delved into the ongoing criminal activity
of top-level informants like Bulger and Flemmi _ leaders of the
so-called Irish mob _ and whether informants believed the
information they gave their FBI handlers could be used against
them.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the FBI and the criminals it relied on
for information is at the heart of hearings before Wolf, who must
weigh Flemmi's claim that he and Bulger were given immunity from
prosecution in exchange for information they provided the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Flemmi, indicted along with Bulger and other reputed Mafia
figures in 1995, is asking that charges against him be dismissed
because any criminal activity he engaged in was authorized by the
FBI. Since the January 1995 indictment alleges a decades-long
conspiracy between the region's Irish and Italian mobs, dismissing
the charges against Flemmi would derail the case against his
alleged co-conspirators as well.
</P>
<P>
   A string of FBI employees, past and present, including Ring,
have testified that Bulger and Flemmi were never given immunity in
exchange for information.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf asked Ring to elaborate on earlier testimony in which he'd
said that he would never ask informants about crimes they were
committing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to investigate that informant, it should be
outside of that relationship,'' said Ring, who headed the organized
crime squad from 1983 until 1990. If he were to ask an informant
directly about his crimes, ``he'd think you're being really
stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ring said he was unaware that agents on other squads had dropped
investigations after speaking to Bulger and Flemmi's handler, agent
John Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the hearings, FBI agent James Blackburn testified
that he never pursued allegations that Bulger was shaking down drug
dealers after Connolly told him the ``street talk'' wasn't true.
</P>
<P>
   And agent James J. Lavin III testified last month that he
dropped an investigation into a guardrail being installed in front
of Bulger's South Boston liquor store _ allegedly by city workers _
after speaking to Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by Wolf, Ring said he never received any information
that agents had tipped off informants to investigations, wiretaps,
or upcoming indictments. Flemmi says he was tipped off to the
January 1995 indictment, but has not said by whom. Bulger fled
before he was indicted and remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you expect that if anything like that happened, efforts
would have been made to keep you from finding out?'' Wolf asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a premise I hadn't considered in 25 years (with the
FBI),'' Ring replied. ``But yes, (I suppose) they would have.''

LEYRITZ: AN INDIVIDUAL AMONG INDIVIDUALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maybe the real question is this: Just how much of a team game is
baseball, really?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is not football, where the running back cannot function
without appropriate line play. It's not hockey, where one person
cannot ordinarily skate through the entire opposing team (I know
Bobby Orr did just that on more than one occasion, but show me
another Bobby Orr). It's not basketball, where even Michael Jordan
would still be ringless were it not for the ongoing contributions
of Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is the sum accumulation of many individual occurrences.
Sure, you've got double plays and relay throws and outfielders
backing each other up and pitchers standing behind third base just
in case the throw gets away, but baseball is all about such things
as individual confrontation of pitcher vs. batter and the reality
that if a ball is hit or thrown at someone it is in his best
interest to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers pitch for themselves. Batters hit for themselves.
Fielders catch the ball for themselves. The culture of baseball
acknowledges statistical accomplishment as an end in itself, far
more so than in almost any other sport. You may argue that it
(itals)shouldn't(unitals) be that way, but it most certainly is.
</P>
<P>
   Fractious baseball teams have been successful. If I'm not
mistaken, Tris Speaker and either Duffy Lewis or Harry Hooper were
at such odds one season that the sum total of their dialogue
consisted of, ``I got it,'' followed by, ``You take it.'' Tinker
and Evers didn't share morning coffee, either. The Charley Finley
A's were united solely by their intense hatred of the owner
himself. There were many cabs for many players on those squads.
</P>
<P>
   So how much did it matter, really, whether Jim Leyritz was a
pain-in-the-buttsky? How much did it matter that Leyritz was far
more interested in securing enough at-bats to build up enough
statistics to get himself a very good contract than he was in
whether the Red Sox made the playoffs? Leyritz was a major
contributor to the cause in April, and there is no indication that
he was any more of a ``team'' guy then than he is today in his San
Diego uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball being baseball, we can be sure that Jim Leyritz
wouldn't ever give away an at-bat. He may have whined and moaned
and made a fool out of himself of late, but baseball is a sport in
which his inherent selfishness is actually an asset. By trying to
help himself, he would also help the team. A successful Leyritz
at-bat was a successful Boston Red Sox at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that baseball is the only true everyday sport
among our Big 4. People are thrown together from the middle of
February until the end of September, or longer if they are lucky.
Players spend far more time with their teammates and coaches than
they do with their families, and it could, in theory, become a
problem if it became obvious that 24 people were pulling in one
spiritual direction and one was pulling in another. That, we are
led to believe, is what was going on in the case of Jim Leyritz.
</P>
<P>
   So it was left to Dan Duquette to weigh the evidence. His
decision was that Leyritz was an expendable obstructionist. So
determined was the general manager to expunge his organization of
this unhappy employee that he traded him away for players of
dubious value. If any of the players Mr. Duquette has obtained from
San Diego help the Red Sox win so much as one game in 1998, it will
be an upset. Leyritz would have to be an extremely divisive
individual _ and I mean (itals)extremely(unitals) _ to warrant a
trade as apparently one-sided as this in the context of the pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox shouldn't be surprised at this turn of events.
Leyritz isn't doing anything he hasn't done before. He is a
professional Me First guy who has always been his own biggest fan.
He was never satisfied during his 5 1/2-year tenure in New York,
where the most games he ever played was 95. The Yankees finally
traded him to the Angels for two minor leaguers following the '96
season. He wasn't happy in Anaheim, either, and he went to Texas in
the Ken Hill deal last July 29.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that Leyritz is a catcher who can't catch, or, at
least, not very well. I don't know or care who promised him what
when he came to Boston. Jimy Williams looked at him behind the
plate long enough to arrive at the same conclusion as Buck
Showalter, Joe Torre, Terry Collins, and Johnny Oates; namely, that
as a catcher, Jim Leyritz is a good meat carver. Nor have I heard
any Red Sox pitchers rushing to the Leyritz defense.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyritz is what Jim Leyritz is, that being a fairly
dangerous righthanded hitter who has the requisite intestinal
fortitude in the clutch. His resume includes a game-winning
15th-inning home run in Game 2 of the 1995 playoff series with
Seattle and the dramatic Game 4 home run off Mark Wohlers that
turned out to be the single biggest hit of the 1996 World Series.
There are a whole lot of famous baseball names that have never had
a postseason moment half as meaningful as either one of these.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator with the two big home runs is that
Leyritz wasn't happy when he hit either one. He had been in classic
Leyritz squeaky-wheel form when he hit the home run against
Seattle, so much so that it wouldn't surprise me to learn that some
Yankee players were privately saying, ``Oh, God, anybody but
(itals)him(unitals).'' And he had entered the World Series game
against Atlanta in progress, so you know he was steaming.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, so what? He's always unhappy. We know who he is. The
man looks in the mirror and he sees Johnny Bench, and never mind
that he is 34 years old with the following up-to-the-minute
695-game big league career totals: .270, 76 homers, 331 runs batted
in. When you're 34, and no manager has ever seen fit to play you in
more than 59 percent of your team's games, you ought to get the
message.
</P>
<P>
   But he has value, and he could have been very useful to the Red
Sox when the important games come. Being a first-class pain didn't
prevent him from turning on that Wohlers fastball.
</P>
<P>
   I would have kept him hostage until October. Then, and only
then, would I allow him to go somewhere else to prove for the fifth
time that he is Johnny Blanchard, and not Johnny Bench.

RICK SCHRODER TO REPLACE JIMMY SMITS ON `NYPD BLUE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Schroder may have found the perfect way to dispel any
lingering notion that he is still a child star.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old actor will join the cast of the gritty,
adult-themed ``NYPD Blue'' next season, filling the vacancy Jimmy
Smits will create when he leaves the acclaimed police drama after
appearing in a handful of episodes this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Schroder, best known to TV audiences for the teen roles of Ricky
Stratton in the 1980s sitcom ``Silver Spoons'' and Newt Dobbs in
the 1989 miniseries ``Lonesome Dove,'' will join the 15th Precinct
in a role that is still being fleshed out.
</P>
<P>
   But producer Steven Bochco says there is no doubt Schroder is
the right person to be joining the cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a wonderful actor with a kind of physical
and emotional intensity,'' Bochco said Monday, ``because if you
can't stand in against the awesomeness of a Dennis Franz, you're
just going to be floating down the river belly up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bochco said Schroder displayed more than enough moxie in a
reading with Franz, who plays Andy Sipowicz, the veteran detective
with the hard shell outside and soft center.
</P>
<P>
   Since the show's second season, Smits has played Bobby Simone,
Sipowicz's parter in crime-fighting. He stepped into the breach
when David Caruso left the show after the first season. Along with
Franz's stellar acting and some dynamite writing, Smits has helped
build ``NYPD Blue'' into one of the most consistently compelling
dramas on network TV.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco himself admitted to having a fairly typical reaction when
the show's casting director suggested Schroder for the new part. He
was among 30 or 40 actors considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us had some sort of old image of Rick Schroder,''
Bochco said, ``but within a minute of his coming into the room it
began to dissipate.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroder was on a short list of roughly half a dozen hopefuls
who read for the role opposite Franz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick just knocked us all out,'' Bochco said. ``He knocked
Dennis out. . . . I think that, whatever surprise or doubt anybody
has about Rick's ability to credibly fit into that envirnoment,
those will be dispelled in 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the addition of Schroder may be a cheeky move on Bochco's
part. Smits and Caruso both tended to get women's hearts racing,
especially when they exposed a little skin. Schroder, who hadn't
yet reached 10 when he made his film debut in ``The Champ'' in
1989, doesn't usually fall into the same heartthrob category.
</P>
<P>
   Odds 'n' ends
</P>
<P>
   ``The Simpsons'' will get a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame
next year. So will Dennis Franz, Bob Newhart, Jane Seymour, Buffalo
Bob Smith and Alex Trebek, according to the Hollywood Chamber of
Commerce. . . . When George Clooney leaves NBC's ``ER'' at the end
of next season, he will rejoin Les Moonves, who as president of
Warner Bros. TV signed Clooney to the ``ER'' cast. Moonves is now
president of CBS Entertainment, which will be Clooney's new home
under a two-year development deal. It calls for him to appear in
two TV movies and to serve as executive producer of a new series.

   GLF-SAHALEE (San Francisco) They are West Coast courses ripe
with trees on every hole, tight fairways, several steep inclines,
right and left doglegs, and well-fertilized rough that can swallow
balls skipping only inches off course. One is laden with history
while the other has history waiting to be made. The Olympic Club
Lake Course and Redmond's Sahalee Country Club, site of this year's
PGA Championship Aug. 10-16, have so much in common that deja vu
might strike many of the players who completed in the U.S. Open
here.

LEARNING CO. BUYS RIVAL BRODERBUND IN $417 MILLION DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Learning Co., looking to become a billion-dollar player in the
home software market, said Monday it will buy Broderbund Software
Inc., one of the oldest and best-known names in consumer software.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge, Mass. software firm is acquiring Novato,
Calif.-based Broderbund _ marketer of the popular Carmen Sandiego
line of educational software _ in a stock swap valued at $417
million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Broderbund shareholders will receive 0.8 share of Learning Co.
stock for each Broderbund share.  &UR;  &LR; That would value Broderbund at
$19.91 a share, based on Monday's closing prices. &UR;  &LR;  Pending
approval by shareholders and regulators, the deal should close by
September.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. was created through a series of acquisitions in the
home and entertainment software arena. It was formerly known as
Softkey International Inc., which bought Learning Co. in 1995 and
adopted its name.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Broderbund also tried to buy Learning Co. that year.
But the company was outbid by Softkey, which acquired Learning Co.
in a $606 million hostile takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1980, Broderbund established itself as a leading
maker of practical, easy-to-use software for home users. Among its
biggest hits are the Carmen Sandiego line of educational programs
for children and Family Tree Maker, a popular genealogy program.
Perhaps Broderbund's most famous product is Myst, a computer puzzle
game that has become one of the most popular home entertainment
programs of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund has recently stumbled, largely due to competition
from the Learning Co. and other makers of home software. In its
fiscal year ending last &UR;  &LR;  August , Broderbund posted a $13.5
million loss on sales of $191 million. Over the past year, the firm
has launched a restructuring that cost the job of its president and
about 150 workers. Broderbund has generated $14 million in profits
in the past two quarters &UR;  &LR; due to increased sales of its educational
software as well as last year's introduction of Riven, the sequel
to Myst.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Stephen Dube of Wasserstein Perella Securities in New
York said that Broderbund was simply too small to force its
products onto the shelves of retail software stores. ``They have a
lot of titles. They are basically good titles. But it's basically
like a chicken and egg,'' Dube said. Without the size to win shelf
space from retailers, Broderbund couldn't sell enough software to
increase in size, no matter how good its products might be.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Tanny, Broderbund's vice president of marketing, said
that the acquisition by Learning Co. should finally break the
vicious cycle. ``We matter to a retailer a lot more than we used to
as a result of this merger,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. President Kevin O'Leary indicated that the popular
Myst line won't be at the center of his firm's marketing efforts.
``I think the focus has been so intense on Riven and Myst in the
last year that people have forgotten what's under the hood'' at
Broderbund, said O'Leary.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was Broderbund's educational and home productivity software
that attracted the Learning Co., according to O'Leary. &UR;  &LR;  ``These
are brands that are right into our sweet spot. &UR;  &LR; You want to get a
product like Carmen Sandiego and make sure that every child who's
eight years old gets to see that product.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Myst and Riven, he said that the Learning Co. would
continue to support the products, but hadn't yet decided whether to
expand the product line. O'Leary left open the possibility that the
company might sell the Myst line to some other software company.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also cited Broderbund's ownership of Parsons Technology
Inc. a leading mail-order marketer of home software. He said that
Parsons's expertise in direct marketing to consumers would help
expand the Learning Co.'s outreach to home users. He predicted that
by 1999 the Learning Co.'s annual sales, including the addition of
Broderbund, would approach $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Learning Co. posted a $475 million loss on $392.4
million in sales. The loss was due to amortization and merger costs
of $501 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co. stock closed at $27 57/64, down $ 7/64, on the
New York Stock Exchange. Broderbund gained $2 1/4 to $18 3/4 on the
Nasdaq exchange.

BOARD EASES TEACHER CERTIFICATION STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After deadlocking twice on the issue, the Massachusetts
Board of Education voted Monday to allow a lower passing score for
would-be teachers who took the state's first teacher certification
test.
</P>
<P>
   The lower score means only 44 percent of the 1800 candidates who
took the exam in April flunked it, rather than 59 percent under the
higher standard recommended by a panel of 300 educators. As a
result, 260 candidates who would have been barred from seeking jobs
as teachers will now be certified to instruct children.
</P>
<P>
   In move that surprised many at the contentious meeting, board
chairman John R. Silber cast the deciding vote to lower the
standard. Silber had been a vociferous supporter of the tougher
certification standard, but ultimately changed his vote in order to
break a 4-4 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Silber said the board should give deference to acting Education
Commissioner Frank W. Haydu III's arguments that many of the
candidates were unaware of the stringency of the exam and that the
state could better defend itself against lawsuits if it gave
initial testtakers more leeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the commissioner has recommended is simply to increase
the chances of making this reform stick,'' Silber said.
</P>
<P>
   Silber said it was ``regrettable'' that the lower standard would
mean 260 candidates who would have failed could be certified, but
with a large percentage still not passing the exam it nonetheless
represented ``a very big step toward improving the quality of
education in Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every board member agreed. Student representative Micah
Silva, who voted against the lower standard, said it would not only
affect the 260 teaching candidates, but their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only takes one incompetent teacher teaching biology to
affect an entire class,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silva disputed the idea that the exam was unusually tough,
pointing out that the questions to evaluate candidates' literacy
skills are similar to those asked of tenth-graders under the new
student testing standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Haydu had the power under the state's education reform
law to set the passing score himself, he asked the board to endorse
his position that a lower threshhold be adopted for the short-term.
Since this is the first year the test is being given, Haydu said,
``We are giving the benefit of the doubt to the test-taker.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, including the attorney general's office, also advised
it would be ``safer'' to adopt the lower standard in the event
lawsuits are brought, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some candidates have complained that they were given little
notice that the April test would actually count. And with some
minority groups scoring substantially lower than whites on the
test, there also is concern that a discrimination lawsuit could be
brought, even though the test was reviewed to eliminate any
cultural or ethnic biases, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Abigail Thernstrom, another board member who voted against the
lower standard, said, however, the panel's decision should not be
driven by the fear of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is questionable that we should be making policy on a legal
challenge that has yet to occur,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The board was under pressure to make a decision Monday because
candidates who failed the April test can retake it for free, and
the next test will be administered on July 11. It will be the last
one with the reduced standard: Higher scores will begin taking
effect with the following test, scheduled for Oct. 3, according to
the board's vote.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schaeffer of FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass. monitoring
group that opposes teacher certification tests, contended that the
fact the state set the passing score after _ and not before _
candidates took the exam demonstrates that it was arbitrary, based
on politics rather than merit.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said a certification test in Alabama was struck down
by the courts in the 1980s because the cutoff scores were set in a
similar fashion.

DESPITE COMMUNIST PARTY RIGIDITY, PERSONAL FREEDOM GROWS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ At a kitchen table strewn with glossy fashion
magazines, Lucy Lu sat with her boyfriend Tony Yao and talked about
what it is like to live together without being married, an
arrangement rarely allowed in China until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to bug me about it, but nobody else seems to
care,'' said Ms. Lu, a 26-year-old real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we pay the rent,'' Yao cut in, laughing. ``A few
years ago the landlord here would not let a couple like us live
here, at any price. Today, he just wants to collect the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   More than being a symbol of sexual revolution, this young couple
is a signal of a growing realm of personal freedom in China, where
ordinary people now make choices about travel, work, study and love
with less government interference than at any time in the nearly 50
years since the People's Republic was established.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton arriving in China on Thursday, critics of
the administration's policy of engagement point to the lack of
political freedom in a country still governed by the Communist
Party that keeps it a place where political persecution, censorship
and a secretive and authoritarian leadership are as entrenched as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Only the public side of life, however, remains so tightly
restricted in China. The private side of life here is quite
different, as Clinton would see if he could shed his 1,000-member
entourage long enough to talk to some ordinary folk. The issues
that most people care about most _ choosing a job, a place to live,
a mate _ have gained a degree of flexibility that few could have
imagined 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to accentuate the positive side of Clinton's engagement
policy, administration officials like to argue that U.S.
cooperation with China can help promote the growing sense of
personal freedom in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the changes now under way in China are so deep and
wide that it is hard to see how U.S. policy can significantly
affect them one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will find its own way forward, as it always has,'' said
Alex Hao, an advertising executive who studied in the United States
for five years before returning to China in 1993. ``Americans
always think they can change every place. You can't change China as
fast as it is changing by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of China's recent history is
how the nation's social and economic change have sped ahead so
fast, while the political system has remained rigid. These
diverging tracks create new strains for anyone who tries to
straddle the two, yet for now most Chinese people seem content to
stay on the path that lets their incomes and personal lives
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Relinquishing control over aspects of ordinary life has not come
from any benevolent plan by the authorities. Instead, as China has
developed economically, with an ever-more-mobile populace, it has
simply become more difficult for the authorities to monitor and
control the lives of ordinary people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not long ago, every lane in Shanghai was subject to the watchful
eye of a neighborhood committee, a local organization typically
staffed by retired women who kept track of every resident and
reported to the local police or Communist Party organization
anything unusual, like a young unmarried couple living together.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, every work place in the vast state-run apparatus of
companies, offices and organizations had its own Communist Party
organization to keep track of anyone who seemed to stray from the
preferred path, in personal or professional matters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in recent years, each of these avenues of control has begun
to melt away. Modern phenomena, like tall apartment buildings and
private companies, make it harder for the authorities to control
the lives of ordinary individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the urban elite with money to spend clearly have
gained the greatest amount of personal freedom. Yet increased
personal freedom is not limited to the cities.
</P>
<P>
   In rural China, where the vast majority of China's 1.2 billion
people live, old restrictions on movement from one area to another
have melted away in recent years. As a result, well over 100
million people now migrate to work outside their home area, mostly
as unskilled laborers doing construction and housework.
</P>
<P>
   Su Xiaoli remembers her own days in the countryside, where she
spent five years planting rice as a teen-ager in the 1970s, having
followed orders to move there from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no choice at all at that time,'' mused Ms. Su, 42, now
the deputy manager of a company that makes revolving doors. ``Now
it's the other extreme. My son is 16, and the choices facing him
are astounding to me. He says it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her own eyes, Ms. Su has watched the tentacles of
government control relax year by year, gradually granting her the
freedom to change jobs, change apartments and travel overseas. She
has done each in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   At a previous job in the telephone bureau, Ms. Su said, one
entire day of each work week was set aside for a political
meetings, where the current political line from Beijing was
supposed to be discussed. In practice, she recalled, that usually
meant that a leader in her department would simply read sections of
People's Daily aloud.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, by her own description, Ms. Su was relatively
powerful. In an era of scarce telephones, she got to decide who got
a telephone line in their home, and she laughingly admits that she
often took gifts and favors just to do her job. But as privileged
as she was, she chafed against all the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sat around and did nothing, life was simple,'' Ms. Su
said. ``If you wanted to get a plane ticket or some gasoline for a
car, it was an ordeal of paperwork. Trying to change jobs was a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Su can buy a plane ticket, book a hotel room or buy a
car without any special permission or interference from the
authorities. When she quit the telephone bureau to take her new job
in 1995, she did not need anyone's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even my husband could stop me,'' she said, laughing again.

MCCAIN SAYS ANTI-TOBACCO FIGHT WILL CONTINUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ It's been a tough week for Senator John
McCain, former Vietnam prisoner of war and possible Republican
presidential candidate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The high-profile, anti-smoking legislation that he sponsored
died in Congress, and, ``I did something else last week I regret
terribly.'' He told a ``stupid, offensive, cruel joke'' that made
fun of, among others, President Clinton's daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to you today a bit depressed,'' McCain said Monday at a
luncheon attended by several journalists at the Inn at Harvard
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain, who is running for reelection to the Senate from
Arizona this year and says he won't decide until after the election
whether to seek the White House, swore off insulting jokes in the
future and vowed to continue pushing for restrictions on tobacco
companies.
</P>

   By spending $40 million on advertising, McCain said, the tobacco
companies ``were able to change the frame of the debate'' with the
public, emphasizing the bill's ``big tax'' aspect rather than its
anti-smoking objective.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the anti-tobacco legislation, which would have
increased taxes on cigarettes and raised $516 billion over 25
years, ``renewed my zeal for ... campaign finance reform,'' McCain
said. He said ``huge amounts of soft money'' _ dollars that are
given to political parties in unregulated quantities _ were
critical in defeating the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be more and more scandals, because there's
just too much money there,'' McCain said. But he conceded that
Republicans who vote in primaries may not be as enamored of
restrictions on campaign contributions as some other voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some conservatives have been uneasy with me for a long time,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 90-minute discussion of various topics, McCain criticized
President Clinton for ``kind of a rudderless foreign policy,''
which McCain said he fears may have more serious and widespread
consequences in the conflict in the Kosovo province of Serbia even
than it did in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my major problem with the president, who has the
greatest communicative skills of any president I've seen in my
adult life,'' McCain said. The United States has ``a posture ...
not a position.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to send young people there,'' McCain said, but
Clinton has neither laid out a plan for intervention in that
explosive part of the world, nor outlined the reasons for becoming
involved to keep the local conflict from spreading to such
countries as Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has not had a conceptual framework as to
where the threats to our national security lie, and where the
United States' national interests lie.''
</P>
<P>
   With McCain weighing a presidential run in 2000, he was asked
about the prospect of having his personal life in the media.
McCain's problems in his first marriage, and a more recent
drug-dependency issue in his family, have been documented, though
not widely publicized.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as those personal issues are concerned,'' he said, ``I
will continue to maintain it's a personal issue'' and refuse to
discuss them, even if he seeks the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bar continues to change as far as the amount of disclosure
that candidates have to make about their personal lives, and I
think we all know that,'' he said. ``I believe that people have the
right to privacy, and ... I will continue to maintain that it's
nobody's business. And if that is something that hurts me, then
that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added: ``My life is very well-known.''

SUPREME COURT STRIKES DOWN FINE, CALLING IT EXCESSIVE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court told the U.S.
government Monday to return most of the $357,000 in cash it seized
from an international traveler who failed to report all the money
he was carrying.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the court struck down as unconstitutionally
excessive the U.S. government's seizure of $357,144 from Hosep
Bajakajian, who willfully violated a federal law that requires
overseas travelers to tell federal authorities when they are
transporting more than $10,000 in currency.
</P>
<P>
   The law, designed to trap drug dealers, requires that people
found to have violated the reporting requirement surrender any
property ``involved in such offense'' to the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision that united its most conservative and liberal
members, the court said the amount of the forfeiture violated the
Eighth Amendment's prohibition on excessive fines because the total
seized was ``grossly disproportionate'' to the offense of not
reporting it.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose on June 9, 1994, when Bajakajian, his wife and
two daughters were waiting at Los Angeles International Airport to
board a flight to Italy. Customs inspectors, using
currency-sniffing dogs, discovered about $230,000 in the family's
checked baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Customs inspectors then approached Bajakajian and his wife,
informed them of the reporting requirement and asked them if they
had any more money. Bajakajian said he had $8,000 and his wife
another $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   However, a search of their carry-on bags, wallet and purse
brought the total yield to $357,144. The inspectors seized the
money and arrested Bajakajian.
</P>
<P>
   Bajakajian, who admitted a ``distrust for the government'' after
growing up as an Armenian minority in Syria, pleaded guilty to
failing to report the currency, but the government was never able
to connect the cash to any illegal enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court ruled forfeiture of all the money would
violate the Eighth Amendment and ordered the government to return
all but $15,000 of the seized currency.
</P>
<P>
   The court also fined Bajakajian $5,000 and placed him on
probation for three years. Customs officials appealed the decision
to try to keep all the seized cash.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas, among the high court's most
conservative members, was joined in his majority decision by
liberal Justice John Paul Stevens and three other colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said Bajakajian's offense was ``minimal;'' hurt no one
and, if undetected, would have deprived the government only of the
information that $357,144 had left the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no inherent proportionality in such a forfeiture,''
Thomas wrote. ``It is impossible to conclude for example that the
harm respondent caused is anywhere near 30 times greater than that
caused by a hypothetical drug dealer who willfully fails to report
taking $12,000 out of the country in order to purchase drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer also concurred with Thomas' opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In a vehement dissent, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the court
failed to recognize the government's legitimate need to seize money
in its fight against smugglers and illegal drug traffickers.
Kennedy also mocked the majority in noting that Bajakajian admitted
to lying to customs officials and would lose only $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money launderers will rejoice to know they face forfeitures of
less than 5 percent of the money transported, provided they hire
accomplished liars to carry their money for them,'' Kennedy wrote.
He was joined in dissent by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Antonin Scalia.

RUSSIA TO SELL 2 NUCLEAR POWER STATIONS TO INDIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL GORDON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia has agreed to sell two nuclear power stations to
India, defying calls to punish New Delhi because of its nuclear
testing.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry concluded the deal,
which is worth $3 billion or more to Russia's cash-starved nuclear
energy industry, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale has became an important test of Washington's ability to
marshal world opinion against India.
</P>
<P>
   Following unsuccessful U.S. efforts to persuade Russia not to
sell reactors to Iran or advanced anti-aircraft systems to Cyprus,
the Indian sale has become another indication of America's limited
influence with the Yeltsin government.
</P>
<P>
   The United States tried to head off the sale even before India
stunned the world by exploding nuclear devices in May. After
India's nuclear tests, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright again
urged Moscow to abandon the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The construction of the civilian plants themselves will have
little military significance. But U.S. officials say they violate
an important principle: that the world community should not engage
in nuclear cooperation with aspiring nuclear-weapon states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends the wrong the wrong message to the world and to
India and Pakistan,'' said James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman. ``Instead of pursuing business as usual, we should be
scaling back this cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials, for their part, hailed the sale, saying it
will help thwart the U.S.-led effort to impose economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has long enjoyed close ties to India. During Soviet days,
Russia saw India as a counterweight to China, as well as a customer
for weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   India's rivalry with Pakistan was not a major worry for Moscow.
Moscow had little love for Pakistan, which cooperated with U.S.
efforts to funnel assistance to Afghan rebels following the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of Foreign Minister Yevgeni Primakov, Russia
has maintained close ties with New Delhi for foreign policy as well
as commercial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   According to Russian officials, India is now the second-largest
purchaser of Russian arms. Just last week India's deputy defense
minister, Adjit Kumar, visited Moscow to discuss the purchase of
additional Sukoi-30 fighter bombers, another multi-billion dollar
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Kumar visited the Zhukovsky airfield outside Moscow to observe
the latest model of the warplane, which can be equipped with bombs,
cluster munitions, air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also promised to sell attack submarines and is
discussing the sale of anti-ship and other weapons.
</P>
<P>
   While the disagreement over the nuclear power plant erupted into
the open Monday, Russia and the United States have been at odds
over the nuclear deal for years.
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the dispute go back to 1992, when nuclear
suppliers agreed to a broadened system of export controls.
</P>
<P>
   The basic idea behind the 1992 ``suppliers' agreement'' was that
countries that do not have nuclear weapons should not get the
benefit of nuclear energy without committing themselves to use it
only for peaceful purposes.
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, the ``suppliers' agreement'' forbade
suppliers from exporting nuclear technology to aspiring nuclear
powers that do not subject all their nuclear sites to international
monitoring. The effect was to preclude nuclear sales to India since
it will not agree to such far-reaching safeguards.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russia joined the 1992 ``suppliers' agreement.'' But economic
pressure on its nuclear industry prompted Russian officials to look
for a way to sell two 1,000-megawatt reactors to India.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials argued that Moscow had a right to proceed with
the India deal on the grounds that the sale was contemplated by a
1988 Soviet-Indian agreement, an argument Washington flatly
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   While negotiations between Russia and India dragged on, India's
nuclear tests raised the stakes. At first, Russian officials said
the Indian reactor deal was under review.
</P>
<P>
   Washington urged Moscow to drop the deal, but never sought to
link U.S. support for Western financial aid to Russia with Russian
cooperation on security issues.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's new atomic energy minister, Yevgeny Adamov, pressed
hard for the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Atomic Energy Ministry has become increasingly
dependent on exports to pay its workers and proceed with its heady
plans to build more nuclear plants in Russia. Yevgeny Reshnetnikov,
a senior atomic energy official, said last year that the value of
the sale was $1.5 billion to $2 billion for each of the reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Adamov flew to India last weekend to cement the deal with the
chief of India's Atomic Energy Commission, R. Chidambaram.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear plants, which are to be located at Kudankulam, will
be light water reactors, meaning that ordinary water is used to
moderate the nuclear reaction. A byproduct is spent fuel with
plutonium and other highly radioactive products, which can be
processed to make bomb ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Russia argues that the two plants would be for civilian use and
would be subject to international monitoring to prevent them from
contributing to India's nuclear potential. The Russian reactors
will take eight years to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials say they hope the deal will encourage nations
to engage in nuclear cooperation. India has 10 nuclear plants, but
they are much smaller, often unreliable and meet only a tiny
fraction of the nation's energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to blunt Western criticism, Valery Nesterushkin, a
spokesman for Russia's Foreign Ministry, said the deal ``will not
create a precedent for future agreements on nuclear cooperation
with India'' because India has refused to subject all of its
nuclear plants to monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Bunn, a former Energy Department official and a
specialist at Harvard University, said the sale would not be
militarily significant because the Indians already had nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was still an important setback. ``Nuclear
cooperation with countries that are flouting nuclear rules
undermines global efforts to stem the spread of nuclear weapons,''
Bunn said.

COURT RULES $357,000 FINE ``EXCESSIVE'' AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in its 208-year history, the
Supreme Court on Monday rejected a government fine as excessive and
therefore a violation of the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   It ruled that federal officials must return the bulk of a
$357,144 penalty against a Los Angeles man.
</P>
<P>
   In its 5-4 decision, the court said that the government cannot
necessarily keep all of the money seized from people trying to take
large amounts of unreported cash out of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law requires that anyone who transports more than
$10,000 in cash or other ``monetary instruments'' out of the
country must report the amount to the Treasury Department. People
who fail to report it can be sentenced to up to five years in
prison and fined up to $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The law also requires the people to forfeit the unreported money
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Clarence Thomas, writing for the court, said the
forfeiture rule amounts to a fine and that in some cases the fine
can be disproportionate to the offense, violating the Eighth
Amendment's ban on excessive fines.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time that the high court, since it began meeting
in 1790, has ruled that a fine violated the amendment, which says,
``Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines
imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishment inflicted.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision means that the government must return most of the
$357,144 seized in June 1994 from Hosep Krikor Bajakajian when he
tried to leave the country with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory for the defense,'' said James E. Blatt,
the lawyer representing Bajakajian, who owns two gas stations in
Los Angeles. ``This case will benefit other defendants who have had
their money taken from them,'' Blatt said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he and other legal observers said they did not expect
the ruling to significantly affect the government's ability to
seize money or property in cases involving illegal drug activity.
Many of those forfeitures are not considered punishment and
therefore are not treated as fines.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman John Russell said officials were
disappointed by the ruling. But the chief counsel for the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, Chuck Blanchard, said, ``I see it
having very little or no effect on drug cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Bajakajian, 41, was detained by U.S. Customs agents in Los
Angeles as he, his wife and two daughters waited to board an
airplane to Italy. Their final destination was Syria, Bajakajian's
native land.
</P>
<P>
   Using dogs trained to sniff and detect currency, customs
inspectors discovered the cash that Bajakajian had not reported in
his luggage. The inspectors seized the money and arrested him for
trying to leave the country with unreported cash.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyers explained later that Bajakajian failed to report the
money because he did not trust customs agents, especially those in
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   A month after the incident, U.S. District Judge John Davies in
Los Angeles concluded that the money lawfully belonged to
Bajakajian. He had earned or borrowed it from friends and was
carrying it to Syria to repay relatives who had helped him get
started in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't drug money. This wasn't gambling money. This
wasn't stolen money. This wasn't money being laundered for any
reason,'' Davies said.
</P>
<P>
   Bajakajian pleaded guilty to failing to report his money to the
Treasury Department and was sentenced to three year's probation. He
was also fined $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, refusing to uphold a total forfeiture of Bajakajian's
money, ordered that $15,000 of the unreported cash be turned over
to the government.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed, upholding the
$15,000 forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   During his appeals, Bajakajian's money remained in government
hands.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Supreme Court said the lower courts were right
and that he should get his money back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever his other vices, (Bajakajian) does not fit into the
class of persons for whom the statute was principally designed: He
is not a money launderer, a drug trafficker, or a tax evader,''
Thomas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The justice added that forcing Bajakajian to turn over the full
$357,144 would be ``grossly disproportional to the gravity of his
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was joined Justices John Paul Stevens, David H. Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' split with the four dissenters was unusual, since he
rarely votes against the conservative Rehnquist and Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the dissenting justices, Kennedy said that opening
the door to fights over whether a fine is excessive ``is disturbing
both for its specific holding and for the broader upheaval it
foreshadows.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that ``By invoking the excessive fines clause with
excessive zeal, the majority may in the long run encourage Congress
to circumvent it.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN HARKES STILL ROOTS FOR HIS PALS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ It was not easy to be John Harkes on Sunday. Some of his
best friends were in Lyons, mostly sitting on the U.S. bench. He
was even farther away, celebrating Father's Day in Virginia, eating
his heart out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have contributed,'' Harkes said Monday by telephone.
``I'm a player that can go forward, make a tackle, make a run.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tackling or running, Harkes was watching television
as his former teammates _ and maybe his future teammates _ lost to
Iran, 2-1, and were eliminated from advancing in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through so much hard work, and now the World Cup is
over so fast,'' Harkes said. ``I feel for the players. I'm part of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, Harkes has taken the high road, but he also knows
that Coach Steve Sampson is gone as soon as the U.S. plane lands on
home soil after the Yugoslavia game on Thursday in Nantes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I should be there,'' Harkes said. ``I thought I could
contribute something with leadership. We had such good chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Until May, John Harkes was the feisty midfielder with the yellow
captain's armband. The man had stuck out his chin and his elbows
during the qualifying games, the hard duty in El Salvador and Costa
Rica and Mexico. If an opponent needed a little manners or posture
correction, Harkes would do the job. Sometimes he even tried to
straighten out the officials.
</P>
<P>
   He was the captain, a trifle testy, maybe a step slower than he
used to be, but a veteran of the British leagues, a hard-boot
professional. Then in one unexplained action, Sampson ripped away
the armband and the team jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hugged me after the Portland game and said, `You're going
to your third World Cup,''' Harkes said. ``Then he cut me. The way
it was handled was so unprofessional.''
</P>
<P>
   Word has come down that Sampson felt that Harkes would not move
back on defense, to which Harkes replied, ``I've been known to play
more than one position.'' It was also fairly clear that Sampson
felt Harkes was smirking and shuffling during practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that body-language stuff,'' Harkes said Monday.
``I was the captain. I was leading in my way, keeping the team
together. We beat Brazil. We had some great games. Steve is the
only one who ever questioned my leadership. I think it was evident
they lacked leadership. Where was the fighting spirit?''
</P>
<P>
   He has nothing bad to say about anybody who wore the U.S.
uniform in the losses to Germany and Iran, but he does question the
lineups and the formations chosen by a coach who never played or
coached at an exalted level until the American federation put him
in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The former captain will say he did not understand sticking Eric
Wynalda, his best buddy, up front all by himself against Germany:
``He didn't have a chance. He was out there playing against four
backs, like he was a defender.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Iran, Sampson pasted together a lineup that looked like
a mixer on the first night of a cruise. The Americans might as well
have worn stickers that said, ``Hi, My Name Is ...''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Sampson was questioned closely about not using
Wynalda, and he said he would not change a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange when you don't see Eric Wynalda out on the
field,'' Harkes said. ``He's our all-time leading scorer.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Harkes said, the Yanks didn't play badly for the first
34 or 40 minutes, hitting the goal posts or crossbar three times.
``We were unlucky, you can say that, but you have to finish it,''
Harkes said.
</P>
<P>
   Harkes keeps in touch. Another of his best friends, Tab Ramos,
called him from a mobile phone on the field a couple of hours
before the Germany game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tab told me, `We miss you, you should be here,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Harkes plays for DC United in Major League Soccer, has
time for his family and comments on the World Cup for the Voice of
America.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the team, he sometimes says: ``I have my
theories. I'm saving some of it for my book, which will be out in
November.''
</P>
<P>
   He burns no bridges, because John Harkes, still only 29, sees
himself back on the U.S. team, as soon as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, Steve made the decision, which was a bad
one,'' Harkes said. ``I look forward to playing again.'' He can
even see himself wearing the captain's armband again: ``That's up
to the new coach. I have a lot of good years left.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, 1998 may be the year that John Harkes stayed
home and felt terrible for his national team, watching games he
thought he could have affected.

STATE AND FEDERAL PROSECUTORS TRY TO DECIDE HOW TO HANDLE SUSPECTS
IN DRAGGING DEATH OF BLACK MAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD STEWART 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
BEAUMONT _ Jasper County authorities will ask a grand jury July 6
to return capital murder indictments against two or possibly all
three white men accused of dragging a black man behind a pickup for
almost three miles along a winding rural highway.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investigators found James Byrd Jr.'s head and right arm more
than a mile from where his torso was dumped in front of a country
church.
</P>
<P>
   If indicted and convicted on capital murder charges, Shawn Berry
and Bill King, both 23 and from Jasper, and Russell Brewer Jr., 31,
of Sulphur Springs, would face a possible death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The three remain in the Jasper County Jail. They were arrested
about 12 hours after residents of the Huff Creek area reported
finding Byrd's mangled remains on June 7.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents have formed a special task force to investigate the
crime, but no federal charges have been filed thus far.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford in Beaumont said Monday that
federal prosecutors may await the outcome of state prosecution
before deciding whether to file federal hate crime charges.
Bradford said that if one of the defendants does not get the death
penalty from state charges, he could later be tried in federal
court.
</P>
<P>
   Local Jasper County officials have said they hoped federal
prosecutors would take the lead in the prosecution because a trio
of capital-murder trials could cost the cash-strapped county
government up to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bradford said his office expects to make a decision about
federal prosecution ``within the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the task force's investigation is drawing to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Pat Hardy in Jasper County said
Monday that his office has not yet decided if it will seek capital
charges against all three of the defendants or just two of them.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, the first arrested and the owner of the pickup allegedly
used in the crime, gave investigators a detailed confession that
implicated the other two suspects. According to this account, Berry
offered Byrd a ride and that the other two defendants took Byrd to
a rural location, beat him until he was unconscious and used a
towing chain wrapped around his ankles to drag him along Huff Creek
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Monday that Berry remains the only one of the
defendants to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Guy James Gray said earlier that his office
may offer reduced charges to one of the defendants in exchange for
testimony against the other two. He would not say which defendant
might be offered that deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, capital murder is defined as a murder committed
during the commission of a select few crimes. Assault does not fit
that category.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy would not specify what might make the Byrd murder a
capital offense, but from early on officials have mentioned
kidnapping as a possibility. Hardy noted that forensic evidence
shows Byrd fought to keep his attackers from removing him from the
back of the pickup before he was beaten and dragged. A number of
items linked to the defendants _ including tools, a compact disc
and a lighter _ were found at the scene and appeared to have been
thrown from the truck during a struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local law enforcement officials are gearing up for
the next chapter of what has become an ongoing saga in Jasper _ a
Ku Klux Klan rally scheduled for Saturday in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Officers would not divulge their plans. But up to 200 city,
county, state and federal lawmen are expected to be in town
Saturday to make sure no trouble breaks out during a rally by
Klansmen from Vidor, Waco and northern Georgia.

ROMANIA MOVES INTO SECOND ROUND WITH 2-1 WIN OVER ENGLAND  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By ROGER COHEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ Britannia, the crowd insisted, rules the
waves, but England looked a mess on plain old grass Monday,
crashing to a 2-1 defeat against a slick Romanian side that took
its chances with aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, clinched by a late goal from right back Dan
Petrescu, assured Romania of advancement to the round of sixteen in
the World Cup and left England facing a tough contest against
Colombia on Friday. A defeat in that match would send England and
its large following home.
</P>
<P>
   Police deployed massive reinforcements ahead of the game after
English hooligans went on the rampage in Marseilles last week and
German thugs beat a French policeman into unconsciousness in the
northern town of Lens on Sunday. But there were no immediate
reports of serious incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Sepp Blatter, the president of the international soccer
federation, FIFA, said before the match that European governments
should do more to stop thugs traveling to games. ``They must be
aware that football is more than kicking a ball around,'' Blatter
said. ``It's the social and cultural aspects. It is up to national
authorities to make laws.''
</P>
<P>
   But the European Union allows free movement of people among its
15 member states and it was not clear how governments could clamp
down. The violence in Lens appeared to be linked to German rightist
groups and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the incidents were ``a
scandal for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   English fans packed the stadium in this southern city Monday
night, vastly outnumbering the Romanian supporters, but they could
do little to raise their side from mediocrity. Romania, whose team
reached the quarterfinals of the last World Cup in the United
States, was faster, more assured, and razor-sharp in front of goal.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gheorghe Hagi, no longer the fleet-footed player who made
such an impression in America but still a considerable force, who
opened the way to victory early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Brushing off a challenge from England's Graeme Le Saux, he cut
into the penalty box before lobbing a perfect pass to Viorel
Moldovan. The center-forward brought the ball down with his chest
and blasted the ball past David Seaman, whose main activity Monday
was fishing the ball out the net.
</P>
<P>
   Poor England. Manager Glenn Hoddle had taken off midfielder Paul
Ince midway through the first half, and Ince's guts and strength
were sorely missed as the English side looked for an equalizer.
Star striker Alan Shearer was often isolated up front, and the
English midfield looked about as capable of inspiration as a brick
wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owen, Owen,'' the crowd chanted, calling for 18-year-old
Liverpool striker Michael Owen to be brought on. With 20 minutes to
go, Hoddle finally ceded to the pressure, and there Owen was in the
79th minute to sweep home a low cross from Shearer as if it was the
most natural thing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   England, one of the tournament's fancied teams, seemed to have
saved the day and even looked briefly capable of a late victory.
But with minutes left, a long pass found Petrescu bustling into the
left side of penalty box with English left half Le Saux at his
side.
</P>
<P>
   Flailing haplessly like a fish out of water, Le Saux allowed
Petrescu _ a teammate on England's Chelsea club team _ to move past
him, steady himself, and slip the ball between Seaman's legs with a
left-footed shot that had all the power of water dripping from a
tap.
</P>
<P>
   Owen, a diminutive figure but a bundle of energy, came roaring
back, and a late shot from him hit the post. But it was not
England's night, and in the end it was two Romanians who play in
England _ Moldovan of Coventry and Petrescu of Chelsea _ who sank
the English team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are bitterly disappointed,'' said Hoddle. ``I thought we
could go and win the game after we scored, not lose it.'' The coach
went on to defend his team, saying ``we will win more games than we
lose if we play like that,'' but his words lacked conviction. As
Hoddle knows, the task against an improving Colombian team will be
anything but easy.

DEMOCRAT TRYING TO UNSEAT TEXAS GOV. BUSH LASHES SON'S ROLE IN
PRESIDENT BUSH'S CAMPAIGNS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
WASHINGTON _ Texas Democratic gubernatorial candidate Garry Mauro
arrived in the nation's capital Monday to scoop up some much needed
cash and dish out criticism of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, linking
him to the infamous ``Willy Horton'' ads and his father's ``no new
taxes'' pledge.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mauro, who will appear at fund-raisers with the Clintons on
Tuesday, appeared as eager to discuss his Republican opponent's
vulnerabilities as a presidential candidate as he was to criticize
Bush's performance as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, Bush was treated as a potential
presidential candidate by lobbyists and GOP party loyalists who
crowded into his fund-raiser, which raised over a million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, who is trailing Bush by 53 percentage points in the
latest public opinion poll, attributed the governor's strong
showing to the healthy economy under President Clinton and the
popularity of Bush's parents in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is riding the wings of popularity of two popular
presidents. But if he ever jumps into the race for president those
wings of popularity will fall off and he will have to construct his
own wings on the way down,'' Mauro told a National Press Club
audience.
</P>
<P>
   But Mauro suggested that as a presidential candidate the
governor would be saddled with baggage from the presidential
campaigns of his father, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro revisited the controversial 1988 Willy Horton commercial,
which Republicans used against Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis,
the Massachusetts governor, about a black murderer who brutalized a
couple while on furlough from a Massachusetts prison.
</P>
<P>
   While the commercial was not made by the Bush campaign, the
president was linked to the spot that critics said played on
whites' fear of black men.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said that in 1988, George W. Bush was ``in the
decision-making seat (as a campaign aide) when President Bush's
campaign refused to repudiate the now infamous Willy Horton ad.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Bush had broken his pledge to halt prisoners' early
release. As a result, Lawrence Russell Brewer, one of three white
men accused of killing a black man in Jasper recently, was let out
of prison early, Mauro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Bush had kept his promise Brewer would have been in prison
instead of making mischief,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker dismissed Mauro's attacks
as `` the same old distortions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Garry Mauro's abysmally low showing in the polls show that
people of Texas know better,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Bush ended early release for anyone sentenced since he
became governor. But she said the Legislature worried it would be
unconstitutional to approve a law retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   Brewer was sentenced before Bush was elected.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said Bush should have tried harder to prod the Legislature
into passing a law that would have withstood a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro also suggested Bush's opponents would link him to his
father's fateful reversal of his ``no new taxes'' pledge because he
had refused to endorse the Democrat's proposal to eliminate a sales
tax on vehicles in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Read my lips, George Bush called a major tax cut for average
Texans reckless,'' Mauro said. ``I wouldn't want to depend on those
wings to fly the Bush plane on the way to the New Hampshire primary
if Steve Forbes is anywhere near.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 primaries, Forbes, the wealthy magazine mogul,
caused GOP frontrunner Bob Dole to slide in the polls by attacking
him for voting for tax increases in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While Mauro attacked Bush for accepting money from those tied to
the managed care industry, he indicated that he would not reject
such contributions to his own campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he saw nothing wrong with leaving Texas to look for
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any place, anytime anywhere people will get together in groups
of two and three and give me financial support I will be there,''
said Mauro, who is trailing Bush in fund-raising as well as poll
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro will attend a $1,000 a person fund-raising reception with
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton followed by a $5,000-a-person
dinner with President Clinton. The campaign hopes those two events
will raise $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Mauro will attend a $1,000-a-couple fund-raiser in
El Paso with Vice President Al Gore that officials hope will raise
another $150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro has known the Clintons since they worked together on the
1972 McGovern campaign in Texas. Mauro has headed Clinton's Texas
presidential efforts in both campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has to do with old-fashioned friendship,'' said
Mauro of the Clintons' efforts on his behalf. &QL;

a highly restrictive standard for determining when school districts
can be found liable under Federal law for a teacher's sexual

authority to intervene actually knew of the teacher's misconduct

railroad town with more than 25 churches and about 8,000 people,
she sketched the simple fish that she had regarded from childhood
as a universal symbol of faith. She won the logo contest and $100
prize. Now, suddenly, the little fish is causing an awfully big
splash. Someone complained about the fish to the American Civil
Liberties Union, and in February the organization sent a letter
asking the mayor to delete the fish from the logo because the fish
was ``unmistakably identified with Christianity.'' By Laurie
Goodstein.

   CHINA-FREEDOM (Shanghai) _ At a kitchen table strewn with glossy
fashion magazines, Lucy Lu sat with her boyfriend Tony Yao and
talked about what it is like to live together without being
married, an arrangement rarely allowed in China until recently.
More than being symbols of a sexual revolution, this young couple
signals a growing realm of personal freedom in China that allows
ordinary people to make choices about travel, work, study, and love
with less government interference than at anytime since the
People's Republic was established nearly 50 years ago. By Seth
Faison.

   NY-SCHUMER-FUNDS (New York) _ In his race for the U.S. Senate,
Rep. Charles E. Schumer has raised more in donations than any other
challenger in congressional history, collecting well over $10
million. His treasury not only dwarfs those of the other Democrats
in the race, Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green; Schumer is also the
second highest fundraiser among all Senate candidates nationwide.

   TEXAS-BORDER-TOWNS (El Paso, Texas) _ Four years after the North
American Free Trade Agreement lowered trade barriers, the cities
along Texas's long border with Mexico that had hoped to benefit are
instead struggling to become more than glorified truck stops as
they watch their manufacturing jobs go south by the thousands.
Almost everywhere else in the United States, the economy is booming
and the national unemployment rate is the lowest in nearly 30
years. But along the border unemployment persists at two and three
times the national rate, and incomes remain far below state and
national averages. By Sam Howe Verhovek.

is part of an broad array of civilian and military technology

ruling, the court went on to declare that the government could not
constitutionally seize $357,144 in undeclared cash that a Los
Angeles man and his family had attempted to bring in their luggage
on a flight to Cyprus to repay a family debt. By Linda Greenhouse.

WHERE DOES U.S. SOCCER GO FROM HERE?  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORNIC, France _ The U.S. soccer team washed ashore on the
Atlantic Coast Monday, its World Cup hopes shipwrecked by Sunday's
2-1 loss to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the defeat was a chance to advance to the second round,
to grab the interest of average sports fans and to give any kind of
boost to attendance in the second half of the Major League Soccer
season.
</P>
<P>
   This was a game that was penciled in as a win. Instead the
Americans lost one of the most significant matches in the history
of U.S. soccer. As the team heads home after Thursday's meaningless
game against Yugoslavia in Nantes, the immediate future is
uncertain for the U.S. soccer federation, Coach Steve Sampson and
many of his players.
</P>
<P>
   The federation's stated hope of winning a World Cup in 2010 now
seems hopelessly premature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's going to be a tremendous amount of
disappointment from the fans and the general public,'' defender
Alexi Lalas said Monday after the team had a light workout on the
Brittany coast. ``In the past four years there has been an increase
in awareness of the team, and with that comes expectations to
succeed at a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States is undeniably a more talented team, and a more
assertively attacking team, than it was under Coach Bora
Milutinovic's conservative, defensive approach. Sampson's team has
previously defeated Brazil, Argentina, Nigeria and Mexico. But this
team did not demonstrate that it had improved in the World Cup.
Milutinovic's 1994 team advanced to the second round, and this one
did not.
</P>
<P>
   Such disastrous defeats are seldom tolerated in the most fervid
soccer countries. Carlos Alberto Parreira, who produced a champion
with Brazil in 1994, did not even survive the first round in 1998
before he was dumped by Saudi Arabia. And Cha Bum Kun got his
walking papers after South Korea was embarrassed 5-0 by the
Netherlands. But this being the United States, where soccer moms
are a more valued constituency than soccer coaches, Sampson is
still a member in good standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what Steve did wrong,'' Alan Rothenberg, president of
the United States soccer federation, said after the Iran game on
Sunday. ``I don't think Steve should be blamed. I don't think the
players should be blamed. They played their hearts out; they just
couldn't put the ball in the net.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Sampson's future, Rothenberg said, ``After the World
Cup, we'll start assessing the future. I'm not going to do it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson said that he wants to return. He said that he felt
``confident and proud'' about what he had accomplished in becoming
the first American coach to qualify the United States for a World
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the federation doesn't want me, I'm sure some other
organization will want me,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He could join MLS, where Rothenberg is seeking to buy the San
Jose Clash. And, fluent in Spanish, he has also expressed interest
in coaching in Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm open to all offers,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   If Sampson is fired, Parreira is again available. It was
Parreira who Rothenberg attempted to hire after Milutinovic was
fired in 1995. Carlos Queiroz of Portugal, whom Rothenberg also
previously sought, has just left the U.S. federation as head of
player development to coach the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant departure from the federation will be
Rothenberg's, when he steps down as a two-term president in August.
He organized what is considered the most successful World Cup in
1994, started a professional league and took soccer from
mom-and-pop amateurism to ambitious professionalism. The two
candidates to replace him, Dr. Robert Contiguglia and Lawrence
Monaco Jr., do not possess Rothenberg's international connections
or audacious showmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg believes the financial side of the federation is
solid with about $500 million set to come in from deals signed with
Nike and the International Management Group, and from television
rights, between now and 2010. On the player side, the federation
still has much work to do in aggressively recruiting Hispanic and
black athletes. Rothenberg said the federation intended to hire
scouts to roam the country spotting talent. But he acknowledged
that outside of places like the Houston Parks Department, the game
is not being played and organized as the federation would like in
the inner city.

<P>
   ``We need to do a better job attracting the best athletes the
United States has to offer into the sport of soccer,'' said
Sampson, who has built significant bridges into the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the United States needs players who can put the
ball into the net. In 14 games this year, the Americans have scored
an anemic 15 goals. Eric Wynalda is the country's all-time leading
scorer, but he has scored only twice in his last 15 games. At some
point, the Americans must realize that hitting the post or crossbar
four times against Iran was not bad luck but an obvious lack of
finishing skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``One area is key to our success _ precision in front of the
goal,'' Sampson said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he wanted players with ``personality,'' by which he
meant players who are not made timid by the opposition. This
hesitancy, or even fear, was obvious in a 2-0 loss to Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans also need leadership. All of the current players
have professional experience, but they sometimes seem like a team
of fraternity boys _ nice guys, but without any fearsome presence.
No one stepped in when Claudio Reyna took a shot to the kidneys in
the first minute of the Germany game. In replacing John Harkes,
Sampson did not replace his gritty personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team was capable of doing better than 1994,'' said
defender Jeff Agoos. ``It just didn't come through.''

COMMUNITY CARE CHIEF INDICTED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The US Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against
Frederick Thacher alleging that the chief executive of Community
Care Systems Inc. in Wellesley illegaly diverted the retirement
funds of about 400 of his employees.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in US District Court in Boston, alleges that
Thacher and his financially troubled company withheld approximately
$150,800 in 401(k) contributions from employee checks but did not
forward the money to their retirement plan. The suit seeks to hold
both CCSI and Thacher responsible for paying the retirement funds
into the plan, with interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are alleging that Thacher and his companies illegally
retained and used employee witholding amounts for their own
purposes because CCSI and some of its subsidiaries have been having
financial difficulty,'' said James Benages, Regional Director for
the Labor department's Pension &AMP; Welfare Benefits Administration,
which oversees employee retirement programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thacher did not return phone calls placed to his Boston home.
Jay Fialkow, the attorney who has been dealing with the Labor
department on Thacher's behalf, was out of town and unavailable for
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CCSI owns two psychiatric hospitals, Charles River Hospital in
Wellesley, and Jackson Brook Institute in Portland, Maine. Earlier
this year, CCSI closed another psychiatric hospital in Chicopee,
citing financial difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
in Maine after state authorities alleged CCSI had diverted $15.5
million to its Massachusetts subsidiaries. The company later
relinquished control of Jackson Brook to state regulators, leaving
behind an estimated $4.3 million in unpaid bills.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Brook is up for sale and has ``several interested
buyers,'' according to David Hillman, an attorney representing the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, financial problems continue to plague CCSI. Employees
at Charles River Hospital in Wellesley, who asked not to be named,
said in recent interviews that some of their paychecks have
bounced. They also said that the retirement contributions from
their checks have not been deposited in their 401(K) plan.
</P>
<P>
   One nurse at the hospital, who requested anonymity, said she
watched as the hospital's dumpster was repossessed last month. The
nurse said employees have been forced to haul hospital trash to the
local dump.
</P>
<P>
   CCSI is privately held. Thacher is the company's sole board
member and majority owner.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Departent's lawsuit alleges that since November 1997,
CSSI and its subsidiaries have failed to forward employee
reitrement assets to their 401(k) plan as required by the federal
Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as ERISA.
</P>
<P>
   ``These withheld monies have been and continue to be comingled
with the general assets of CCSI...,'' the suit alleges.

KENNEDY, OTHERS, CHEER ON HIKE IN MINIMUM WAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After nearly two hours of testimony, Senator Edward M.
Kennedy looked out at the crowd and pronounced his verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be a case against increasing the minimum wage, but
we sure haven't heard it today,'' the state's senior senator told
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   No, they hadn't. The State House's Gardner Auditorium, after
all, has its acoustical advantages. And Monday's was a rhetorical
echo between the panel of politicians and the public-policy
presenters before them.
</P>
<P>
   From Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, a recent convert to the idea
of raising the wage floor, to former Labor Secretary Robert Reich
and Paula Rayman, director of the Radcliffe Public Policy
Institute, to a grocery-store worker and a laundry employee
struggling along on the minimum wage, their views were unanimous:
Only good come could of hiking the minimum wage, whether at the
state level or federally, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Past predictions of adverse economic impacts hadn't come true,
said Cellucci, explaining why he now backs an idea he opposed only
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps that consensus shouldn't have come as a complete
surprise to the senator. According to press aide Darcy Lee, it was
his office, that picked the guests to speak at the informal
``minimum wage forum.'' Those they chose made it obvious what
Kennedy sought was not a debate, but a cheerleading squad. Asked
afterward why he hadn't also invited foes of a minimum-wage
increase, Kennedy said he had heard their arguments before and
didn't find them ``terribly convincing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The principal arguments are, one, unemployment and two,
inflation,'' Kennedy said. ``I thought Bob Reich, who is the
secretary of labor and the economist, addressed both of those
issues very well.''
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, who hails from less
contentious St. Louis, apparently left the forum thinking
Massachusetts was all of one mind about hiking the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no argument against it anymore,'' Gephardt declared.
``I don't know what they would argue. What would they argue?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, had Kennedy and company really wanted a debate, they
wouldn't have had to look awfully far.
</P>
<P>
   No further, say, than Copley Square, where the 5,000-member
Associated Industries of Massachusetts is located. The state's
largest employer group, AIM worries that hiking the state's minimum
wage will put Massachusetts at a competitive disadvantage with
neighboring states.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Coalition for a Competitive Massachusetts --
with seven chambers of commerce and eight business associations
among its members -- which sent a June 15 letter to state
legislators highlighting their concerns about job loss if the
minimum wage goes up.
</P>
<P>
   There's even market-oriented economist David Tuerck, executive
director of Suffolk University's Beacon Hill Institute, a
conservative thinktank. Tuerck says he would have happy to walk
across the street to argue the real effect of a minimum wage hike
is not so much job loss as jobs uncreated.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Brian Gilmore, AIM's executive vice-president, said he
would have liked to offer his views -- but wasn't surprised not to
have been asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the list of speakers that were invited, it didn't seem to
me that it was going to be an open hearing,'' Gilmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a conclusion that really is hard to argue with.

FIREARMS LICENSING FEE HALVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The gun lobby has been busy on Beacon Hill. It has also
been effective.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, a move to ban assault weapons was expected to pass the
House but the industry won a key amendment slicing in half the
proposed $50 firearms licensing fee. The move so stunned House
Speaker Thomas M. Finneran that he postponed further debate on the
issue until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   It may have marked the first time so many of Finneran's
committee chairs have voted out of line with his wishes and he
promptly called the team into a meeting in an attempt to reverse
the amendment, approved 79-73.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven members of Finneran's leadership voted for the amendment,
which would require those with firearm identification cards to pay
$25 _ rather than $50 _ every three years to renew their license.
The amendment also exempts those over 65, as well as those who
currently have hunting or sporting licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it costs just $2 for a lifetime permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of sportsmen out there saying you should go
after the criminals and leave us alone,'' said Representative David
Peters, a Charlton Republican, who offered the amendment. ``The
speaker has grossly overestimated the members' appetite for this
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Yacino, executive director of the Gun Owner's Action
League, said the group has for years been pushing for a bill that
would track all gun-related crimes, including whether the
perpetrator had a license.
</P>
<P>
   The current assault weapons ban, he said, would restrict those
with a license, while not truly preventing criminals from obtaining
high-powered guns illegally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts is not going to be able to stop crime by making
life more difficult for the licensed gun owner,'' Yacino said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Yacino for further comment Monday were
unsuccessful because, according to one GOAL worker, he was out
lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   Such arm twisting of the legislators may not defeat the assault
weapons ban altogether, but it has put it in jeopardy, while
fighting for second amendment rights continues on other fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the industry are scheduled to be in Suffolk
Superior Court Wednesday seeking an injunction against Attorney
General Scott Harshbarger's handgun safety regulations, some of
which took effect Jan. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations effectively ban Saturday Night Specials in the
state and require all handguns sold in Massachusetts to be child
proof, with tamper proof serial numbers and safety warnings.
</P>
<P>
   However, the American Sports Shooting Council Inc., along with
manufacturers Smith &AMP; Wesson Corp., Glock Inc. and Taurus Firearms
Co. Inc. have filed suit, charging Harhsbarger is overstepping his
authority. About 30 types of handguns, most of them .22- or
.25-caliber weapons are likely to be barred from sale here for
failing to meet the new standards.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger believes he has the right to implement such
regulations under the state's consumer protection laws. But the
industry says he is skirting the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Monday assailing the gun lobby for
attacking his regulations, Harshbarger said he hoped the House
would pass the assault weapons ban.

SUPREME COURT SHARPLY LIMITS HARASSMENT SUITS AGAINST SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court set a highly
restrictive standard Monday for determining when school districts
can be found liable under federal law for a teacher's sexual
harassment of a student.
</P>
<P>
   A harassment victim can recover damages from the school district
only if a school official with the authority to intervene actually
knew of the teacher's misconduct and, acting with ``deliberate
indifference,'' failed to stop it, the court said in an opinion by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The vote was 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case from a school district near Austin,
Texas, where a high school teacher seduced a ninth-grader and
engaged in a yearlong affair with her. The girl never told school
officials about the affair, which ended when a police officer
discovered the two. The teacher was dismissed and criminally
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The girl and her mother sued the Lago Vista Independent School
District for damages under a federal law, Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination by
educational institutions that receive federal money, a definition
that applies to all public school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Supreme Court decisions established that the law's
reference to sex discrimination covers a wide range of misconduct
involving sexual harassment, and also provided for suits for
damages by individual victims. But the court had not addressed the
standard for establishing liability.
</P>
<P>
   Over the four dissenters' vigorous protest that the court was
enacting into law a judicial ``policy judgment'' that would have
the effect of insulating school districts from nearly all such
lawsuits, the majority chose the most restrictive of several
alternative standards.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the court rejected the Department of Education's
interpretation of Title IX, under which a school district could be
found liable, regardless of whether officials knew of the
misconduct, if a teacher had misused his position of authority in
carrying out the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   That was a misunderstanding of Title IX, O'Connor said in her
majority opinion. ``It does not appear that Congress contemplated
unlimited recovery in damages against a funding recipient where the
recipient is unaware of discrimination in its programs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the majority opinion
along with Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and
Clarence Thomas. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H. Souter, and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor noted that Title IX ``amounts
essentially to a contract between the government and the recipient
of funds,'' under which schools agree to accept certain conditions,
such as preventing discrimination, in exchange for their federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said it did not make sense that Congress would have
expected school districts to subject themselves to open-ended
liability for misconduct of which no one in a position of authority
might even be aware.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while ``no one questions that a student suffers
extraordinary harm'' from harassment and abuse by teachers, the
court could not impose broad liability on school districts ``until
Congress speaks directly on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The National School Boards Association had warned the court, in
a brief filed on the Lago Vista district's behalf, that any
standard other than the ``actual knowledge'' test the court adopted
on Monday would have a ``devastating financial impact on the
nation's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   While many school districts receive relatively small amounts of
federal money _ $126,000 a year in the case of Lago Vista _ jury
verdicts in harassment cases can exceed $1 million, the school
board association's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a group of civil rights organizations _ led
by the National Women's Law Center _ here said in their brief that
because many victims of sexual harassment by teachers feel isolated
and afraid to report the situation, a liability standard that
depends on official knowledge would effectively immunize school
districts much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the plaintiff, Alida Star Gebser, testified that
she was afraid to tell anyone about her relationship with the
teacher, Frank Waldrop.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia D. Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, said Monday that the decision would ``make the job of
eliminating sexual harassment in schools far more difficult.''
Greenberger is currently seeking Supreme Court review in a case
that raises the separate but related question of whether schools
can be held liable for the harassment of one student by another.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision on Monday, Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School
District, No. 96-1866, upheld a ruling last year by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans. That court, affirming an
initial ruling by the U.S. District Court in Austin dismissing
Gebser's suit, held that the school district could be liable only
if a supervisory employee ``actually knew of the abuse, had the
power to end the abuse, and failed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions by other federal courts, including a 1997 ruling by
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New York, had taken a
different approach under which a district could be found liable if
a teacher had abused his authority over a student.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the court Monday went even further in
protecting school districts than the 5th Circuit opinion it
affirmed. O'Connor said that to establish liability, the school
district failure to respond must have amounted to ``deliberate
indifference to discrimination,'' which she defined as an
``official decision'' not to act on its knowledge. The 5th Circuit
had left open the question whether a district could be liable if
its failure to respond was simply negligent, rather than
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, in a dissenting opinion that the other dissenters also
signed, said the court had given school districts an incentive not
to take steps to protect vulnerable students. ``As long as school
boards can insulate themselves from knowledge about this sort of
conduct, they can claim immunity from damages liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters said that the court had in effect overruled a
1992 decision that made damages available to individual plaintiffs
in Title IX cases. The majority's reasoning suggested ``that no
damages should ever be awarded in a Title IX case,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate dissenting opinion, Ginsburg said that if a school
district had an effective policy in place for reporting and
redressing sexual harassment, such a policy could be an
``affirmative defense'' against a lawsuit by a plaintiff who had
not taken proper advantage of the policy. Souter and Breyer also
joined this opinion, which may have represented an abortive effort
to marshal a majority by allaying fears about unlimited liability
for school districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the court is scheduled to decide two other
sexual harassment cases. Both deal with employer liability for
harassment in the workplace, which is addressed by a different
federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For that
reason, the ruling Monday does not necessarily forecast the outcome
of the other cases.

CLINTON TARGETS TOBACCO COMPANIES THAT TARGET CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
WASHINGTON _ Giving no ground in his fight with tobacco companies
and their congressional allies, President Clinton called Monday for
annual government surveys to determine which tobacco brands are
favored by underage smokers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The information will help identify ``which companies are most
responsible for the problem'' of teen smoking, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents, quite simply, have a right to know'' which companies
are ``targeting children,'' the president said as he left for an
annual forum on family issues in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief session with reporters, Clinton fired another
verbal volley at Senate Republicans who last week blocked
comprehensive anti-smoking legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The congressional leadership seems willing to walk away from
its obligation to our children,'' the president said. ``The
Republican leadership placed partisan politics and tobacco
companies above our families. Their vote was not just pro-tobacco
lobby, it was anti-family.''
</P>
<P>
   Killed in a series of procedural votes, the anti-smoking
legislation hammered out over several months would have raised the
price of a pack of cigarettes by $1.10 over five years. The measure
would have expanded Food and Drug Administration regulation of
nicotine and subjected the industry to new restrictions on
marketing, advertising and labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, said
cigarette companies have agreed to help with research into why
teens use tobacco products. He said the survey ordered by Clinton
will not help in that research and amounts to ``a continuation of
his attack rhetoric while giving the impression to the public that
he is doing something substantive.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the president's remarks are viewed by the tobacco
companies ``as a political gesture designed to divert attention
from the fact that (the White House) failed to offer any
substantive leadership on the tobacco debate'' since an agreement
was reached a year ago between cigarette makers and several state
attorneys general with input from the administration.
</P>
<P>
   In that compromise, tobacco companies agreed that the industry
as a whole would pay up to $2 billion annually if youth smoking did
not decline. As the agreement was drafted in bill form, the White
House insisted that the annual maximum penalty be increased to $3.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a provision was inserted that would have
levied additional penalties against individual companies for
failing to meet their targets for weaning teen-agers from tobacco
products. To help determine which companies fell short of their
targets, the legislation called for an annual survey much like what
Clinton directed the Department of Health and Human Services to
produce.
</P>
<P>
   The government reports that about 3,000 young people start
smoking every day and 1,000 of them will die of smoking-related
causes. The average age for starting to smoke is 14 1/2, and seven
of every 10 smokers are hooked by their 18th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   A Health and Human Services study in 1994 found that when
advertising budgets were increased for Camel and Newport cigarettes
in the early 1990s, the number of teens buying Camels went up by 64
percent and by 55 percent for Newports. The study estimated that 3
million teens smoke cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president's announcement is a signal
he intends to ``push forward on all fronts'' and not wait idly for
Congress to act.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that once survey information reaches the public,
tobacco companies ``will then no longer be able to evade
accountability and neither will Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats say they will make the tobacco vote an issue in
the November elections, Republicans have expressed doubts that the
issue will resonate with voters. A recent poll by the independent
Pew Research Center found that by a 2-1 margin the public wants the
government to take some sort of action against tobacco companies.

<P>
   BOSTON _ The Menino administration Monday ushered the Democratic
party elite into town on a carpet of history to hawk Boston as the
natural milieu for the millenium convention.
</P>
<P>
   The visiting 50 Democrats may be teachers or union leaders in
everyday life, but Monday they were whisked by Lincoln Continental
from the fog-shrouded Logan International Airport to start a
privately-funded tour with lunch at the tres chic Maison Robert in
Old City Hall, featuring a surviving link to the golden days of
Camelot _ Senator Edward M. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Images from yesteryear that swathed the site committee Monday
were part of a strategy to stress the city's strength _sterling
Democratic roots, and downplay the mere 35 electoral votes that all
six New England states could, collectively, hope to offer to any
nominee.

   But, think history, say Boston officials. Paul Revere and John
Singleton Copley.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Los Angeles _ lead contender to host the August
2000 Democratic National Convention _ is set in vote-heavy
California and can offer a post-convention bounce as wide as the
west. Forget about Philadelphia as another cradle of liberty
situated in a key electoral state next door to heartland swing
states of the midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Boston history is the mantra percolating through the halls of
the all-Americana JFK Library, where Boston's pitch for the
convention started Monday evening. It is the third of seven stops
for the delegates, who will chose the host city sometime later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   After the library, the delegates moved on to the splendid Copley
Square and the grand entrance to the McKim building, circa 1895.
There, assembled party chairs from five states and a host of
panelists followed a hall of fame _ photographs of historic figures
with strong local ties from Leonard Bernstein (a Boston Latin
School graduate) to Henry David Thoreau (born in Concord and a
Harvard University graduate) to Harriet Tubman (active in the
women's movement in New England).
</P>
<P>
   ``What better place can you be for the millenium but where the
origins of our nation took place?'' said Howard Leibowitz, the
city's director of intergovernmental relations.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia could strike the same theme, but Boston hopes to
come out ahead of Philly, home to the Liberty Bell, by highlighting
its futuristic achievements in biotech and software fields, not to
mention the city's poster child status for the Clinton
administration's crime fighting successes.
</P>
<P>
   The attending Democrats, whose turnout is stronger here than in
most of the other seven cities the panel is visiting, were bestowed
with souvenirs at every turn. First, a pair of Rockports for each,
they were polled for shoe size in advance, to highlight the walking
city theme; then, a hand-held computer from 3Com corp., containing
the tour itinerary and important phone and pager numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As nice as the tchotchkes are, though, the Menino administration
has not lost sight of its audience of visiting party stalwarts who
love to revel in political lore.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the step through the looking glass of Camelot, and on to a
political memorabilia exhibit at the Boston Public Library, where
party diehards had an entire brass showcase devoted to pictures of
James Michael Curley, the infamous, bad boy Boston mayor (four
times between 1914 and 1950) and governor (1935-1937) who served
the voters while doing time in 1947.

CROWD FILLS COURTROOM AS COSBY TRIAL OPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ The victim's friends and family filled
two rows. The other seats were taken too, everyone crowded into the
courtroom Monday to see the teenager accused of killing Bill
Cosby's only son.
</P>
<P>
   But the entertainer whose celebrity was the draw during opening
statements made no appearance himself. He has said he wants a
dignified proceeding, and so Cosby and his wife stayed away from
the same courthouse where the O.J. Simpson civil trial was held two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, interest was intense, competition for seats stiff. Los
Angeles Superior Court Judge David D. Perez, who normally rules
from a temporary trailer behind the building, was relocated to a
second-floor courtroom for the Cosby case. Spectators had to pass
through a metal detector set up at the door, where extra security
personnel were also stationed.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the victim's last name, however, and the $130,000
Mercedez-Benz whose tire Cosby was changing on a dark freeway exit
road, little about the case sets it apart from any other street
robbery gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of all the attention was 19-year-old Mikail
Markhasev, charged with gunning down Ennis Cosby, 27, in the early
hours of Jan. 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In her opening statement, Deputy District Attorney Anne Ingalls
reconstructed the crime scene and police investigation for jurors,
then set out to prove that Markhasev's own jailhouse letters to
friends amount to a confession. The prosecution also contends that
Markhasev, a Ukranian immigrant who spent time in juvenile
detention, is a member of the notorious prison gang called the
Mexican Mafia. The letters introduced in court Monday were filled
with Spanish words and idiomatic expressions.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry Hall, the defendant's lawyer, told the racially mixed
jury that police have the wrong man, that the killer was in fact a
friend of Markhasev's who is now a star prosecution witness. Both
men resemble the composite picture that was based on a description
given by one of Ennis Cosby's friends, who was shining her car's
lights on his tire as he changed it.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the trial, Hall said, ``We will know who the
killer is, and it's not him.'' He added, ``This case is about a
chance meeting. It's also a case full of mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   The murder and attempted robbery charges could put Markhasev,
who wore a gray suit with a fine pinstripe to court, in prison for
the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis Cosby, a graduate student at Columbia University, was
visiting his parents during Christmas break when he was shot and
left to die on the side of the road at 1:45 a.m. Two months later,
police arrested Markhasev, and prosecutors intend to call 25
witnesses who they say will bolster DNA analysis and other physical
evidence that places him on the darkened stretch of road.
</P>
<P>
   But Hall, a public defender, noted that Stephanie Crane, Cosby's
friend, failed to identify Markhasev in a police lineup and
stressed that two friends who say they were with Markhasev that
night lied, in part to receive lenient treatment in an unrelated
case. One, Eli Zakaria, 24, is the real killer, Hall insisted again
and again.
</P>
<P>
   Police recovered the murder weapon, a .38-caliber pistol, and a
knit cap that Crane said the killer was wearing, with the help of
two of the defendant's other friends. One, Michael Chang, is
expected to testify that Markhasev called him for help finding the
murder weapon, which he had thrown away. Markhasev also allegedly
admitted killing Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, however, said the stories were motivated by a $100,000
reward offered by a supermarket tabloid. To underscore his point
that the prosecution's witnesses are not credible, he displayed
posters featuring their pictures and criminal records. He also said
the letters his client allegedly wrote were forgeries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about people covering up for Eli Zakaria, and
that's fine and dandy for all of the witnesses to do. . .,'' Hall
told jurors. ``But your job is to see through that.''

     THE POETRY OF MONICA LEWINSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years before &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  was a friendly White House intern,
she was a schoolgirl poet, reports the New York Post. The latest
issue of the literary quarterly Open City reprints a poem she wrote
at the age of 10 or 11, published in the yearbook of the  &UR; John
Thomas Dye &LR;  School:
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a pizza/ I can be a delicious lunch, dinner/ or
breakfast, if you're weird/ I have a great deal of toppings on me/
I am a round and flat piece of dough/ with lots of toppings/ I make
your mouth water/ I'm very good to eat, but I'm/ Fattening!/ I am a
mouth's best friend/ I make you say, `Yum, Yum'/ I am a pizza.''
</P>
<P>
   Deconstructionists will note the author's identification of
herself within the pizza structure as a piece of dough that serves
as a support for repeatedly mentioned ``toppings,'' obviously
indicative of the young Lewinsky's ambition to serve as a
functionary for a top executive, to wit, the nation's
executive-in-chief.

AT LEAST 10 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DIE FROM HEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Torrid heat has killed at least 10 people who
have walked into the United States illegally, U.S. Border Patrol in
southern Texas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As another body was found on Monday, the Border Patrol launched
Operation Lifesaver to find and rescue others who have crossed the
border in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are walking in conditions where we wouldn't last a
day,'' said Patty Mancha, a spokeswoman for the patrol in the
border city of Del Rio. ``From now through the end of August, we'll
be on alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Drought and extreme heat have gripped the region in recent
weeks. Walking in the sun and temperatures hovering around 100 can
cause dehydration and weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they found more than two dozen illegal
immigrants jammed into the back of an unventilated moving van
outside San Marcos, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 men were sick from heat and dehydration when they were
found late Sunday morning, said Ray Dudley, spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temperature inside the van was estimated at 125 degrees or
higher,'' Dudley said. ``We had to have medical personnel look the
men over, and they were taken back to our offices where they were
given water and fluids all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, bodies have been discovered in remote
stretches along the Rio Grande. On Monday, a group of men from
Mexico led agents to a body south of Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several isolated stretches where there's no water,
and a person can walk for days and not see a soul,'' Mancha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have a compass or any sense of
direction,'' she said. ``There's a tendency to get delirious.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Operation Lifesaver, INS, which oversees the Border
Patrol, has provided public service announcements for Mexican radio
and television stations to warn potential immigrants about the
dangers of extreme heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth your life!'' warns one radio message.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Mexican officials last week announced a joint plan
aimed at keeping illegal immigrants out of dangerous areas, at
rescuing them if they get in trouble, and identifying those who
die.
</P>
<P>
   Agents who roam in vehicles as well as those deployed in
helicopters and aircraft have received emergency medical training
and are carrying extra jugs of water.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is not only to hunt for people entering the United
States illegally, but try to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're geared up if anything happens,'' said Fred Borrego, head
of a patrol checkpoint near Kingsville.

FOR THE LIBERTY BELL, A MOVE WITH A VIEW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 28)  
 (JT)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ No tourist attraction in Philadelphia draws more
people than the Liberty Bell. Last year, the National Park Service
recorded 1.6 million visitors at the modest pavilion where it sits,
helping make Independence National Historical Park one of the
busiest park service sites.
</P>
<P>
   Just stand there, and ponder its wonder, the inscrutable crack
and words that speak to the freedoms of a nation: ``Proclaim
Liberty throughout all the Land unto all the Inhabitants Thereof,''
a passage from Leviticus.
</P>
<P>
   And now, gaze beyond the bell. Just off in the distance is
glorious Independence Hall, a spired structure of red brick where
the Declaration of Independence was adopted, the United States
Constitution was drafted and the 2,080-pound bell once hung. And
just beyond Independence Hall, towering high above it _ indeed,
dominating the view _ are the Penn Mutual office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The what? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is now painfully apparent that the esthetics of Independence
Mall, created in 1976 as part of a national park with its symbols
of liberty and justice for all, did not take into account two
insurance-company buildings that possess little in the way of
architectural or historical significance.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller of the Penn Mutual buildings dates from the 1920s,
the larger from about 50 years later, when the general area was
still densely populated with offices, businesses and center-city
residents, and Independence Hall was just another old building in
the oldest section of one of America's oldest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the pavilion housing the bell, which opened on Jan. 1, 1976,
to celebrate the Bicentennial, was placed smack in front of
Independence Hall, with a view that leaves it dwarfed by the
mercantile backdrop. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's about to change. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the park service's most ambitious effort to beautify the mall
and dramatize its two greatest treasures, plans are underway to
move the bell from its location near Market Street, between 5th and
6th Streets, into a larger new pavilion 200 yards away just off the
corner of 6th and Chestnut, a shift toward the southwest that will
allow visitors at the bell to view Independence Hall at a sharp
angle, with open sky as the background, not buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Independence Hall is an international icon,'' said
David Hollenberg, assistant regional director for the National Park
Service, ``and many people have a strong desire to see the hall and
the bell against its spire simultaneously. But in the current
setting, it doesn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a new site for the bell, the redesign efforts
will include a Liberty Bell interpretive center near the bell
pavilion, a visitor center and a new National Constitution Center,
a project endorsed by Congress to focus attention on the
Constitution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Park officials say the plans for the pavilion will not be
finalized for several months. The entire project will take at least
two years and cost $215 million, only $65 million of which has been
raised from public and private sources.
</P>
<P>
   When the Park Service embarked several years ago on its latest
long-range study to consider how to make the park more
accommodating to the growing number of annual visitors, officials
did not immediately contemplate such a radical change as moving the
Liberty Bell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For more than 200 years, it has largely resided in Philadelphia,
leaving for occasional exhibits outside the city around the turn of
the century. After two parades in Philadelphia during World War I,
it was moved only once more, from inside Independence Hall to its
current pavilion. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Park Service's interest in changing the design of
Independence Park drew an assortment of suggestions _ some modest
in scope _ that recommended leaving the Liberty Bell where it is,
and some controversial. One group proposed building a high-tech
underground $170 million Constitution Center, with the Liberty Bell
at its ground-level exit point.
</P>
<P>
   Park officials unveiled their general ideas for redevelopment
last year, but it was not until they retained a nearby local
architectural firm to conceive a plan did the idea of moving the
bell come to light. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The head of the firm, Laurie Olin, was a frequent visitor to the
mall and, as Hollenberg said, was the first person to propose
moving the bell to enhance the view of the hall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first to note that from the Liberty Bell was the
only place to view the spire,'' Hollenberg said. Once officials
agreed (and they agreed quickly) that the shift made sense, the
rest of the plan fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   An important part is the new pavilion, which will be designed to
give bell viewers longer and quieter visits. In its current
pavilion, the bell can be viewed by up to 150 people at a time,
with rangers offering historical perspective. With the new plans
that include a separate interpretive center and more expansive
surroundings at the bell, visitors will be allowed to spend more
reflective moments, without rangers whisking them out for the next
group.

AT LEAST 10 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DIE FROM HEAT

<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Torrid heat has killed at least 10 people who
have walked into the United States illegally, U.S. Border Patrol
officials in southern Texas said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As another body was found on Monday, the Border Patrol launched
Operation Lifesaver to find and rescue those who have crossed the
border in remote areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are walking in conditions where we wouldn't last a
day,'' said Patty Mancha, a spokeswoman for the patrol in the
border city of Del Rio. ``From now through the end of August, we'll
be on alert.''
</P>
<P>
   Drought and extreme heat have gripped the region in recent
weeks. Walking in the sun and temperatures hovering around 100 can
cause dehydration and weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said they found more than two dozen illegal
immigrants jammed into the back of an unventilated moving van
outside San Marcos, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The 28 men were sick from heat and dehydration when they were
found late Sunday morning, said Ray Dudley, spokesman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temperature inside the van was estimated at 125 degrees or
higher,'' Dudley said. ``We had to have medical personnel look the
men over, and they were taken back to our offices where they were
given water and fluids all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, bodies have been discovered in remote
stretches along the Rio Grande. On Monday, a group of men from
Mexico led agents to a body south of Kingsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are several isolated stretches where there's no water,
and a person can walk for days and not see a soul,'' Mancha said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't have a compass or any sense of
direction,'' she said. ``There's a tendency to get delirious.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of Operation Lifesaver, INS, which oversees the Border
Patrol, has provided public service announcements for Mexican radio
and television stations to warn potential immigrants about the
dangers of extreme heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not worth your life!'' warns one radio message.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Mexican officials last week announced a joint plan
aimed at keeping illegal immigrants out of dangerous areas, at
rescuing them if they get in trouble, and identifying those who
die.
</P>
<P>
   Agents who roam in vehicles as well as those deployed in
helicopters and aircraft have received emergency medical training
and are carrying extra jugs of water.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is not only to hunt for people entering the United
States illegally, but try to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're geared up if anything happens,'' said Fred Borrego, head
of a patrol checkpoint near Kingsville.

 &HT;    On deck for Atlanta: New York Yankees
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV/radio: TBS.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: LHP Tom Glavine (9-3, 2.75 ERA;
0-0, 0.00 lifetime vs. Yankees) vs. RHP Orlando Hernandez (2-0,
1.52; first appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: Glavine, who had his five-game winning streak snapped
by Florida last Thursday, returns to the scene of one of his best
performances last season. In the opener of a three-game interleague
series, Glavine threw nine innings of eight-hit (all singles),
shutout ball before the Yankees hit four straight singles off Mike
Bielecki in the 10th inning to win 1-0. That was one of Glavine's
12 no-decisions last season. Tonight, he goes after his 10th win.
Two Yankees have had success against Glavine in the past: Darryl
Strawberry, with three home runs in 32 at-bats (8-for-32, .250);
and Tim Raines (4-for-13, .308). Hernandez makes his fourth
major-league start since being called up from Class AAA Columbus.
After winning his first two starts, El Duque got no decision in a
5-2 win last Thursday in Cleveland. He gave up seven hits and two
earned runs in 7-2/3 innings, and was hoping to become only the
fourth Yankee to start and win his first big-league appearances
(and the first since Mel Stottlemyre in 1964). Opponents are
hitting just .198 against Hernandez (16-for-81, one homer). He's
been especially tough against right-handed hitters (.143, 5-for-35;
lefties are .11-for-46, .239, one homer).

 &HT;    History revisited: Jones remembers homers of '96 Series
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   New York _ Andruw Jones sat Monday afternoon behind the batting
cage at Yankee Stadium, stretching the legs that make him such a
dangerous outfielder. To his left, about 320 feet away, is where he
made history almost two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was 19 then, blasting two home runs in Game 1 of the World
Series, the youngest player ever to go deep in the Fall Classic.
</P>
<P>
   They landed in the seats in left field, and the next morning
Jones landed across the back pages of the New York tabloids. They
called him The Kid, baseball's newest phenom, playing a starring
role in a town and a stadium that such greats as Babe Ruth, Joe
DiMaggio and Mickey Mantle called home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jones is 21, and on Monday he was barely noticed as he
trotted on to the field for batting practice. No mobs of reporters
approaching him. No one yelling his name.
</P>
<P>
   Not that he won't be a star some day. But those two Series
homers still stand above everything else. Baseball still is waiting
for Jones to blossom offensively, but there are signs he is about
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't think about those homers,'' he said. ``I'm just
concentrating on baseball right now. Maybe when I retire I will
look back and really think about them. But it's not 1996 anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones comes to New York hitting .261 with 12 home runs and 42
RBIs. At his current pace, he would finish with 26 homers and 91
RBIs, power numbers that are nothing to be ashamed. Then again,
it's easy to expect a lot from a player who hit homers on his first
two Series at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I will never forget those homers,'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ``It was huge, it was very exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has learned quite a lot since that Fall Classic. He has
learned that baseball can be a very humbling game, after struggling
for most of last season and getting off to a terrible start this
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves remained patient. They could afford to; one thing
that never suffers is Jones' defense. It is always very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard all the people saying I should be in the minors,''
Jones said. ``But they had seen me play, they knew what I could
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball people think that his development might have been
retarded by the two homers he hit here. In other words, it gave him
a false sense of security or perhaps even a big head. It also put
all kinds of pressure on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Andruw feels pressure,'' Cox said. ``He sure
didn't feel any pressure when he was struggling earlier this
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said ``I don't read things (about me), but people come up
and tell me things. I have learned a lot over the last two years, I
have learned what it is like to play under pressure. But I am still
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Like teammates Javier Lopez and Eddie Perez, Jones has been
helped by the presence of Andres Galarraga, both on and off the
field. Galarraga, able to communicate with the team's Latin players
in their own language, has been a settling influence for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andres has helped me, (and) so has C.J.,'' Jones said,
referring to batting coach Clarence Jones, ``but they cannot go up
to the plate and hit for me. I have to do that. I have to be the
one that takes the advice and makes it work at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   And right now it's working.

 &HT;    Harpring awaiting NBA's verdict
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As Matt Harpring stands on the threshold of a pro
career, it's important to remember that he has been fooling
basketball scouts for years.
</P>
<P>
   Harpring was a solid football prospect in high school at the
Marist School, a quarterback who had Wake Forest and Northwestern
to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   But Harpring grew three inches between his junior and senior
years at Marist and became a hot basketball property. Georgia
wanted him. Georgia Tech got him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a chance Harpring can become an Atlanta Hawk during
the NBA draft Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although he hopes he'll be taken higher _ the Hawks pick 20th _
Harpring says he wouldn't mind a chance to play his entire career
in his home town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done what I can,'' he said. ``If I go in the teens,
that's great. If I end up in Atlanta, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpring figures that would make him one half of a very exotic
bet. ``Keith Brooking went to my school, then to Tech and was
drafted by the Falcons. If I go from Marist to Tech to the Hawks,
how often does something like that happen?''
</P>
<P>
   How often does an athlete come home a winner as a longshot?
</P>
<P>
   Harpring wasn't a gleam in Bobby Cremins' eye until his senior
year in high school, yet he joined Mark Price, as the only two
Georgia Tech players ever named first-team All-ACC three seasons in
a row. He averaged 21.6 points as a senior and 17.9 ppg. as a
four-year starter.
</P>
<P>
   But problems for the 6-6 1/2 forward grew out of his inability
to work out for a number of teams this spring. Limited by an ankle
injury, he dropped from the upper third of the first round and now
faces an uncertain landing.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors, of course.
</P>
<P>
   First, the influx of young, athletic players has obscured a less
flashy senior who now may find himself slipping into the 20s
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Houston and Orlando dominate the middle of the draft,
holding all but one selection from 12 through 18. If they don't
take Harpring and Minnesota passes at 17, then the solidly built
22-year-old is looking at Milwaukee (19), Atlanta (20), Charlotte
(21) or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Harpring's ailment is a bone bruise in his left ankle, similar
to a stress reaction. ``I hurt my ankle with three or four games
left in the season,'' he said Monday. ``It was stiff and sore. I
took two weeks off from running and lifting, and I guess I should
have taken more time.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Richard Howell knew the clock was ticking and that
Harpring would have plenty of time to rest this summer. ``He said,
`You need to work out,''' Harpring said. ``I did and it got sore
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpring visited the Magic and the Rockets last week and worked
out for Minnesota on Monday. He believes teams understand his
predicament. And if he slips, he slips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what I could. I really wanted to let these teams get to
meet me and get to know me. After four years at Georgia Tech, they
should know my game.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Hawks know Harpring. They watched through four
years of college competition. They saw him scrimmage with NBA
players in September. So, when Harpring met recently with the
Hawks' basketball staff and took their psychological tests, there
was no pressure to see him on the floor again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've watched throughout his career,'' Hawks general manager
Pete Babcock said Monday, offering this evaluation: ``The plus side
of his game is that he plays with great intensity, great effort. He
is unrelenting in his work. The downside is that he's an undersized
small forward by NBA standards, but he remains a great
competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell said he believes Harpring's value has held, but in a
draft this unpredictable, everyone's hedging bets.
</P>
<P>
   Scouts know Harpring can shoot, and there is the suggestion his
game will improve in the NBA, where a player who did everything in
college fulfills a role much more narrowly defined.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's a matter of waiting.

ITALY READY TO UNLEASH `ALE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Powerful strikers such as Argentina's
Gabriel Batistuta and Brazil's Ronaldo have been drawing most of
the attention at France '98. Their teams, along with Croatia,
France, and Nigeria, clinched second-round berths after two games
and will be coasting in preparation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a feeling that a more subtle force could soon
explode. Call it coincidence or call it destiny. The young Italian
forward they call ``Ale'' will make his France '98 starting debut
against Austria at Stade de France tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The shouts should be louder than during Monday's training
session at the massive Stade, when Alessandro Del Piero's teammates
constantly called out the diminutive of his name, sounding much
like, ``Allez, allez, allez,'' the French for, ``Go, go, go!''
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero is expected to become the center of attention for
Italy, a player with grace and style plus the innate ability to
produce goals in the most difficult circumstances. He is the
logical successor to Roberto Baggio.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this can be a mixed blessing. Baggio was the Italian savior
at USA '94, but the tournament ended sourly as he missed a penalty
kick against Brazil and then was consigned to many months of
purgatory fighting for recognition in Italy's Serie A. National
team coach Cesare Maldini, a pragmatist from the conservative
school, deemed creators such as Baggio and Del Piero out of
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero was left out of qualifying games, despite a prolific
goal-scoring record for Juventus, and Baggio was resurrected only
the week before Maldini had to submit a roster for this event.
Baggio pulled off another magic trick to salvage a draw against
Chile in the opener but against Cameroon, he declined and was
replaced by Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero has recovered from a thigh injury and gets his turn
now. Monday's practice concluded after Del Piero slipped a
brilliant backheel to Paolo Maldini for a goal _ just the type of
play Baggio used to make regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Maldini would not confirm the starting lineup for tonight,
saying that the shirts the players were wearing would be a good
clue.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Del Piero and his Juventus teammate, Filippo
Inzaghi, would be paired in attack. But it is unlikely that former
Juventus striker Christian Vieri is being excluded, since he is
tied for second with Chile's Marcelo Salas in scoring in this
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Italy could go with a three-pronged attack. The only other
change could be Luigi Di Biagio, possibly displacing Demetrio
Albertini as the midfield generator.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero, 23, is from San Vendemiano, near the Piave River and
less than 50 miles from Baggio's hometown of Caldogno. Del Piero
has a high profile in most of the world but he has not been
promoted like Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   Del Piero has a long-term contract with Juventus and the club
considers him the heir to Michel Platini, the stylish Frenchman who
led Juve to European success in the '80s. Again, Del Piero is
associated with coincidence or destiny; Platini is president of the
France '98 Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Del Piero's World Cup is just getting started, so too are the
traditional World Cup powers. A closer look at where things stand:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP A &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brazil can guarantee Norway's elimination with a two-goal
victory tonight. The Brazilians' primary objective is to prepare
for their second-round match at Parc des Princes Saturday. But they
could be motivated by Norwegian coach Egil Olsen, who has been
critical since his team defeated Brazil, 4-2, in Oslo last year.
This could open the way for Scotland, which has never advanced past
the first round of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP B &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chile is the favorite to follow Italy. The Chileans have
performed well, taking the initiative with strikers Ivan ``El
Terrible'' Zamorano and El Matador Salas, only to surrender late
goals in ties against Italy and Austria. Chile was eliminated from
the 1990 and '94 World Cups after a scandalous faked injury
incident during a qualifier against Brazil. Coincidentally, Brazil
is the second-round foe for Group B's second-place team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP C &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   France requires at least a draw against Denmark in Lyon tomorrow
to win the group. This would allow Les Bleus to avoid Nigeria in
Sunday's second-round match. Both France and Denmark are missing
key players after Red Thursday, when referees expelled five players
in two games. Zinedine Zidane of France and Tibor Molnar of Denmark
are suspended for two games, and Denmark's Mogen Weighorst is out
for one match.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP D &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria has a chance to try a different defensive scheme with
captain Uche Ukechukwu suspended against Paraguay in Toulouse
tomorrow. Goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert has promised to score the
most memorable goal of the World Cup, and has come close on two
free kicks for the Paraguayans. Both Bulgaria and Spain, among the
most impressive teams at USA '94, could be out of the tournament
after this game. The Spaniards lost only one game since falling to
Italy in Foxborough four years ago before falling to Nigeria last
week.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP E &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexico carries CONCACAF's hopes after Jamaica and the US were
quickly eliminated. Tomorrow in St. Etienne, the Mexicans will meet
the Netherlands, which showed its potential in a 5-0 crushing of
South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP F &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Germany and Yugoslavia are contending for the top spot, which
likely means avoiding the Netherlands in the second round.
Yugoslavia is regretting surrendering a late goal to Oliver
Bierhoff in a 2-2 tie with the Germans in Lens Sunday. The
Yugoslavs will need a big win over the US in Nantes Thursday to
overtake the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP G &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Romania gave England a reality check with a 2-1 win in Toulouse
last night. Gheorge Hagi's team remains among the most dynamic in
this tournament. The second spot will be determined by the
Colombia-England matchup in Lens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
GROUP H &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Argentina and Croatia, as expected, dominated the group and will
meet for first place in Bordeaux Friday. The Argentines have the
World Cup's leading scorer, Batistuta, plus Ariel ``El Burrito''
Ortega, and have a team capable of progressing beyond the Diego
Maradona era. Japan has been the best of the newcomers so far, a
good sign for the 2002 World Cup, which it will host with South
Korea.

   REPUBLIC, Mo. _ Eight years ago, on a whim, Marilyn Shexsnayder
entered the contest to design a logo for her hometown. She was a
stockbroker, not an artist. But using her colored pencils and her
computer she drew an oustretched hand, a family of four in
silhouette and, to portray the centrality of religion in this old
railroad town with more than 25 churches and about 8,000 people,
she sketched the simple fish that she had regarded from childhood
as a universal symbol of faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish is better than a cross, because if you use a cross,
the Jewish people are mad because it's not a star of David,'' Mrs.
Shexsnayder says. ``I wanted a symbol that would represent religion
totally, all religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Shexsnayder won the logo contest and $100 prize, and for
eight years the logo with the fish has adorned the town's trucks,
flags, street signs, stationery, business cards and chamber of
commerce brochures.
</P>
<P>
   Now, suddenly, the little fish is causing an awfully big splash.
Someone complained about the fish to the American Civil Liberties
Union, and in February the organization sent a letter asking the
mayor to delete the fish from the logo because the fish was
``unmistakably identified with Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish symbol, also known as an ichthus, first appeared in
the second century and was used as a secret sign of Christianity,''
said the letter from Doug Bonney, a volunteer ACLU lawyer, quoting
from a Bible dictionary, two Christian encyclopedias and a
theological review. The first Greek letters of the phrase ``Jesus
Christ, Son of God, Savior'' spell out ``fish'' in Greek, and often
appear with the fish symbol. ``Thus we believe the City's seal
violates the First Amendment's prohibition against the
establishment of religion,'' Bonney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of changing its logo, like another nearby town recently
faced with a similar warning from the ACLU, Republic has vowed to
fight. Many Republic residents are gearing up for the battle,
saying they must take a stand for local autonomy against meddling
outsiders like the ACLU, and for the Christian faith of the town's
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logo represents the town overall,'' said Paula Howell, an
office manager at an accounting firm and a third-generation
Republic native, ``and I don't see anything wrong with that because
the majority of our community are actually Christians. The majority
of our community are very religious. This is the Bible Belt and the
number of churches we have per person is pretty high. It ranks
right up there with fast-food restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy also reveals what happens when a religiously and
ethnically homogeneous town begins to feel the first cracks in its
communal identity. This is a place so steeped in an evangelical
Protestant sensibility that residents talk about ``non-Christians,
such as Catholics.'' A handful of Jewish and Asian families live
here, but nobody seems to know of any black or Hispanic residents.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in a sign of the town's emerging diversity, a Jewish man
was elected to the board of aldermen, and some people have friends
married to Muslims. One resident Wiccan, a practicing witch, says
that until the fish dispute arose, she had felt comfortable rearing
her family in Republic. And one evening in April when the board of
aldermen was taking up the fish issue at city hall, dozens of high
school and college students turned out to protest, carrying signs
saying, ``Small Towns, NOT Small Minds'' and ``Diversity Is
Divine.''
</P>
<P>
   Debates like this one in Republic over the separation of church
and state are coming up with increasing regularity around the
country. Sometimes the issue is a town's or state's logo or slogan
with an explicitly religious reference; sometimes a creche placed
on civic property; and sometimes a teacher or coach leading
students in prayer. Often, the conflicts must be resolved in court.
</P>
<P>
   In Republic, the warning letter from the Civil Liberties Union
stung like a poison arrow from a hostile tribe. In March, more than
60 people packed a meeting of the board of aldermen, where many
residents, including ministers, spoke passionately in defense of
the fish. Mayor Douglas Boatwright, who was then running for
re-election, scuffed his foot across the floor and announced, ``I,
for one, would like to draw a line in the sand and say this is it.
I will not change the logo!''
</P>
<P>
   Boatwright's challenger in the race for mayor, James Huntsinger,
a retired Army warrant officer who moved to Republic three years
ago, said the city's time and money would be better spent on less
``trivial'' matters like weather-proofing houses and the
environmental impact of the local building boom. He soon found
himself making house calls to voters who telephoned him questioning
whether he was truly a Christian. Huntsinger says he tried to
explain that he was indeed a Christian who favors prayer in the
schools, but found the fish on the logo ``constitutionally
indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fish became the big issue in the election,'' Huntsinger
said in an interview. ``Everything else kind of took a back seat.''
</P>
<P>
   The fish began appearing all over town _ on a banner on the side
of Calvary Baptist Church, drawn on sidewalks saying, ``Save Me,''
as a sculpture on busy U.S. Highway 60, the main road through town.
</P>
<P>
   At the local nail salon, manicurists began painting fish on
customers' fingernails. A few weeks before the election, on April
7, Debbie Boatright, the mayor's wife, appeared in a photograph on
the front page of The Republic Monitor displaying her fish
manicure. Boatright, who declined to be interviewed, won the
election against Huntsinger, 716-587.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Howell, the third-generation Republic native, and 10 other
residents answered the board of aldermen's call for the formation
of a citizens' committee to raise money to defend the fish. The
board estimated that the city would need at least $100,000 to cover
legal fees to finance the fish fight.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Mrs. Howell insisted that her ``Support
Republic Committee'' did not want to be seen as a ``bunch of Bible
thumpers.'' She is a member of the state PTA board, and has run for
local office as a Democrat. At the committee's first meeting, Mrs.
Howell said, they prayed to ask God for direction. Then they
decided not to pray in their meetings again ``so the ACLU doesn't
use anything against us.'' So far the committee had raised $10,000.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Howell said the city's volunteer lawyers are exploring a
legal strategy that will draw on research showing that the fish
predates Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that if we can prove it's not just a Christian
symbol,'' Mrs. Howell said, ``we stand a very good chance of not
having it removed, because it's showing faith in general and not a
specific religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Kurtenbach, executive director of the Civil Liberties Union
of Kansas and Western Missouri, the regional office handling the
lawsuit, said in a telephone interview, ``This is precisely the
harm that comes to religion in these battles. What's sad is,
Republic is now scrambling to try to circumvent the First
Amendment's establishment clause by saying, `This symbol doesn't
mean much.'''
</P>
<P>
   After all this time, the person who started the controversy by
complaining about the logo has never identified himself or herself
publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their own little paranoid theories,'' Mrs.
Howell said. ``Mine is that the ACLU moves people into the
community just to do this.'' She said she believed that when a
black father and his family once moved into a trailer park in
Republic and then accused the town of racial discrimination and
suddenly moved out, the ACLU had planted them there.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the ACLU are talking with several potential
plaintiffs about whose name should go on the lawsuit. One possible
plaintiff withdrew, Kurtenbach said, out of fear of losing a job.
</P>
<P>
   Gay Revi, a volunteer with the Civil Liberties Union in
Springfield, said, ``There's a real climate of fear down in
Republic right now and some of these people who initially spoke up
do not want to be named publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper editor, Larry Rottmann, insisted he was not the
person who complained, and the witch, Jean Webb, said she had not
complained either, but was considering signing on to the lawsuit
for the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not Christian. We are Wicca,'' Mrs. Webb said, talking
at a table at the Taco Bell with Jessica, her teen-age daughter.
Mrs. Webb said she had moved her family to Republic three years ago
after her daughter was harassed for her religion at the elementary
school in nearby Aurora. They moved to Republic for the good
school, the warm people, and to stay near the doctors who are
treating her husband, who has emphysema. Republic had been
``everything we wanted, until the ichthus thing came up,'' Mrs.
Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Mrs. Webb had worked at the newspaper as a
typesetter and writer. After the aldermen's meeting in March, she
says the publisher asked her to write a counterpoint editorial
opposing the fish. Mrs. Webb's editorial criticized the ``righteous
anger'' and ``gang mentality'' she said she saw at the meeting. She
says the fervor frightened her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Webb left her job at the newspaper, she says, under
pressure from the new publisher, the father of the former
publisher. Neighborhood children have taunted Jessica, she said.
``It's gotten ugly,'' she said. ``As soon as my husband passes on,
we're moving.''
</P>
<P>
   No one involved in the fish controversy has driven the five
miles from town to Marilyn Shexsnayder's farm to ask her what she
thinks should become of the logo she designed, says Mrs.
Shexsnayder, who is mostly housebound, recovering from a car
accident two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say my eyes have been opened,'' Mrs. Shexsnayder said
softly. Until the furor over the fish, she said, ``I didn't know it
was just for Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sitting beside his wife, Del Shexsnayder, who runs a dry-ice
business and sits on the board of the local Lions Club, said that
no one he knew was in favor of keeping the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are some people within the political network of
Republic, strong Christians, that are taking this just too far,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Shexsnayder had to do it all over again, she said she
would try to find a symbol that was truly universal. ``Maybe,'' she
offered, ``a halo.''

AFTER NAFTA, EL PASO AND OTHER BORDER CITIES FACE HIGH
UNEMPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas _ Four years after the North American Free Trade
Agreement lowered trade barriers, the cities along Texas' long
border with Mexico that had hoped to benefit are instead struggling
to become more than glorified truck stops as they watch their
manufacturing jobs go south by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Almost everywhere else in the United States, the economy is
booming, and the national unemployment rate is the lowest in nearly
30 years. In Texas university towns like Austin and College
Station, employers complain of deep labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But along the border, unemployment persists at two and three
times the national rate, and incomes remain far below state and
national averages. Though NAFTA has created jobs in the warehouses
and truck depots that line its highways, free trade has moved
across the Rio Grande thousands more low-skill, low-wage factory
jobs that had been a mainstay of the border economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole free-trade thing turned out to be for the big
companies, not the little guy,'' Ricardo Granado, the manager of
the TeMex Money Exchange in Brownsville, said recently as trucks
bearing goods from Mexico roared past after crossing the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, clothes makers like Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.,
Wrangler, Lee and Tex-Mex Apparel have put thousands of El Paso
residents out of work.
</P>
<P>
   Refugio Arrieta lost her job as a pocket stitcher two years ago
when the Tex-Mex factory moved its 150 jobs to Mexico. She is among
10,000 workers in El Paso who the Labor Department says have lost
jobs because of NAFTA, the most anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the economy of El Paso is leaving so many of us
behind,'' said Ms. Arrieta, who has no high school diploma and
minimal English. ``We have been written off.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Ms. Arrieta, who is struggling to learn English
while in a retraining program to be a nurse's assistant, are at the
center of the problem facing border cities that once marketed
themselves as sources of cheap labor.
</P>
<P>
   Now that those kinds of jobs are being lost to Mexico, the
cities realize they must attract better-paying, higher-skill jobs.
But the work force, swelling with poor Mexican immigrants, is
ill-equipped for them.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Christian, the chairman of the Greater El Paso Chamber of
Commerce, said that business leaders this year identified
retraining workers as by far the community's top need.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a Silicon Valley and we're not close to being a
Silicon Valley, but we can compete for high-tech jobs,'' said
Christian, who is chief executive of the local Norwest Bank.
</P>
<P>
   With a large young work force and a low cost of living, the area
interests many corporations as a manufacturing base, he said.
``Basically, these companies say if you can give us a labor base
with adequate skills, if you provide us with that, we would make
you our first choice to locate.''
</P>
<P>
   When NAFTA took effect, many communities hoped it would somehow
bring prosperity. A study sponsored by business groups in El Paso,
for example, predicted the city would become a banking and commerce
center for Mexico like Hong Kong is for China.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the big deals still seem to be made in Houston or
Dallas, just as in Mexico they are made in Mexico City or other
financial centers. Meanwhile, with tariffs removed, workers watch
their jobs freely cross to cities like Ciudad Juarez, where wages
are far lower.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that as more of NAFTA's provisions go into
force _ as Mexican truckers, for example, gain the right to cross
the Rio Grande and drive all the way to Michigan _ the border will
suffer even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border becomes irrelevant,'' said Bernard L. Weinstein, a
professor of applied economics at the University of North Texas.
``And unless it figures out some way to replace the jobs that came
from the indigenous activities that used to be associated with
being a border town, then things get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   With the border mired in poverty, many people are angry,
suspecting that once again the border matters to the rest of the
country, if at all, as a remote buffer zone. The region has long
resented that its cities have been made militarized zones in the
war against illegal immigrants and drugs, with their boundaries
marked by razor wire and their neighborhoods patrolled by
immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border never seems to thrive, and it's designed that
way,'' said Raymond C. Caballero, an El Paso lawyer. ``The border
is being used by the state of Texas, and has been for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   That anger came across in a recent editorial in the El Paso
Times, the daily newspaper here, that called for an end to price
supports for tobacco farmers. ``Tobacco farmers should start facing
free-market principles,'' the editorial said. ``After all, these
are the same free-market principles that have ruthlessly gutted the
city's garment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The border region has a long and fabled history, perhaps most
famously in El Paso, with its striking desert landscape below the
Franklin Mountains and its four centuries of shared culture,
commerce and conflict with Juarez, across the Rio Grande. The
sister cities are often described as the most dramatic meeting
anywhere of First World and Third.
</P>
<P>
   The drama has nourished a vibrant sense of self and place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something very unique about the border,'' said Dr.
Abraham Verghese, the author of ``My Own Country'' and a professor
of medicine at the Texas Tech Health Sciences Center. ``There are
so many different mythologies that come together here _ the Spanish
conquistadors, the Aztec Indians, the Billy the Kid Wild West.''

</P>
<P>
   The ease with which people can cross the border offers constant
reminders that two very different worlds are side by side, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the border has never fully marched to the beat of the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Southern frontier is not simply American on one side and
Mexican on the other,'' Tom Miller observed in his book, ``On the
Border.'' ``It is a third country with its own identity.''
</P>
<P>
   And in El Paso, the busiest border crossing in the world, there
is a clear feeling that the U.S. side may no longer be getting the
better part of any bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1994, the foreign-owned factories just inside Mexico,
known as maquiladoras, have added 220,000 jobs, a 60 percent
increase. In these plants, workers assemble foreign-made goods that
are shipped back to their country of origin with duty assessed only
on the value added to the product. Juarez, a city of 1.3 million,
boasts a lower unemployment rate than El Paso, and at least 20,000
El Pasoans commute to jobs in Juarez.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez's largest employers are corporations including General
Motors, Ford Motor Co. and United Technologies. El Paso's largest
are two public school districts and Fort Bliss.
</P>
<P>
   All along the U.S. side of the border, communities are trying to
broaden their employment base. Several cities are establishing
funds for retraining workers, aiming for jobs paying at least $10
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, even as the legislature in Austin was approving a
billion-dollar statewide tax cut, voters in McAllen, where per
capita income is only $11,478, less than half the national average,
raised their sales tax half a cent to start a ``human development
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Other initiatives have a plaintive air. In the Rio Grande
Valley, corporate leaders began ``Project Come Home,'' a campaign
to encourage young people to return after college _ and to convince
potential employers that a skilled work force will be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, parents have been telling their kids that in order
to obtain a good job, they must leave the Valley,'' Keith Patridge,
executive vice president of the McAllen Economic Development
Corporation, said. ``Well, this is changing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But the challenges to lure employers are daunting. While El
Paso's schools are well-respected, they have a high proportion of
students with poor English skills. Drop-out rates are high, and
many adults lack high school diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   A study released recently by the National Institute for Literacy
found that the border had some of the highest illiteracy rates in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who can show they lost jobs because an employer left for
Mexico are eligible for Transitional Adjustment Assistance (TAA),
which provides up to $7,500 for retraining. More than 10,000 signed
up in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea that such a sum might quickly make high-tech
experts of workers who have spent their lives stitching blue jeans
is dismissed by many people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What TAA promised was that it was going to be a bridge to
connect people to a whole new world of work,'' said Cindy Arnold,
development coordinator for La Mujer Obrera (The Working Woman), a
nonprofit group in El Paso that helps displaced workers, most of
whom are female and Hispanic. ``But it's like a bridge into a
ravine. It doesn't exist. It's a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   NAFTA has undeniably brought economic activity to the border,
most obviously the huge warehouses, distribution centers and truck
depots that have risen outside of Laredo and east of El Paso. But
it has also brought pollution, traffic, jammed bridges and a sense
that its benefits were overstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``NAFTA has done absolutely nothing for Douglas, Ariz.,'' said
Ray Borane, the mayor of that border city. ``The only thing we've
seen is truck traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   El Paso Mayor Carlos M. Ramirez still insists his city is poised
to enter a ``golden age.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But so far,'' Ramirez said, ``the border is bearing the burden
of free trade and not the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think NAFTA has been good for the country, but if the entire
country is getting the benefits, it should be paying the costs,''
he added, saying that the region needs federal money for its
clogged bridges and roads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are bright spots, most with cautions. The area is creating
jobs at a faster pace than are most other parts of Texas, though
the demand for work far outstrips the supply.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, per-capita income grew by 32.6 percent from 1990 to
1996, slightly faster than the 27.4 percent growth nationally. But,
at $12,199, it is still less than half the national figure of
$24,436.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those left behind are determined to catch up. Irma
Montoya, 47, lost her job at an El Paso plant that made
thermometers when it closed two and a half years ago. Since then,
she has studied bookkeeping, but she has no regular income, and her
husband, who worked for 20 years at a boot manufacturer that also
closed, is making a much smaller salary as a janitor.
</P>
<P>
   The family's one piece of good economic news is bittersweet for
Ms. Montoya: Her 24-year-old son, Oscar, got a job at Acer
Computer, which opened a computer assembly plant here five years
ago. The job required at least a high school diploma, some math
skills, and knowledge of English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am happy for him, but this is what I'm telling you when I
say we are left behind,'' said Ms. Montoya, who speaks little
English. ``I'm afraid I could never get a job like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There are optimists along the border, many of whom say that as
the skill level of students and workers here picks up, the region
will become a dynamic link between two nations that are
increasingly trading with each other. Michael J. Blum, a former
city planner for McAllen who is now a business consultant, calls
the area ``the neck of the hourglass.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Arnold, of La Mujer Obrera, which has organized pickets and
camp-outs in which displaced workers demand jobs and retraining,
says the women she deals with yearn to play a role in the new
economy. ``These workers are not uneducable by any means,'' she
said. ``There is a tremendous hunger. They are very motivated to
learn and to work.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, of course, jobs just over the border, and from places
like El Paso and Brownsville, more people are commuting to work in
Mexico, especially in the maquiladoras.
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for workers say there is no way an American can
earn a decent living in such plants, which, according to a Labor
Department study last year, pay an average hourly wage of $1.36,
compared with $7.71 for factory jobs in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with this issue of retraining here, in this
city, in this country,'' Ms. Arnold said. ``There is no way you can
sustain yourself on Juarez wages and live in the United States.''

<P>
   LONDON _ The recent drop in oil prices, which began in October
and accelerated recently, has prompted several oil-producing
countries to take some of the medicine that high oil prices once
imposed on oil-guzzling countries like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, Saudi Arabia, the world's largest and richest
oil producer, has quietly borrowed some $2 billion from its banks
to help pay for public spending programs as it prepares to reduce
its budget by at least 10 percent and raise fees on government
services _ all to offset the most serious fall in oil revenues in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago the oil minister of Kuwait, another huge oil
producer, warned of ``a looming economic catastrophe,'' akin to the
economic and political collapse of Indonesia, for his country and
some other oil producers. The minister, Sheik Saud Nasser al-Sabah,
said that unless world oil producers made drastic cuts in oil
production, the free fall in oil prices. could bring down some
governments. Prices have plunged recently by more than 48 percent
to an average of less than $12 a barrel, from $23 last year,
</P>
<P>
   A hint of things to come may have already begun in tiny Yemen,
one of the world's smallest oil producers. Beginning on Saturday,
several cities exploded in riots as thousands of people protested a
new round of cuts in subsidies for bread and fuel imposed by the
International Monetary Fund and the government as it struggles to
make up lost income from oil exports.
</P>
<P>
   The fall in oil prices prompted the 11 members of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries plus Mexico to reduce
production this year by 1 million barrels a day to help lift
prices. But the cutbacks halted the slide in prices only briefly,
and when some countries started pumping more petroleum than they
had agreed to and consumption starting declining again, prices
plunged anew. Now prices are lower than they were three months ago
when OPEC called its last emergency meeting. Another session begins
in Vienna on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the meeting will including several large
oil-producing countries that are not members of the cartel.
including Russia, Norway, Mexico and Oman.
</P>
<P>
   For the OPEC members the dimension of the crisis can be summed
up in one simple statistic: Their annual oil revenues have fallen
so far this year by almost a third, or nearly $50 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The recent turmoil in Asia has diminished demand for oil in what
used to be the fastest growing energy-consuming market in the
world. ``The need is for a large cut in oil production,'' said
Peter Gignoux, managing director of energy futures at Smith Barney
in London.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed a widespread view among experts that OPEC members as
well as those like Norway, Russia and Mexico, must decide to remove
far more oil from the market. perhaps as much as 2.5 million
barrels a day. That would amount to a 3.4 percent cut in total
world oil production, or twice the level of cuts OPEC and Mexico
announced in March.
</P>
<P>
   With most analysts skeptical that OPEC will agree on a such a
huge cut, oil prices are likely to fall with unpredictable
consequences of social unrest, rising unemployment and economic
instability in countries including Algeria, Russia, Nigeria,
Bahrain and Indonesia, which is already suffering an economic
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   For oil-consuming nations like the United States and Europe, the
news is just the reverse. As it stands today, these consumers are
enjoying strong economic growth and the cheapest oil in a quarter
century. Pierre Terzian, editor of the Paris-based Petrostrategies,
noted in an interview Monday that when compared with the dollar's
strength in 1973 _ the year OPEC began its ascent as a cartel _
today's oil prices are lower.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment virtually all producers to which oil represents
the lion's share of revenues are experiencing serious pain. The
full impact of the falling prices is just emerging.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has had to stop pumping some 350,000 barrels of its daily
output of 5.9 million barrels because the cost to extract and
transport the oil exceeded market prices. In mid-May Russia also
failed to sell Rosneft, the last large state-owned oil company,
which it wants to privatize as means to raise money to reduce its
budget deficit. Russia's initial price tag of $ 2.1 billion drew no
bidders because of falling oil prices. The company is now on the
market for about $1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has watched its income from oil exports, which are its
key source of hard currency, decline by a third. If prices continue
to fall, they will seriously discourage foreign oil companies from
investing further in Russian oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not by chance the Russians are going to attend this OPEC
meeting as observers,'' says Roger Diwan, director for global oil
markets for the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consultant.
``They are hurting as much as everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kuwait, even before the most recent price collapse began, the
government had anticipated a deficit in this year's budget of $5.73
billion, assuming an average oil price $12 a barrel. With oil
prices now likely to go lower, the deficit in the $16 billion
budget may be far higher.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia's situation is more pressing. Unlike Kuwait, it
largely spent its vast reserves during the Persian Gulf war, which
cost the country some $75 billion, and it has not been able to
replenish them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tremendous awakening to a new situation,'' said a
senior Saudi official who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We
will have indirect taxation,'' he added, referring to tariffs and
fees for services and transactions. ``government spending will be
squeezed. This time around we don't have financial reserves to fall
back on.''
</P>
<P>
   The government of Venezuela, the leading source of oil for the
United States, so far this year has trimmed spending by $4 billion.
The Finance Ministry has announced that economic growth will fall
drastically from a very healthy 5.1 percent last year to an anemic
0.8 percent this year. The national currency, the bolivar, is
expected to lose value against the dollar resulting in higher
unemployment and rising higher prices for imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria, with oil representing 95 percent of its exports, stands
to loose at least 13 percent of its revenues this year. The loss is
certain to worsen a political and economic crisis that has already
fueled a six-year-long undeclared war that has taken 60,000 lives
between government forces and Islamic militants recruited among the
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The extent to which the country can withstand the present
crisis depends very much on how long oil prices remain depressed,''
said Ali A. Efssaoui, an Algerian senior research fellow at the
Oxford Institute for Energy Studies.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that a quick fix will arrest the crisis.

IRAQ CRITICIZES U.N. REPORT ABOUT ITS WEAPONS PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq has criticized a U.N. report that said it
is still hiding details about its program to develop weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the Security Council made public on Monday, the
deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, complained that the report
misrepresented Iraq's willingness to make a full disclosure, which
would permit lifting the embargo on oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   The letter offered the latest counterpoint to a running dispute
that began with the imposition of sanctions after Iraqi troops
occupied Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Since it lost the Persian Gulf war in 1991, Baghdad has insisted
that it has disclosed the extent of its biological and chemical
weapons and ballistic missiles and the means to make them, but U.N.
inspectors have ferreted out evidence to the contrary. The ensuing
game of hide-and-seek has brought the United States and its allies
nearly to the point of military confrontation with Iraq twice in
the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz, in a letter dated Saturday, accused the chief arms
inspector, Richard Butler, who sent the report to the president of
the council last week, of ``concentrating on controversial points
in a manner that fails to give a balanced and objective picture of
what occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, the executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission,
which is charged with ridding Iraq of its weapons of mass
destruction, visited Baghdad from June 11 to 15 to work out a
disarmament schedule that could open the way for the removal of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   He initially expressed optimism about his progress. But his
report to the Security Council last Thursday said, ``Iraq stated
that it has already presented all the evidence available to it, and
that no additional information or documentation would be provided
to the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular Butler said Iraq refused to respond to further
questions about its production of deadly VX nerve gas. He also said
Aziz declined to provide more information about biological weapons
and missile fuel. Withholding such evidence would make it
impossible to verify that Iraq had eliminated its weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Aziz appeared to have been timed to provide
Iraq's position before Wednesday, when Butler is to brief the
council.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz wrote that Baghdad had given the Special Commission ``the
relevant clarifications, explanations and documents pertaining to
VX nerve gas'' and had demonstrated that ``Iraq did not have any
other documents on the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz also argued that ``since the accounting for missile
engines, missile launchers and the warheads was completed, the
question of missile propellants loses importance and becomes a
secondary issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it is in Iraq's interest to provide documents, Aziz
said, ``the Special Commission should not insist and request
something that does not exist.'' In the past, inspectors repeatedly
found documents with details of biological and chemical weapons
production that Iraqi officials had insisted did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Under Security Council Resolution 687, whose terms Iraq accepted
in 1991, the U.N. inspectors must verify that Iraq is free of
weapons of mass destruction before the oil embargo can be lifted.
The next major review by the Security Council is scheduled for
October.
</P>
<P>
   If destruction of the weapons is confirmed, active inspections
are to be replaced by long-term monitoring by a surveillance system
of video cameras and other electronic devices to prevent Iraq from
rebuilding its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad has regularly insisted that it has been unfailingly
forthcoming, while repeatedly testing the council's resolve about
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In the last confrontation, in January and February, three of the
council's five permanent members, China, France and Russia, opposed
military strikes proposed by the United States and Britain to force
Iraq to open up fully to U.N. inspectors. This has reportedly
fueled hope in Baghdad _ and concern in Washington and London _
that support for the tough line represented by sanctions is
eroding.

WAS LASORDA BEHIND CLAIRE, RUSSELL FIRINGS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(SLANG) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before a recent game against the Cincinnati Reds,
Bill Russell sat gloomily in his clubhouse office at Dodger Stadium
venting his frustrations about Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's just killing me and Fred (Claire) with the Fox
people,'' said Russell. ``Fred knows it. I know it. And there's
nothing we can do about it. It's just tough to work under these
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's just vicious when he wants something. He did the same
sort of thing when he was a coach under Walter Alston, and wanted
Alston's job. Tommy's been second-guessing me ever since I took
over for him. Why? I don't know. All I know is that we haven't
spoken for months. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Tom Lasorda denied Russell's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Russell is like a son to me and Fred Claire has been a
friend of mine for more than 30 years,'' Lasorda told Los Angeles
sports talk show host Joe McDonnell. ``I would never politic for
either guy's job. I would never do something like that. I didn't
want anyone to get fired. But it happened, and we have to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tom Lasorda indeed had been putting the knock on Russell, he
only would have joined a lengthening list of Russell detractors
that included many Dodger fans, many media types and, ultimately,
too many members of Rupert Murdoch's impatient new management team
who questioned Russell's leadership abilities and tactical skills.
</P>
<P>
   And, if Lasorda were laying deadly minefields of criticism about
Fred Claire around town, it would have been treated with a
cautionary wink by the new Fox brass that understood that Lasorda's
motives just might be tainted by the well-known fact that he was
fanatically determined to assume Claire's job and run the team
himself.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the aftermath of the Great Dodger Sunday Night Massacre
in which both Bill Russell and Fred Claire were savagely cashiered,
there are those observers inclined to believe that Tom Lasorda
played a prominent role in it.
</P>
<P>
   And they are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Lasorda for sure hasn't been reciting epic poetry about
Russell and Claire that would inspire comparisons to T.S. Eliot, or
Ezra Pound. And it's also known he's schmoozed for long hours with
Michael Milken, a top adviser to Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm sure that the two Fox executives, Peter Chernin and
Chase Carey, who manipulate the puppet strings attached to the
so-called Dodger president, Bob Graziano, would have coolly ignored
Lasorda's alleged remonstrances and not made such a stunning
decision had the team not fallen haplessly on its cleats.
</P>
<P>
   The cruel bottom line is that Bill Russell and Fred Claire are
among the dearly departed because of where the Dodgers now find
themselves in the N.L. West Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday evening's debate with the Anaheim Angels, the
Dodgers were 36-38 and 12{ games behind the San Diego Padres, not
exactly where the Los Angeles team expected to be at this juncture
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the giddy optimism of March and April, the Dodgers
were actually the consensus favorite to win their division for
reasons I never quite understood.
</P>
<P>
   You knew the team simply wasn't that good when it arrived here
for its opener without a legitimate center fielder and with a bunch
of guys on its roster (Matt Luke, Trenidad Hubbard, Thomas Howard,
ad nauseam) that nobody else desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough players,'' Bill Russell stated to me
privately.
</P>
<P>
   And what compounded the Dodgers' miseries is that they didn't
have any pitchers, either, as all except Ramon Martinez and Darren
Dreifort turned out to be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo was such a bust that the Dodgers traded him to the
New York Mets, which might turn out to be a deft move in light of
Nomo's failings.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Fred Claire, responsible for putting this Dodger team
together, must be held at least partly accountable for its
pratfall, although Claire was kept under a severe monetary
restraint in recent years by the notoriously thrifty former Dodger
owner, Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   While a division rival like the Padres was going out and
spending money to get players like Kevin Brown, Ken Caminiti and
Greg Vaughn, Claire has had to operate under the handicap of being
forced to go after second-tier guys like Todd Zeile, Jose Vizcaino,
Eric Young, etc.
</P>
<P>
   And, in what was particularly humiliating to him, Claire wasn't
even consulted last month in perhaps the biggest transaction in
Dodger history.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it turns out Claire was vehemently opposed to that
staggering miscalculation pulled off by the neophyte Fox management
team when it put its baseball ignorance on public display for all
to ridicule by trading away the team's only marquee performer, Mike
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   It has been one of the hoariest maxims of professional athletics
since the Boston Red Sox got rid of Babe Ruth almost 80 years ago
that a team should never divest itself of a superstar who's in his
prime, but Messrs. Chernin and Carey were going to show the
baseball establishment how the big boys do it in the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. They sure showed everybody!
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were struggling before they dispatched Piazza and
Zeile to the Florida Marlins for Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson,
Bobby Bonilla and Jim Eisnreich, none of whom has exactly stirred
Dodger fans to storm the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Dodgers are struggling even more without at least
the presence of the slugging Piazza to boost home attendance during
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Fox worsened a bad situation with a trade it probably already is
embarrassed about---Piazza has been treated like a conquering hero
in New York---and now has detached Russell and Claire for I guess
therapeutic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if Russell's successor, Glen Hoffman, can do much to
reverse the fortunes of a team that simply doesn't possess enough
talented players to exceed the .500 caliber baseball it's played
throughout this erratic Dodger season.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if Fox wanted to do something dramatic, it should have
stuck Tom Lasorda back into the dugout, where his charismatic
presence would have at least enlivened a moribund team and where he
has longed to be ever since he retired as manager in the middle of
the 1996 summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda also longed for Fred Claire's job, and it's the irony of
all ironies that he landed it on the day Claire's successor, Al
Campanis, a close friend of Lasorda, died.
</P>
<P>
   Claire took over for Campanis in April of 1987 after Peter
O'Malley fired Campanis for his racially insensitive remarks on
ABC's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire's greatest legacy will be the Dodgers' storybook 1988
season in which they shocked the New York Mets to win the National
League pennant and then did the same to the Oakland A's to win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It was Claire who brought in a fellow who would goad that team
to its destiny, Kirk Gibson, and Claire would win Executive of the
Year honors for his work.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers never again would reach such heights during
Claire's long incumbency, and it seemed in recent years Claire
never was able to get over that disastrous trade he made earlier
this decade with the Montreal Expos when he parted with a young
righthander named Pedro Martinez for Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not all Fred Claire's fault, or Bill Russell's, that
the Dodgers have deteriorated into mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plight became inevitable a few years back when Peter
O'Malley, unable or unwilling to battle teams like the Atlanta
Braves in pursuit of high-priced free agents, forced Claire to
conduct his business with one arm tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   The neophyte Fox team tried to undo the mess that O'Malley's
tight-fisted policies created, but only exacerbated the chaos with
the ouster of Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tom Lasorda is back in power, trying to bring light into a
Dodger scene that has fallen into darkness.

COURT RULING PROTECTS SCHOOLS IN SEX HARASSMENT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in the first of three decisions
this term to define liability for sexual harassment, ruled Monday
that school districts do not have to pay damages to students
harassed by teachers if officials didn't know about the misconduct
or tried to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision will make it much harder for victims of school
harassment to win monetary awards. It also signaled that a majority
of the justices would like to start changing the punitive climate
that pervades sexual-harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority,
acknowledged that while ``harassment unfortunately is an all-too
common aspect of educational experience,'' a Texas middle-school
student was not entitled to collect punitive damages from the Lago
Vista public school district that employed a high-school teacher
who sexually harassed her for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damages may not be recovered ... unless an official of the
school district who at mimimum has authority to institute
corrective measures has actual notice of, and is deliberately
indifferent to, the teacher's misconduct,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who said she based her opinion on interpretation of
Title IX, the federal statute that prohibits sex discrimination in
education, upheld an appeals court ruling and was joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony
Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a toughly worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
court ruling ``thwarts the purposes of Title IX'' _ which is to
``minimize the danger that vulnerable students will be exposed to
such odious behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as school boards can insulate themselves from
knowledge about this sort of conduct, they can claim immunity from
damages liability,'' wrote Stevens, who was joined in his dissent
by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision was closely analyzed by civil rights and
business groups that are awaiting two other Supreme Court rulings
in the next week considered crucial in setting the extent of an
employer's liability when a supervisor sexually harasses a worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ... ruling is promising,'' said Robin Conrad, a senior
vice president at the National Chamber Litigation Center, an arm of
the US Chamber of Commerce and an advocate for limiting liability
on employers for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to hold employers liable for wrongdoing
they didn't notice and corrective actions they didn't know to
take,'' Conrad said. ``The court is showing a certain pragmatism
here that makes us hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the one of the pending cases, the court has been asked to
find the city of Boca Raton financially liable for the sexual
harassment of lifeguard Beth Ann Faragher by her supervisor, a city
employee. Faragher sued the city in 1992 for failing to police
obscene talk and obnoxious touching by her boss at the beach. A
federal appeals court sided with the city, saying it should not be
held responsible for misconduct that was not reported to city hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, the court must decide if an employer,
Burlington Industries, must be liable when a supervisor engages in
sexual misconduct but the employee, Kimberly Ellerth, rebuffed the
advances and suffered no adverse job consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of so-called quid pro quo harm was central to US
District Judge Susan Webber Wright's dismissal of Paula Jones's
sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Jones's
lawyers say they are waiting for the Supreme Court to rule in the
Burlington case before filing papers in their appeal of Wright's
April 1 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it is risky to predict how the court will
come down in the two employment cases, based on Monday's decision
in the student-harassment case. O'Conner made it clear in her
opinion that the liability standards under Title VII, the law
barring sex discrimination in the workplace, are stricter than
those in Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't make Monday's decision insignificant, according
to Victoria Alzapiedi, executive director of the Title IX Advocacy
Project in Boston. She said the ruling will have a chilling effect
on the reporting and follow-up of sexual harassment incidents in
middle schools and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students have to let school administrators, as opposed to
teachers or counselors, know about harassment, they will fear the
implications for themselves and the stigma among their peers,''
said Alzapiedi, whose nonprofit group works with adolescents on
Title IX issues. ``The backlash _ subtle or blatant _ will be a
major disincentive to report a hostile sexual environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's case, a middle school student met social studies
teacher Frank Waldrop in 1991 when she was placed in a program for
the gifted at Lago Vista High School near Austin. Waldrop's
sexually suggestive remarks to her grew into a sexual relationship
in 1992. In 1993, the pair was caught by a police officer, who
arrested Waldrop. The school district fired Waldrop, who later
pleaded guilty to statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   At no time did the student complain to school officials, though
the high school principal was told by other parents about Waldrop's
lewd comments in class. In 1993, the student and her mother filed a
sexual-harassment suit against the school district and Waldrop,
seeking punitive damages from both. Two lower federal courts
rejected the claims against the school district. The federal court
sent the suit against Waldrop to a state court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court properly refused to hold school districts
liable for the concealed criminal conduct of abusive employes,''
said Wallace Jefferson, the San Antonio lawyer who represented the
school district. ``Most school districts would be financially
devastated by jury verdicts holding them liable for sexual
harassment, which they could not have prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of School Boards, which filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the school district, praised
Monday's decision and said it would make schools more, not less
vigilant in exposing sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces the importance of preventive action, and in no
way lets any school administrator off the hook,'' said Anne Bryant,
executive director of the school boards association, a private
group.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, called it ``a very disappointing decision'' and said
Congress will have to legislate remedies for students that the
court would not prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially painful to see students having less access
than adult employees have under Title VII, when harassment in
schools can be just as severe with even greater lifelong
consequences,'' Greenberger said.
</P>

 &HT;    Braves shortstop Weiss takes leave to be with E. coli-infected
son

<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brody Weiss is two months shy of his fourth birthday,
with blond hair and a sharp angle on life that makes you wonder how
something that small lives that large.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's our high-maintenance kid, bouncing off the wall, he's got
so much energy,'' said his father, Walt Weiss, a reserved and
reflective man. ''Everybody who knows him always jokes about it.
The first thing people who haven't seen us for a while is, 'How's
Brody?' Everybody loves him because he's so active.''
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss is leaning against a wall down the hall from the
Intensive Care Unit at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center,
which is all wrong. The past week has been all wrong, not just for
Walt and wife Terri Weiss, but for a small but heavy handful of
families in the metro Atlanta. Their kids have been diagnosed with
E. coli 0157:H7, a deadly strain of bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Brody Weiss' kidneys have already shut down and all anyone can
do is watch over the coming weeks for what else the bacteria might
do before it recedes. Walt has just gotten off the phone, where
he'd been trying in vain to reach his boss, Bobby Cox, who is with
the rest of the Atlanta Braves in New York City, which must be a
million miles away from this place. Maybe Walt will be at shortstop
Wednesday night at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no antibiotics that can treat this,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, you develop toxins in your blood and obviously once
it's your blood, it passes through your whole body... and your
kidneys ultimately shut down. When (wife Terri) brought him in
Saturday evening, he had 50 percent kidney failure. Now he's at 100
percent (failure). He just came out of surgery to get a catheter
put into his stomach for his bowels and _ just now as we speak _
he's getting hooked up to a dialysis machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically now, they're trying to get his kidneys working on
their own and then sit back. I mean, you hope that . . . the thing
you want to stay away from is neurological damage. When it's in you
blood, it's everywhere. It has the potential to affect other
organs.''
</P>
<P>
   So insidious is this strain of E. coli that somehow, the Weisses
feel blessed that Brody is in serious condition. Two other children
at Scottish Rite are listed as critical. The families share the
common nightmare _ a healthy child struck down in a mysterious
instant. The wait is 24 hours at a time, the stashed pillows and
blankets in the corners now all their transmuted homes. A World Cup
soccer match on a corner TV plays for no one.
</P>
<P>
   The blinking red light on the phone at the Sheraton Centre in
Montreal late Saturday night hinted at nothing like this. Weiss had
just gone 3-for-4 against the Expos and, though he'd helped bring
Brody in to the hospital three times last week, a dose of
antibiotics hinted he'd turn the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a good thing my wife has been persistent through this
whole thing,'' Weiss said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She took him back to ER a fourth time. We were aware that he
had E. coli. It came back in his stool sample. But there are
different strains of E. coli and once she brought him back in
Saturday evening, that's the first time he was diagnosed as having
the deadly strain. He was probably admitted about game time in
Montreal (7 p.m.) that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss left the Braves the next morning and hasn't even had time
to clear the family's message machine at their Marietta, Ga. home.
The source of the infection and whether it could be linked with
other cases is something he's put aside for now, the better to turn
his full energies to maintaining all of the Weisses. Besides Terri,
there is a son Blake, 11, and an infant, Bo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll be 11 months,'' Weiss said, checking the date on his
watch, ''in two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Which, on this day, on this hall, in this place is only an
eternity.

VIAGRA'S OTHER SIDE EFFECT: UPSETS IN MANY A MARRIAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(EDS: This replaces story with the same slug but different
description listed on noon sked.) (lh) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the surface, the couple from Queens seemed like
perfect candidates for Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   They have been married for 30 years, and he began having trouble
achieving an erection a few years ago. While unhappy about it, the
husband, 59, had learned to see some good in it. ``My eye doesn't
wander anymore,'' he said, ``because I can't do anything about it''
</P>
<P>
   And though the woman, 53, said she ``could not imagine staying
in a relationship without sex,'' she, too, had reconciled herself
to having other kinds of intimacy and other forms of sex.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra, the popular new drug for impotence, would appear to be
their ticket back to a more conventional sex life. But like many
couples contemplating Viagra, the two are starkly divided about
whether to try it: While he is looking for a medical panacea for a
physical problem that often comes with age, she has long wondered
whether the problem might be better addressed on a therapist's
couch than in a doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Viagra was being promoted by everyone from
urologists to drug company analysts as destined to help solve
millions of Americans' sexual problems. The drug flew off pharmacy
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   But therapists and experts on sexuality are finding that Viagra
and other impotence aids may actually throw into chaos
relationships that have fallen into their own routine, sexual
dysfunction and all.
</P>
<P>
   The most common problem, they say, is that men hope to treat
their impotence as a simple mechanical issue, while women tend to
want to address the emotions related to impotence. In other cases,
a man and woman are forced to confront their divergent views about
what it means to have sex and how often they want to have it _
issues that impotence had rendered moot.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that many couples are finding that a solution to
what they thought was a medical problem may uncover myriad other
issues in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a very high-tech society, and people are used to
having things done very quickly,'' said Eileen Palace, director of
the Center for Sexual Health at Tulane University Hospital in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw in the 1960s how the pill could control biology. Later,
we saw how to control infertility. People want a simple, easy, fast
solution. And many physicians assume that just because there is a
physical problem means there is no psychological cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Urologists interviewed for this article said they had been
writing Viagra prescriptions by the dozens, many for patients who
had never before said they were impotent. Some had not even
confided in their partners. Instead, they simply avoided sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy sees himself having trouble, and he, out of
embarrassment and lack of communicativity, he says, `I am going to
sleep in the other room,''' said Dr. Walter Bortz, a geriatrics
specialist at the Palo Alto Medical Foundation, in California.
``The wife thinks he has a girlfriend. And it becomes a gulf that
enters a well-cemented relationship, because egos get in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   When the possibility of sex resurfaces, a couple is often at a
loss. They never talked much about their problems before, and now
they have no idea how to approach the change. In the meantime, all
the issues that contributed to the impotence or resulted from it
have been long swept under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone hears about Viagra, they are expecting to get
better on their sexual problems,'' said E. Douglas Whitehead,
director of the Association for Male Sexual Dysfunction in New
York. ``But there are many issues that affect desire: life
stresses, the stock market, other issues. But most of the time,
people don't talk about those problems. ... They think Viagra will
address them.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The woman from Queens who, like her husband, agreed to be
interviewed if they were not identified, said she was frustrated
and had given up trying to persuade her husband to address the
emotional aspects of their sexual problems in therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``His doctor suggested he go into therapy because he couldn't
find any medical reason for his borderline erections,'' she said.
``I thought therapy was a great opportunity, but he didn't want to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Therapy is where many couples dealing with impotence belong,
even if they use Viagra, many doctors say. The couple may never
have discussed the inevitable resentment and pain that resulted
from their damaged sex lives, feelings that will not disappear with
medication. Once Viagra allows a couple to have sex again, their
relationship can change.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra, which must be taken an hour before
intercourse, and other drugs for impotence leave little room for
spontaneous romantic encounters. What is more, a couple used to not
having sex may be out of practice in the language and gestures of
sexual intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   Palace recalled a man with diabetes, which often contributes to
impotence, who would inject drugs that help impotent men achieve
erections.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in in tears, because his wife's romantic gesture was
to lay the syringe on the pillow,'' she said. ``You have to be able
to talk about the role of the treatment in the relationship. And
I've learned to trust penises, because they are good indicators of
what is going on in a relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven and Katherine, who spoke on the condition that their last
name not be used, had married shortly after testicular cancer left
him impotent in 1990. They then found their relationship in trouble
when Steven began using penile injections.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we would go to the urologist,'' Katherine said, ``they
would come up with this or that and address really only my husband
and his physical problems.'' This or that turned out to be
injections that produced erections but terrible sex. The injections
themselves were disturbing enough, she said, but the underlying
problem was her unacknowledged feelings about having married a man
who was impotent. Ultimately, she said, she worked through the
problem in sex therapy at Tulane. ``Part of what therapy did was
help me face the grief that I had never faced being married to a
man who was impotent.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven agreed that he had not thought through the emotional
issues related to their sexual problems. ``I thought my primary
problem was plumbing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that amazed me when we finally opened the lines of
communication was that my sexual performance was not satisfactory
for her. I thought things were fine. But because she loved me
anyway, she made a conscious decision to forgo a good sexual life
to have a good marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they have decided to forgo Viagra and explore other
avenues of sexual intimacy.
</P>
<P>
   While many therapists and urologists say that most men are loath
to discuss their sexual problems with anyone, especially a
therapist, the men themselves see Viagra as an easy way out.
</P>
<P>
   Pepper Schwartz, a professor of sociology at the University of
Washington in Seattle and author of several books about American
sexual habits, cited two things about Viagra that appeal to men:
``They don't have to talk about impotence, and they have a high
assurance of potential good in using it.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``the issues that have been shrugged off are the
psychological and social aspects of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I do believe that any drug that alters the core way a
couple relates to each other requires discussions of expectations
and pressures.''
</P>
<P>
   Most men, however, seem reluctant to talk even to their
partners, let alone an outsider, about their sexual problems. A
74-year-old man from Long Island who has had erectile dysfunction
since his 20s could never quite talk to his wife of 25 years about
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would tend to kind of brush the problem under the rug,'' he
said. ``It isn't an easy topic to deal with. It goes to the heart
of your masculinity.''
</P>
<P>
   After a divorce, his problem recurred during a 20-year
relationship with a much younger woman. He now admits that a more
active sex life might have saved both relationships.
</P>
<P>
   He is convinced that Viagra is the answer to his lifelong sexual
problem and that no amount of therapy would help.
</P>
<P>
   The woman from Queens went into therapy alone and kept her
emotional journey to herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therapy was helpful to me,'' she said. ``I felt like it made
me understand that this was just one more thing to deal with, not
the end of the world.''

COURT RULING PROTECTS SCHOOLS IN SEX HARASSMENT CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, in the first of three decisions
this term to define liability for sexual harassment, ruled Monday
that school districts do not have to pay damages to students
harassed by teachers if officials didn't know about the misconduct
or tried to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision will make it much harder for victims of school
harassment to win monetary awards. It also signaled that a majority
of the justices would like to start changing the punitive climate
that pervades sexual-harassment law.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing for the majority,
acknowledged that while ``harassment unfortunately is an all-too
common aspect of educational experience,'' a Texas middle-school
student was not entitled to collect punitive damages from the Lago
Vista public school district that employed a high-school teacher
who sexually harassed her for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damages may not be recovered ... unless an official of the
school district who at mimimum has authority to institute
corrective measures has actual notice of, and is deliberately
indifferent to, the teacher's misconduct,'' O'Connor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, who said she based her opinion on interpretation of
Title IX, the federal statute that prohibits sex discrimination in
education, upheld an appeals court ruling and was joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony
Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In a toughly worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the
court ruling ``thwarts the purposes of Title IX'' _ which is to
``minimize the danger that vulnerable students will be exposed to
such odious behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as school boards can insulate themselves from
knowledge about this sort of conduct, they can claim immunity from
damages liability,'' wrote Stevens, who was joined in his dissent
by Justices David Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision was closely analyzed by civil rights and
business groups that are awaiting two other Supreme Court rulings
in the next week considered crucial in setting the extent of an
employer's liability when a supervisor sexually harasses a worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ... ruling is promising,'' said Robin Conrad, a senior
vice president at the National Chamber Litigation Center, an arm of
the US Chamber of Commerce and an advocate for limiting liability
on employers for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense to hold employers liable for wrongdoing
they didn't notice and corrective actions they didn't know to
take,'' Conrad said. ``The court is showing a certain pragmatism
here that makes us hopeful.''
</P>
<P>
   In the one of the pending cases, the court has been asked to
find the city of Boca Raton financially liable for the sexual
harassment of lifeguard Beth Ann Faragher by her supervisor, a city
employee. Faragher sued the city in 1992 for failing to police
obscene talk and obnoxious touching by her boss at the beach. A
federal appeals court sided with the city, saying it should not be
held responsible for misconduct that was not reported to city hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, the court must decide if an employer,
Burlington Industries, must be liable when a supervisor engages in
sexual misconduct but the employee, Kimberly Ellerth, rebuffed the
advances and suffered no adverse job consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of so-called quid pro quo harm was central to US
District Judge Susan Webber Wright's dismissal of Paula Jones's
sexual harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Jones's
lawyers say they are waiting for the Supreme Court to rule in the
Burlington case before filing papers in their appeal of Wright's
April 1 decision.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts said it is risky to predict how the court will
come down in the two employment cases, based on Monday's decision
in the student-harassment case. O'Conner made it clear in her
opinion that the liability standards under Title VII, the law
barring sex discrimination in the workplace, are stricter than
those in Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't make Monday's decision insignificant, according
to Victoria Alzapiedi, executive director of the Title IX Advocacy
Project in Boston. She said the ruling will have a chilling effect
on the reporting and follow-up of sexual harassment incidents in
middle schools and high schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``If students have to let school administrators, as opposed to
teachers or counselors, know about harassment, they will fear the
implications for themselves and the stigma among their peers,''
said Alzapiedi, whose nonprofit group works with adolescents on
Title IX issues. ``The backlash _ subtle or blatant _ will be a
major disincentive to report a hostile sexual environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's case, a middle school student met social studies
teacher Frank Waldrop in 1991 when she was placed in a program for
the gifted at Lago Vista High School near Austin. Waldrop's
sexually suggestive remarks to her grew into a sexual relationship
in 1992. In 1993, the pair was caught by a police officer, who
arrested Waldrop. The school district fired Waldrop, who later
pleaded guilty to statutory rape.
</P>
<P>
   At no time did the student complain to school officials, though
the high school principal was told by other parents about Waldrop's
lewd comments in class. In 1993, the student and her mother filed a
sexual-harassment suit against the school district and Waldrop,
seeking punitive damages from both. Two lower federal courts
rejected the claims against the school district. The federal court
sent the suit against Waldrop to a state court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court properly refused to hold school districts
liable for the concealed criminal conduct of abusive employes,''
said Wallace Jefferson, the San Antonio lawyer who represented the
school district. ``Most school districts would be financially
devastated by jury verdicts holding them liable for sexual
harassment, which they could not have prevented.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of School Boards, which filed a
friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of the school district, praised
Monday's decision and said it would make schools more, not less
vigilant in exposing sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reinforces the importance of preventive action, and in no
way lets any school administrator off the hook,'' said Anne Bryant,
executive director of the school boards association, a private
group.
</P>
<P>
   But Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, called it ``a very disappointing decision'' and said
Congress will have to legislate remedies for students that the
court would not prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's especially painful to see students having less access
than adult employees have under Title VII, when harassment in
schools can be just as severe with even greater lifelong
consequences,'' Greenberger said.

BILL WOULD REGULATE AU PAIRS IN BAY STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An au pair licensing bill originally designed to
prevent a repeat of a Louise Woodward case cleared a major
legislative hurdle Monday, but its sponsor charged that lawmakers
had bowed to pressure from au pair agencies and that the rewritten
version has lost its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature's Committee on Human Services, after seven
months of debate and negotiations, approved the bill, which creates
state regulations and licensing guidelines for au pair agencies. It
also would require au pairs to take certified training in various
child-care skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can only improve child care for Massachusetts families,''
said Susan Gross, director of program development at the EF Au Pair
agency of Cambridge, which placed Woodward in the Eappen family.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward this year was found guilty of manslaughter in the death
of Matthew Eappen, who prosecutors said died after being violently
shook.
</P>
<P>
   But Representative Marie J. Parente, a Milford Democrat who
offered the original bill in the days following Woodward's
conviction in October, scoffed at the rewritten version, saying the
committee has done little to change the way the au pair agencies
are doing business. She removed her name as a sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must be celebrating,'' said Parente, who said the panel
had come under intense lobbying from EF Au Pair. ``The committee is
asking them to do what they already do, for the most part. They've
only added a few things.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill goes to the House Ways and Means Committee before it
can reach the full House for a vote. If approved, it would then go
to the Senate. Because the legislative session is winding down, it
is not clear whether the bill can be enacted before the lawmakers
end their session next month.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Michael P. Cahill, the Beverly Democrat who
chairs the committee, said he would not speculate on whether the
legislation could prevent another case in which a child under an au
pair's care dies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't hazard a guess on that,'' Cahill said. ``But in
looking into this issue, we could see the potential dangers have
been there all along.''
</P>
<P>
   Parente, however, said some of her bill's provisions, such as
clearly defining an au pair's role and requiring au pairs to have
previous professional child care experience, would have made a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Louise had been properly trained, she might never have
faced what it appears she did in the Eappen home,'' Parente said.
``These unresolved stories between the family and Louise would not
have been there if there were clear and defined objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Parente was particularly critical of the committee decision to
delete her proposal that would limit 18- and 19-year-olds to caring
for only two children under 5 years of age. She also wants to
require that the au pair have professional child care experience,
something the committee rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bill says they have to come properly trained,'' Parente
said. ``I don't see that with this bill.''

IN BELARUS, ENVOYS' HOUSES ARE NO LONGER THEIR HOMES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko,
insists that he cannot understand what all the fuss is about. ``A
simple housing problem is being turned into an affair of state,''
he complained Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But for the ambassadors from the United States, Japan and
several European countries, the efforts of the Belarus government
to oust them from their homes in Minsk, the capital, is an affair
of state and a clear violation of diplomatic convention.
</P>
<P>
   The United States recalled Ambassador Daniel Speckhard and made
clear that the Belarus ambassador would not be welcome back in
Washington anytime soon. ``In English, it would be a real bad idea
for him to come to the United States right now,'' said James Rubin,
the State Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus officials have told the diplomats that the authoritarian
president wants to force the ambassadors out of their apartments in
a diplomatic compound in Minsk so he can expand his official
residence, which adjoins the compound. Officially, the government
has said the diplomats must move because of a need for extensive
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to evict the diplomats has not been subtle.
Electricity, water and phone service have been cut off without
warning. Some diplomats returned to their homes last week to find
workmen trying to weld the gates shut. Rubin described the actions
as ``unprecedentedly uncivilized behavior for a member of the
international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy and Japan also withdrew
diplomats from Minsk on Monday to protest what seemed to be a
blatant violation of the Vienna Convention, under which embassies
and residences are supposed to be inviolable.
</P>
<P>
   As she prepared to leave Minsk on Monday, British Ambassador
Jessica Pearse said the exodus was meant to send a message to
Lukashenko, a former director of a collective farm who rules
Belarus virtually as a dictator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of us leaving is to show that he cannot treat us in
the way that he expects to be able to treat anyone in his
country,'' she said on the BBC. ``Ambassadors are expected to be
treated with a certain status, a certain respect and a certain
common courtesy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests, the State Department was careful to point
out that the United States was not breaking diplomatic ties with
Belarus, a former Soviet republic of 10 million people that won
praise several years ago when it chose to give up the nuclear
warheads that the Soviet Union had left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our embassy remains open,'' Rubin said. ``But so long as
they're going to violate one of the first premises of diplomatic
relations _ that is, the inviolability of an ambassador's residence
_ it's very hard to have a serious diplomatic discussion with
them.''

FDA WITHDRAWS SECOND DRUG IN TWO WEEKS, RAISING QUESTIONS ABOUT
SPEEDY APPROVAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in two weeks, the Food and Drug
Administration has taken the rare step of pulling a prescription
drug off pharmacy shelves, a move that is renewing questions about
whether the agency's new emphasis on speeding up drug approvals is
allowing unsafe medicines to reach patients.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, Duract, a painkiller manufactured by Wyeth-Ayerst
Laboratories of St. Davids, Pa., has caused a dozen cases of
serious liver failure since it went on the market last July,
including those of four patients who died and eight who required
liver transplants. All cases involved patients who took the drug
for longer than the recommended 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Both the agency and the company are advising patients who have
been taking Duract for longer than 10 days to stop immediately; all
patients who are using the medication should consult their doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Monday was the third time in nine months
that the food and drug agency removed a new medicine for safety
reasons. On June 8, the high blood pressure medication Posicor was
banned because it turned out to be potentially lethal when used in
combination with a long list of other drugs. Last September, the
popular diet drug Redux was taken off the market, along with its
close cousin, fenfluoramine, when both were implicated in heart
valve problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst record we have ever had _ it's
unprecedented,'' said Thomas Moore, a senior fellow in health
policy at George Washington University Medical Center who studies
drug safety. ``I believe we are paying the wages of the one-sided
debate that we have had in this country that the speed of FDA
approval is the only issue.''
</P>
<P>
   It is extremely unusual for the FDA, which is widely regarded as
the most safety-conscious consumer protection agency in the world,
to have to withdraw a drug once it has been approved. Including the
most recent withdrawals, there have been only six such withdrawals
in the past decade, according to Dr. Murray Lumpkin, deputy
director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the agency has been under intense
pressure from congressional Republicans to speed up its drug
approval process, and it has given its imprimatur to a record
number of new drugs, 92, over the past two years. That fast-track
approval process has been financed in large part by the
pharmaceutical industry, which gave the FDA $327 million in user
fees between 1992 and 1997. The money was used to hire 600 new
employees to review drug applications.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the fast-track system argue that it is necessary
to bring life-saving therapies to patients who desperately need
them. However, Lumpkin estimates that only 20 percent of the new
medicines approved fall into the category of breakthrough drugs.
The rest, including Duract and Posicor, are what is known as
``me-too drugs,'' medicines that treat disorders for which there
are already plenty of approved therapies, leaving critics to wonder
why they are allowed on the market in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agency has been put under too much pressure to approve
more drugs faster, whether they are needed or not,'' said Larry
Sasich, a pharmacist for Public Citizen's Health Research Group, a
Washington advocacy organization. ``This is the price that the
American public is paying for believing that the FDA was keeping
life-saving medicines out of the hands of the American public,
which is simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Lumpkin, however, defended the agency, saying the review of
Duract took nearly three years and was extremely thorough. Although
the agency was aware of the potential for liver problems with
long-term use, he said, it made a calculated decision to approve
the drug for short-term use, no more than 10 days, because the
benefits outweighed the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a rushed decision by any means,'' Lumpkin said,
adding that the agency still believes the drug is safe and
effective when used for fewer than 10 days. ``There is nothing in
our data that makes you think that if you used this product as
labeled it would be unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sasich wondered why the FDA approved Duract in the first
place, given that there are plenty of other drugs on the market to
treat pain. ``This was a drug that no one needed,'' he said. ``It's
the same scenario as we went through with Posicor.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 11 months that Duract was on the market, it was
prescribed to 2.5 million people, according to the manufacturer,
Wyeth-Ayerst, a division of American Home Products Corp. Dr. Philip
deVane, the company's North American medical director, said that 15
percent of the prescriptions were written for longer than 10 days,
despite clear warnings on the label.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, which goes by the generic name bromfenac, belongs to a
class of medications known as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
or NSAIDS. In addition to treating pain, these drugs, some of which
are so safe they can be sold over the counter, are often used for
chronic conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. Experts say
patients typically take NSAIDS for weeks or months at a time, which
may explain why doctors continued to prescribe Duract for long
times.
</P>
<P>
   Duract went on the market last July, and by this February,
deVane said, Wyeth-Ayerst had received three reports of liver
injuries to patients who were taking the drug for longer than 10
days. At the FDA's request, the company then put a black box on
Duract's package to highlight the warning against extended use.
</P>
<P>
   But when the food and drug agency continued to receive reports
of liver trouble, including the four deaths, Lumpkin said,
officials decided that the risk was no longer worth the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are other alternatives that don't have this kind of
serious reaction over long-term use, there is no reason to take the
risk,'' he said. The FDA then asked the manufacturer to withdraw
Duract, and the Wyeth-Ayerst complied, describing the decision as
voluntary.

 &HT;    Expert advice: Wash food, cook meat and be a smart consumer
 &HT;    (EDS: Can also run with ECOLI and STINSON-ECOLI)
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dangers of E. coli can be serious, but consumers can often
combat them by thoroughly washing and cooking food, according to a
leading expert on the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety and
Quality Enhancement at the University of Georgia, is involved in
testing and studying the dangerous strain E. coli O157:H7. He
tested meat in the 1993 widely publicized Jack in the Box case in
the Seattle area, an outbreak that sickened hundreds and killed
four.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle is a member of a panel assembled by the National Academy
of Science to recommend improvements to government food safety
efforts. He spoke Monday at a national meeting in Atlanta of the
Institute of Food Technologists, a gathering of food scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is E. coli and are all strains alike and bad for us?
</P>
<P>
   A: E. coli is a bacteria and some of them are good. They live in
our intestinal tract and do no harm whatsoever. It's the particular
strain O157:H7 that can kill.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long has this deadly strain been evident and what foods
are most likely to carry it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was first recognized as a pathogen in 1982, though it's
probably been around for 30 to 50 years. The No. 1 source of E.
coli O157:H7 illness is ground beef. The second most common way is
by coming in direct contact with animal feces on a farm. Beyond
that, foods such as apple juice, lettuce and sprouts have all been
sources of outbreaks. And this organism has an unusual resistance
to acid, including stomach acid, which we usually count on to kill
harmful bacteria. That's why it can survive in juices.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the symptoms of the illness and who does it threaten
most?
</P>
<P>
   A: Not everyone who comes in contact with it develops an
illness. Those most severely affected are the young and the
elderly. It starts out with watery diarrhea and severe abdominal
cramping. Then you will see bloody stools. From there about 10
percent of children and the elderly will develop hemolytic uremic
syndrome, or HUS. That can lead to kidney failure and, in the most
severe cases, death.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can be done to prevent it, starting with the source?
</P>
<P>
   A: At the processing plants, there are steps, such as steam
pasteurization, to try to clean the surface of the meat and to
avoid cross contamination. But it's next to impossible to remove it
all. You may kill a hundred-fold or a thousand-fold of the
bacteria. But it takes a very low dosage of E. coli O157:H7 to make
you sick. Irradiation of meat, which has now been approved by the
FDA, can help. But there aren't enough facilities for irradiation
and it does effect the flavor of meats with high fat content, like
ground beef.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So what's the option for the consumer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The consumer has to take this very seriously. Do not eat
ground beef that is pink in the middle. Many people still do that.
Cook ground beef until there's no pink and the juices run clear. To
be extra sure, use a meat thermometer and cook to 160 degrees.
Beyond that, wash fresh foods that aren't cooked, like lettuce,
very, very well. Peel off the outside layers. For juices and cider,
pasteurization will take care of it. And wash your hands before
handling food.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you think the food industry is handling this
challenge?
</P>
<P>
   A: Food processers have responded very positively, putting into
place processes that help ensure safety. That's in their best
interest. But the producers are where the problem lies. If there is
no way to convince the producers that they've got to help produce
safe food, then they will continue to hand the problem over to the
processors. Too many farmers think of food as a commodity and not
as something we eat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about government agencies? Are they doing enough in
terms of food safety?
</P>
<P>
   A: Considering the resources available, they are doing a
remarkable job. But things can be done better. Sometimes hands are
tied by statutes and by producers. And some problems emerge, like
new pathogens, that we can't predict.

 &HT;    U of F scientist is named provost at UGA
 &HT;    By Rebecca McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ University of Georgia President Michael Adams on
Monday named Karen Holbrook, a scientist and administrator from the
University of Florida, as the university's new provost and chief
academic officer, saying she was both committed to undergraduate
teaching and experienced with research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any one of the three finalists could have done the job, but
the chemistry between us was the best,'' Adams said as he
introduced Holbrook, the highest ranking woman ever at UGA, to
about 40 employees from across campus. ``I like to like the people
with whom I spend this much time.''
</P>
<P>
   In her new job, Holbrook, 55, will be responsible for all core
academic functions, including public service and outreach,
instruction, student affairs and research. She will be one of three
vice presidents reporting directly to Adams, who began touting this
new administrative structure when he arrived on campus last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being personable, Holbrook is viewed by her fellow
faculty members as collegial, Adams said. Her scientific background
complements his background in the social sciences professionally,
as does her productive work pace.
</P>
<P>
   According to UGA, Holbrook will be paid $210,000 yearly. In
addition, she will receive a car allowance and half membership in
the Athens Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook holds a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in
zoology from the University of Wisconsin and a Ph.D. in biological
structure from the University of Washington School of Medicine. She
joined the faculty there in 1972, eventually becoming the associate
dean for scientific affairs by 1993, when she moved to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At Florida, she was dean of the Graduate School Office of
Research, Technology and Graduate Education and a professor of
anatomy and cell biology and medicine. Her area of interest in
research is dermatology. She has worked on various levels with the
National Institutes of Health for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook said that she had ``heard really positive things''
about UGA and Georgia Gov. Zell Miller's commitment to higher
education. She wants the university to continue as one of the
nation's finest research institutions ``that still cares about its
undergraduate education program.''
</P>
<P>
   She is married to James R. Holbrook, an oceanographer retired
from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and they
have a grown son.

CARLOS CASTANEDA A MYSTERY IN LIFE, DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS ROPP  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Castaneda died April 27.
</P>
<P>
   Or did he?
</P>
<P>
   The ``Los Angeles Times'' reported Friday that the bestselling
author and self-proclaimed ``sorcerer'' died at his home in Los
Angeles of liver cancer, that he was cremated immediately and that
his ashes were spirited away to Mexico, according to the Culver
City, Calif., mortuary that handled his remains.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman in the office of Castaneda's Los Angeles
literary agent, Tracy Kramer, said it is Kramer's opinion and the
opinion of others who worked closely with Castaneda that the author
evanesced _ disappeared like mist from this world in much the same
way Castaneda believed his teacher Don Juan and his group did in
1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to officially die in order for his will to be
executed,'' the spokesman said. ``We expect a statement on Dr.
Castaneda's Cleargreen Web page stating that Carlos Castaneda left
this world in the tradition of the Mexican sorcerers of antiquity
in his lineage.'' The Web address is www.castaneda.org.
</P>
<P>
   Cleargreen is a Los Angeles company set up by Castaneda to
market and handle publicity for his books, seminars and workshops.
</P>
<P>
   If Castaneda didn't vanish into thin air, he may as well have.
It's doubtful there's ever been a cult personage shrouded in more
mystery.
</P>
<P>
   He did not allow himself to be photographed, have his voice
recorded or grant many interviews. No one knows when he was born,
where, or even his real name.
</P>
<P>
   One of his autobiographical accounts reports that Carlos Ce'sar
Arana Castaneda immigrated to the United States in 1951. He
reportedly was born Christmas Day 1925 in Sao Paolo, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the Castaneda mystique is based on the fact that even
his closest friends aren't sure who he is,'' wrote his ex-wife,
Margaret Runyan Castaneda, in a 1997 memoir that Castaneda tried to
keep from being published.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda denied being married.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever he was or in whatever manner he ``moved on,'' there's no
denying Castaneda's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   His 10 bestselling books on the teachings of Yaqui shaman Don
Juan's worlds of non-ordinary reality galvanized a generation in
the late 1960s and early '70s. Many viewed him as America's
godfather of the New Age movement. His books were subsequently
translated into 17 languages, adding millions more to his fan base.
While his popularity has waned in this country, his works are just
now being discovered and revered in places such as Germany and
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's adventures began in 1960, when he met Don Juan Matus
in Nogales, Ariz. He was an anthropology student at UCLA,
collecting information for a doctorate on the use of hallucinogenic
peyote cactus by indigenous peoples. He was told by a mutual friend
that Matus was an expert on peyote.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda thought he was studying the elderly Yaqui Indian, but
Juan Matus was studying him. Castaneda became his apprentice.
Encouraged by Don Juan, Castaneda wrote about his indoctrination
and participation in the world of seers, witches and beings from
``unfathomable'' worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda's thesis, published in 1968 by the University of
California Press, became an international best-seller, ``The
Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued publishing over the next 30 years. ``The Wheel of
Time: The Shamans of Ancient Mexico, Their Thoughts about Life,
Death and the Universe''is scheduled to be released in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Castaneda's Cleargreen Corp. said that his
works will continue to be published and that there are ``things
written down that have not yet come out.''
</P>
<P>
   She regards Castaneda's company as the carrier of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that if people want to reach infinity, the tools
are available,'' the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   I met Carlos Castaneda last summer in a Cuban restaurant near
West Hollywood. The interview came about because of a workshop
sponsored by Castaneda that was coming to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He did not notice me when I first walked in. He was looking down
at his table, elbows propped, head between his palms like a sleepy
kid in study hall. He did not look well then. He was very thin.
</P>
<P>
   But when he looked up, my eyes met the eyes of the most famous
sorcerer in the world. These were sober eyes, steady eyes that
reeled in my awareness and held it with unbending intent.
</P>
<P>
   As if reading my mind, he said: ``There is nothing to Carlos
Castaneda. Personality is a pretense. Fame? Success? Who gives a
(expletive)? If we weren't so involved in ourselves, we wouldn't do
such barbaric things to ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   He then smiled mischievously, and I joined him for a long,
pleasant lunch.
</P>
<P>
   As for who Carlos Castaneda really was, you'll have to decide
for yourself. For me, he was the real thing. &QL;

CANADIAN DOLLAR FALLS TO A YAWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV.: a graphic for use with this story is being sent to NYT

(HLW)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REGINA, Saskatchewan _ It has become a regular, almost routine,
occurrence: another day, another record low for the Canadian
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The recurring declines that have sent Canada's currency to one
low after another since the beginning of this year might have
caused a panic in many countries, especially in these jittery
economic times when fluctuations in the Japanese yen or the Thai
baht send shivers throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   But this is calm, collected, Canada. Its currency on Thursday
was worth around 68 American cents, just above the record low. Yet,
despite the best attempts of chauvinist columnists and all-news
radio stations to stir things up every time the Canadian dollar
weakens, Canadians are acting as though pretty much nothing has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not only have most Canadians blandly tolerated the
latest, relatively modest, decline of their dollar _ popularly
known as the ``loonie'' because the dollar coin bears the image of
a common loon on one side _ some are even cheering the currency's
steady fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I see the loonie fall I think `Yes! All Right!',''
said Jack Degelman, a manufacturer and exporter of farm equipment
in Regina, Saskatchewan. ``Having a lousy dollar definitely helps
us out.''
</P>
<P>
   A lousy Canadian dollar makes products like the rock pickers
produced by Degelman Industries Ltd. cheaper for buyers with
American dollars, and Degelman's sales have been on the rise. Since
more than 80 percent of Canadian exports go to the United States,
the lopsided exchange rate helps lift the entire manufacturing and
export sector.
</P>
<P>
   That has given Ottawa one big reason not to do much to keep the
loonie from sinking. Besides, the overall Canadian economy
continues to be strong, with low inflation, attractive growth, and
the first balanced budget in decades.
</P>
<P>
   But while exporters may laud the currency's depreciation _ and
record numbers of American tourists discover how much further their
dollars can go north of the border _ plenty of Canadians are
feeling some pain.
</P>
<P>
   Even with slight improvements that have, at least for now,
pushed the loonie back up over 68 cents, importers have watched
their profit margins shrink drastically. Canadians who usually
flock to Florida and other warm spots in the United States are
cutting their trips short or flying directly to Mexico, where the
Canadian dollar continues to hold its own against the peso. The
Toronto Blue Jays, with their $50-million payroll in American
dollars, buy greenbacks months in advance as a safeguard against
further currency shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the depreciation, prices have not yet increased
substantially for all the imported food, clothing and other items
that Canadians buy every day. But business is warning consumers to
be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada is a big importing nation,'' said Robert Armstrong,
president of the Canadian Importers Association, an industry group.
``Apparel, footware, appliances, electronic goods, food stuffs _
we're all going to have to pay a higher price this winter.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said the federal government had not acted to arrest
the dollar's slide because it was focusing almost entirely on the
export part of the economy without taking into account how badly
the rest of Canada was hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't cope with a dollar this low,'' he said. ``It's not
good for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But his pleas are falling on mostly deaf ears. Government
economists preach pragmatism and patience. Canada's official policy
is to let the market set the value of the loonie against the U.S.
dollar and other currencies. While the rate is supposed to float
freely, the Bank of Canada _ the country's central bank _ can
influence currency exchange rates by raising or lowering interest
rates, which now stand at 4.41 percent for three-month Treasury
bills (compared with 5.18 percent for U.S. T-bills).
</P>
<P>
   Fundamentally, a weaker Canadian dollar reflects the declining
competitiveness of Canadian industry and an oversupply of the
natural resources that Canada produces in abundance. Officials
argue that allowing the loonie to weaken is the least damaging way
to deal with the situation and contend that trying to artificially
support it with higher rates would be much worse, hammering
investment and consumer spending on big-ticket items.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, the central bank has intervened in the open market
to buy back Canadian dollars. But it does so rarely, and then only
to stabilize the currency on a particularly volatile day, not to
rebuild its value.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Canada enjoys a high degree of independence but it
is more under the influence of the elected government than is the
Federal Reserve in the United States. Canada's minister of finance
appoints directors, who in turn select a bank governor. In the case
of disputes over policy, by law it is the government, through the
finance minister, and not the Bank of Canada, that has final say.
</P>
<P>
   The last time one Canadian dollar was worth one American dollar
was in late 1976. Since then, the loonie has continuously lost
ground, though it had generally stabilized from early 1994 to last
summer, when the decline resumed. But the decline has been gradual,
minimizing the impact. And even this year, while the exchange rate
has bounced through several record lows, the cumulative
depreciation so far is under 3 percent, far less than the huge
declines of several Asian currencies in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   Economists here generally attribute the currency's latest dips
to outside factors, particularly the Asian economic situation
itself, which has dampened demand for the natural resources and
other commodities that Canada produces. ``Canada's resources sector
is besieged by plummeting prices,'' said Jeff Rubin, chief
economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, in Toronto. Over all, the Canadian
dollar, like other currencies, has been hurt in part because the
tremors in the Asian market have investors seeking out the
strongest currency, which is currently the American dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The economists also credit other factors, including the Bank of
Canada's reluctance to raise interest rates to levels equivalent to
those offered in the United States, and, to a lesser degree,
lingering worries over a possible fall election in the restless
province of Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seems to overly concern federal officials. Prime
Minister Jean Chretien has been predicting since January that the
Canadian dollar's slide will not last. Speaking before New York
investors in March, he blamed currency speculators ``in red
suspenders'' for causing fluctuations in the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists think the problems are more serious. ``We
might as well take the loonie and rename it the ugly duckling
because it only looks good against Asian currencies,'' said David
Rosenberg, senior economist for Nesbitt Burns Inc., a Toronto firm.
He believes that for the situation to be reversed, the Bank of
Canada must raise interest rates, even if doing so hurts exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people may feel we can devalue our way to prosperity,''
Rosenberg said, ``but the ever-weakening Canadian dollar is nothing
more than a tax hike on all Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists do not think the loonie's slide has ended. Some
expect to see the Canadian dollar drop to as low as 65 cents to the
dollar. That further complicates things for Canadian companies that
are already struggling to cope with the worsening exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Toronto Blue Jays. About 80 percent of the baseball
team's income is in Canadian dollars, but 80 percent of its
expenditures are in American dollars. That includes travel,
lodging, and the club's roughly $50-million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   To protect itself from depreciation of the dollar, the team
tries to forecast its cash requirement and then relies on currency
experts at banks and investment houses to lock in its position by
buying American dollars in advance, said Susan Quigley, vice
president of finance and administration for the Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   For most Canadians though, adjusting to the weakened dollar has
simply meant tightening their belts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to go down to the States at least two or three times a
year, but the dollar is so low we can't afford to do that any
more,'' said David Crocker, a swimming-pool store owner from
Brantford, Ontario. He and his wife, Judy, were spending the day at
a casino on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls, where a Canadian
dollar buys four slot machine tokens, but an American dollar brings
almost six.
</P>
<P>
   After a day at the casino, the Crockers usually cross the border
to Buffalo or Niagara Falls, N.Y., to have dinner. This time, they
said, the limping loonie forced them to stay in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't afford it,'' Crocker said.
</P>
<P>
   The ups and mostly downs of the exchange rate have been a
nightmare for Janet Ellen Lee, who lives in Niagara Falls, Ontario.
In September, she and her husband will have two daughters attending
universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had cashed in some of our investments,'' Mrs. Lee said,
``and I remember waking up in the middle of the night wondering if
it would be enough when we converted the money into American
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The clear winners in all this include Americans, like Darla M.
Brown of Ellenton, Fla., who find more money in their purses as
soon as they cross the border into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Brown, visiting Casino Niagara, in Niagara Falls, had
settled comfortably in front of the $1 slots. She had given herself
a $100-a-day limit, but with the exchange rate, her $100 bought her
145 tokens.
</P>
<P>
   Which may or may not have been a fortunate thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're just playing and planning on losing anyway,'' she
said, ``you've just got that much more to lose.''

ADMINISTRATION SETS STRICT RULES MEDICARE-BENEFICIARY HEALTH PLANS
</HEADLINE>
   (ps) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration ordered sweeping
protections for Medicare beneficiaries on Monday, requiring health
plans to guarantee access to specialists, to keep medical records
confidential and to provide interpreters when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, which add muscle to a 1997 law, are stricter than
the standards governing commercial health insurance in many states.
</P>
<P>
   The rules go beyond the 1997 law in some ways, establishing
additional protections for women, for people with serious illnesses
and for patients who cannot read or speak English. The rules apply
to all Medicare services, but include special provisions for
managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said the new rules herald ``the most
significant change in the Medicare program since its inception in
1965.'' Included in the new rules are provisions that would ban
health plans from discouraging sick people from enrolling and
discriminating against Medicare beneficiaries by limiting or
denying coverage because of physical or mental illness, genetic
information, disability or prior use of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of private health plans will soon try to enroll older
Americans, and the government, which pays an average of more than
$5,600 a year for each beneficiary, devised the rules as a way to
make sure that the anticipated growth of private health plans
occurs under careful regulation.
</P>
<P>
   What Medicare does is important to the health care system as a
whole for at least two reasons. With more than 38 million
beneficiaries, Medicare directly influences the medical market in a
big way. Moreover, its standards provide a template for other
buyers, as employers and private insurers often follow the
government's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, Medicare beneficiaries may, on request, obtain
information about the financial condition of a private health plan
and how its doctors are paid.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are to be published in the Federal Register on Friday
and will take effect 30 days later. The Medicare rules, which run
to more than 165,000 words, also contain these requirements:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women may demand ``direct access to a women's health
specialist'' for ``women's routine and preventive health care
services,'' including Pap smears and breast and pelvic
examinations. Specialists include gynecologists and nurse-midwives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients with complex or serious medical problems must be
allowed to go directly to medical specialists in some
circumstances, for example, if a cancer patient has a treatment
plan that calls for 10 rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health plans must provide services ``in a culturally competent
manner'' to all Medicare patients, ``including those with limited
English proficiency or reading skills, diverse cultural and ethnic
backgrounds and physical or mental disabilities.'' Health plans
must try to enroll disabled people, as well as older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health maintenance organizations must pay for the treatment of
any condition that ``a prudent lay person'' would regard as an
emergency. A Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an HMO or other
private health plan may not be charged more than $50 for services
in a hospital emergency room. While most Medicare plans now charge
less, there was no government limit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health plans must protect the confidentiality of medical
records and may not sell their members' names and addresses for any
purpose, even for scientific studies. Patients are entitled to see
their own records. These rules provide more protection than prior
federal standards, but do not go as far as privacy advocates want.
</P>
<P>
   _ Private health plans may not ``solicit door-to-door for
Medicare beneficiaries.'' If they recruit patients in high-income
areas, they must make ``comparable efforts'' in low-income
neighborhoods. They may not offer cash rebates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients who believe they are too sick to go home may
challenge a hospital's decision to discharge them. The patients may
remain in the hospital, at no cost to themselves, until their cases
have been reviewed by an impartial arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ A health plan must assess the health of each new member within
90 days after the person is enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The rules establish elaborate procedures for grievances and
appeals. In general, a health plan must rule on a patient's request
for services as quickly as the person's condition requires _ within
14 days in most cases, or 72 hours in urgent cases. If the patient
appeals, the health plan must issue its decision within 30 days, or
72 hours in urgent cases.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can pursue their claims through several levels of
review leading ultimately to a federal court. In addition, the
rules say, some Medicare beneficiaries may be able to recover
damages under state law for injuries caused by medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Candace K. Schaller, a vice president of the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents the managed-care
industry, said the new consumer protection standards were
``generally reasonable.'' But, she added, health plans may need
more leeway on some issues, like the time limits for deciding
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says it will use the new rules to
improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. It will set
``uniform national performance standards,'' stipulating how many
patients should receive mammograms or flu shots, for example, and
the government may refuse to renew its contract with any health
plan that fails to meet these goals.
</P>
<P>
   Each health plan will have to show ``significant improvement'' _
tentatively defined as a 10 percent reduction in bad outcomes _ in
areas specified by the government. Thus, if 40 percent of the
members of a particular health plan did not get flu shots, the goal
would be to reduce this number to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also contain new protections for doctors. HMO's and
other health plans that take Medicare patients must consult with
their doctors in developing medical policies, clinical guidelines
and procedures for controlling the use of costly services. Such
guidelines must be based on ``reasonable medical evidence,'' not
just a desire to save money.
</P>
<P>
   If a health plan cancels or refuses to sign a contract with a
doctor, it must explain its reasons. The doctor can appeal the
decision and demand a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, a health plan may expel a Medicare beneficiary
if the person is ``disruptive, unruly, abusive or uncooperative,''
or fails to pay premiums within 90 days after being pressed for the
amounts due.
</P>

COMMENTARY: WHAT GOES AROUND  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DASNA, India _ The folks in Dasna village, north of New Delhi,
have never heard of Alan Greenspan. They do not own shares on the
Bombay Stock Exchange. And they are confident India will do just
fine, thank you, despite the economic sanctions imposed by the
United States on it and Pakistan for their nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are 900 million people. We will not die from these
sanctions,'' said Pramod Batra, the 42-year-old village doctor in
Dasna, where there are still more water buffalo and bicycles than
cars on the road and where the air is heavy with the smell of cow
dung used for energy. ``This nuclear test was about self-respect,
and self-respect is more important than roads, electricity and
water. Anyway, what did we do? We exploded our bomb. It was like
shooting a gun off into the air. We didn't hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Indians of Dasna don't understand, and what many
officials of India's new Hindu nationalist government don't
understand, is that since 1991 their country has opened its economy
to global imports and investors, and made itself partially
dependent on global capital to fuel its growth. If anyone forces
India to put its nuclear genie back in the bottle, it's not going
to be the United States, the United Nations, Pakistan or China. It
is going to be the faceless gnomes of this global market. The
Indians are about to learn a fundamental truth about globalization:
Globalization does not end geopolitics. Nations, like India, will
still defy international norms in pursuit of respect, or in
response to real or imagined threats, no matter how integrated they
are. But what globalization will do is exact a whole new price for
that sort of defiance.
</P>
<P>
   A team from the Moody's bond rating agency quietly slipped into
India last week _ about as quietly and secretly as India's nuclear
scientists prepared their bomb. That Moody's team concluded that
the Indian economy _ in the wake of the government's new bloated,
directionless budget, the Indian nuclear test and the U.S.
sanctions _ is heading in the wrong direction. As a result, on
Friday, Moody's downgraded India's economy from ``investment
grade,'' which means it is safe for global investors, to
``speculative grade,'' meaning investors beware.
</P>
<P>
   This is far more important than any U.S. sanctions, because it
will raise the cost of borrowing for every Indian company and state
government seeking funds from abroad. And because India has a low
savings rate, those foreign funds are crucial for its growth.
Indian companies will now have to turn more to the Indian treasury
for capital, and the Indian government, which is already engaged in
far too much deficit spending, is either going to have to open up
the money taps, and trigger inflation, or let Indian companies
starve for cash. The Standard &AMP; Poor's rating agency also changed
its outlook on the Indian economy from ``stable'' to ``negative.''
This is a real blow to a country that needs $500 billion in new
infrastructure over the next decade to remain competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Said Tarun Das, director of the Confederation of Indian
Industry: ``There is something called sentiment in the world
market. People put money where they feel good. Unfortunately,
people are now worried about this part of the world. We are getting
all sorts of hits on our web site from foreign investors, who are
asking us, `Are you at war?'''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that foreign direct investment in India, which was
only $100 million when India opened its economy in 1991, then
soared to $4 billion, has started to slow again. Foreign investment
in the Bombay Stock Exchange is about $8 billion, a quarter of
India's total foreign currency reserves, and those foreigners have
been selling lately. The Bombay Stock Exchange Index _ which had
been resisting the Asian flu _ has slid from 4,300 to near 3,000
since the nuclear test. The Indian rupee has lost 10 percent
against the dollar, falling Monday to a record low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indian society was so carried away with the euphoria over the
nuclear test that it has not carried out a cold assessment of what
the implications are,'' remarked Rajendra Pachauri, an analyst at
the Tata Energy Research Institute. ``I fear that there will be a
sense of denial for a while that nothing is wrong, and then when
something hits us, we will be totally unprepared. I fear that
society could react in an unpredictably negative manner. There
could be a real sense of trauma. We need to prepare Indian society
for that.''

TEXAS GOVERNOR MAY TAKE HEAT FROM G.O.P. CONSERVATIVES FOR TIES TO
DISNEY, R-RATED FILMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush's first chore if he runs for
president in 2000 may be to convince Republican social
conservatives to accept his little-known role in helping finance
more than a dozen R-rated movies for the Walt Disney Co.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boycotts of Disney by the Southern Baptist Convention and
American Family Association over its adult movies appear to have
had little financial effect on Disney, but the influence of social
and religious conservatives in the Republican presidential
nominating process could cause trouble for Bush because of his
personal ties to financing Disney movies.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives in Texas already are pushing state
government under Bush to sell off more than $416 million in Disney
stock owned by Texas trust and pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was a paid director of Silver Screen Management Services
Inc. from 1983 until he resigned from its board two months before
announcing for governor in November 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Screen, through limited partnerships, raised more than $1
billion to finance Disney movies ranging from The Little Mermaid to
Stakeout, a comedy about undercover police spying on suspected
criminals in a fancy mountain home. Silver Screen financed 21
R-rated movies; 32 PG and PG-13 movies; and nine G movies.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Screen was founded and run by Bush's Yale fraternity
brother Roland Betts. Betts also was the largest single shareholder
in the Texas Rangers baseball team while Bush was the team's
managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Betts recently sold their interests in the Texas
Rangers, and last week Bush received $14.9 million for his original
$600,000 investment in the team.
</P>
<P>
   None of the R-rated movies financed by Silver Screen are among
the more controversial films that have led to boycotts of Disney by
social conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   The movies most often cited as offensive _ ``Priest,'' ``Pulp
Fiction'' or ``Chasing Amy'' _ were produced under the Miramax
label. Silver Screen partners financed more than 50 Walt Disney and
Touchstone label movies.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the Silver Screen-financed movies _ ``Down and Out in
Beverly Hills'' _ was the first R-rated movie ever produced by
Disney.
</P>
<P>
   American Family Association of Texas President Wyatt Roberts
said the Touchstone movies ``are not the really raunchy stuff.
Those are more adult oriented, more mature.'' But Roberts said
Touchstone paved the way for the more ``sexually graphic and
gratuitously violent'' Miramax movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Touchstone opened the door,'' Roberts said. ``It signaled to
people that Disney was ready to broaden its appeal beyond family
entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there is no reason why his party's social
conservatives should hold his work with Silver Screen against him.
He said he was never an investor in either Silver Screen or Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only interest was for the company itself,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said as an outside director his role was not to make movies
but to make sure the business itself was properly run. Bush said
Betts asked him to be on the board as part of several business
deals they were doing together, such as the Texas Rangers. But
State Board of Education member Bob Offutt of San Antonio, who is
pushing the state to sell its Disney stock, said he was
``disappointed'' to learn of Bush's connection to the financing of
R-rated Disney movies.
</P>
<P>
   Offutt said that connection could make Bush a tough sell to
social conservatives nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you add those things together there will be many of the
social conservatives in the Republican Party who will be seeking an
alternative to him in the year 2000,'' Offutt said.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, however, said the effect on Bush will be ``negligible''
for anyone except those who already oppose Bush for the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Those conservatives, he said, ``will hold it up and say, `He's
bankrolling the Disney empire,''' Roberts said. ``But given the
minimal involvement he had, I can't see this having an impact on
his political aspirations.''
</P>
<P>
   When social conservative voters turned against U.S. Sen. Phil
Gramm, R-Texas, in Louisiana and Iowa in 1996, it ended his quest
for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   One of the controversies surrounding Gramm was his 1974
investment of $7,500 in an R-rated movie called ``Beauty Queens''
being produced by his former brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beauty Queens'' was never made. The money instead was spent on
an R-rated satire of former President Nixon. Gramm said he never
saw the script of either movie and was just trying to help a family
member.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, as governor, has had an uneasy relationship with his
party's social conservatives, especially on education issues. Some
of those issues include school textbook adoption, school-to-work
programs and a curriculum standard that social conservatives called
``faddish and experimental.''
</P>
<P>
   During this month's Republican State Convention, Bush appealed
to social conservatives with promises to support the teaching of
sexual abstinence to teen-agers and to pass a law requiring
parental notification before a minor can get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Social conservatives next month plan to ask the State Board of
Education to sell the Permanent School Fund's $47 million share of
Disney stock.
</P>
<P>
   Offutt said such a vote would send a message to Disney
executives, even though selling the stock is unlikely to affect
Disney profits or stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they (Disney executives) have completely
abandoned the family, but we want them to know if they continue to
produce objectionable stuff, there could be negative consequences
for their corporation,'' Offutt said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is sort of the corporate equivalent of Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde,'' Roberts said. ``They do some very good things, and they
do some very, very bad things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he opposes the state selling the Disney stock because
he believes investment trust managers should not be politically
motivated in making their decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, the investment decisions ought to be made
on a return on investment basis,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   The Betts-Bush connection to the film industry began in 1983,
when Betts formed Silver Screen and made Bush a director.
</P>
<P>
   An entertainment lawyer, Betts had previously been brought in to
save a company that had financed ``Gandhi'' and ``The Killing
Fields.'' Silver Screen gave Betts the opportunity to become a film
financier himself.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1985, Betts signed a deal to finance movies for Disney
through limited partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The movies were produced under either the Walt Disney or
Touchstone labels and distributed through Buena Vista Distributing
Co., a Disney subsidiary. Disney chose the movies to produce, and
Silver Screen provided the financing.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship ended in 1990 when Disney replaced Silver
Screen with a group of Japanese investors to give Disney additional
financial clout. But Silver Screen has continued to exist to manage
its investors' residuals and ownership rights in the Disney
movies. &QL;

 &HT;    Brill's content is called into question
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brill's Content, the new monthly media-watchdog publication
founded by Steven Brill of Court TV and The American Lawyer
magazine fame, has been born into a climate increasingly critical
of journalism standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything selling itself to you as nonfiction should be true,''
Brill tells readers in the premiere issue of the magazine, which
bills itself as ``The Independent Voice of the Information Age.''
Now Brill's own fact-gathering methods and political allegiance are
in the eye of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressgate,'' a bombshell article in the 152-page issue, which
should be on most newsstands by week's end, quotes independent
counsel Kenneth Starr admitting to press leaks about the Bill
Clinton-Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyers called for an investigation of Starr's
office. Starr disputed Brill in a 19-page letter about the
24,000-word article, saying it bordered on libel. Howard Kurtz of
The Washington Post reported that five other sources have disputed
information attributed to them. In the June 29 issue of The Weekly
Standard, opinion editor David Tell accuses Brill of using the
expose to ``recycle the White House party line in the guise of
press criticism'' and calls it ``fundamentally dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   The brouhaha has succeeded in putting Brill, TV's latest talking
head, ``out there,'' in press speak. The magazine is not aimed at
journalists, but at the mass market of media users. Brill's wants
to pry into the methods of the pryers, showing an initial 225,000
readers how the media products they read or watch are made.
</P>
<P>
   The first issue also features stories on television (how CNN and
other news outlets have special ``bookers'' who arrange live
interviews during breaking news), books (the power of Barnes &AMP;
Noble's chief buyer to make or break a book), newspapers (how The
New York Times investigated the growth of Columbia/HCA Healthcare
Corp.), magazines (the suit against YM magazine over photos used
with an advice column) and the Internet (a profile of David Talbot,
creator of Salon).
</P>
<P>
   Columns include ``The Ticker,'' offering media and cultural
factoids; ``Unhyped Books,'' featuring U.S. Rep. John Lewis'
memoir, ``Walking With the Wind''; and ``Credentials,'' listing the
educational degrees of medical and science reporters, including the
Atlanta Journal Constitution's Mike Toner.
</P>
<P>
   An explicit policy promises to publish corrections ``at least as
prominently as the original mistake.'' And Brill recruited Bill
Kovach, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard
University and a former editor of The Atlanta Journal-
</P>
<P>
   Constitution, as ombudsman.
</P>
<P>
   Kovach writes that he is there ``to receive and investigate
specific complaints about the work of Brill's Content, and to make
a judgment about how such complaints should be handled.'' The storm
around ``Pressgate'' should give him plenty to ponder.

SENATE DESIGNATES MONEY FOR HELICOPTER CARRIER THE NAVY DIDN'T ASK
FOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (Attn: Miss., Maine, Va.)  
 (JT ) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Navy is not asking for a new helicopter
carrier, but Trent Lott wants it to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked into the military budget bill that the Senate debated
Monday is $50 million to buy parts for a $1.5 billion helicopter
carrier that the Navy did not request. The money is also included
in a companion appropriations bill awaiting Senate action.
</P>
<P>
   Senators, aides and lobbyists say the idea of putting a down
payment on the new ship in the $270 billion Pentagon budget bill
came largely from Lott, the Senate majority leader. He represents
Mississippi, where the new vessel would almost certainly be built.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has seven of the helicopter carriers in service or
under construction. Five older ships of a similar design are also
in the fleet, and the Navy seemed to be leaning in its long-range
plan toward overhauling them, at a cost of $950 million each,
rather than buying a new one.
</P>
<P>
   All the ships were built at Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula,
Miss., the state's largest private employer with nearly 11,000
workers at its 800-acre shipyard on the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls a unit of Litton Industries, would almost certainly
build any new helicopter carriers, if Congress approved them. But a
contract to refurbish an older vessel could go to other shipyards
around the country. Knowing the stakes, Ingalls turned to its chief
patron on Capitol Hill, Lott, as well as to other Mississippi
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other lawmakers who lobby long and loud to champion their
cause, Lott, by dint of his lofty position, can often accomplish as
much or more through simple indirection.
</P>
<P>
   An utterance here, a suggestion there goes a long way when it
comes from the Senate majority leader. Lott's top aides, for
instance, hardly need to be told to pay attention when Ingalls
executives come calling with a favor to ask. And when those aides
talk, other senators' staff know they speak for Lott.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being Mississippi's leading employer, Ingalls has
ties to Lott's family that date to the senator's father, Chester,
working at the shipyard as a pipe fitter.
</P>
<P>
   Lott insists he never directly intervened in this case, saying
that the Senate Armed Services Committee ``saw the wisdom'' of
financing parts for the new ship on its own. ``It came out of the
blue,'' Lott said in a brief interview outside his Capitol office.
``But I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who heads the Armed Services seapower
subcommittee, said he did not confer with Lott before including the
$50 million in the bill. The message came through top aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff worked with his staff,'' said Warner, who was
secretary of the Navy when the first of the older helicopter
carriers was ordered in the early 1970s. ``It was the right idea,
so I put it in.''
</P>
<P>
   An industry official familiar with Ingalls' lobbying effort on
Capitol Hill, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said of
Lott's assistance: ``Certainly his work and the work of his staff
was very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   And a lobbyist on Capitol Hill familiar with the issue
underscored the senator's influence: ``This is all Lott. This is
the type of thing that majority leaders do.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Back home in Mississippi, Lott is not taking any public credit
for his role in inserting the money. People who know him say that's
not unusual. ``He doesn't grandstand,'' said Jim Young,
Pascagoula's city manager. ``He works behind the scenes on these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott is not always so quiet when it comes to protecting Ingalls'
interests.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, the shipyard suffered a damaging blow when it
lost out on a Navy contract to build the first three of a class of
12 new amphibious assault ships, the LPD-17, worth about $750
million each. The contract was awarded to a competing consortium
from Maine and Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Upset but undaunted, Lott and Ingalls then lobbied to gain an
advantage on an existing contract to build 12 DDG-51 destroyers
from 1998 to 2001, with the ships evenly split between Ingalls and
Bath Iron Works Corp. in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Lott and Ingalls succeeded in coaxing the Navy, and
Congress, to speed up the construction of two additional
destroyers, which would not have been contracted until after 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the fight for the new helicopter carrier, Lott and his top
aides had a formidable ally, Gen. Charles Krulak, the outspoken,
four-star commandant of the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   The marines are a part of the Department of the Navy and report
to the secretary of the Navy, but they sometimes represent views
independent from the Navy's on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks leading up to the $50 million being included in the
Senate's version of the military budget bill, Krulak urged
lawmakers to invest in a new helicopter carrier rather than sink
money into upgrading one of the older vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Marine generals voice concern that future U.S. military
operations will resemble the Somalia mission in 1992, in which
troops must be flown or ferried into trouble spots from larger
ships off shore.
</P>
<P>
   Krulak said it would be more cost-effective to spend more money
now on a more capable ship that will last 40 years, than extend an
older, less capable ship's service life by 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Krulak repeated his arguments in a letter to Lott that same
month.

 &HT;    Potential new food products get taste test
 &HT;    By Marques G. Harper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's midnight and you're hungry, so you head to the
kitchen for a late-night snack.
</P>
<P>
   Pretzels or chips? Boring. Left-over chicken? Too messy for this
time of night.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe some S'morsels, Banana-Custard Delights or Dinodrops.
Dinodrops?
</P>
<P>
   A student contest that concluded Monday at the Georgia World
Congress Center showcased prospective new food products. Cornell
University's Wrapidos was the winning product. Twenty schools
entered, and six made it to the final round.
</P>
<P>
   Three products are designed to satisfy a sweet tooth:
</P>
<P>
   _ Banana-Custard Delights, created by the Rutgers University
team, are frozen chocolate-covered banana slices filled with
vanilla custard.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dinodrops, developed by the University of British Columbia,
are chocolate-coated sour cherries imprinted with a dinosaur's
foot.
</P>
<P>
   _ And an old campfire favorite _ s'mores _ returns new and
improved. S'morels, created by Iowa State University, combine
graham crackers, marshmallows and chocolate in a roll shape.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry reflects a trend toward adding nutritional
supplements to food.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the additive is bacteria. Pro-Crunch, created by
the University of Wisconsin at Madison, is toasted cookie bits
coated with Bifidobacterium longum and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
The designers say these bacteria are good for the human
gastrointestinal system.
</P>
<P>
   The other two entries take advantage of the growing popularity
of tortillas:
</P>
<P>
   _ Wrapidos _ flour tortillas sealed on three sides with one side
open for stuffing, pita-style _ were developed by Cornell. You
might call them ``tidy tortillas.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicotillas, developed by Kansas State University, are
bite-size, rolled tortillas with raisin filling, flavored with
herbs and spices.
</P>
<P>
   Some teams have received inquiries from manufacturers and have
taken steps to get patents. But there's no guarantee that any of
the six products will make it to the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Prizes, including $1,000 to the winner from sponsor Mars, were
awarded during a meeting of the Institute of Food Technologists,
which conducted the contest.

 &HT;    Braves notebook: Slumping Graffanino gets call to lead off
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ No one was more surprised by the Braves' lineup
Monday night than the man atop it. Leading off ... Tony Graffanino?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not swinging like a leadoff man right now,'' said
Graffanino, who started at second base against Yankee left-hander
Andy Pettitte and led off for just the second time in his brief
big-league career. ``I'm not sure I want the five at-bats right
now. I've been hitting the ball OK but right at people. But I've
got to try to get on base.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino began the night batting just .208. He was hitless in
seven at-bats over the weekend in Montreal, extending his hitless
streak to 0-for-13. Graffanino was 2-for-his-last 34, .059. That's
far worse than his 5-for-31 slump (.161) to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   With Walt Weiss back in Atlanta with his seriously ill and
hospitalized son, Brody, 3, Bobby Cox needed another leadoff man.
Cox said Weiss might rejoin the team Wednesday, when this series
shifts to Atlanta. Ozzie Guillen started again at shortstop, but
despite his .364 lifetime average against Pettitte, Cox chose to
bat Graffanino first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else is gonna lead off?'' Cox asked. ``He's right-handed
and he's leading off. (Guillen) hits Pettitte, but I thought I'd
just give Graf a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other time Graffanino led off was July 22 last year, in
the second game of a doubleheader in Chicago. He was 0-for-3 with
two walks and a strikeout that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel all right,'' Graffanino said. ``I'm seeing the ball
well, and I don't feel I'm having bad at-bats. But my confidence is
not where it should be. I just hope I don't owe (pitchers). I hope
I'm working on credit right now, where they owe me. All I can do is
keep swinging.''
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino was rewarded immediately Monday. In his first at-bat,
he singled up the middle. But two batters later, leaning and
running with a full count to Chipper Jones, Graffanino was picked
off by Pettitte.
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Graffanino drilled a shot in the hole on the left
side. But Derek Jeter fielded it and threw out Eddie Perez at
third. Graffanino and Guillen then scored when Gerald Williams'
drive to deep left glanced off Tim Raines' glove for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Lining up
</P>
<P>
   With Perez catching Greg Maddux Monday, Cox used Javy Lopez as
his designated hitter. The manager also used the right-handed
lineup he has employed regularly lately. That meant Williams in
right field and Danny Bautista, not Ryan Klesko, in left. And that
left Klesko's bat, the club's hottest, on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko doubled Sunday in Montreal to extend his career-high
hitting streak to 13 games. During that stretch, he's 21-for-51
(.412) with four homers and 13 RBIs. In last year's interleague
series in Yankee Stadium, Klesko homered in each of the two games
he played.
</P>
<P>
   But Klesko never has faced Pettitte and is batting just .192
(5-for-26) against left-handers. All 12 of his homers have come
against right-handers.
</P>
<P>
   Williams watch
</P>
<P>
   Williams continues to make the most of his starting chances. He
began Monday with a .528 average against left-handers, .417 with
runners in scoring position and a .474 average (9-for-19) over his
last 10 games. After striking out in the first inning, Williams
ripped Pettitte for a two-run double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be a professional for all the situations I'm put
in,'' Williams said. ``That nothing affects my willingness and
drive when I'm called on. Going into the game, I understand I'm not
as sharp as if I'm playing day in, day out. I've got to understand
I can't try to do too much. I do what I can. Everything else is a
bonus.''

PASTRANA PLEDGES PEACE, BETTER TIES TO WASHINGTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN OTIS 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
 
BOGOTA, Colombia _ Just one day after winning the presidency,
Andres Pastrana vowed Monday to end a civil war that has vexed nine
presidents before him and has bled Colombia for 34 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pastrana, who defeated Horacio Serpa of the ruling Liberal Party
in a run-off election Sunday, pledged to personally sit down for
talks with leaders of the nation's left-wing guerrilla groups. He
said the first meeting could come within the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we will begin to make all the contacts necessary to
meet with the (guerrilla leadership),'' Pastrana said at a news
conference. ``The top priority of this government is peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, who will be sworn in Aug. 7 to lead Colombia's first
Conservative Party government in 12 years, also promised to improve
relations with the United States, which hit bottom under outgoing
President Ernesto Samper.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a Pastrana envoy met in the Andean foothills with top
leaders of Colombia's largest guerrilla organization _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. A FARC communique
that ridiculed Serpa's claims to be the ``peace candidate'' may
have persuaded some voters to support Pastrana in Sunday's
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The door has been opened. We have to take advantage of it,''
Pastrana said. ``Four years ago, the FARC would not meet with any
member of the Samper government. But they have shown a clear
willingness to begin a peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   During Samper's term in office, the guerrillas have dealt the
army a series of humiliating defeats and have grown in terms of
troop strength as well as territorial control. Numbering between
12,000 and 15,000, the rebels are now present in about half of
Colombia's 1,071 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
   Their military prowess and involvement in the drug trade has
alarmed Washington, which has increased military assistance to
Colombia in the past three years. The guerrillas finance their war
by demanding ransom for kidnapping victims and by providing
protection to drug traffickers and farmers who grow coca, the raw
material for cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have refused to negotiate with Samper during his
entire term. They insist that Samper, who was elected in 1994 with
the help of $6.1 million from the Cali drug cartel, lacks
legitimacy and moral authority.
</P>
<P>
   During this year's recent presidential campaign, however, both
the FARC and the smaller National Liberation Army have appeared
willing to open talks with the incoming administration.
</P>
<P>
   To help persuade the guerrillas to disarm, Pastrana vowed to
seek state and private-sector investments in impoverished,
rebel-dominated areas in order to help fighters make the transition
to civilian life.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his government would guarantee the safety of
disarmed rebels, a sensitive issue to guerrillas. When supporters
of the FARC formed a political party in the 1980s, right-wing
paramilitary squads killed more than 1,000 of its members.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos Calarca, a FARC spokesman in Mexico City, said the rebels
are taking a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must have the political will and capacity to achieve
peace, and that can't be demonstrated through declarations alone.
This is demonstrated through deeds,'' Calarca told Bogota's NTC
television.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana also invited the United States to play a greater role
in the peace process. He vowed to improve Colombia's relations with
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Due to the Samper campaign-finance scandal, the Clinton
administration has treated Colombia as a pariah nation over much of
the past four years. The United States revoked Samper's visa and
sanctioned his administration for being uncooperative in the fight
against drugs in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said Colombia, the world's No. 1 supplier of cocaine,
needs a ``Marshall Plan'' of international aid to pay for the
eradication of coca crops.
</P>
<P>
   But he also said that Washington's agenda in Colombia should
include peace, human rights and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Washington on Monday, State Department spokesman
James Rubin offered Pastrana ``warm congratulations'' and said the
U.S. government ``looks forward to working with him and his new
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Pastrana's post-election enthusiasm on the prospects for
peace, it may prove difficult for him to keep his promises.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Torres, a security consultant for oil companies in
Colombia, said it's unclear whether the rebels, who have scored
some of their biggest victories in the past three years, are
serious about disarming. He also said that Pastrana lacks a
comprehensive peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants negotiations, but no one really knows what to
say,'' Torres said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say Pastrana should seize the moment. As a member of
the upper class, Pastrana may be able to persuade Colombia's elite
to consider guerrilla demands for agrarian reform, social spending
and a reduction in the size of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jesus Bejarano noted that lengthy civil wars
in El Salvador and Guatemala were brought to an end by conservative
presidents during their first years in office.
</P>
<P>
   John Otis, a free-lance journalist based in Bogota, wrote this
story for the Houston Chronicle.

ANDRES PASTRANA: FROM `STOOL PIGEON' TO COLOMBIA'S PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ Four years ago Andres Pastrana could not walk
into a movie theater here without facing a torrent of insults, the
most frequent of which was ``stool pigeon.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana was hounded by the wrath of fellow Colombians after he
lost the previous presidential race to Ernesto Samper, then
released recordings of Samper's campaign officials soliciting
contributions from drug lords.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Pastrana found work consulting for the United
Nations and managed to stay out of the country for most of the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, though, Pastrana savored sweet vindication as
millions of Colombians who quietly supported his whistle-blowing
elected him to succeed Samper, rejecting Horacio Serpa, the
president's ally.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Pastrana appeared surprised to have won the presidency
by a firm margin, in an election with a record voter turnout. If on
Sunday he looked shrunken and somehow prematurely defeated,
Pastrana seemed on Monday like a man just getting the hang of
sitting in a much a bigger chair.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said that he would meet with Samper on Tuesday morning
to begin the transition process, and that he expected relations
between the United States and Colombia would change.
</P>
<P>
   He said Colombia now has a president ``with legitimacy and
authority,'' and he pledged to broaden relations with the United
States. ``The agenda with the United States cannot be solely
narcotics,'' he said in remarks Monday to the foreign press.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could see ``saying `no' to the United States for
anything,'' Pastrana replied, ``Maybe for a lot of things.''
</P>
<P>
   After campaigning on a platform of ending more than three
decades of civil violence, Pastrana called the start of peace talks
with leftist rebels ``the first responsibility of the next
president of Colombia.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised to make contact with the leaders of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia _ Latin America's oldest
rebel group and the largest insurgent group in Colombia _ in the
next few days, and he invited Washington to play a role in the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said he believed that the rebels would support the
elimination of coca growing in areas they dominate, and he called
for an international ``Marshall Plan'' to help eliminate drug crops
and develop other ways for coca farmers to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would review agricultural policies, which he
said were crucial to reducing unemployment and improving economic
prospects. Forty percent of Colombians live in rural areas, and
Pastrana noted that agricultural imports in the last four years had
risen to 5 million tons a year, from 700,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana once told a newspaper here, ``I like to undertake
high-risk ventures. It's something that seduces me.''
</P>
<P>
   Steering a country ripped apart by private armies on the left
and right, a country that exports 80 percent of the cocaine that
ends up in the United States, a country with an economy in free
fall, may turn out to be the love of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But the new president's success will to some extent depend on
forces beyond his control. While the rebels have said they want to
begin talks, successful negotiations will require a willingness to
make concessions on all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't depend solely on him,'' said Carlos Franco, a
former rebel of the April 19 Movement, known as M-19. ``If the
conditions exist, if the political class is ready to accept the
kinds of changes the guerrilla wants to discuss, all of that will
influence the chances for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Others said the chances for peace will depend, rather, on
whether the rebels are convinced that they can win their battle
through negotiations rather than bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana, 43, is the Conservative son of a former president,
Misael Pastrana, the last man to rule Colombia as part of a
power-sharing arrangement between Liberals and Conservatives, which
ended in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Bogota and is married to Norha Puyana. They have
three children, Santiago, 15; Laura, 13, and Valentina, 2.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Pastrana _ already widely known as a journalist on
his family's television news program and later as a city councilman
_ turned down an offer to be named mayor of Bogota by President
Belisario Betancur. Instead he became the city's first popularly
elected mayor in 1988, and one of his achievements was
significantly expanding the availability of drinking water in poor
neighborhoods. He went on to become a senator in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bogotanos do not remember Pastrana as an exceptional
mayor, even his critics note that Pastrana has never been accused
of corruption or favoritism.

SUPREME COURT SHARPLY LIMITS HARASSMENT SUITS AGAINST SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A sharply divided Supreme Court set a highly
restrictive standard Monday for determining when school districts
can be found liable under federal law for a teacher's sexual
harassment of a student.
</P>
<P>
   A harassment victim can recover damages from the school district
only if a school official with the authority to intervene actually
knew of the teacher's misconduct and, acting with ``deliberate
indifference,'' failed to stop it, the court said in an opinion by
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. The vote was 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came in a case from a school district near Austin,
Texas, where a high school teacher seduced a ninth-grader and
engaged in a yearlong affair with her. The girl never told school
officials about the affair, which ended when a police officer
discovered the two. The teacher was dismissed and criminally
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   The girl and her mother sued the Lago Vista Independent School
District for damages under a federal law, Title IX of the Education
Amendments of 1972, which prohibits sex discrimination by
educational institutions that receive federal money, a definition
that applies to all public school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Supreme Court decisions established that the law's
reference to sex discrimination covers a wide range of misconduct
involving sexual harassment, and also provided for suits for
damages by individual victims. But the court had not addressed the
standard for establishing liability.
</P>
<P>
   Over the four dissenters' vigorous protest that the court was
enacting into law a judicial ``policy judgment'' that would have
the effect of insulating school districts from nearly all such
lawsuits, the majority chose the most restrictive of several
alternative standards.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the court rejected the Department of Education's
interpretation of Title IX, under which a school district could be
found liable, regardless of whether officials knew of the
misconduct, if a teacher had misused his position of authority in
carrying out the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   That was a misunderstanding of Title IX, O'Connor said in her
majority opinion. ``It does not appear that Congress contemplated
unlimited recovery in damages against a funding recipient where the
recipient is unaware of discrimination in its programs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined the majority opinion
along with Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony M. Kennedy, and
Clarence Thomas. The dissenters were Justices John Paul Stevens,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, David H. Souter, and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor noted that Title IX ``amounts
essentially to a contract between the government and the recipient
of funds,'' under which schools agree to accept certain conditions,
such as preventing discrimination, in exchange for their federal
money.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said it did not make sense that Congress would have
expected school districts to subject themselves to open-ended
liability for misconduct of which no one in a position of authority
might even be aware.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while ``no one questions that a student suffers
extraordinary harm'' from harassment and abuse by teachers, the
court could not impose broad liability on school districts ``until
Congress speaks directly on the subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The National School Boards Association had warned the court, in
a brief filed on the Lago Vista district's behalf, that any
standard other than the ``actual knowledge'' test the court adopted
on Monday would have a ``devastating financial impact on the
nation's public schools.''
</P>
<P>
   While many school districts receive relatively small amounts of
federal money _ $126,000 a year in the case of Lago Vista _ jury
verdicts in harassment cases can exceed $1 million, the school
board association's brief said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a group of civil rights organizations _ led
by the National Women's Law Center _ here said in their brief that
because many victims of sexual harassment by teachers feel isolated
and afraid to report the situation, a liability standard that
depends on official knowledge would effectively immunize school
districts much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the plaintiff, Alida Star Gebser, testified that
she was afraid to tell anyone about her relationship with the
teacher, Frank Waldrop.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia D. Greenberger, co-president of the National Women's Law
Center, said Monday that the decision would ``make the job of
eliminating sexual harassment in schools far more difficult.''
Greenberger is currently seeking Supreme Court review in a case
that raises the separate but related question of whether schools
can be held liable for the harassment of one student by another.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision on Monday, Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School
District, No. 96-1866, upheld a ruling last year by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans. That court, affirming an
initial ruling by the U.S. District Court in Austin dismissing
Gebser's suit, held that the school district could be liable only
if a supervisory employee ``actually knew of the abuse, had the
power to end the abuse, and failed to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Decisions by other federal courts, including a 1997 ruling by
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New York, had taken a
different approach under which a district could be found liable if
a teacher had abused his authority over a student.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, the court Monday went even further in
protecting school districts than the 5th Circuit opinion it
affirmed. O'Connor said that to establish liability, the school
district failure to respond must have amounted to ``deliberate
indifference to discrimination,'' which she defined as an
``official decision'' not to act on its knowledge. The 5th Circuit
had left open the question whether a district could be liable if
its failure to respond was simply negligent, rather than
deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, in a dissenting opinion that the other dissenters also
signed, said the court had given school districts an incentive not
to take steps to protect vulnerable students. ``As long as school
boards can insulate themselves from knowledge about this sort of
conduct, they can claim immunity from damages liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters said that the court had in effect overruled a
1992 decision that made damages available to individual plaintiffs
in Title IX cases. The majority's reasoning suggested ``that no
damages should ever be awarded in a Title IX case,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate dissenting opinion, Ginsburg said that if a school
district had an effective policy in place for reporting and
redressing sexual harassment, such a policy could be an
``affirmative defense'' against a lawsuit by a plaintiff who had
not taken proper advantage of the policy. Souter and Breyer also
joined this opinion, which may have represented an abortive effort
to marshal a majority by allaying fears about unlimited liability
for school districts.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the court is scheduled to decide two other
sexual harassment cases. Both deal with employer liability for
harassment in the workplace, which is addressed by a different
federal law, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. For that
reason, the ruling Monday does not necessarily forecast the outcome
of the other cases.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes

medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

imperfect union of imperfect people will include the measured
brand-testing of the Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation

   Are men worth it? More precisely, is the maxim true about
marriage being good for a man's health but hazardous for a woman's

seem longer? Natalie Angier, a science writer for The New York
Times who is completing a book about women's bodies, takes a crack

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female
Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22 ingredients
marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

 By LESLIE EATON 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

 By KATHLEEN McAULIFFE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

 By KATHLEEN McAULIFFE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

<TEXT>

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

 By ROBERT LIPSYTE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.

 By ROBERT LIPSYTE 
 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>

Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the

aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''

 c.1998 The New York Times Co.  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

<P>
   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

ADMINISTRATION SETS STRICT RULES MEDICARE-BENEFICIARY HEALTH PLANS
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Repeating for all needing)  
(ps) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration ordered sweeping
protections for Medicare beneficiaries on Monday, requiring health
plans to guarantee access to specialists, to keep medical records
confidential and to provide interpreters when needed.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, which add muscle to a 1997 law, are stricter than
the standards governing commercial health insurance in many states.
</P>
<P>
   The rules go beyond the 1997 law in some ways, establishing
additional protections for women, for people with serious illnesses
and for patients who cannot read or speak English. The rules apply
to all Medicare services, but include special provisions for
managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The administration said the new rules herald ``the most
significant change in the Medicare program since its inception in
1965.'' Included in the new rules are provisions that would ban
health plans from discouraging sick people from enrolling and
discriminating against Medicare beneficiaries by limiting or
denying coverage because of physical or mental illness, genetic
information, disability or prior use of medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of private health plans will soon try to enroll older
Americans, and the government, which pays an average of more than
$5,600 a year for each beneficiary, devised the rules as a way to
make sure that the anticipated growth of private health plans
occurs under careful regulation.
</P>
<P>
   What Medicare does is important to the health care system as a
whole for at least two reasons. With more than 38 million
beneficiaries, Medicare directly influences the medical market in a
big way. Moreover, its standards provide a template for other
buyers, as employers and private insurers often follow the
government's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, Medicare beneficiaries may, on request, obtain
information about the financial condition of a private health plan
and how its doctors are paid.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are to be published in the Federal Register on Friday
and will take effect 30 days later. The Medicare rules, which run
to more than 165,000 words, also contain these requirements:
</P>
<P>
   _ Women may demand ``direct access to a women's health
specialist'' for ``women's routine and preventive health care
services,'' including Pap smears and breast and pelvic
examinations. Specialists include gynecologists and nurse-midwives.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients with complex or serious medical problems must be
allowed to go directly to medical specialists in some
circumstances, for example, if a cancer patient has a treatment
plan that calls for 10 rounds of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health plans must provide services ``in a culturally competent
manner'' to all Medicare patients, ``including those with limited
English proficiency or reading skills, diverse cultural and ethnic
backgrounds and physical or mental disabilities.'' Health plans
must try to enroll disabled people, as well as older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health maintenance organizations must pay for the treatment of
any condition that ``a prudent lay person'' would regard as an
emergency. A Medicare beneficiary enrolled in an HMO or other
private health plan may not be charged more than $50 for services
in a hospital emergency room. While most Medicare plans now charge
less, there was no government limit.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health plans must protect the confidentiality of medical
records and may not sell their members' names and addresses for any
purpose, even for scientific studies. Patients are entitled to see
their own records. These rules provide more protection than prior
federal standards, but do not go as far as privacy advocates want.
</P>
<P>
   _ Private health plans may not ``solicit door-to-door for
Medicare beneficiaries.'' If they recruit patients in high-income
areas, they must make ``comparable efforts'' in low-income
neighborhoods. They may not offer cash rebates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Patients who believe they are too sick to go home may
challenge a hospital's decision to discharge them. The patients may
remain in the hospital, at no cost to themselves, until their cases
have been reviewed by an impartial arbiter.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _ A health plan must assess the health of each new member within
90 days after the person is enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   The rules establish elaborate procedures for grievances and
appeals. In general, a health plan must rule on a patient's request
for services as quickly as the person's condition requires _ within
14 days in most cases, or 72 hours in urgent cases. If the patient
appeals, the health plan must issue its decision within 30 days, or
72 hours in urgent cases.
</P>
<P>
   Patients can pursue their claims through several levels of
review leading ultimately to a federal court. In addition, the
rules say, some Medicare beneficiaries may be able to recover
damages under state law for injuries caused by medical malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Candace K. Schaller, a vice president of the American
Association of Health Plans, which represents the managed-care
industry, said the new consumer protection standards were
``generally reasonable.'' But, she added, health plans may need
more leeway on some issues, like the time limits for deciding
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration says it will use the new rules to
improve the quality of care for Medicare beneficiaries. It will set
``uniform national performance standards,'' stipulating how many
patients should receive mammograms or flu shots, for example, and
the government may refuse to renew its contract with any health
plan that fails to meet these goals.
</P>
<P>
   Each health plan will have to show ``significant improvement'' _
tentatively defined as a 10 percent reduction in bad outcomes _ in
areas specified by the government. Thus, if 40 percent of the
members of a particular health plan did not get flu shots, the goal
would be to reduce this number to 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rules also contain new protections for doctors. HMO's and
other health plans that take Medicare patients must consult with
their doctors in developing medical policies, clinical guidelines
and procedures for controlling the use of costly services. Such
guidelines must be based on ``reasonable medical evidence,'' not
just a desire to save money.
</P>
<P>
   If a health plan cancels or refuses to sign a contract with a
doctor, it must explain its reasons. The doctor can appeal the
decision and demand a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules, a health plan may expel a Medicare beneficiary
if the person is ``disruptive, unruly, abusive or uncooperative,''
or fails to pay premiums within 90 days after being pressed for the
amounts due.

   Jamaica's Reggae Boyz gain experience in 5-0 loss to Argentina
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ When the Argentine and Jamaican national soccer teams
lined up for the playing of their national anthems before Sunday
afternoon's World Cup meeting, the picture could not have looked
more bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Argentines, in their famed blue-and-white-striped
jerseys, the consummate professionals, heroes to a nation, winners
of three World Cup championships and representing one of the most
storied soccer histories in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Reggae Boyz.
</P>
<P>
   The guys who call the soccer ball their girlfriend _ and,
``nobody dances with my girl,'' as they are wont to say.
</P>
<P>
   The guys who wear Bob Marley T-shirts under their jerseys,
compose the youngest team in the World Cup, have thousands of
partying fans looking more for fun than for soccer victories _ good
thing _ and come from a nation that only recently picked up the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The final score proved to be Argentina 5, Jamaica 0, a romp. But
please understand: While the Argentines didn't need any help
whipping Jamaica, they got it when a Jamaican player was red-carded
in the first half, meaning Argentina played the rest of the way
with a one-man advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Which is like starting a game of H-O-R-S-E against Michael
Jordan at ``S.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reggae Boyz have come a long way, regardless of the score.
And they still have big plans, regardless of the score.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to the fans at the Gare De Lyon train station, who
were kicking around a soccer ball while waiting for their next
train on this unlikely World Cup ride and listening to reggae
music.
</P>
<P>
   They were asked about Jamaica's chances in its next game, which
comes Friday against Japan and on the heels of a 3-1 loss to
Croatia and the 5-0 loss to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will win 10-0,'' said Edward Powell, a travel agent who led
a group of fans to France for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Have we mentioned that the Reggae Boyz and their throng of fans
always are confident? Have we mentioned that Jamaica already has
been eliminated from the tournament and will play its first-round
finale, appropriately, for fun?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an identity, and we like it,'' said midfielder Robbie
Earle. ``But this is a real soccer team. You don't make it to the
World Cup unless you earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's the name. Reggae Boyz is what they call
themselves. It is not some tag laid on these fellows by a group of
fans or someone in the media.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday's game notwithstanding, being a Reggae Boyz player is
not a bad thing at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here for experience, and we're getting it,'' Jamaica
coach Rene Simoes said. ``When you play with 10 men against a team
the caliber of Argentina, you are likely to allow a lot of goals.
We don't have the proper experience to play that game. It was not a
reflection of our best game.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's best game is free-lancing, shoot-first, worry about
offsides and defense later. It is exactly what these talented
players want to be known for _ fun in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, these guys really are talented, although the attacking
style backfired Sunday at Parc des Princes against an Argentine
team that also likes to attack and is much better at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come here to advertise tourism,'' Simoes said. ``We
came here to play.''
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, as much as the Reggae Boyz are soccer's version of
the Jamaican bobsled team, a novelty act of sorts that entered the
1988 Winter Olympic Games as a sideshow, by 1998 the bobsled team
had become a legitimate squad.
</P>
<P>
   So has Jamaican soccer, and it didn't take nearly as long for it
to reach a high level.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a healthy if small national amateur soccer association
and a big boost from Simoes, a proven Brazilian coach who took over
Jamaica's national team in 1994, Jamaica this year became only the
third Caribbean nation to qualify for the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Caribbean nation to make it to the Cup finals was Haiti in
1974. Before that, Cuba qualified in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players are enthusiastic about soccer, and they are
talented athletes,'' Simoes said. ``This is a serious effort.
Jamaica wanted to reach the top level of the game, and today it has
nothing to be ashamed about. It is getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a team that will go home after Friday's game against
Japan. But the potential is clear.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cup qualifying process, which ended with the Reggae
Boyz tying powerful Mexico 0-0 last November to earn the third and
last qualifying berth out of its region, which also includes the
United States, Jamaica surprised many experts by earning the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there are better teams than us playing today,'' Earle
said. ``But we have come a long way in a very short time.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 when Simoes took over the Jamaican team, it was
considered a joke in international circles, losing by such scores
as 9-2 and 6-0 in the months before Simoes' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   But Simoes, a tough tactician who had coached Brazil's national
Under-20 and Under-23 teams, gathered a group of 40-plus Jamaican
players together and began training them hard.
</P>
<P>
   Some players dropped out of the tough training program,
including Walter Boyd, who was one of Jamaica's most popular
players but did not embrace the training.
</P>
<P>
   Simoes also took various Jamaican teams to Brazil over a
two-year period, training the teams with Brazilian professionals
and scheduling games against top Brazilian teams.
</P>
<P>
   The initiation into elite soccer was tough. Simoes went through
more than 50 lineups, and the record in those exhibition games was
abysmal.
</P>
<P>
   But three years later, Jamaica was putting scares into the
United States and Mexico. Then, the Reggae Boyz squeezed into the
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, they stood shoulder to shoulder with Argentina, if
not eye-to-eye in terms of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team will be back,'' Simoes said.
</P>
<P>
   Their fans, no doubt, will come along too.

 &HT;    Mysterious 'cluster' of dangerous E. coli strikes Atlanta
children
 &HT;    (Eds: Can run with STINSON-ECOLI and FOOD-SAFETY.)
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State health officials are investigating a ``cluster''
of E. coli infections that have stricken six Atlanta children,
including the son of Atlanta Braves shortstop Walt Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the children, girls ages 2 and 4, were in critical
condition on Monday at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center,
diagnosed with a highly infectious and sometimes lethal strain of
the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' 3-year-old son, Brody, was in serious condition at
Scottish Rite. All three children are suffering from kidney failure
and are being treated with dialysis, respirators and blood
transfusions.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth child, a 3-year-old boy, was in stable condition at
Egleston Children's Hospital near Emory University. Two others,
ages 12 and 8, have been treated and released at area hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   At least five of the six are from the north metro area. Although
authorities have declined to identify any of the youngsters, Weiss
confirmed his child was among them.
</P>
<P>
   So far, officials have not found a common denominator among the
six cases for E. coli O157:H7. And they warned that it may be a
week before results from sophisticated DNA tests determine whether
the illnesses have a common point of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the children began showing symptoms more than a
week ago, on June 14. ``It's above and beyond what you'd expect to
see in this short of time,'' said Dr. Larry Slutsker, an
epidemiologist with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. The federal agency has not been asked by the state to
join the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The six children live in Cobb, Cherokee, Bartow and Fulton
counties in the metro Atlanta area. Local jurisdictions have handed
the investigation over to the state Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are searching for clues in food, fruit juices
and a popular metro Atlanta water park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very preliminary right now,'' said Dr. Jim Buehler,
epidemiologist with the state Division of Public Health. ``We're
talking to families about what they've done, where they've been and
trying to interview the children who are sick about what they've
eaten and who they've been in contact with.''
</P>
<P>
   E. coli is a bacteria that lives in the digestive tracts of
cattle and other animals. It is found most often in ground beef.
The ``0157:H7'' strain of the bacteria was discovered in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, only 15 cases were reported in Georgia. In 1996, the
last year for which data exist, 39 cases were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The worst known outbreak of E. coli infection was the 1993 Jack
in the Box case in the Seattle area, in which contaminated
hamburgers from the West Coast chain sickened hundreds and killed
four people.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials say E. coli cases are not uncommon during the
summer, a season for hot weather, outdoor cooking, picnics and
swimming in potentially contaminated water.
</P>
<P>
   But six cases at once is unusual, state officials admit. ``We're
calling this a cluster because of the short time period,'' said
spokeswoman Joyce Goldberg. ``We are not calling it an outbreak.''
</P>
<P>
   That would imply that a single source of the disease has been
found, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, health workers tested the water and inspected
the food services at White Water park in Marietta, Ga., which
officials said some of the families had visited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a clean bill of health in three separate tests,'' said
Deedie Dowdle, marketing director for the park.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors checked the water and the park's restaurants, she
said, adding ``they gave our restaurant a 97 out of 100.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cobb County health department spokeswoman Hamilton said it
is too early to draw conclusions. ``We are looking at all
possibilities right now,'' Hamilton said, ``and we've got a number
of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of those still hospitalized, according to the state Board
of Health, are suffering from hemolytic uremic syndrome _ a
shutdown of the kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   There is no specific treatment for E. coli, other than to treat
the symptoms. The mortality rate from HUS is is 3 to 5 percent .
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the cluster of six children, Egleston Children's
Hospital in Atlanta is treating two sisters, ages 2 and 6, who were
admitted for E. coli infection on June 6 and are in stable
condition. They are not considered part of the cluster.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County epidemiologist Bob Finton said the six cases at
once in a single area is unusual, ``but it may be hard to link
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, E. coli cases arise most commonly from
insufficiently-cooked or contaminated food, unpasteurized milk or
juices, or inadequate handwashing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Waterborne contamination from E. coli is most common in
third-world countries. The bacteria can't spread in chlorinated
water.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said his son appeared to be recovering when he suddenly
took a turn for the worse while the Braves were opening their road
trip in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started getting severe diarrhea a week from yesterday,''
Weiss said Monday. ``We ended up taking him to ER three times. We
just thought he had a bug but blood started showing up in his bowel
movements and by Thursday (June 18), he was just passing pure blood
from his bowels.''

RUSSELL ACCUSSES LASORDA OF BACKSTABBING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)(UPDATES WITH MORE LASORDA
QUOTES) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Before a recent game against the Cincinnati Reds,
Bill Russell sat gloomily in his clubhouse office at Dodger Stadium
venting his frustrations about Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's just killing me and Fred (Claire) with the Fox
people,'' said Russell. ``Fred knows it. I know it. And there's
nothing we can do about it. It's just tough to work under these
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's just vicious when he wants something. He did the same
sort of thing when he was a coach under Walter Alston, and wanted
Alston's job. Tommy's been second-guessing me ever since I took
over for him. Why? I don't know. All I know is that we haven't
spoken for months. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Tom Lasorda denied Russell's claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said a bad word about him,'' Lasorda said Monday night
prior to the Dodgers' game with the Angels in Anaheim. ``I love the
man. I have not talked about him to anyone at Fox and if he says I
have, tell him he's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Russell is like a son to me and Fred Claire has been a
friend of mine for more than 30 years,'' Lasorda earlier told Los
Angeles sports talk show host Joe McDonnell. ``I would never
politic for either guy's job.''
</P>
<P>
   If Tom Lasorda indeed had been putting the knock on Russell, he
only would have joined a lengthening list of Russell detractors
that included many Dodger fans, many media types and, ultimately,
too many members of Rupert Murdoch's impatient new management team
who questioned Russell's leadership abilities and tactical skills.
</P>
<P>
   And, if Lasorda were laying deadly minefields of criticism about
Fred Claire around town, it would have been treated with a
cautionary wink by the new Fox brass that understood that Lasorda's
motives just might be tainted by the well-known fact that he was
fanatically determined to assume Claire's job and run the team
himself.
</P>
<P>
   So, in the aftermath of the Great Dodger Sunday Night Massacre
in which both Bill Russell and Fred Claire were savagely cashiered,
there are those observers inclined to believe that Tom Lasorda
played a prominent role in it.
</P>
<P>
   And they are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Lasorda for sure hasn't been reciting epic poetry about
Russell and Claire that would inspire comparisons to T.S. Eliot, or
Ezra Pound. And it's also known he's schmoozed for long hours with
Michael Milken, a top adviser to Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   But I'm sure that the two Fox executives, Peter Chernin and
Chase Carey, who manipulate the puppet strings attached to the
so-called Dodger president, Bob Graziano, would have coolly ignored
Lasorda's alleged remonstrances and not made such a stunning
decision had the team not fallen haplessly on its cleats.
</P>
<P>
   The cruel bottom line is that Bill Russell and Fred Claire are
among the dearly departed because of where the Dodgers now find
themselves in the N.L. West Division standings.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday evening's debate with the Anaheim Angels, the
Dodgers were 36-38 and 12{ games behind the San Diego Padres, not
exactly where the Los Angeles team expected to be at this juncture
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the giddy optimism of March and April, the Dodgers
were actually the consensus favorite to win their division for
reasons I never quite understood.
</P>
<P>
   You knew the team simply wasn't that good when it arrived here
for its opener without a legitimate center fielder and with a bunch
of guys on its roster (Matt Luke, Trenidad Hubbard, Thomas Howard,
ad nauseam) that nobody else desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have enough players,'' Bill Russell stated to me
privately.
</P>
<P>
   And what compounded the Dodgers' miseries is that they didn't
have any pitchers, either, as all except Ramon Martinez and Darren
Dreifort turned out to be disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo was such a bust that the Dodgers traded him to the
New York Mets, which might turn out to be a deft move in light of
Nomo's failings.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Fred Claire, responsible for putting this Dodger team
together, must be held at least partly accountable for its
pratfall, although Claire was kept under a severe monetary
restraint in recent years by the notoriously thrifty former Dodger
owner, Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   While a division rival like the Padres was going out and
spending money to get players like Kevin Brown, Ken Caminiti and
Greg Vaughn, Claire has had to operate under the handicap of being
forced to go after second-tier guys like Todd Zeile, Jose Vizcaino,
Eric Young, etc.
</P>
<P>
   And, in what was particularly humiliating to him, Claire wasn't
even consulted last month in perhaps the biggest transaction in
Dodger history.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it turns out Claire was vehemently opposed to that
staggering miscalculation pulled off by the neophyte Fox management
team when it put its baseball ignorance on public display for all
to ridicule by trading away the team's only marquee performer, Mike
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   It has been one of the hoariest maxims of professional athletics
since the Boston Red Sox got rid of Babe Ruth almost 80 years ago
that a team should never divest itself of a superstar who's in his
prime, but Messrs. Chernin and Carey were going to show the
baseball establishment how the big boys do it in the movie
business.
</P>
<P>
   Wow. They sure showed everybody!
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were struggling before they dispatched Piazza and
Zeile to the Florida Marlins for Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson,
Bobby Bonilla and Jim Eisnreich, none of whom has exactly stirred
Dodger fans to storm the turnstiles.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Dodgers are struggling even more without at least
the presence of the slugging Piazza to boost home attendance during
the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Fox worsened a bad situation with a trade it probably already is
embarrassed about---Piazza has been treated like a conquering hero
in New York---and now has detached Russell and Claire for I guess
therapeutic reasons.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt if Russell's successor, Glen Hoffman, can do much to
reverse the fortunes of a team that simply doesn't possess enough
talented players to exceed the .500 caliber baseball it's played
throughout this erratic Dodger season.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if Fox wanted to do something dramatic, it should have
stuck Tom Lasorda back into the dugout, where his charismatic
presence would have at least enlivened a moribund team and where he
has longed to be ever since he retired as manager in the middle of
the 1996 summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda also longed for Fred Claire's job, and it's the irony of
all ironies that he landed it on the day Claire's successor, Al
Campanis, a close friend of Lasorda, died.
</P>
<P>
   Claire took over for Campanis in April of 1987 after Peter
O'Malley fired Campanis for his racially insensitive remarks on
ABC's ``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire's greatest legacy will be the Dodgers' storybook 1988
season in which they shocked the New York Mets to win the National
League pennant and then did the same to the Oakland A's to win the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   It was Claire who brought in a fellow who would goad that team
to its destiny, Kirk Gibson, and Claire would win Executive of the
Year honors for his work.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers never again would reach such heights during
Claire's long incumbency, and it seemed in recent years Claire
never was able to get over that disastrous trade he made earlier
this decade with the Montreal Expos when he parted with a young
right-hander named Pedro Martinez for Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not all Fred Claire's fault, or Bill Russell's, that
the Dodgers have deteriorated into mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Such a plight became inevitable a few years back when Peter
O'Malley, unable or unwilling to battle teams like the Atlanta
Braves in pursuit of high-priced free agents, forced Claire to
conduct his business with one arm tied behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   The neophyte Fox team tried to undo the mess that O'Malley's
tight-fisted policies created, but only exacerbated the chaos with
the ouster of Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Now Tom Lasorda is back in power, trying to bring light into a
Dodger scene that has fallen into darkness.

   NEW YORK _ During his nearly two decades in Washington, Rep.
Charles Schumer has become one of the most unblushingly tenacious
fund-raisers in politics. He has built a roster of wealthy Wall
Streeters, courted and cajoled the faithful in Brooklyn, N.Y., and
beyond, and spent hours on the phone seeking donors with a
well-buffed sales pitch. Now his investment is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   In his race for the Senate, Schumer has raised more from
contributors than has any other challenger in the history of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He has collected well over $10 million, accumulating a treasury
that not only dwarfs those of the other candidates in New York's
Democratic primary, Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green, but also is
the second largest among all Senate candidates nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The only candidate who has taken in more is the man Schumer
wants to challenge, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, a virtuoso fund-raiser
who has collected more than $17 million for what is likely to be
one of the most expensive Senate contests ever.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for all their political disagreements, the two men
share a dogged style of fund raising and some of the same big
donors, particularly Wall Street executives. It is a similarity
that Schumer's primary opponents have tried to use against him.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has prospered even though he is less well-known, has
never before run a statewide race and occupies the kind of middling
position in Congress that has traditionally not commanded much
respect from moneyed interests. He has compensated by being
persistent and by relying on a network of supporters that he has
nurtured in his nearly two decades in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Since April alone, he has held about 20 fund-raisers, while
continuing his regular barrage of cold calls to potential
contributors, a regimen that many politicians would bemoan but he
doesn't seem to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very clear about what he is asking you to do and why he
is asking you to do it,'' said Robert E. Denham, whose steadfast
support for Schumer _ he and his wife, Carolyn, have given a total
of $7,000 since 1995 _ grew out of an unsolicited call from Schumer
a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Denham was the chairman of Salomon Inc. when the first call
came. He didn't know Schumer at the time but he agreed to meet him
for breakfast, and by the time they had finished, Schumer had not
only netted himself a wealthy supporter but also won a willing
guide to other deep pockets on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``You fund-raise by convincing people to believe in you and to
believe that you are going to make a difference,'' said Denham, who
stepped down as chairman of Salomon Inc. last year. ``He
communicates that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although campaign finance controversies roil Washington and
Schumer says he favors reducing the role of donations in campaigns,
the congressman is not shy about his bankroll, saying he must
stockpile money if he is to oust a well-financed incumbent like
D'Amato. He often asserts that nominating Ms. Ferraro or Green
would be disastrous for Democrats because neither would have the
money to compete with D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd call that a formula to lose,'' Schumer said in a telephone
interview last week from Texas, where he was on a fund-raising
trip. ``I believe that the day after the primary, D'Amato will do
what he has done in the past, which is unload, sort of launch a
blitzkrieg of ads, and I think that you have to be able to defend
yourself. And to point out D'Amato's foibles.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone appreciates Schumer's approach. He sometimes is not
deterred when people say they are supporting another candidate
after he asks them for a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, some of those people said Schumer's response was
not gracious. ``He began sort of challenging me,'' said one Ferraro
supporter, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
``There was no threat or anything like that, but I thought it was a
little unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   For all his money, Schumer has yet to shake up the Democratic
primary. In polls, he still trails Ms. Ferraro, who has raised far
less but may need to spend less because she has the more recognized
name.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other nonincumbents in the history of Congress have
rivaled Schumer in the financing of their campaigns, both of them
Senate candidates in California: Michael Huffington, who lost the
general election in 1994, and Darrell Issa, who lost the primary
this month. Huffington spent more than $28 million and Issa spent
$10 million, but most of their money came from personal funds, not
from contributors.

 NEW YORK: from contributors.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   As of March 31 of this year, Schumer had $8.2 million in the
bank after expenditures, Ms. Ferraro had $1.1 million and Green had
$800,000, according to disclosure records. D'Amato had $10.6
million after expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer attributed his fund-raising success to his record on
issues like gun control, abortion rights and Israel. He noted that
when he first met Denham, they strongly disagreed on free trade, a
demonstration, he said, that he was not pandering to Wall Street
executives to get their support. He pointed out that contributions
to his campaign since November 1996 have averaged only about $110.
He said he liked his fund-raisers to be small gatherings of 20 or
30 people, not the banquet-style events that many politicians
sponsor, because he enjoyed talking to everyone who showed up.
Schumer's aides would not allow a reporter to attend one of his
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who give to me, clearly not all, regard it
as a charitable act,'' Schumer said, ``as something they should do
for the good of their country.''
</P>
<P>
   His partisans are eager to rebut the idea that his candidacy
revolves around a hunt for money. They say his fund-raising success
stems from more than just his toiling on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   While Schumer's treasury will ensure that he can buy an arsenal
of television commercials, it may hinder him in attacking D'Amato's
fund-raising and ethics, should he win the nomination. D'Amato, the
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, has raised millions of
dollars for his Senate campaign and for the New York Republican
State Committee from donors with interests that bring the donors
before his panel.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has a far less important position as a senior member of
the Democratic minority on the House Banking Committee. Still, just
as D'Amato has backed proposals being pushed by some of his biggest
contributors, so too has Schumer, especially on issues involving
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   In the longstanding battle over legislation that would loosen
rules for mergers between banks, securities firms and insurance
companies, Schumer has usually sided with securities firms. Last
year, he was a sponsor of an amendment to the legislation that
would insure that a certain type of thrift institution that is
owned by several securities firms would not be subject to rigorous
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's donors include many prominent Wall Street executives.
Since 1993, Schumer has collected more than $1.4 million from
donors who also gave to D'Amato, including many Wall Street
executives, lawyers and real estate developers, according to
analysis of disclosure records.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 18 executives at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. contributed to
both candidates, giving a total of $19,250 to Schumer and $16,250
to D'Amato. But now, Schumer may find it harder to raise money from
strongholds like Wall Street because some donors are increasingly
worried about offending D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendously difficult situation,'' said a lobbyist
on securities issues, who spoke on condition that he not be
identified. The lobbyist has contributed to both candidates but is
now shunning Schumer. ``Chuck has been there on every single issue
for the securities industry,'' he said. ``But you have to go with
D'Amato. You don't have any choice about that.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   One key to Schumer's success has been his ability to stash away
contributions from his House campaigns. In 1996, he raised roughly
$3 million in his successful race against an unknown Republican who
collected less than $40,000. Schumer then transferred most of that
money to his Senate account.
</P>
<P>
   The transferred House money is not counted against the
contribution limits for this race, which are $2,000 for individuals
and $10,000 for political action committees. The move has
essentially allowed Schumer to raise far more than $2,000 from some
individuals for his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, since 1993, D'Amato has been able to raise a
maximum of $2,000 from each individual donor because as a Senator,
the limit applied for his entire six-year term. But until recently,
Schumer was raising funds as a House member, whose terms are two
years. So every two years, a new $2,000 limit applied, and many
donors gave $2,000 to Schumer in 1995-1996 and then another $2,000
in 1997-1998.
</P>
<P>
   This maneuver is legal, but Green, New York City's Public
Advocate, has contended that it violates the spirit of the campaign
laws. Green has also questioned how Schumer can back legislation _
including the campaign finance overhaul now under consideration in
the House _ intended to reduce the role of money in campaigns even
as he is so busy passing the hat. The criticism is part of an
effort by Green to portray Schumer's fund-raising as no different
than D'Amato's.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer brushed aside Green's charges. ``Mark Green is working
every bit as hard as I am to raise money from the same people I
am,'' Schumer said. ``I will make campaign finance reform one of my
major issues in the Senate. I have always believed in it strongly.
Until the system changes, you can't unilaterally disarm.''

VISITING U.S. AIDE PLEDGES HELP FOR JAKARTA'S ECONOMIC REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The United States pledged on Monday to
support Indonesia's economic reform efforts and said it was
prepared to provide economic and technological assistance to help
rescue the country's stalled economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The restoration of economic stability is an absolute top
priority,'' Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said after a
90-minute meeting with the Indonesian president, B.J. Habibie. He
did not elaborate on the amount or form of the economic and
technological assistance he mentioned on his one-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said he was ``encouraged'' by the reforms undertaken by
Habibie since he became head of state on May 21, after President
Suharto resigned under public pressure after 32 years in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We explained that what is most important is the action that
Indonesia takes,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   Habibie has promised to follow through with the measures
prescribed by the International Monetary Fund for its bailout
package.
</P>
<P>
   Summers' visit, his second this year, comes as the IMF is
reportedly nearing the end of its latest round of negotiations with
top government officials to resume aid payments from the rescue
package, which were halted after riots that left nearly 1,200
people dead in May. A second installment of $1 billion is expected
to be released in early July.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who was responsible for the delay in aid from the
IMF, to which the United States is a major contributor, Summers
said, ``The IMF makes its own decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's top economic official, Ginandjar Kartasasmita, has
acknowledged that the country's efforts to slow inflation,
stabilize food supplies and curb rising unemployment would fail
without foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stabilizing the economy is our responsibility, but we are
aware that without international help, our stabilization program
will not succeed,'' Ginandjar, coordinating minister for economics
and finance, told reporters after meeting with Summers later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia saw its economy shrink more than 6 percent in the
first quarter of this year, and the country's worst recession in
three decades has left almost one-sixth of the country's work force
of 90 million people unemployed. Annual inflation was officially
recorded at 52 percent in March, with some private analysts
predicting triple-digit inflation by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank said in a statement on Monday that it would
allocate funds to help the hungry and the sick and contribute to a
national education campaign to help keep children in school.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)

<P>
   Threats of further social unrest have led the government to
place heavily armed troops around shopping malls, hotels and other
strategic locations in the capital, where more than 4,000 shops and
buildings were looted or destroyed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations, mostly peaceful, continue in the capital. More
than 500 Muslim students demonstrated outside Parliament on Monday
to demand a reduction in basic commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   The country's powerful military has said it will uphold the
spirit of reform that has swept through campuses and resulted in
the removal of many restrictions on the press and labor unions, but
has warned that it will not tolerate any ``unconstitutional acts.''
Military officials did not elaborate.

VERDICT AGAINST TOBACCO COMPANY IS VOIDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida appeals court on Monday struck down a $750,000 jury
verdict against the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., ruling that
the lawsuit, one of the few a cigarette maker has ever lost to a
smoker, was filed six days too late.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 verdict was only one of two verdicts outstanding
against cigarette makers. Earlier this month, a Florida jury
ordered Brown &AMP; Williamson to pay $1 million, including $500,000 in
punitive damages, to the family of a deceased smoker.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, a three-judge panel of the state Court of Appeals
for the 1st Circuit found that the statute of limitations in the
1996 case had expired because the smoker, Grady Carter, had waited
too long to file his lawsuit in 1995, after discovering he had lung
disease in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Carter expressed disappointment over the ruling but said he was
not surprised. ``It is hard to beat the tobacco companies,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on tobacco litigation said that while they had not
reviewed the decision, it appeared largely limited to the specifics
of Carter's case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mary Aronson, the president of Aronson Washington
Research, which advises institutional investors on legal trends,
said the ruling was an emotional setback for plantiffs' lawyers in
smoking cases, after the optimism following last week's $1 million
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this throws a damp rag on the euphoria some
plaintiffs' lawyers were feeling,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rabin, a law professor at Stanford University said that
Monday's decision demonstrated that while the public perceives that
tobacco cases are decided on issues like possible corporate
misrepresentation they often are won by tobacco companies that hire
top defense lawyers who exploit legal issues like statutes of
limitations on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin said that Carter's lawyer could appeal the decision to the
Florida Supreme Court, but, failing that, his case was dead.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, officials of Brown &AMP; Williamson, based in
Louisville, Ky., said they were pleased with court's ruling. ``We
are gratified that the court of appeals has applied the law in this
case,'' said Tom Bezanson, company lawyer who argued its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Wilner, a lawyer in Tallahassee, who handled Carter's
claim, did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Wilner also represented the family of Roland Maddox, who won the
lawsuit earlier this month against Brown &AMP; Williamson, and has
filed about 200 lawsuits on behalf of individual smokers against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The jury verdict in the lawsuit brought by Maddox's family
marked the first time that a jury had award punitive damages in a
tobacco case. Brown &AMP; Williamson has said that it will appeal the
award and that Monday's ruling could aid them.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony, Carter, who had smoked Lucky Strikes and other
cigarettes for 44 years, said he became concerned about his health
when he began coughing and spitting up blood in late January 1991.
He consulted his doctor, who took X-rays on Feb. 4, 1991, and told
Carter that he had a spot on his lung that indicated several
diseases, including cancer. The next day, Carter saw a chest
specialist who performed a number of tests. On Feb. 14, Carter was
told he had lung cancer and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Brown and Williamson, a subsidiary of BAT Industries, asserted
that the statue of limitations in Carter's case began on Feb. 5,
when he was told that he had a disease that might be the result of
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court agreed and held that because Carter had waited
until Feb. 10, 1995, to file his claim Florida's four-year statute
of limitations had expired.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The panel also held that the trial judge had erred by allowing
an expert witness to testify that Brown &AMP; Williamson could have
inserted additional warnings about the risks of smoking inside
cigarette packages. But courts have typically found that a 1969
Federal law requiring a warning on the outside of cigarette
packages pre-empted any state statutes requiring more health
information.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also held that the trial judge should not have allowed
Wilner, the lawyer for Carter, to use a 1963 internal Brown &AMP;
Williamson memo that reflected communications between two company
lawyers, a category of documents normally protected from disclosure
by attorney-client privilege.

FORMER CHAMPIONS FIND REASSURANCE AT WIMBLEDON 
</HEADLINE>

 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Champions are nothing if not greedy. Just
ask Monica Seles, who has won nine Grand Slam events, but will not
retire a happy woman unless she manages to win Wimbledon once.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, and several other players lately fallen on troubled times
_ four-time and defending Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras,
seven-time champion Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi, who won his first
Slam title here in 1992 _ all ventured to this venerable tournament
like pilgrims to Lourdes, seeking restoration, reaffirmation,
regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   And all found at least a short-term cure Monday in the form of
straight-set victories that left them feeling a little more secure
about their long-term recoveries from what ails them.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, who has said that she is ``out to win the most Grand
Slams that I can,'' barged her way into this one with a 6-3, 6-4
subjugation of Maria Sanchez Lorenzo on an unsettled but rainless
opening day. And Graf actually burst into tears after coolly
blasting Gala Leon Garcia off Center Court, 6-4, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Graf said a performance like Monday's, in a place that moves her
like no other, gave her cause to hope that, at 29, she could still
make a difference in this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is a long way away, but it is my favorite tournament,
and I do feel it is my place, and experience does help,'' she said.
``A year ago I was basically lying in bed not able to do anything.
I don't take anything for granted anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi and Sampras shared Graf's brand of humility _ the kind
that comes with maturity born of disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can just get into the tournament, I'll start playing my
best tennis,'' vowed the 13th-seeded Agassi. ``I need to take it up
to a new level.'' He got to the second level of the seven-round
event by trouncing 83rd-ranked Alex Calatrava of Spain, 6-2, 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who fired 17 aces at Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia in his
methodical 6-3, 6-3, 6-3 victory, said: ``I don't know if it's
mental or what it is, but over the years, this place has just
brought out the best in me. Wimbledon is kind of a new start.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And they can all use one.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has not won a major title since collecting his 10th
career Grand Slam championship here a year ago, and he cannot help
overhearing the whispers about his missing motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Graf sat out last year's tournament because of knee surgery, and
seven weeks ago she was considering quitting because she was fed up
with her nagging leg injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi had not won a Wimbledon match since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Seles emerged from two years of emotional limbo just last month
in Paris, where she put on the emotional blinders and reached the
French Open final just two weeks after losing her father, Karolj,
to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   While those favorites advanced, the seventh-seeded Russian
Yevgeny Kafelnikov, whose title on grass at Halle, Germany, two
weeks ago seemed to bode well for a credible campaign here, tumbled
back into what he termed his ``crisis'' mode. Kafelnikov committed
22 double faults and tumbled out of contention with a 6-7 (5-7),
7-6 (7-1), 6-4, 6-2 loss to Mark Philippoussis and his 21 aces.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Pierce, who has yet to develop a fondness for Wimbledon or
its slippery lawns, became the first seeded player to depart. The
11th-seeded Pierce performed with increasing indifference once she
dropped the first set's tie breaker to 87th-ranked Elena Tatarkova
of the Ukraine, and the ensuing 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 defeat marked her
earliest Wimbledon exit.
</P>
<P>
   But Pierce was not the most celebrated player to vanish from the
women's side of the draw: that distinction went to 12th-seeded Anna
Kournikova, the 17-year-old Russian, whose tanned midriff was
featured on the front pages of several London newspapers Monday
morning but whose sore right thumb prompted her reluctant
withdrawal from her favorite Grand Slam event. It was here on
Center Court last year that she made the run to the semifinals that
proved she was a player, and not just a poser. ``I was for a whole
year thinking about coming back here again,'' she said. ``It's a
tough decision to make, to withdraw.''

LAWYER FOR MEGGETT SAYS SEX ASSAULT CHARGE IS DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sexual assault charges against former New England Patriots
player David Meggett have been dropped, but the running back still
faces robbery charges stemming from a February incident in a
Toronto hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett, who the Patriots released last month, had been charged
with attacking a 33-year-old woman when she refused to continue
having sex with him after the condom he was using broke. An angry
Meggett then allegedly reclaimed from her coat pocket a roll of $20
bills he had given her in exchange for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual assault charges also have been dropped against Steve
Brannon, a former Patriots practice squad player and an
acquaintance of the unidentified woman, who was in the hotel room
with Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett's lawyer Alan Gold Monday said prosecutor James Atkinson
of the Crown Attorney's Office in Toronto moved to dismiss the
charges Friday in the Provincial Court. Gold said he persuaded
prosecutors in Toronto that there was insufficient evidence to
justify the sexual assault complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's leave it at that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett, who was not in court on Friday, faced up to 10 years on
the sexual assault charge. Gold said he and the prosecutor are due
back in court on July 20 to set a trial date on the theft with
violence charge. Meggett could be sentenced to 20 years in prison,
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   If Meggett wishes, Gold said he will push for a trial prior to
the start of the next National Football League season. Meggett is
unsigned by any NFL team, although the New York Jets and
Jacksonville Jaguars have expressed some interest in the
31-year-old veteran player.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots spokesman Don Lowry said that despite the finding,
there are no plans to bring Meggett back to the team. At the time
of his release, Meggett had three years remaining on his contract
for $1 million a year. ``The release was final,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Gold, none of the parties involved in the case could
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly after the incident, the 33-year-old
Toronto woman said she had met Meggett for the first time on Feb.
27 in his room at the Royal York Hotel, a luxury hotel in downtown
Toroto.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the woman said, she and Brannon first had protected
intercourse, using a condom she had with her.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while the two were engaged in sexual intercourse again,
Meggett entered the suite and placed a roll of money on the table
and participated.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Meggett's condom broke, and she told him not to
continue unprotected. ``I am thinking I can get pregnant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally pushed him (Meggett) off,'' she said, ``and I saw
there was no condom there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all trying to justify it by saying because they were
in the league, you know, the football league, and they get tested
(for disease).
</P>
<P>
   Later, she said, Meggett became angry and slapped her four
times.
</P>
<P>
   He took back the roll of money, she said, saying she didn't
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   She left the suite at the Royal York Hotel and was sobbing
against a wall when a group of guests approached her and phoned
police, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett and Brannon were arrested at the hotel later that
morning. Meggett has been free on $7,500 bail and Brannon on
$2,500.

GLORIA F. ROSS, 74, TAPESTRY DESIGNER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gloria F. Ross, a widely known tapestry maker who
brought painters and weavers together to create contemporary wall
hangings, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She
was 74 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, her son Clifford A. Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Translating paint into wool, as she put it, Ms. Ross worked with
Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, Jean Dubuffet, Frank Stella,
Jack Youngerman, Romare Bearden, and more than two dozen other
artists to make tapestries of their paintings. The actual weaving
was done by professionals in Felletin, a small French town near
Aubusson, and at the Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh, although Ms.
Ross played a hands-on role in the process.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, realizing that the chevrons and targets of
Kenneth Noland's paintings were a perfect match for the Navajo loom
and color range, Ms. Ross developed a series designed by Noland and
hand-woven by Navajo weavers in Arizona and New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Her tapestries were collected by individuals, corporations, and
museums. Work by Motherwell and Helen Frankenthaler rendered as
tapestries, for example, hangs in the entrance to the Philadelphia
Convention Center, and museums owning Ross tapestries include the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in
Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Textile Museum in
Washington, and the Denver Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, although retired from professional work, Ms. Ross was
active in the production of an ark curtain designed by Mark Podwol
for Temple Emanu-El in New York. That year she also founded the
Gloria F. Ross Center for Tapestry Studies in Tucson, Ariz., a
nonprofit research institute and educational foundation. The center
grew from her belief in tapestry as ``a vital contemporary art form
with rich historical connections,'' said Dr. Ann Lane Hedlund,
chairman of its board. The center sponsors public lectures,
workshops, research projects and exhibitions devoted to tapestries,
from prehistory to the present.
</P>
<P>
   During her travels in the Southwest, Ms. Ross collected Navajo
rugs and other textiles of native design, which she donated to the
Denver Art Museum. An exhibition of them organized by the museum
and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts toured the
country from 1992 to 1997, ending at the National Museum of the
American Indian in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on Sept. 5, 1923, Ms. Ross was the daughter of
Justice Alfred Frankenthaler of the New York State Supreme Court
and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. She graduated from Mount
Holyoke College in 1943. Her first marriage, to Arthur Ross, ended
in divorce in 1970. In 1975, she married Dr. John Bookman, a
nutrition and diabetes specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He
died in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ross served on the Mount Holyoke College board of trustees
from 1986 to 1991, and on the advisory board of the college's art
museum from 1975 on. Since 1991 she had been an active trustee of
the Textile Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her son Clifford, she is survived by another son, Alfred
F. Ross, of New York City; a daughter, Beverly Ross; two sisters,
Marjorie Iseman and Helen Frankenthaler, the artist, both of New
York; a stepdaughter, Ann Bookman of Brookline, Mass.; a stepson,
Richard Bookman of Coral Gables, Fla.; two grandchildren; four
step-grandchildren; and her companion, Henry Kohn, also of New
York.

In planning a run against Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, Rep. Charles
Schumer has raised more from contributors than has any other
challenger in the history of Congress, collecting well over $10
million. ``I believe that the day after the primary, D'Amato will
do what he has done in the past, which is unload, sort of launch a
blitzkrieg of ads, and I think that you have to be able to defend
yourself,'' says Schumer. ``And to point out D'Amato's foibles.''

SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT TOP FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's even worse than we had imagined. Like most serious
aficionados of cinematic art, I was shocked and appalled that the
American Film Institute's list of the Top 100 films did not include
that sweeping saga of love, war and a man who turns into a fish,
``The Incredible Mr. Limpet.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture stars Don Knotts, the slightest heavyweight ever to
grace the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Our family saw it at the Green Garden Drive-In, an expansive
``V'' carved into the low woods of western Pennsylvania and shared
most summer evenings by unequal numbers of moviegoers and
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   I was 9 when ``Limpet'' came out. Like most boys my age, I
pictured myself as Kirk Douglas in ``Spartacus.'' Until I looked in
a mirror, and saw Don Knotts.
</P>
<P>
   Limpet was a dreamer.
</P>
<P>
   By determination alone he was able to transform himself into
something bigger, better and more glorious than anyone expected.
The movie's enlightened themes, its unrestrained enthusiasm, its
sense of hope and grandeur set my young mind soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or it was the entire can of insect repellent I'd
sprayed on myself at the drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I never forgot the film.
</P>
<P>
   I figured if Don Knotts could be metamorphosed into a big
cartoon carp, then I could become something just as good.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday I will. &QL; 
A gross injustice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I can point out the gross injustice done to
``Limpet'' by the American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the movie not included in the Top 100, it wasn't
included in the Top 400 from which the best were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   And neither were any of the Tarzan movies, among them ``Tarzan
and his Mate,'' which in its fully restored video version has a
fully naked Jane stand-in swimming in a
fish-tank-supposed-to-be-a-lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Tarzan's New York Adventure,'' in which Cheetah rides on
top of a cab while Tarzan dives off the Brooklyn Bridge, then gets
a herd of circus elephants to rescue Boy by saying ``Timba, timba,
magoolie, umgawa!'' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   (Tarzan began using this phrase as a child, while living with
apes. By repeating the words he found he could get the apes _ or
any other creature _ to do whatever he wanted, provided he promised
to stop saying it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 1,500 leaders from the American film community''
picked the films, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   I find this difficult to believe. If that were so, the
``leaders'' would have ditched ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid'' (No. 50) and replaced it with the greatest buddy film of all
time _ ``The Man Who Would Be King.''
</P>
<P>
   They would have moved No. 85, ``Duck Soup,'' way up, and
included ``A Day at the Circus,'' in which Groucho sings ``Lydia,
the Tattooed Lady'':
</P>
<P>
   ``When her muscles start relaxin'/ Up the hill comes Andrew
Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Freshman'' belongs on the list as the only American film
to feature an enormous Marlon Brando ice skating to Tony Bennett.
``The Black Stallion'' should be included for having the best end
credits of all time. ``Captain Blood'' _ Errol Flynn, Basil
Rathbone. Enough said. And something, anything, with Liv Ullmann. &QL; 
LIST IS PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   We see movies in crowded theaters but it's an individual
experience.
</P>
<P>
   When we see them, and where, and with whom, determine _ as much
as what's on the screen _ if a film makes our personal Top 100
list.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, I believe the selections of the 1,500 film community
experts need to be re-evaluated. I recognize that, to the American
film industry, I'm more a fish out of water than a Limpet. But I
believe in this instance the thoughtful suggestions of a
knowledgeable man can and will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way:
</P>
<P>
   Timba, timba, magoolie, umgawa! Timba, timba, magoolie, umgawa!

DESPITE COMMUNIST PARTY RIGIDITY, PERSONAL FREEDOM GROWS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 15th graf starting: Members of the, etc., to insert new
material) (ps) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ At a kitchen table strewn with glossy fashion
magazines, Lucy Lu sat with her boyfriend Tony Yao and talked about
what it is like to live together without being married, an
arrangement rarely allowed in China until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to bug me about it, but nobody else seems to
care,'' said Ms. Lu, a 26-year-old real estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we pay the rent,'' Yao cut in, laughing. ``A few
years ago the landlord here would not let a couple like us live
here, at any price. Today, he just wants to collect the rent.''
</P>
<P>
   More than being a symbol of sexual revolution, this young couple
is a signal of a growing realm of personal freedom in China, where
ordinary people now make choices about travel, work, study and love
with less government interference than at any time in the nearly 50
years since the People's Republic was established.
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton arriving in China on Thursday, critics of
the administration's policy of engagement point to the lack of
political freedom in a country still governed by the Communist
Party that keeps it a place where political persecution, censorship
and a secretive and authoritarian leadership are as entrenched as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Only the public side of life, however, remains so tightly
restricted in China. The private side of life here is quite
different, as Clinton would see if he could shed his 1,000-member
entourage long enough to talk to some ordinary folk. The issues
that most people care about most _ choosing a job, a place to live,
a mate _ have gained a degree of flexibility that few could have
imagined 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to accentuate the positive side of Clinton's engagement
policy, administration officials like to argue that U.S.
cooperation with China can help promote the growing sense of
personal freedom in Chinese society.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the changes now under way in China are so deep and
wide that it is hard to see how U.S. policy can significantly
affect them one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``China will find its own way forward, as it always has,'' said
Alex Hao, an advertising executive who studied in the United States
for five years before returning to China in 1993. ``Americans
always think they can change every place. You can't change China as
fast as it is changing by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of China's recent history is
how the nation's social and economic change have sped ahead so
fast, while the political system has remained rigid. These
diverging tracks create new strains for anyone who tries to
straddle the two, yet for now most Chinese people seem content to
stay on the path that lets their incomes and personal lives
flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Relinquishing control over aspects of ordinary life has not come
from any benevolent plan by the authorities. Instead, as China has
developed economically, with an ever-more-mobile populace, it has
simply become more difficult for the authorities to monitor and
control the lives of ordinary people.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not long ago, every lane in Shanghai was subject to the watchful
eye of a neighborhood committee, a local organization typically
staffed by retired women who kept track of every resident and
reported to the local police or Communist Party organization
anything unusual, like a young unmarried couple living together.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, every work place in the vast state-run apparatus of
companies, offices and organizations had its own Communist Party
organization to keep track of anyone who seemed to stray from the
preferred path, in personal or professional matters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in recent years, each of these avenues of control has begun
to melt away. Modern phenomena, like tall apartment buildings and
private companies, make it harder for the authorities to control
the lives of ordinary individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the urban elite with money to spend clearly have
gained the greatest amount of personal freedom, with an array of
new choices. In ways large and small, Chinese are less likely to
look over their shoulder before, say, kissing in public or keeping
large sums of money in a bank. Growing personal freedom has also
touched groups who are not in the mainstream of Chinese society,
including gays, for example, who now enjoy greater tolerance, at
least in urban areas. Yet increased personal freedom is not limited
to city folk.
</P>
<P>
   In rural China, where the vast majority of China's 1.2 billion
people live, old restrictions on movement from one area to another
have melted away in recent years. As a result, well over 100
million people now migrate to work outside their home area, mostly
as unskilled laborers doing construction and housework.
</P>
<P>
   Su Xiaoli remembers her own days in the countryside, where she
spent five years planting rice as a teen-ager in the 1970s, having
followed orders to move there from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no choice at all at that time,'' mused Ms. Su, 42, now
the deputy manager of a company that makes revolving doors. ``Now
it's the other extreme. My son is 16, and the choices facing him
are astounding to me. He says it's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Through her own eyes, Ms. Su has watched the tentacles of
government control relax year by year, gradually granting her the
freedom to change jobs, change apartments and travel overseas. She
has done each in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   At a previous job in the telephone bureau, Ms. Su said, one
entire day of each work week was set aside for a political
meetings, where the current political line from Beijing was
supposed to be discussed. In practice, she recalled, that usually
meant that a leader in her department would simply read sections of
People's Daily aloud.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, by her own description, Ms. Su was relatively
powerful. In an era of scarce telephones, she got to decide who got
a telephone line in their home, and she laughingly admits that she
often took gifts and favors just to do her job. But as privileged
as she was, she chafed against all the limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sat around and did nothing, life was simple,'' Ms. Su
said. ``If you wanted to get a plane ticket or some gasoline for a
car, it was an ordeal of paperwork. Trying to change jobs was a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Su can buy a plane ticket, book a hotel room or buy a
car without any special permission or interference from the
authorities. When she quit the telephone bureau to take her new job
in 1995, she did not need anyone's permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even my husband could stop me,'' she said, laughing again.

challenger in the history of Congress, collecting well over $10
million. ``I believe that the day after the primary, D'Amato will
do what he has done in the past, which is unload, sort of launch a
blitzkrieg of ads, and I think that you have to be able to defend
yourself,'' says Schumer. ``And to point out D'Amato's foibles.''

SOMETHING FISHY ABOUT TOP FILMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's even worse than we had imagined. Like most serious
aficionados of cinematic art, I was shocked and appalled that the
American Film Institute's list of the Top 100 films did not include
that sweeping saga of love, war and a man who turns into a fish,
``The Incredible Mr. Limpet.''
</P>
<P>
   The picture stars Don Knotts, the slightest heavyweight ever to
grace the silver screen.
</P>
<P>
   Our family saw it at the Green Garden Drive-In, an expansive
``V'' carved into the low woods of western Pennsylvania and shared
most summer evenings by unequal numbers of moviegoers and
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   I was 9 when ``Limpet'' came out. Like most boys my age, I
pictured myself as Kirk Douglas in ``Spartacus.'' Until I looked in
a mirror, and saw Don Knotts.
</P>
<P>
   Limpet was a dreamer.
</P>
<P>
   By determination alone he was able to transform himself into
something bigger, better and more glorious than anyone expected.
The movie's enlightened themes, its unrestrained enthusiasm, its
sense of hope and grandeur set my young mind soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Either that, or it was the entire can of insect repellent I'd
sprayed on myself at the drive-in.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I never forgot the film.
</P>
<P>
   I figured if Don Knotts could be metamorphosed into a big
cartoon carp, then I could become something just as good.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe someday I will. &QL; 
A gross injustice &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, I can point out the gross injustice done to
``Limpet'' by the American Film Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was the movie not included in the Top 100, it wasn't
included in the Top 400 from which the best were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   And neither were any of the Tarzan movies, among them ``Tarzan
and his Mate,'' which in its fully restored video version has a
fully naked Jane stand-in swimming in a
fish-tank-supposed-to-be-a-lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Or, ``Tarzan's New York Adventure,'' in which Cheetah rides on
top of a cab while Tarzan dives off the Brooklyn Bridge, then gets
a herd of circus elephants to rescue Boy by saying ``Timba, timba,
magoolie, umgawa!'' over and over.
</P>
<P>
   (Tarzan began using this phrase as a child, while living with
apes. By repeating the words he found he could get the apes _ or
any other creature _ to do whatever he wanted, provided he promised
to stop saying it.)
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 1,500 leaders from the American film community''
picked the films, according to the institute.
</P>
<P>
   I find this difficult to believe. If that were so, the
``leaders'' would have ditched ``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance
Kid'' (No. 50) and replaced it with the greatest buddy film of all
time _ ``The Man Who Would Be King.''
</P>
<P>
   They would have moved No. 85, ``Duck Soup,'' way up, and
included ``A Day at the Circus,'' in which Groucho sings ``Lydia,
the Tattooed Lady'':
</P>
<P>
   ``When her muscles start relaxin'/ Up the hill comes Andrew
Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Freshman'' belongs on the list as the only American film
to feature an enormous Marlon Brando ice skating to Tony Bennett.
``The Black Stallion'' should be included for having the best end
credits of all time. ``Captain Blood'' _ Errol Flynn, Basil
Rathbone. Enough said. And something, anything, with Liv Ullmann. &QL; 
LIST IS PERSONAL
</P>
<P>
   We see movies in crowded theaters but it's an individual
experience.
</P>
<P>
   When we see them, and where, and with whom, determine _ as much
as what's on the screen _ if a film makes our personal Top 100
list.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, I believe the selections of the 1,500 film community
experts need to be re-evaluated. I recognize that, to the American
film industry, I'm more a fish out of water than a Limpet. But I
believe in this instance the thoughtful suggestions of a
knowledgeable man can and will be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Or, to put it another way:

 Free-Speech Victory in Internet Case   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Online free-speech advocates scored a major legal victory yesterday
when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Internet service providers
are not liable for defamatory material that appears on their
systems.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without comment, the nation's high court let stand a federal
appeals court decision which determined that the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 shields providers against legal attack for libelous or
obscene material they distribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision encourages full and robust speech on the
Internet,'' a relieved AOL general counsel George Vradenburg told
The Chronicle. ``If the phone company were responsible for
filtering the content of every call that contained comments that
were libelous, pornographic or hate-filled, voice traffic would
grind to a halt. And so would correspondence on the Internet _ if
we had lost this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The court justices denied an appeal by Kenneth Zeran, a Seattle
artist and filmmaker, who sued AOL in 1996 for defamation after
being the victim of a wide-scale cyberhoax.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the bombing of the federal building in
Oklahoma City in 1995, an unknown user posted a message on an AOL
message board that advertised ``Naughty Oklahoma T-Shirts.''
Prospective customers were instructed to call ``Ken'' at Zeran's
home phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several days, similar messages were posted on AOL
message boards, prompting a tidal wave of abusive phone calls and
eventually the wrath of an Oklahoma City radio station announcer,
who encouraged listeners to call Zeran's home.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail was exposed as a ruse a few weeks later. The
perpetrator is still unknown. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Zeran sued AOL in 1996, insisting the company had a duty to
remove the defamatory posting immediately, tell its members that
the message was untrue and screen future defamatory material. He
said AOL removed the fake ad, but refused to post a retraction as a
matter of company policy.
</P>
<P>
   After a federal judge in Virginia and then a federal appeals
court ruled in favor of AOL, Zeran appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court. He said his case presented the court ``with the first
opportunity to interpret the limits of immunity granted online
service providers'' by the 2-year-old Telecom Act.
</P>
<P>
   Internet service providers have keenly followed the Zeran case
as a signpost of their responsibility for material posted on their
services.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been a spate of libel cases ensnaring
Internet companies as third parties, &UR;  &LR; this is the first to involve
the country's high court.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge Incident
</P>
<P>
   In April, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman dismissed AOL as
a defendant in a White House adviser's $30 million defamation suit.
Sidney Blumenthal and his wife, Jacqueline, sued AOL and
self-styled ``Internet informer'' Matt Drudge over an inaccurate
online report in August that said Blumenthal had a ``spousal abuse
past.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL pays Drudge, who unearthed the Monica Lewisky scandal,
$3,000 a month to distribute his column.
</P>
<P>
   However, Friedman ruled that Drudge himself is still potentially
liable and must defend the lawsuit in Washington, D.C., rather than
in California where he is based. Blumenthal sued the columnist even
though Drudge retracted the story and apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling, however, erases any doubts
about an Internet service provider's culpability and treats them
more like phone companies than the Fourth Estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is better off if we don't treat ISPs as publishers.
They are common carriers,'' said Tom Leonard, a University of
California at Berkeley journalism professor. ``Once you try to
regulate content online, you're heading down a dangerous road.''
</P>
<P>
   Providers are ``thrilled with the ruling,'' said Deb Howard,
president of ISP Consortium, a Minneapolis organization that
represents 220 small- to mid-sized providers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that ISPs should not be held responsible
for their customers' posting,'' Howard said. ``Don't shoot the
medium, go after the person with the message. We can't be the
thought police and we certainly aren't the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Russo, a computer law attorney in Palo Alto, said the
decision ``gives the Internet freer rein in what people can say
than the traditional media. It doesn't put any control on what
people say online.
</P>
<P>
   ``ISPs are passive carriers,'' Russo said. ``It is very hard for
them to police their environments.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if you're AOL.
</P>
<P>
   AOL, a Mammoth Operation
</P>
<P>
   The world's most popular online service has little control over
what its 12 million subscribers say online: It processes 30 million
pieces of e-mail a day and oversees 19,000 chat rooms. AOL's
Instant Messenger Service, which lets Web users chat and send
instant messages to one another, &UR;  &LR; is available to more than 80
million Web users.
</P>
<P>
   AOL monitors language on its chat rooms under a terms of service
agreement that prohibits vulgarity, obscenity and threatening
messages from its users. The policy, like Netcom's and others, is
intended to maintain a community standard. Violators of the
so-called TOS face expulsion from the online service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to set a standard somewhere between a phone company
and the press: We're not AT&AMP;T and we're not ABC,'' AOL's Vradenburg
said.
</P>
<P>
   A Netcom spokeswoman said the San Jose ISP does not believe in
monitoring its customers' online conversations, but it will not
hesitate to eject subscribers who frequently use offensive language
under its terms of service agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't sacrifice the rights of the many for the stupidity of
the few,'' said ISP Consortium's Howard.
</P>
<P>
   She empathizes with Zeran, she said, but believes he chose the
wrong party to sue. ``Hash out your problems with the other person
and, if you have to, contact the local authorities. To implicate
the carrier is not the point.''

LEWINSKY'S LAWYERS TO TURN OVER RECORDS OF BOOK PURCHASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: in 4th graf, name ``Kramerbooks &AMP; afterwords'' is cq with a
lower case word.) 
 (fb) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawyers for Monica Lewinsky have reached an
agreement with prosecutors to provide records from a bookstore of
several of Lewinsky's purchases, lawyers and a co-owner of the
bookstore said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was a small step in the larger and more significant
negotiations between Lewinsky's lawyers and the prosecutors over
whether the former White House intern should be granted immunity
from prosecution in exchange for her cooperation in the
investigation of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides remain far apart in those discussions, although
lawyers in both camps said Monday that the talks were still in the
preliminary stages.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the bookstore deal, the bookstore _ Kramerbooks &AMP;
afterwords _ agreed to turn over to Lewinsky records of her book
purchases, and she will then turn them over to the independent
counsel. Prosecutors have long been interested in those purchases
because Lewinsky's lawyers have acknowledged that she and Clinton
exchanged books as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   But the bookstore, with the support of the industry and the
American Civil Liberties Union, had fought the subpoena, contending
that it violated Lewinsky's First Amendment rights and right of
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a federal judge ordered Kramerbooks to turn over
business records describing some of Lewinsky's book purchases. The
judge also ruled that another bookstore, Barnes &AMP; Noble, did not
have to turn over any material because it did not have any relevant
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the arrangement that we helped to broker, she can now
voluntarily provide what information she wants to the independent
counsel,'' said Bill Kramer, a co-owner of the bookstore, obviously
happy to have sidestepped a subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement was the first sign that Lewinsky's new lawyers
and prosecutors in the office of Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel, are capable of reaching agreements, although their broader
talks involving immunity remained far from resolution, lawyers
involved in the negotiations said.
</P>
<P>
   The immunity negotiations were rekindled this month when
Lewinsky changed lawyers, dropping the flamboyant California
counsel, William H. Ginsburg, for two experienced Washington
criminal lawyers, Plato Cacheris and Jacob A. Stein.
</P>
<P>
   But in the opening round of discussions with the independent
prosecutor, Cacheris and Stein were said to have provided fewer
details about the roles played by Clinton and his close friend,
Vernon E. Jordan Jr., than Ginsburg had offered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Jordan and Lewinsky are the focus of an investigation
that is examining whether anyone lied, obstructed justice or
tampered with witnesses in the sexual harassment lawsuit brought by
Paula Jones against Clinton. Lewinsky and Clinton have both denied
under oath in that case that they had a sexual relationship. But
from the outset of the investigation, Lewinsky has offered to
testify, in exchange for immunity, that she did have such a
relationship, lawyers involved in the inquiry have said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lawyers in both camps disputed the account of several
published reports last weekend that the independent counsel had
been insisting on an agreement that included a confession by
Lewinsky that she had committed a crime.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers said the two sides were still far apart on
several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's lawyers have not provided details about a three-page
``talking points'' memo that Lewinsky handed Linda Tripp, a former
colleague at the Pentagon, that coached Tripp about what to say in
the Jones lawsuit. The memo is one of the most important pieces of
evidence to emerge in the inquiry, although investigators remain
puzzled about its origins.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides also appear to be at some distance over Starr's
demand that Lewinsky be interviewed by investigators prior to any
deal.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   This week promises to be a busy one on several fronts for the
independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the negotiations with Lewinsky's lawyers,
prosecutors have signaled their intention to call two White House
aides, John Podesta and Sidney Blumenthal, back to the grand jury.
Podesta helped arrange for a job interview for Lewinsky with
Ambassador Bill Richardson, the representative to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   And Blumenthal had previously refused to answer some questions
posed by the prosecutors on the ground that they were protected by
executive privilege. Clinton recently dropped that claim during an
appeal of a judge's ruling that the privilege was outweighed by the
needs of the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers representing the Clinton administration and the
independent counsel's office are also set to argue soon in two
federal appeals court cases, on Friday and Monday, over the issue
of whether the administration can limit the testimony of Bruce
Lindsey, a top White House lawyer, and Secret Service officials, on
the ground that they are protected by privileges.

blitzkrieg of ads, and I think that you have to be able to defend
yourself,'' says Schumer. ``And to point out D'Amato's foibles.''

 Windows 98 Upgrade Just Windows Dressing   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Windows 98 proves a main contention of Microsoft's most vocal
critics: Take away competition, and innovation also disappears.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How else can you explain this uninspiring ``upgrade'' to Windows
95, which goes on sale Thursday?
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 contains few improvements over Windows 95, the
operating system that runs most of the personal computers in the
universe. And none of the improvements are earthshaking enough to
make anyone run out and pay $89 for it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is not as bad as Apple, whose wheezing Macintosh
operating system is looking for a major overhaul 14 years after its
introduction. But you'd think the world's largest software company
could come up with something exciting in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has made no secret of its plan to combine Windows with
Windows NT, the version of the operating system used in corporate
networks. That will take place sometime next year. So Windows 98 is
really just a placeholder, something Microsoft hopes will keep
sales up in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   As of this week, most new PCs will come with Windows 98. The
real question is whether individuals who already own PCs should buy
the upgrade, which includes the latest version of Microsoft's
Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The answer: If your Windows 95 system is doing the job for you,
if your printer and modem and other peripherals work properly and
if your Internet setup is satisfactory, don't bother with Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you already may have some of the advantages claimed by
Windows 98, and you can get others for free:
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft's free Web browser, Internet Explorer 4.0, includes
the Active Desktop that comes with Windows 98. This feature lets
you single-click your way around and makes folders look like Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   _Windows 98 comes with DirectX technology that improves the
performance of 3-D video games. But most high-performance games
also come with DirectX, which you can install at the same time you
install the game.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 does have a few genuine goodies. It launches
applications a little faster than its predecessor. And it's also
faster at shutting down your system.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, it has built-in support for DVD drives and USB ports,
which let you plug in printers, scanners and such and use them
without first having to configure them.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 is easier than Windows 95 to set up the first time
you use it. The program automatically configures printers, monitors
and other peripherals. On the down side, it can take up to an hour
to install the program.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also makes it easier to get on the Web, with an
Internet Connection Wizard that recommends an Internet service
provider in your area and guides you through the process of signing
up.
</P>
<P>
   Other small benefits: There's a ``Maintenance Wizard'' for
keeping your PC fine-tuned, trouble-shooting wizards for when
things go wrong, and a feature for automatically going online and
updating Windows when Microsoft comes up with improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, however, is that Windows 98 looks almost
identical to Windows 95, and the average person might not be able
to tell the difference at all.

 A Low-Key Launch for Windows 98   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Microsoft officially will introduce Windows 98 in San Francisco on
Thursday, but the event will be a watered-down version of the
flamboyant launch of Windows 95.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analysts estimate that Microsoft will spend only $10 million to
promote Windows 98, a pittance compared to the $100 million-plus it
spent on the Windows 95 debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 95 launch was a day-long event emceed by Jay Leno
from Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Wash and broadcast all
over the world. Microsoft projected the Windows 95 logo onto the
Empire State Building and persuaded computer stores across the
country to open at midnight. It sold a million copies the first
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows 98 launch _ which has the theme ``Route 98: Another
Milestone on the computing highway'' _ will be held Thursday
afternoon at Fort Mason Center in San Francisco. Microsoft CEO Bill
Gates will speak to between 500 and 1,000 journalists, analysts and
technology executives before they adjourn for some computer
demonstrations and a buffet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Windows 95 was a unique experience,'' said Kim Akers, Windows
98 project manager at Microsoft. ``Windows 98 is very different and
the timing is very different.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for Microsoft's low-key approach to
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   _ Windows 98 is an upgrade rather than a revolutionary new
operating system like Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft is pitching Windows 98 to a smaller audience than
Windows 95, which was aimed at consumers and businesses. Microsoft
is only pursuing home and small business users with Windows 98. It
is encouraging corporate clients to switch from Windows 95 to
Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   _ Windows 98 is the subject of a lawsuit by the Justice
Department and 20 states.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the suit, Microsoft doesn't want to call excessive
attention to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the suit, it doesn't need to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research showed that awareness of Windows 98 is very high
_ after all, it's definitely been in the news a lot,'' said Akers,
the Windows 98 product manager.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's ads will tout specific features of Windows 98 _ such
as better game graphics or fewer computer crashes _ along with the
tagline ``Works better. Plays better.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads will appear in mainstream magazines like The New Yorker,
Bon Appetit and Time, but will not show up in computer trade
magazines as Windows 95 ads did.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is also skipping television advertisements this time
around _ but it does plan to blanket the Web with online ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just not going to be anywhere near as major,'' a media
splash as Windows 95, said Rob Enderle, analyst at Giga Information
Group in Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   In the week following the Windows 95 launch, one survey showed
that the new software was featured in nearly as many TV news
stories as the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as many stories have been written about Microsoft's
battle with the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors contend that Microsoft is illegally using
its monopoly in operating systems to muscle its way into the
Internet market. Windows 98 is a central piece of the case because
it integrates Microsoft's Web browser software into the operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust enforcers are demanding that Microsoft remove its
Internet software from Windows 98 or add a competing program from
Netscape Communications. Microsoft argues that the Internet browser
is an integral part of Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is set to begin September 8 in District Court in
Washington D.C. Until the judge rules on the case, Windows 98 will
be available in stores.

LAWYER FOR MEGGETT SAYS SEX ASSAULT CHARGE IS DROPPED

<P>
   Sexual assault charges against former New England Patriots
player David Meggett have been dropped, but the running back still
faces robbery charges stemming from a February incident in a
Toronto hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett, who the Patriots released last month, had been charged
with attacking a 33-year-old woman when she refused to continue
having sex with him after the condom he was using broke. An angry
Meggett then allegedly reclaimed from her coat pocket a roll of $20
bills he had given her in exchange for sex.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual assault charges also have been dropped against Steve
Brannon, a former Patriots practice squad player and an
acquaintance of the unidentified woman, who was in the hotel room
with Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett's lawyer Alan Gold Monday said prosecutor James Atkinson
of the Crown Attorney's Office in Toronto moved to dismiss the
charges Friday in the Provincial Court. Gold said he persuaded
prosecutors in Toronto that there was insufficient evidence to
justify the sexual assault complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's leave it at that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett, who was not in court on Friday, faced up to 10 years on
the sexual assault charge. Gold said he and the prosecutor are due
back in court on July 20 to set a trial date on the theft with
violence charge. Meggett could be sentenced to 20 years in prison,
if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   If Meggett wishes, Gold said he will push for a trial prior to
the start of the next National Football League season. Meggett is
unsigned by any NFL team, although the New York Jets and
Jacksonville Jaguars have expressed some interest in the
31-year-old veteran player.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots spokesman Don Lowry said that despite the finding,
there are no plans to bring Meggett back to the team. At the time
of his release, Meggett had three years remaining on his contract
for $1 million a year. ``The release was final,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than Gold, none of the parties involved in the case could
be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly after the incident, the 33-year-old
Toronto woman said she had met Meggett for the first time on Feb.
27 in his room at the Royal York Hotel, a luxury hotel in downtown
Toroto.
</P>
<P>
   That night, the woman said, she and Brannon first had protected
intercourse, using a condom she had with her.
</P>
<P>
   Later, while the two were engaged in sexual intercourse again,
Meggett entered the suite and placed a roll of money on the table
and participated.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Meggett's condom broke, and she told him not to
continue unprotected. ``I am thinking I can get pregnant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally pushed him (Meggett) off,'' she said, ``and I saw
there was no condom there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all trying to justify it by saying because they were
in the league, you know, the football league, and they get tested
(for disease).
</P>
<P>
   Later, she said, Meggett became angry and slapped her four
times.
</P>
<P>
   He took back the roll of money, she said, saying she didn't
deserve it.
</P>
<P>
   She left the suite at the Royal York Hotel and was sobbing
against a wall when a group of guests approached her and phoned
police, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett and Brannon were arrested at the hotel later that
morning. Meggett has been free on $7,500 bail and Brannon on
$2,500.

`YOU NEVER CAN TELL': SHAW, IN GENTLE MOOD, RELAXES AT THE BEACH

 By WILBORN HAMPTON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeing Shaw's ``You Never Can Tell'' is a little like
sitting on a beach watching a skywriter, wondering what fanciful
and amusing things the pilot might spell out. You won't take them
all that seriously, but it's fun to watch and try to guess what he
will say next.
</P>
<P>
   The play belongs to a group of early Shaw efforts known as
``plays pleasant,'' and the Roundabout Theater's new revival is
just that: as pleasant as a light, breezy summer's day at the
seashore, which is also where the comedy is conveniently set.
</P>
<P>
   Written 100 years ago, ``You Never Can Tell'' is primarily a
spoof of the prevalent notions of love and marriage as the world
approached the 20th century, with some side sallies against
Victorian social mores and a gentle deflating of the New Woman of
the incipient feminist movement. But the humor is more of the
joshing elbow-in-the-ribs variety than the rapier wit of Shaw's
more crusading works.
</P>
<P>
   The action, all of which takes place on one day, centers around
the wooing by a young dentist named Valentine of Gloria, the
headstrong elder daughter of a single mother who 18 years earlier
left her husband, changed her name and took her three children to
Madeira to raise them. The mother, who is also the author of a
series of books on what to expect in the 20th century, has now
returned to England with the grown children _ Gloria, Dolly and
Philip _ and winds up in the seaside resort in Devon where her
husband just happens to reside. The husband also just happens to be
the dentist's landlord.
</P>
<P>
   If those coincidences seem a bit much to swallow, there are even
more to come. Shaw's demands on the audience's suspension of
disbelief begin as soon as the curtain rises to find Dolly having a
tooth pulled by the handsome dentist. Why a healthy teen-age girl
would need a tooth extracted during a day at the beach is not a
question to trouble us. It is done painlessly and bloodlessly, for
which the audience may be grateful, and it provides as good an
occasion as any for Valentine to be invited to lunch, a meal to
which he will of course bring his landlord, the same long-lost
husband and father.
</P>
<P>
   As the inevitable complications arise from the sudden reunion of
a broken household after an 18-year separation, not to mention the
courtship of a young 20th-century feminist by a 19th-century
Lothario, the services of a lawyer are suddenly required. In one
last test of the audience's tolerance, the barrister who arrives
just happens to be the son of the headwaiter at the hotel where the
family is staying.
</P>
<P>
   The waiter, who put his son through Cambridge and law school
because the boy ``never had a hand for real work,'' is Shaw's
stroke of brilliance in ``You Never Can Tell.'' Like Shakespeare's
fools, the waiter is the one calm voice of reason amid the wounded
familial pride, hurt feelings and jealous lovers jilted by their
own pasts and future expectations, a sage who can dispense advice
while taking drink orders and serving the soup at lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Although the role would seem a supporting one by mere line
count, Philip Bosco turned it into a star turn in a 1986 revival of
the play at the old Circle in the Square, and Charles Keating does
no less in this Roundabout production.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw once boasted that ``You Never Can Tell'' was a play that
was ``actor proof.'' Fortunately that premise is not severely
tested in the Roundabout production. The main roles are ably
filled, starting with Keating, who is a walking definition of
unflappability and understatement. ``You can't learn being a
waiter, sir,'' he confides at one point. ``You have to be born to
it.'' He might have added that it's not unlike acting in that
regard, and Keating is as natural a Shavian as he proved to be an
Ortonian in revivals of ``Loot'' and ``What the Butler Saw'' a few
seasons back.
</P>
<P>
   The lovers are in the capable hands of Robert Sean Leonard as
Valentine, the five-shilling dentist who manages to stay one step
ahead of the latest feminist thinking on matters of the heart until
he puts his foot in his mouth, and Katie Finneran as Gloria, the
modern young woman who hates pretty speeches until she hears one.
Leonard, nervous and clumsy one moment, dropping napkins and
spilling drinks, then ardent in his declarations of love the next,
is a dashing figure who commands one's attention on the stage (much
as Victor Garber did in the same role in the 1986 revival). Ms.
Finneran is amusing in her haughty disdain for such old-fashioned
sentiments as love and shattered with self-loathing once she
succumbs to them.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Kellner is a delight as Dolly, the impertinent younger
daughter who asks more questions than Kenneth Starr, and Simon
Jones is convincing as the long-lost husband and father, an almost
Dickensian reading of a man who has found that ``most things that
are good for me are nasty.'' Jere Shea adds a nice turn as Bohun,
the brash young lawyer who has made a ``specialty of being right
when others are wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Helen Carey never quite finds the feminist zeal of the mother,
and some of the supporting performances are uneven. But Nicholas
Martin's direction mostly maintains a pace that moves quickly over
the rough edges (except in one Jack Benny-like pause that fails to
get the laugh it seeks and nearly brings the play to a standstill).
Allen Moyer's set is full of light and almost smells of the sea.

BRUINS LEAVE ELLETT, BAUMGARTNER UNPROTECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Veteran defenseman Dave Ellett and winger/enforcer Ken
Baumgartner, both of whom joined the Bruins as free agents last
summer, are among the veterans Boston has left exposed for Friday's
expansion draft that will stock the NHL's Nashville Predators.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely Bruin to be sent South, however, is Mike
Sullivan, the 30-year-old center who proved to be a valuable
faceoff man and defensive specialist last season.
</P>
<P>
   If the Predators find themselves in need of an enforcer, then
Baumgartner could be the the one picked in the expansion draft,
which will be held at 2 p.m. in Buffalo, one day before the annual
amateur entry draft at Marine Midland Arena. But it's far more
likely that Nashville will look to build around speed and
dependability, a scenario that points to Sullivan, the former
high-scoring Boston University pivot.
</P>
<P>
   The league released the protected lists of all 26 teams Monday,
and the Bruins, as expected, opted to protect two goalies, four
defenseman, and seven forwards. Their keepers included a couple of
mild surprises, right wing Landon Wilson and defenseman Darren Van
Impe.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, a Group 2 free agent, has done little since his arrival
here from Colorado in December '96 in the deal that cost the
Bruins' their first-round pick Saturday. Van Impe showed himself to
be a valuable point man on the power play but also porous on
defense, leading coach Pat Burns to keep him on the bench much of
the time when play was at even strength.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wilson and Van Impe were retained at the risk of either
Ellett or Baumgartner, two of Burns's favorites. No club can lose
more than one player in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Grant Ledyard, acquired in a late-season swap with
Vancouver, also was left unprotected by the Bruins. Not
surprisingly, Byron Dafoe and Rob Tallas were the two goalies
retained, leaving former Vezina Trophy winner Jim Carey out there
for his former general manager in Washington, David Poile, to
select. At a cost of $5 million over the next two years, and coming
off a 1997-98 season that was curtailed by shoulder surgery, Carey
isn't likely to be picked up by Poile.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators, if they feel emboldened, can select some of the
priciest talent in the league, including St. Louis's Brett Hull.
Hull is free to sign with any team as of July 1, with the Blues
owed nothing in return. The Blues recently offered the former
high-scoring winger a three-year, $15 million pact, but wouldn't
yield to the Golden Brett's demand to write a no-trade clause into
year No. 3 of the deal. He is expected to sign with Chicago early
next month. It's highly doubtful that the Predators would waste the
pick, but Hull's high name recognition could lead Poile &AMP; Co. to
consider signing him for Team Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton's Curtis Joseph, Florida's John Vanbiesbrouck, and the
Rangers' Mike Richter, all free agent goalies who likely will be
offered $5 million a year or better on long-term deals, were left
unprotected. The Predators can draft up to five goalies, but again
it's doubtful that they'd bite on any of the high-priced
unrestricted free agents. A promising young netminder such as Mike
Dunham, left unprotected by the Devils, probably will be more
tantalizing, or perhaps the Senators' Ron Tugnutt.

 &HT;    Frozen embroys offered to couple for fertilization
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ A couple has been selected to receive six
frozen embryos offered for donation last December and will have
them implanted in late July, according to the lawyer who conducted
a nationwide search.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Attorney Charlotte Danciu would not identify the couple
Monday except to say they aren't from South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   A Broward County, Fla. couple who identified themselves only as
Donna and Ron offered last December to donate the embryos, frozen
for seven years after Donna had one child from an implantation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's very excited,'' Danciu said. ``We want to
encourage other people to do this. These were the ones, and it
worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Danciu said she received about 50 legitimate inquiries. Many
were eliminated for medical reasons or because they didn't meet the
couple's requirement that any children be raised in a Christian
family. Interviews determined the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   Danciu also said other couples have since inquired about
donating embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The donation comes as the medical industry wrestles with the
ethics of infertility, a $2 billion-a-year business. While selling
embryos for profit violates medical ethics rules, some clinics
reportedly sell eggs left by patients and fertilized by donor sperm
to desperate couples. Ethicists have said the practice could lead
to ``designer babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron, a 43-year-old production manager, and Donna, a 41-year-old
homemaker, had tried for 15 years to conceive. In 1989, doctors
fertilized 15 embryos and implanted four. One took: young Ronnie
was born in May 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It was a difficult pregnancy, and Donna almost died, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple concluded they wouldn't try again, but they did
nothing about the nine remaining embryos, which were frozen. Donna
later learned a vial containing three embryos had broken, and the
clinic planned to begin charging $600 a year for storage.
</P>
<P>
   That's when the couple decided to give the embryos away.

 &HT;    Ranchers in Florida 'desperate' due to heat wave
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Florida's cattle ranchers will likely become
the latest victims of the state's continuing heat wave, adding to
the $80 million in crops already lost this summer, Agriculture
Commissioner Bob Crawford said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not been this desperate in Florida in 50 years,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months of record-breaking heat, North Florida
farmers have lost $20 million worth of sweet corn, $20 million of
hay, $15 million in peanuts, $12 million in cotton and $10 million
in soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   It's that loss of hay _ about 95 percent of the expected crop
this year _ that in turn is cutting into the $150 million-a-year
cattle industry, Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   Large ranchers might be able to cope by purchasing hay from
other states, but smaller ranchers are more likely to ship their
calves to market early, depressing further an already low market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're out of pasture. We're out of hay,'' said Lawrence
Heitmeyer, director of Leon County's Agricultural Extension. ``We
just don't have anything to feed them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ranchers' losses won't translate into cheaper steaks at
the supermarket, cattle experts said. Rather than raising cattle to
the size necessary for slaughter, Florida cattlemen produce calves
that are then shipped to feed lots in the West and Midwest. Two
years later, the animals are sent to large slaughterhouses and then
to meat wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Don't look for cut-rate rib-eyes this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a couple of years to affect that price,'' said Mark
Kistler, head of the Okeechobee County Extension, adding that the
business has ``too many middlemen'' for consumers to see any
benefit at the grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for other foods, like corn or peanuts, may rise slightly,
depending on what happens to crops in other states, Crawford said.

 &HT;    Fires continue to burn with no relief in sight

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Florida is so crackling dry and hot that
even prayed-for thunderstorms brought lightning that fueled the
worst outbreak of wildfires in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke from burning timber land blacked out the Daytona Beach
area on the east coast and 10,000 acres of pine forests burned
Monday near Perry, 50 miles southeast of Tallahassee.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Power &AMP; Light turned off the electricity for up to three
hours to pool filters, water heaters and air conditioners of
hundreds of thousands of customers in a voluntary program across
the state to keep the use of power under control.
</P>
<P>
   Power use reached 17,774 megawatts, not far from the record
summer peak of 18,004 megawatts, said FPL spokesman George Molina.
set when?
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in Palm Beach County scrambled to control eight
brush fires from Jupiter Farms to south Boca Raton, yet all but one
was less than 4 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Relief for South Florida may be less than a week away. The wet
season weather pattern has returned, proven by rain around Lake
Okeechobee Sunday, including nearly 2 inches south of Clewiston.
</P>
<P>
   East and southeast winds push afternoon thunderstorms inland. A
westerly wind allows storms to build over the east coast.
``Eventually it will come,'' said Eric Swartz, a meterologist with
the South Florida Water Management District.
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, fires have burned more than 80,000 acres in
40 counties stretching from Lake Okeechobee to the Panhandle. The
state is seeing an average of 80 new fire starts a day, 90 percent
of them started by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide fires have destroyed 114 buildings and 74 vehicles
and have cost $4 million to fight so far, said Palm Beach County
Rescue Chief Raymond Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen firefighters from Palm Beach County headed Monday to
Volusia County, to relieve some of the about 30 local firefighters
already there. The county and Boca Raton each sent five, Delray
Beach four and Boynton Beach three.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sheppard said Palm Beach County, where 18 brush fires
cropped up this weekend, isn't placing itself at risk by helping
others. The point of the region-wide response ``is that no one
(department) becomes overwhelmed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford, whose office runs
the forestry division, has asked counties and municipalities to
cancel their Fourth of July fireworks displays, and several north
and central Florida counties have agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But he admitted that banning private celebrations would be a
legal problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``One sparkler, one small firecracker can cause tremendous
damage,'' he said. ``We're going to have a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters in Martin and Palm Beach counties haven't pushed
for a ban on either public fireworks displays or private
celebrations despite the fact that two of Monday's brush fires

 &HT;    Lamborghini lawsuit claims costly cars 'defective'
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ He thought he'd be James Bond-cool in
his new purple Lamborghini, which came complete with a hydraulic
lift to get the low frame over the speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   But once the car's battery died, and the roof started leaking,
and the doors stuck shut, and the steering wheel rapped his knees,
and the sunroof latches thwacked him in the head, John Martin's new
car seemed more like something from the garage of Inspector
Clouseau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really wanted a quality vehicle,'' he said. ``With all the
money you're paying, you expect the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 31, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla. filed a lawsuit in federal
court last week charging the Automobili Lamborghini company, maker
of his 1997 Diablo Roadster model, with knowingly selling him a
defective car. Martin's lawyer, Saul Smolar, said he has sworn
statements from four former employees of the Italian automaker who
said the company has concealed a litany of faults with the
Roadster.
</P>
<P>
   Few Lamborghinis are on the road, probably because of their
prohibitive cost (including the Ferrari he traded in, Martin and
his parents paid about $240,000 for his). But Smolar and two other
law firms want to make Martin's suit a class-action on behalf of
the 50 to 60 other people in the United States who bought Diablos.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's suit seeks repayment for the car, repair costs,
insurance costs and interest.
</P>
<P>
   The Diablo went on the market in 1996 as Lamborghini's first car
intended for typical driving conditions. Until then, Lamborghinis _
which can reach speeds exceeding 200 mph _ primarily were racing
cars, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The big problem with the Diablos, Smolar says, are their
distinctive vertical doors. The windows are supposed to retract
slightly to let the door rise, but often the windows get stuck,
preventing passengers inside from getting out. The doors also are
part of the leaking problem, in which the car fills with water
every time it rains, Smolar said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a Diablo that does not leak,'' Smolar said. ``You
need an umbrella in the car if you are going to drive in the
rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said his car was in the shop more than 10 times for
repairs, the last time for nearly three weeks. He said the
dealership that sold him the car, Prestige Imports in North Miami
Beach, Fla., refused at first to take the car back.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the car's makers sent Martin a recall notice, offering
to fix a switch in the door and recommending that Martin drive with
the windows slightly open at all times.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for Lamborghini was out of town Monday and couldn't be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Martin's lawsuit lists still more complaints about his car: It
stalls, it's rusting, the horn doesn't work, and lights on the
dashboard sometimes flicker inexplicably. Not even that nifty
hydraulic lift is working; he says he's still bouncing off the
speed bumps.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, a pharmacy student at Broward Community College, has
placed his Lamborghini in the garage. Now he's driving a sports
utility vehicle made by Mercedes Benz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just gave up on anything Italian except pasta,'' he said.

 &HT;    Online Privacy Alliance introduced as Commerce Department opens
summit
 &HT;    By Mike Drummond
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lexis-Nexis and NCR Corp. were among some 50 major American
companies that formed a new trade group Monday to protect consumer
privacy on the Internet and thwart government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The Online Privacy Alliance and a separate initiative by the
Better Business Bureau were unveiled before the Department of
Commerce opened its two-day summit on Internet privacy today, as
debate rages over how to deal with commercial Web sites that siphon
information from unsuspecting Web surfers.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a similar initiative led by Lexis-Nexis last year, the
self-regulating Alliance lacks ways to punish member companies for
violating terms of the group's privacy policies
(www.privacyalliance.org), despite its requirement that members
post privacy policies and prohibit children's sites from collecting
information without parental consent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their motivation is they don't want legislation, but
unfortunately legislation is needed to have privacy protected,''
said Evan Hendricks, editor of the Washington, D.C. newsletter
Privacy Times . ``Self-regulation is a king without clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's other mission is to cultivate electronic
commerce. Framingham, Mass.-based International Data Corp.
estimates that global Internet commerce revenue will grow to $223
billion in 2001 from $10.6 billion in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox is that while e-commerce mushrooms, government and
industry officials say its full potential is hobbled by fears of
lack of privacy, even among experienced computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Lexis-Nexis triggered debate over online privacy two years ago
when inaccurate rumors circulated on the Web about its P-Trak
people-finder service. Last year, Lexis-Nexis helped form the
Individual Reference Services Group, a coalition of 14 companies
that pledged to limit who can access personal information and allow
people to ``opt out'' of certain databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is self-regulation can work,'' said Lexis-Nexis
spokeswoman Judith Schultz, noting that IRSG members will be
independently audited and face federal penalties for violating
privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Clinton administration said it would give
Internet businesses more time to develop their own privacy rules to
protect information they collect from customers.
</P>
<P>
   But the IRSG and the Alliance may not be enough to satisfy a
more aggressive Federal Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the FTC recommended government legislation to
protect children from Web sites that collect personally
identifiable information.
</P>
<P>
   The commission conducted a survey of commercial Web sites this
year and found few provide any privacy notices. The FTC also found
almost 90 percent of 212 children's sites surveyed collected
personally identifiable information directly from children.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton, Ohio-based NCR markets automatic teller machines and
other products that gather consumer information and feeds it into
NCR data warehouses. Yet the company also tries to balance its
data-gathering mission with protecting privacy, in part because not
doing so may invite the heavy hand of government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Global e-commerce will not fulfill its promise without privacy
and data protection,'' said Chris Hankin, director of governmental
affairs for NCR. ``But bureaucracy is inherently slow, and the
Internet is very fast.''

 Rock 'n' Roll Fantasy for the High-Tech Famous   By Jamie Beckett and Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Fillmore hosts an all-star lineup this Friday _ although you've
probably never heard of any of the bands.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But in the high-tech world, they're famous.
</P>
<P>
   Headlining at the rock palace where The Grateful Dead and Janis
Joplin once belted out tunes is a band of middle-aged guys called
The Flying Other Brothers, led by Silicon Valley venture capitalist
Roger McNamee.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the bill: Where's Julio? headed by three founders of
Excite, one of the top Web search engines; and the Raving Daves, a
10-member combo from high-flying software-maker PeopleSoft.
</P>
<P>
   These high-tech hobby bands will rock the Fillmore at a
fundraiser for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit
group working to protect online civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Fillmore performers are just a few of the dozens of amateur
bands that are springing up as fast as startups in Silicon Valley.
Some of the Valley's best-known executives, venture capitalists and
technical visionaries are spending their off hours living out their
rock 'n' roll fantasies, strumming and thumping in garages and
basements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every company has a little pickup band,'' said Fred Davis, a
former programmer and computer magazine editor who plays keyboard.
``If you have a bunch of techies around, it also means you have a
bunch of musicians around.''
</P>
<P>
   High tech and music go together, like _ well, like rock 'n'
roll. Math, computer programming and music all require the ability
to recognize and organize patterns.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``It's the math and music parallel. Like math, music is
structured, it's ordered and you can do something with it,'' said
Russ Haines, an audio and video consultant who plays guitar and
sings for Severe Tire Damage, which is probably the highest tech of
the high-tech bands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, this self-described ``geek band'' became the first in
the world to broadcast a live rock video over the Internet _ a year
ahead of the Rolling Stones. When the Stones did their Web
broadcast, Severe Tire Damage electronically crashed the show.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the band _ whose members include Mark Weiser, chief
technologist at famed research center Xerox PARC and Mark Manasse,
a cryptography expert _ broadcasts its weekly rehearsals live on
the Web. Fans can do more than just watch: By pressing a button on
their computer screens, they can trigger a fog spray in the
cluttered Digital Equipment storeroom in Palo Alto where the band
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other musicians in Silicon Valley make technology part
of their repertoires.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Zornes, a database guru at the Meta Group research firm,
holds virtual jam sessions with far-flung friends by using his
Disclavier, a high-tech piano that can transmit digital signals
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Raving Daves _ named for PeopleSoft chief executive Dave
Duffield, who occasionally sings &UR;  &LR; and plays guitar with the band _
was born one midnight when Baer Tierkel, deep into a difficult
coding problem, sent out an e-mail inviting others to join him for
an impromptu concert.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, they've had so many appearances that band members
wrote a database application just to manage the band's schedule and
lyrics to its 300 songs.
</P>
<P>
   This is the band's second appearance for the Electronic Frontier
Foundation at the Fillmore. Last year the event raised $130,000 and
became a sort of Woodstock for the digital community _ including a
solo by Steve Jobs' daughter, Lisa, the namesake for Apple's first
personal computer. Jobs stole the show when she sang the Beatles'
``Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Although brothers Giles and Roger McNamee played music in
college, their band began in 1987 under the name Random Axes.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry analyst Esther Dyson unintentionally sparked
the first Random Axes jam by leaving McNamee off the invite list
for a game of charades used as an icebreaker at her annual
conference. The jam session began as a consolation event for the
uninvited.
</P>
<P>
   After that, the Random Axes _ which included trade press editor
Bill Machrone, former Apple Computer research and development guru
Larry Tessler, multimedia publisher Tony Bove and software
entrepreneur Philippe Kahn _ played occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Roger McNamee created the Other Brothers three years ago to
perform at a charity affair at Comdex, the nation's largest
computer trade show. The band joined others including Grown Men,
led by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who used professional
studio musicians to back up his guitar playing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the math connection, many high-tech rockers have another
trait in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your parents don't tell you to go learn electric guitar. They
don't encourage you to be a rock musician _ you have to be really
entrepreneurial to do it. People in high-tech are entrepreneurs,''
said Zornes, the database marketing guru. Zornes played with two
bands that had minor hits in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Avram Miller, whose day job is running Intel's new-business arm,
was a pianist who learned about electronics to measure audience
reaction. He thinks the success in music and business often go hand
in hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing a musical instrument takes physical dexterity. To
succeed, you have to have discipline and you have to be somewhat
systematic because you have to overcome your body,'' said Miller,
who still plays jazz piano.
</P>
<P>
   Execs like Zornes and Miller aren't the only tech-types who like
to groove. Kludge is a Silicon Valley band made up of editors at
computer trade publications owned by CMP Media. It is led by Paul
Kapustka, who edits the newsletter GeekWeek.
</P>
<P>
   Kapustka revels in the unabashed geekiness of Kludge _ its name
is slang for a quick and dirty engineering fix. Kludge specializes
in computer-industry parodies of rock 'n' roll tunes, such as an
homage to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison, set to the tune of Elvis
Costello's ``Allison.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Kludge-job: an altered ``Sympathy for the
Devil'' called ``Sympathy for the Inventor,'' which honors Bob
Metcalfe, the granddaddy of computer networking.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Goldberg, a former Rolling Stone editor and current
editorial director of Addicted to Noise, an online music magazine
in San Francisco, said that other industries _ especially the
financial industry on Wall Street _ also have hobby bands. He
argues that forming bands is a Baby Boomer thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just a technical thing,'' Goldberg said. ``After the
Beatles hit in the '60s, anyone who was anywhere from nine to 25
wanted to be in a band.''
</P>
<P>
   But Frank Ingari, who leads a band of software industry
executives, said there is a peculiar affinity between music and
technology. The CEO of Shiva Corp., a data networking company in
Massachusetts, leads a band called Look &AMP; Feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``High-tech in general and software in particular requires the
same kinds of behaviors and attitudes you need in a band,'' Ingari
said. ``You need people collaborating according to a plan, but the
plan has to leave room for improvisation.''
</P>
<P>
   Most tech-band members play primarily for fun. But for some hot
Gen X bands, like Irene's Cuisine, the possibility of going pro
holds a certain allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the best of both worlds,'' said Randy Eckhardt, who
with his buddy Ric Niel, produces hit video games like Madden
Football for Electronic Arts. On weekends, they team with other
software designers to play at San Francisco nightclubs like Slims.
Now they're talking to national booking agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being in the game business, we know that making a hit is 135
percent luck. So the expectation of making it big in music isn't
there,'' Eckhardt said. ``But on the other hand, if the opportunity
ever came up, it's not the sort of thing you pass up.''

   Sampson's changes questioned after U.S. defeat
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BORDEAUX, France _ Losing to Germany in the World Cup opener was
neither a shock nor cause for a fire alarm at Camp USA.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Soccer coach Steve Sampson even said as much after that
game, when he promised to only tinker with the things that went
wrong in the Americans' World Cup-opening loss, but concluded that
it was no time to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be fine,'' Sampson said. ``We're confident with
the things we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words have come back to haunt Sampson, whose tinkering for
Sunday's crucial and ill-fated game against Iran was like Tim ``The
Toolman'' Taylor deciding to add on a room.
</P>
<P>
   There were wholesale changes not just in the USA's lineup but in
the entire offensive and defensive schemes, which only days before
Sampson had described as giving the U.S. its best chance of
winning. Also, U.S. players were wondering about one of the most
critical decisions of all.
</P>
<P>
   Why bench Eric Wynalda, the creative goal-scorer with more
international experience than any forward on the team?
</P>
<P>
   It was but one of several questions facing the coach and the
team Monday in the wake of a 2-1 loss that some called the worst in
U.S. Soccer history and ended all U.S. hopes of advancing past the
first round of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Should the U.S. team lose to Yugoslavia on Thursday in Lens, the
best it could finish in the Cup is 27th place. It will have gone
through the entire tournament winless. It will have seen a
disturbing goal-scoring drought linger on.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the U.S. finished 14th overall, in a group that
was considered equally as tough as this year's. Among the teams the
U.S. faced four years ago were Colombia and Romania. That U.S. team
advanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's up to others to decide how much progress we've made,''
Sampson said. ``I think we are a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the Americans seemed to outplay the Iranians in
most parts of Sunday's game, taking more shots, getting more shots
on goal and possessing the ball significantly longer.
</P>
<P>
   But Iran won 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's critical go-ahead goal came when there was a significant
breakdown in the new defensive set that Sampson put together
specifically for the Iran game. Iran counterattacked, which long
has been its best asset.
</P>
<P>
   Tab Ramos and Claudio Reyna _ natural midfielders _ were the two
players involved in the mix-up in the U.S. box on the huge Iranian
goal, as Iran's Hamid Estili got a clear shot on a header shortly
before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought (Ramos) had him, and he thought I had him,'' Reyna
said. ``It was a breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the game. And it exposed the strange nature of Sampson's
sudden and drastic change in tactics.
</P>
<P>
   For months prior to the World Cup, Sampson professed a
commitment to playing six midfielders against opponents in order to
utilize the U.S. team speed. In lead-up matches to the tournament,
the 3-6-1 worked amazingly well, forging victories over Austria and
even Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Against Germany in the opener, it's likely no scheme or tactic
would have mattered. The Germans were miles better.
</P>
<P>
   But against Iran, a team that usually does not build offensive
attacks, instead relying on counterattacks for its goals, Sampson
ditched the six midfielders and went to a more conventional four
midfielders.
</P>
<P>
   He chose Ramos and Joe-Max Moore for the middle-back of the
defense, playing them out of position in defensive roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't change a thing,'' Sampson said when asked why Ramos
and Moore played when some of the most decorated and taller
players, Jeff Agoos, Marcelo Balboa and Alexi Lalas, were on the
bench. ``I'm very happy with the effort of the players I chose.
It's up to other people to decide what they think.''
</P>
<P>
   But among the other people questioning Sampson's shift in
strategies, which seemed to play into Iran's strength of
counterattacking, were his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're the kind of team that can change
strategies just like that,'' Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   Said forward Cobi Jones: ``The coach puts up the lineup, and we
play. That's all we can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players still refused Monday to speak publicly regarding
the crash in U.S. Soccer fortunes and the strange and sudden change
in strategies against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas and Agoos only shook their heads when asked to comment
about the game and the plan.
</P>
<P>
   And at the center of it all was Wynalda, who is regarded among
the most dangerous scorers in U.S. history but never saw the field
even after the Americans fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't start, and you just say OK, and we'll go out and
play without him,'' Reyna said. ``Everyone here has not started
games. But I was surprised that Eric didn't get in at some point.
When we made changes, I thought it would be Eric coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't. The normally accommodating Wynalda also refused
to discuss the issue. Sampson said it was not a matter of condition
or injuries, just his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Said goalkeeper Kasey Keller: ``You go down, and you need to
score some goals. I wondered why Eric wasn't there. He's one player
who can score goals for you. We're going to be asking ourselves a
lot of questions about this (World Cup), I'm sure.''
</P>
<P>
   They'll have time. It's a long flight home.

 Year 2000 Problem Worries Americans   By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Nearly one in four Americans thinks that Year 2000 computer
glitches will affect their daily life, according to a survey
released yesterday by the Information Technology Association of
America.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ITAA said its poll of 1,000 people nationwide is the first
one to gauge the views of ordinary Americans on the Year 2000 bug.
Jon Englund, vice president of the ITAA in Arlington, Va., called
the one-in-four number ``significant.''
</P>
<P>
   A May 1998 Gallup poll found that only 6 percent of small
business owners considered the millennium problem ``very serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those individuals in the ITAA poll who expect to be stricken
by the Year 2000 bug, 80 percent worry that their financial records
will be distorted and 72 percent fear business losses.
</P>
<P>
   Half of those surveyed said that government and business leaders
aren't doing enough to remedy the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sends a clear message to President Clinton to get serious
about the bug and what it's going to cost taxpayers,` said Englund.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also criticized the Clinton Administration last week
for doing too little to make government computer systems Year 2000
compliant.
</P>
<P>
   At his birthday party on Saturday, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
said Clinton is presiding over a ``large wreck'' waiting to happen
on Jan. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, House Republicans voted to earmark $4 billion in
emergency spending for fixing Year 2000 glitches.
</P>
<P>
   The millennium bug results from a 1960s programming convention
restricting the year to two digits of code.
</P>
<P>
   Come Jan. 1, 2000, some systems might interpret the date as Jan.
1, 1900, resulting in delays, errors or shutdowns.
</P>
<P>
   While the millennium glitch may make some people wary of
computers, a large segment of the U.S. population is comfortable
sending credit card numbers over the Internet.

 Former Sybase Workers' Startup Gets $10 Million in Cash   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A gang of refugees from Sybase have  spawned a new genre of
databases, and today their startup will be blessed with $10 million
in venture cash.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even in these inflated times, that's a big bet on Cloudscape
Inc., which is trying to popularize a program that ships data to
handheld devices.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudscape of Oakland was born two years ago when ex-Sybase
engineers Nat Wyatt and Howard Torf saw opportunity in two trends.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the rise of Java, a programming language that
creates portable programs which can travel easily over the
Internet. The second was the popularity of Palm Pilots and now
Windows CE devices, handhelds too small to run conventional
databases.
</P>
<P>
   For their first $500,000 in seed funding, Wyatt and Torf lined
up impressive backers like Informix co-founder Roger Sippl and
longtime Sybase marketing whiz Stewart Shuster.
</P>
<P>
   Today's financing round is led by Mohr, Davidow Ventures, which
hopes the $10 million cash inflow will send Cloudscape aloft.
</P>
<P>
   Merv Adrian, an industry analyst with Giga Information Systems,
said Cloudscape will need that cash to compete with the current
market leader in mobile databases _ a prize if you guessed that
it's Sybase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real trick ... is to line up software partners to create
niche applications, and that costs money,'' Adrian said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate objective is to create programs that insurance
brokers might use on Windows CE handhelds, or that car salesmen
might whip out on a Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sybase and Oracle both have databases that send info to
mobile gadgets, IDC analyst Evan Quinn said Cloudscape's database
is written in Java, which has the technical advantage of being
easier to ship over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudscape won't have the Java-database space to itself for
long. DataBean in San Mateo is working on a competing Java-based
package. DataBean was founded by Bruce Scott, formerly one of the
top database programmers at Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Zooming in: &LR;  San Francisco-based Xoom will announce today that
it has acquired SiteMail, a vendor of free Web-based e-mail for an
unspecified sum. Xoom will soon add free e-mail to the list of
services it offers members.
</P>
<P>
   What is Xoom? If you have to ask, then you're not one of the 1.7
million people who've created personal Web pages in Xoom's
fast-growing electronic community.
</P>
<P>
   Xoomers pay no fees for their plots in cyberspace. Instead,
users fill out personal profiles and agree to accept e-mail sales
pitches that, in another context, would be called spam. Xoom gets
paid for being the middleman in these direct marketing pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in September 1996 by veteran entrepreneurs Chris Kitze
of Lycos and Laurent Massa of the Learning Company, Xoom's
35-person staff is adding new members at the rate of 22,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   The company is currently in a quiet period prior to the filing
of an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Car talk? &LR;  With four venture capitalists on stage, the
Churchill Club had a sellout crowd at last week's dinner speech in
Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   With the Valley awash in cash, and everybody carrying around a
business plan, dinner-goers hoped to grab a card from such venture
veterans as Sam Colella, Irwin Federman and Michael Child.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Jim Breyer of Accel Partners who stole the show by
treating the crowd to a translation of venture capital euphemisms.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, when VCs say their startup is pursuing ``an
acquisition strategy,'' what they really mean is their current
products have no market. ``Limited downside'' is just another way
to say things can't get much worse.
</P>
<P>
   But Breyer waxed serious long enough to say that when evaluating
startups, he looks for Hondas in their parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a profit mentality and expense controls from
Day One,'' said Breyer, who steers clear of firms with Porches and
Beemers out front.

 Layoffs Likely In Broderbund Acquisition   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The Learning Company's acquisition of Broderbund is likely to
result in some job cuts and product realignments because both
companies employ significant workforces in the Bay Area and make
many competing software programs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Layoffs probably won't be announced until after the $420 million
deal _ confirmed yesterday _ closes in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has their jobs for the next 60 to 90 days'' until
the merger closes, said Lauren Tanny, Broderbund's vice president
of marketing. Although she said she doesn't expect major layoffs,
The Learning Co. has approved a severance package.
</P>
<P>
   One of Broderbund's core products, The Print Shop suite of home
publishing software, competes directly with Printmaster, which is
made by The Learning Co.'s Mindscape division.
</P>
<P>
   Broderbund's best-selling Family Tree Maker and clip art and
encyclopedia products also compete with Learning Co. offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The companies will spend the summer figuring out ways to
integrate those product lines. One print program, for instance,
might be sold at a higher price, or one might move into an office
market.
</P>
<P>
   Learning Co. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Michael Perik
said he will ``de-emphasize'' Broderbund's entertainment line,
which includes Warlords, The Journeyman Project, and Last Express.
But he said he will keep the smash hit Myst and its sequel, Riven,
which was released late last year.
</P>
<P>
   In educational software, Broderbund's well-known titles _
including Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?, Arthur, and Dr.
Seuss _ can be sold right alongside The Learning Co.'s Reader
Rabbit, Oregon Trail and Cluefinder software.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts, Perik _ who kept pronouncing
the name of his newly acquired company ``Borderbund'' _ said the
deal should result in ``the first pure $1 billion revenue line from
a consumer software company.''
</P>
<P>
   For fiscal 1997, Broderbund had sales of $192 million and The
Learning Co. had $392.4 million in sales. But this year, The
Learning Co. has acquired several companies, including Novato-based
Mindscape, and Broderbund is expected to do $300 million in
revenues, including sales from Riven.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Broderbund employs 1,100 people, with 600 at its headquarters
in Novato and 100 in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Co., based in Cambridge, Mass., employs 2,000
people, including 300 in Novato and 300 in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Broderbund stock closed yesterday up $2.25, or 12 percent, at
$18.75 on the news. The Learning Co. closed down 11 cents at
$24.89.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broderbund has been struggling for a few years. In the hands
of a company like The Learning Co., shareholders will see a better
return,'' said Andrea Williams, an analyst with Volpe Brown Whelan
and Co.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Learning Co. will swap eight-tenths of a share for each
share of Broderbund stock. The Learning Co. expects its earnings
per share to rise about 10 cents this year due to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been reached yet on the board of directors or on
the fate of Broderbund CEO Joe Durrett.

 Is Earthlink Linked to Scientology?   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 Q:  I recently read in an online publica   tion that Earthlink _
one of the largest Internet service   providers _ is run by the
Church of Scientology. Is this true,   or is it one of those
unfounded Internet rumors? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  The latter seems to be the case. It's true that Earthlink
founder Sky Dylan Dayton is a Scientologist, as were several other
top officials of the company when it started out. The company early
on also got some business from the church and its affiliates. But
the church appears to wield no influence over the company, nor is
there evidence that Dayton pressured workers to join up.
</P>
<P>
   FYI, Scientology came under heavy fire on the Internet after it
sued another ISP, Netcom, because a disgruntled former Scientology
minister posted copyrighted church documents on a bulletin board
that had a contract with Netcom. The postings included a 17-page
transcript of confidential lectures by Scientology founder L. Ron
Hubbard. Netcom settled the suit in the summer of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q: &LR;   &LR; I'm getting ready to take the plunge and buy a notebook &LR; 
 &LR; computer. Is it worth spending more for an active matrix &LR; 
 &LR; display, or is dual scan good enough. I plan to use the &LR;   &LR; computer
for word processing, some spreadsheet work and the &LR;   &LR; Internet. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; A:  &LR; An active matrix display (also known as TFT) contains
more than 1 million transistors _ three behind every pixel on the
screen. By comparison, a dual scan display uses just a couple of
thousand transistors that send signals through wires behind the
screen. Not surprisingly, active matrix provides a sharper picture,
which can be seen well even when viewing at an angle. By
comparison, dual scan displays are not as bright, and tend to
deteriorate when viewed at an angle. If you think you'll be using
your new notebook on a desk with proper lighting, a dual scan
display should be fine. But if you'll be working on a bus, a train
or a plane, active matrix is the way to go. It's also a must if you
plan to use the notebook for presentations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to providing a clearer picture, active matrix can
handle more colors and higher resolution than dual scan. But all
these advantages come with a price. You can expect to pay at least
$600 more for active matrix in a new notebook.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q: &LR;  Long URLs don't fit in the space allowed for it on my &LR; 
 &LR; Internet Explorer browser. How can I look at the whole thing to &LR; 
 &LR; make sure I typed it correctly? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Try this: Place your mouse pointer just to the left of
where it says Links on the address bar (just to the right of the
address space). The pointer should turn into a short line with
arrows at either end. Hold down the left mouse button and drag to
the right to increase the size of the address space.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q: &LR;  I'm about to buy a new computer, and I'd like to be able &LR; 
 &LR; to transfer my Favorite Places and Address Book entries to the &LR; 
 &LR; new computer from AOL on my old computer. Is there and easy way &LR; 
 &LR; to do this? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Relatively easy. The Favorite Places are saved in a file
named after your screen name. Typically you'll find it in
c:aol30organize. Your address book info is in two files, AddrBk.ind
and AddrBk.lst, both of which are in c:aol30idb.
</P>
<P>
   Using Windows Explorer (which you'll find in the Programs menu),
save those three files to a floppy disk. Then place them in the
same folders in AOL on your new computer. (You may be asked if you
want to overwrite files already installed. Go ahead and do it.)
Then you should have access to your Address Book and Favs.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; Q: &LR;  I've been having a problem printing out pages from Web &LR; 
 &LR; sites. The last line of the page is sliced in half, with the &LR;   &LR; top
half of the line at the bottom of the first page and the &LR;   &LR; bottom
half of the line at the top of the next page. While it's &LR;   &LR; usually
legible, it's still annoying. Any solutions? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A: &LR;  Try adjusting your margin settings. Click the file menu in
your browser and choose Page Setup. Then decrease the bottom margin
a little.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the Week &QC; 
AOL users who are involved in fantasy baseball leagues can set up a
portfolio that includes statistics for all the players on their
fantasy team. Go to the keyword Stats BB, then click Player
Portfolio and follow the instructions. After creating your
portfolio you can check how your players did today, yesterday, for
the past week, two weeks, three weeks or for the entire season. You
can also get information on injuries and player transactions.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The squiggly little things keep multiplying like
amoebas. They grow, they shrink, they change forms, they disappear,
they come back, they attack their creators.
</P>
<P>
   Words, words, words! You can't say one without meaning an
infinity of others. And if you're one inordinately well-read,
hopelessly conflicted analysand named Hendryk, who could only be
the product of the inordinately well-read playwright named Tony
Kushner, you can't open your mouth without a swarm of the little
varmints filling the room, endlessly trailing paradoxes and
associations. Why, just consider the title of the brief,
deliciously convoluted play in which this victim of logorrhea
appears: ``Terminating, or Lass Meine Schmerzen Nicht Verloren
Sein, or Ambivalence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Terminating,'' as it will henceforth considerately be called,
is one of seven brisk theatrical odes being performed by the Acting
Company at the Joseph Papp Public Theater under the title ``Love's
Fire.'' Kushner is in august company: the evening's other
contributors are Eric Bogosian, Ntozake Shange, Marsha Norman,
William Finn, Wendy Wasserstein and John Guare, each of whom was
commissioned by the Acting Company to write a playlet inspired by a
different Shakespearean sonnet.
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, now. What exactly do Hendryk's babblings about sex and
smells and curtain fabrics and tattoos and existential despair have
to do with Shakespeare's Sonnet 75, the one that begins, ``So are
you to my thoughts as food to life''?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the poem is definitely, on one level, about ambivalence,
and Hendryk, played with megawatt electricity by Stephen DeRosa,
has enough of that trait to take Hamlet through another five acts
of vacillation. So, for that matter, does his shrink, Esther (the
winning Erika Rolfsrud), who would rather be pondering her own
problems than listening to this cosmic kvetcher.
</P>
<P>
   But even more resonantly, ``Terminating'' has everything to do
with the limits and limitlessness of language. Which is also, of
course, the essence of Shakespeare, in whose world a rose is seldom
only just a rose. (Roses, by the way, figure in Hendryk's
discussion of his distaste for a certain sex act, but don't ask
how.) Kushner's spirited dialogue between doctor and patient, with
the voices of their lovers thrown in as condiments, turns
psychiatric free association into a floating metaphor for the
transforming perspective every reader brings to every piece of
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love's Fire,'' which has been directed with ingenuity and
great good humor by Mark Lamos, lets you crawl into seven very
different minds dealing with similar material. The resulting
production, which has already toured the United States and been
seen at the Barbican Center in London, is a testament to the
inexhaustibility of these poems _ a reminder that while the
Shakespearean sonnet may be a tight and disciplined form, its life
doesn't stop with its concluding couplet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words of a dead man are modified in the guts of the
living,'' W.H. Auden wrote in his elegy for W.B. Yeats. Few words
have been so rigorously subjected to so much analysis over the
centuries as those of Shakespeare's sonnets, which have been
presented as everything from a narrative of homosexual love to the
ultimate semiotic game. ``Love's Fire,'' in addition to using the
poems as a sort of Rorschach test for its different playwrights,
acknowledges the interpretive Tower of Babel that the works have
given rise to.
</P>
<P>
   Lamos appropriately begins the evening with the nine members of
the ensemble uttering fragments from the sonnets under
consideration, in a manner that starts slowly and seductively and
then builds into a cacophony of clashing voices. The idea of a
multiplicity of points of view is underscored throughout the
evening in having each sonnet recited by two different actors, and
in the designer Michael Yeargan's use of a wall of television
screens to echo and fragment the faces of the actors and the words
they speak.
</P>
<P>
   The evening concludes with Guare's ``General of Hot Desire''
(spun off from the last of the sonnets, 153 and 154), which
presents the entire ensemble as a group of college students, armed
with essays and reference books, who have been assigned the task of
creating a play from those same poems. What they come up with is
nothing less than a history of the world, starting with the Garden
of Eden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Desire'' is a doggedly whimsical work, sometimes
irritating in its cuteness but often truly affecting, too. In its
scope and story-theater symbolism, it is reminiscent of Thornton
Wilder's ``Skin of Our Teeth'' (this summer's first offering, by
the way, from the New York Shakespeare Festival in Central Park).
</P>
<P>
   Like that play, it sees something admirable and pathetic in
humankind's attempts to reconnect, through art and religions, with
paradise lost and an indifferent God, and it sums up the generosity
of spirit of the whole evening. Its climactic, festive song, with
music by the gifted Adam Guettel, is filled with an intense love of
performing that lingers long after the students have lapsed back
into academic quibbling over their project.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The other plays, Kushner's combustible rant of a work aside, are
most interesting as exercises in individual styles, reflecting the
distinctive mind-sets of their creators. Ms. Norman, the author of
the harrowing `` 'Night, Mother,'' creates a dark daisy chain of
erotic desire in her ``La Ronde''-ish ``Sonnet 140.'' Ms.
Wasserstein, the master of the urbane comedy of manners, uses
Sonnet 94 as a springboard for a look at worldly dissatisfaction
among the rich and name-dropping in ``Waiting for Philip Glass,''
which brings to mind her screenplay for ``The Object of My
Affection.''
</P>
<P>
   In a lovely, palate-cleansing musical vignette, Finn, the
composer of ``Falsettos'' and the current ``New Brain,'' has a
painter ( DeRosa) consider the impossibility of capturing his
beloved (Jason Alan Carvell) in art. Bogosian, best known for his
funny, splenetic performance pieces, turns a confrontation between
a couple (Heather Robison and Daniel Pearce) on the eve of their
wedding into a robust comic look at the sexually divided self.
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Shange, the author of the poetic portrait of black
womanhood ``For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/ When the
Rainbow Is Enuf,'' takes off from the musical tropes of Sonnet 128
into a conflicted mating dance to Chico Freeman's music, performed
by Carvell and the incandescent Lisa Tharps and choreographed by
Dyane Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   The actors _ who also include Hamish Linklater, James Farmer and
Jennifer Rohn _ aren't all equally comfortable with the extremely
varied demands of the material, and there are occasionally feelings
of the pained self-consciousness of an acting class. But they all
have shining moments. Ms. Rohn, for example, is hilarious as a
woebegone Eve looking for words for depression in Guare's piece.
And DeRosa, in particular, has the bright presence and dexterous
shading of which stars are made.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's writers are, to some degree, stars already.
``Love's Fire'' isn't going to make or break them. But how
wonderful to have them assembled, in all their differences, as they
are here. The sheer exhilaration of Kushner's emotionally weighted
wordplay is alone enough to make the production worthwhile. But
it's the contrasts within ``Love's Fire'' that give it such a
hopeful glow. They demonstrate that poems spun four centuries ago
continue to evolve and mutate in ``the guts of the living'' and may
well do so forever. That is something to celebrate.

EDITORIAL: HARASSMENT IN THE SCHOOLS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 23:
</P>
<P>
   A sharply divided Supreme Court on Monday emphasized the
``extraordinary harm'' suffered by student victims of sexual
harassment or abuse by teachers, but then perversely deprived them
and their families of an effective legal remedy.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-to-4 ruling, shattering the court's usual unanimity on
sexual-harassment issues, was the product of a conservative bloc of
justices who sought to substitute their own views for those of
Congress in interpreting Title IX, the federal law that bars sex
discrimination in schools receiving federal funds. The majority
ruled that victims of harassment could recover damages from a
school district only if officials knew of the misconduct and
deliberately failed to act. In thus greatly narrowing the ability
of victims to hold school districts liable for the abusive behavior
of teachers, the Court granted schools an immunity they do not
deserve as a matter of law or public policy.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the court also rejected the Department of
Education's reasonable interpretation of Title IX, under which a
school district could be found liable, regardless of whether
officials knew of the misconduct, if a teacher had misused his
position of authority in imposing the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new ruling, a harassment victim may not recover
damages from a school district absent a showing that a school
official with power to intervene had ``actual notice'' of the abuse
and, acting with ``deliberate indifference,'' failed to stop it.
The majority opinion, by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, with
concurrence from Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justices
Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Anthony Kennedy, held that
lack of a formal school policy against harassment or any system for
reporting complaints should not be deemed evidence of ``deliberate
indifference.''
</P>
<P>
   The four dissenters _ Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer _ rightly scored the
majority's disingenuous reading of Title IX's legislative history
and the harmful impact their stringent liability standard will have
in insulating school districts from nearly all harassment suits. As
Stevens said in his minority opinion, the court put ``protection of
the school district's purse above the protection of immature high
school students.''
</P>
<P>
   It is little solace that the victim is still free to sue the
district for damages under state laws and the individual teacher
for damages under Federal and state laws. Many states lack a remedy
for this kind of serious sexual harassment, and going after a
teacher with little ability to pay ignores the responsibility of
schools for preventing abuse.

AMERICA WEST ON FAA WATCH LIST OVER SAFETY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Federal regulators have stepped up scrutiny of America
West Airlines in the wake of safety concerns raised by the
carrier's mechanics and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 9 memo to Federal Aviation Administration inspectors
in cities served by America West, an FAA supervisor in Phoenix said
the Tempe carrier had been placed on ``Troubled Air Carrier''
status.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack described the FAA's action
as routine for carriers in protracted labor negotiations, and said
America West is cooperating. She added that ``no significant
maintenance or operating problems have been discovered as a result
of these additional inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA memo suggested six areas for increased surveillance,
from in-flight procedures to compliance with critical maintenance
regulations. It was written by Ronald Rosenhahn, supervisor for the
America West Certificate Management Unit of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The memo didn't cite the reasons for the FAA's increased
vigilance, but an FAA spokesman said it stemmed from complaints
called into the FAA's aviation safety hotline by America West
flight attendants and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   He said the calls suggested labor unrest, which, along with
airline financial troubles, always trigger increased FAA scrutiny.
America West's flight attendants and mechanics are both in union
contract negotiations that have dragged on and now involve a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that we do when we get an indication that a
carrier is under strain, and because of the strain there might be
some temptation to skip some of things they're supposed to do,''
said Mitch Barker, public affairs specialist in the FAA's Seattle
office.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said Northwest Airlines, which also is involved in union
negotiations, is also on the FAA's watch list, the new name for
Troubled Air Carrier status. He said the latter term was used in
error on the memo about America West.
</P>
<P>
   The specific areas on the suggested surveillance list include:
</P>
<P>
   Minimum equipment list program compliance. The list includes
critical instruments that must be operating correctly or the plane
can't leave the gate, such as the radio used to communicate with
air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   _Ramp inspections, with emphasis on indications of airplane
corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   _Performance of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance done by
the company and outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   _Dispatch paperwork, emphasizing appropriate weather
information.
</P>
<P>
   _En route flight procedures, emphasizing checklist procedures.
</P>
<P>
   _In-flight/flight attendant training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said America West's watch list status is open ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surveillance will continue at an increased level until we
don't feel it needs to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspectors find problems, fines could be levied. The
worst-case scenario is that major problems are uncovered and the
airline's certificate, or operating permit, would be suspended.
Last year, Iowa-based Great Lakes Aviation, a commuter airline, was
ordered to suspend service and agreed to pay $1 million in
penalties for sloppy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   While not familiar with the details, one aviation expert is
unfazed by America West's watch list status. Arnold Barnett, a
professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who specializes in safety issues, said ``there's no end
to (such) lists, in a certain way.'' He said he flies America West
often from Boston to the West Coast and wouldn't hesitate ``for a
moment'' to do so today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an airline that has done a lot of things very well,''
he said, citing its accident-free record and rapid expansion after
the industry deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   While this is the first time America West has been on the FAA's
troubled carrier/watch list, regulators have criticized the company
in the past for lax maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   During a major inspection two years ago, the FAA found serious
maintenance errors which it blamed on the company's decision, in
late 1995, to lay off 500 mechanics and transfer its heavy aircraft
maintenance to Tramco, a contractor in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA found, among other things, that more and more repairs
were being deferred to keep planes flying. An FAA official said the
airline's cost-cutting efforts had gone too far. Overall, however,
it said the carrier was safe.
</P>
<P>
   America West responded by saying it would hire dozens of
mechanics and increase the number of internal auditors who make
sure that paperwork is completed properly and that outside vendors
are properly qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Since then America West mechanics and their union, the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have criticized the work
done by outside mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on the eve of America West's annual shareholders
meeting, the union raised concerns about flight safety and said
mechanics were going to follow the maintenance book to the letter
even if it meant flight delays. America West officials dismissed
the move as a negotiating tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very concerned about the maintenance and the
outsourcing at America West ever since December of 1996,'' said
Patrick Lacefield, a Teamsters spokesman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks have seen a lot of the effects of the outsourcing in
terms of planes that come in and are supposed to be fixed and
aren't fixed and have to be fixed again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 350 remaining mechanics want America West to rehire the
mechanics it fired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West quietly terminated its maintenance contract with
Tramco in March. The work is now being done in Indianapolis by
United Airlines. The airline also uses other contractors, including
Air Canada, to service its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Association of Flight Attendants, which
represents America West's 2,100 flight attendants, could not be
reached for comment. The negotiating committee is meeting in
Atlanta this week. &QL;

EDITORIAL: CLEANING UP CONSTRUCTION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 23:
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has moved with impressive success against
organized crime in industries that few experts thought could be
cleaned up. He now wants to eliminate bribery, shakedowns, and
bid-rigging in New York City's construction industry by setting up
a powerful new commission to deny licenses to unworthy companies.
This is a noble objective, but his task may be much more difficult
than his earlier challenges to the Fulton Fish Market and the
commercial garbage haulers.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is going after a politically well-connected industry.
Hardly any elected official in the city has not received some form
of campaign contribution from builders, developers and contractors.
It does not help his prospects that he is currently engaged in a
political war with the City Council Speaker, Peter Vallone. Vallone
has helped the mayor in earlier anti-corruption efforts, and the
mayor needs to enlist his leadership in this new effort.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's proposal deserves a careful, nonpartisan hearing.
Recent investigations by the Manhattan district attorney, Robert
Morgenthau, have turned up mob involvement in office building
management and resulted in successful prosecutions. Mob involvement
should of course be the primary target, but the commission would
also perform a valuable service by reshaping the culture of an
industry in which bribes and payoffs are accepted business
practices. These practices have helped drive New York City
construction costs to a level far higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The trick will be to carry out both tasks without a cumbersome
and expensive new bureaucracy. The mayor proposes to start with
only the biggest 400 to 500 companies, but much of the problem lies
with myriad subcontractors less easy to investigate. The council
should certainly feel free to recommend improvements to minimize
the burdens on the industry and avoid damage to legitimate
contractors. It may also wish to look at the government's role, in
part because bribery of city inspectors is thought to be a major
part of the problem, and in part because the city's building codes
are so complicated. But in broad terms, Giuliani's proposal makes
very good sense.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Mikail Markhasev's own words prove he
shot and killed Ennis Cosby as Cosby fixed a flat tire in the inky
January night, just off a Los Angeles freeway, a prosecutor said
Monday in the opening statements of Markhasev's murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, deputy district attorney Anne Ingalls, said
Markhasev described the Cosby killing as a ``robbery gone bad'' in
letters from jail to another imprisoned friend, mixing English and
Spanish slang. Ingalls said that Markhasev also told a friend while
he was trying to recover a gun from the woods that he had shot a
black man: ``It's all over the news.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements will be buttressed by the testimony of two
friends who were with Markhasev around the time of the killing,
friends who saw him looking for news of the crime on television
later that day and another friend who said Markhasev asked him for
help in recovering the gun, Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   But in his own statement, Henry J. Hall, a defense lawyer, said
his client was not even at the scene of the crime when Cosby was
killed and that the murder was instead committed by one of the
prosecution's chief witnesses, Eli Zakaria. Hall, a public
defender, said the letters implicating Markhasev had been
fabricated, and he attacked the credibility of witnesses who would
testify against his client.
</P>
<P>
   The jury of six men and six women were given two portraits of
Markhasev: a man who shot Cosby during a robbery and left him lying
on the road, or an innocent Ukrainian immigrant, then 18, offered
up by questionable witnesses seeking financial gain or to conceal
their own involvement in the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev faces a possible life sentence without parole if he is
found guilty of killing Cosby on Jan. 16, 1997, not far from the
courtroom. A weathered white cross and shaded flowers still mark
the site where Cosby, the son of the entertainer Bill Cosby, was
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cosby's name was mentioned once Monday morning, when Hall
asked the jury not to let the case ``be infected by the celebrity
of the victim's father.''
</P>
<P>
   Two rows of friends and family members of the victim sat in
court, but Bill Cosby was not among them.
</P>
<P>
   Ennis Cosby, a 27-year-old graduate student at Columbia
University Teachers College in New York, was visiting Los Angeles
on a break, the prosecution said. He was on his way to meet a woman
around 1:15 a.m. in his mother's Mercedes-Benz, when he pulled over
because of a flat tire.
</P>
<P>
   Markhasev had been partying at a Bel Air home with his friends,
Eli Zakaria and Sara Peters, Ingalls said, before they passed
Cosby. Zakaria asked him: ``Hey are you OK?'' and Cosby replied:
``Yeah. Everything's cool,'' Ms. Ingalls said, and then the three
went to a nearby pay telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Cosby had called his friend, Stephanie Crane, on a cellular
telephone, and asked her to come and shine her headlights on his
car while he changed the tire, Ingalls said. As Crane sat in her
Jaguar, the defendant appeared at her window and said: ``Open the
door or I'll shoot,'' Ingalls said. Crane drove away quickly, then
turned around because she had left Cosby behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that time, the defendant went over to Ennis, demanded his
money, and when Ennis wasn't quick enough, shot him once at close
range in the temple, killing him instantly,'' Ingalls said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, the prosecution said, two associates, Chris So
and Michael Chang, went with Markhasev to a wooded area to try to
recover the gun and it was then that he implied he had killed
Cosby. So called The National Enquirer to claim a $1,000 reward for
information about the slaying. When the police came to his home, he
took them to the same wooded area, where they found the gun. The
prosecution said that tests showed the gun was the murder weapon.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Perhaps to counter defense attacks, Ingalls acknowledged that
the prosecution witnesses, Zakaria and Chang, are convicted felons
currently serving prison sentences. She acknowledged that So was
motivated by a financial reward. Also, the prosecution
acknowledged, Crane failed to pick out Markhasev in a police lineup
after his arrest nearly two months after Cosby's death.
</P>
<P>
   Hall referred to So as just one of the ``bottom-dwelling
witnesses in this case.'' So told two different stories when he
called the Enquirer, Hall said. He said the jailhouse letters that
were turned over by an informant now serving time for bank robbery
in a federal prison in Texas, were in two different types of
handwriting and contained inaccuracies that someone who knew the
case would not mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Hall showed the jury a composite sketch drawn from Ms. Crane's
description of the killer, along with a photograph of Zakaria,
saying the long nose and rounded chin looked more like the
government witness than the defendant. And he said that there was a
45-minute gap between the departure of Markhasev from the Bel Air
home with Zakaria and Peters and the killing. He said that
Markhasev was being dropped off at home during the slaying. Zakaria
and Peters returned to the Bel Air home for drugs, he said, and
they are the only ones who know who killed Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen of the jury when you get to the end of
this case, the evidence will show you beyond any doubt that the
real person who did this killing was Eli Zakaria,'' Hall said.

VACCINES WON'T WIN WAR ON TICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Clarifies that even with vaccine, ticks are dangerous because they
may carry other diseases.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Englanders and others who live in areas plagued by Lyme
disease have been eagerly anticipating the advent of a vaccine,
hoping perhaps to be able enjoy the woods and marshes again without
eternal vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Two vaccines are indeed on their way, but anyone who thinks
they'll put an end to Lyme disease anxiety is doomed to
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, an FDA advisory panel recommended approval of
a vaccine made by SmithKline Beecham. Given as a series of three
shots over a year, it was 79 percent effective at preventing Lyme
disease in tests involving 10,936 people aged 15 to 70. The FDA
isn't bound by the panel's vote, but approval is considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, Pasteur Merieux Connaught, is expected to
submit a similar vaccine with comparable efficacy _ tested in
10,305 people aged 18 to 92 _ to the FDA by this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's wonderful, of course, to have ``any new tools of
prevention,'' as Dr. David Dennis, coordinator of the Lyme disease
program at the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   And in areas where Lyme disease is endemic, including many parts
of New England, a vaccine will ``make a real difference,'' agrees
Dr. Allen Steere, chief of rheumatology and immunology at New
England Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But even when the vaccines become available _ and SmithKline's
could be out in a few months _ you won't be able to ramble freely
in the boonies if you really want to avoid Lyme disease, which
strikes 12,000 to 16,000 Americans a year.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the studies so far have tested the SmithKline
vaccine in people between 15 and 70 and the Connaught vaccine in
people 18 to 92. Until research in children is completed, it's not
clear how well the vaccines will work in these groups. Nor is it
clear whether people with certain diseases, including rheumatoid
arthritis, should get the vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the vaccine, you have to remain vigilant because the
antibodies stimulated by the vaccine don't act on the tick itself _
just the bacterium inside it. The tick could be carrying other
diseases like babesiosis and ehrlichiosis.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to remember that it takes three shots given over
a year's span to get adequate protection. The SmithKline vaccine is
only 50 percent effective after two shots. This means you have to
start shots in advance; even if the vaccine is approved soon, you'd
have time for only two shots by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   And because of the way the vaccines work, the protection wears
off fast, which means you'll need shots every year. What happens is
that the vaccines stimulate your immune system to make antibodies
to a protein on the surface of the bacterium (Borrelia
burgdorferi), which lives in the tick's gut. When the tick takes a
drink of your blood, it sucks in these antibodies, which then kill
the bacteria inside the tick before they get in your blood stream.
Your immune system never encounters the whole bacterium, which
would give longer lasting immunity, so the immunity gets weaker
with time.
</P>
<P>
   If, despite vaccination, a bacterium does enter your body, it
substitutes another protein on its surface, against which the
vaccine would not work. So if the first line of defense fails, you
may still get infected.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors also worry that in people who already have a
chronic form of Lyme disease, getting vaccinated might make things
worse. ``I would be extremely cautious about (vaccinating) anyone
who thinks they had Lyme disease,'' says Dr. Sam Donta, a
specialist at Boston Medical Center and the Boston Veterans Affairs
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not always easy to tell who's been infected, because
some people do not have obvious symptoms. In fact, Lyme disease is
both often-missed and overreported. If you fail to notice the rash
that follows within a few days of a bite from an infected tick, the
symptoms that arise in the next few weeks _ fever, chills, headache
and fatigue _ might be mistaken for something else.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, even if you decide to be vaccinated _ which
makes sense if you live in an endemic area, despite the
shortcomings _ you will still need to take precautions against
ticks, says Dr. Bela Matyas, medical director of epidemiology at
the Massachusetts Public Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that ``70 percent of people contract Lyme
disease in their own backyard,'' says David Weld, executive
director of the American Lyme Disease Foundation in Somers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   That means that you'll have to stay vigilant _ all summer long.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PREVENTION IS THE KEY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A mild winter and a wet spring mean this will be a banner year
for ticks, and the rate of new Lyme disease cases is already double
last year's. Here's how to protect yourself:
</P>
<P>
   _Learn to look for the deer tick, Ixodes scapularis, on your
skin or clothing after walking in fields or woods. The tick is most
likely to bite in the nymph stage, when it's a dark speck the size
of a poppy seed.
</P>
<P>
   _If you can't avoid areas where ticks thrive _ woods, marshy
areas, high grass, and bush _ wear long-sleeved shirts, long pants
tucked into socks, and closed-toe shoes. Light colors make it
easier to spot ticks on your clothes.
</P>
<P>
   _Spray clothes with insect repellant. Permethrin, the most
effective, kills ticks on contact, but it's very irritating, so
don't get it on your skin.
</P>
<P>
   _Standard repellants for use on skin contain DEET
(diethyltoluamide) and are also effective. High dose DEET may cause
nerve damage in rare cases, and more often can cause allergic
reactions. Avoid concentrations higher than 30-35 percent for
adults; 10-15 percent for children. Don't use it on your face and
wash your hands so it doesn't get into your eyes if you rub them.
And don't use it on kids under a year old.
</P>
<P>
   _When you get home from a tick-infested area, shower or bathe
and check yourself and your children carefully for ticks.
</P>
<P>
   _Remove ticks with tweezers within 24-48 hours. &UR;  &LR; Grab the tick
as close to the skin as possible.
</P>
<P>
   _If pets have been in tick-infested areas, check them, too, as
well as areas where they sit or lie.
</P>
<P>
   _If you become infected, call your doctor; antibiotics are
effective, especially if given early.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 23:
</P>
<P>
   In August, Abraham Zapruder's 26-second home movie recording of
the assassination of President Kennedy will become government
property, in accordance with an Assassination Records Collection
Act. First, however, there is the matter of compensating the
Zapruder family. (Zapruder died in 1970.) The actual 8mm film has
been in the National Archives since 1978, and there it will stay.
What is being negotiated now is the sale of the exclusive rights
the Zapruder family maintains. They would like $18.5 million. The
Justice Department would like to spend much less.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final figure, no film _ it is tempting to say no
cultural artifact of any kind _ has been more closely examined than
the Zapruder film. It has been sped up, slowed down, reversed,
enhanced, and will soon be digitized. Each frame has been pored
over relentlessly. Shot at 18.3 frames per second, the Zapruder
film provides a split-second chronology of a shattering event.
People will always remember where they were when President Kennedy
was shot. But in a sense, the one place we all were is behind the
lens of Zapruder's camera, so dominant has it become as an image of
the assassination.
</P>
<P>
   That dominance is also a measure of the film's ubiquity, which
poses a question in itself. Does the ubiquity of a completely
reproducible artifact raise or lower its value? The question
crystallizes the strangeness of this film and, in a sense, of film
itself. A thousand eyewitness narratives were born in the seconds
it took Lee Harvey Oswald to kill Kennedy, but none are as complete
or impassive as the Zapruder film. On the surface, it is a
transparent record of 26 seconds during a Dallas motorcade. In
fact, it is more opaque than that. A viewer  &UR; learns &LR;  to see it, to
identify the gestures and motions, one horrible instant after the
next. To the cost of that learning each person must attest on his
own.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Justice Department and the Zapruder family began
negotiating, the film has been rebroadcast again and again, often
shown as if it were a film loop and the president's limousine were
speeding beneath the freeway underpass and back onto Dealey Plaza
again and again. One of the myths about our experience of the
modern world is that we become desensitized through exposure to
images. But even now, 35 years after Kennedy's assassination, the
Zapruder film is not just another pattern on the cultural
wallpaper. The film begins, the motorcycles ride into view, and as
the frames flicker past, seeming to pull time along with them, many
of us still watch in disbelief, still avert our eyes from the
brutality of what is coming.

TECH STOCKS RISE WHILE DOW RALLY FIZZLES  
 (JT )
</HEADLINE>
   By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 50-point gain in the Dow Jones industrial average
evaporated in the last 30 minutes of trading Monday, pushing the
gauge lower and extending its losses for a third consecutive
session.
</P>
<P>
   Technology shares, however, ignored the Dow's decline and
continued to rise. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index,
which advanced 0.5 percent on Friday, rose 1.4 percent Monday.
Intel, Microsoft, Dell and Cisco led the advance.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts largely attributed the Dow's reversal Monday to a
computer-generated sell program that stripped 44.09 points off the
Dow late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the effects of computer-generated programs was
positive Monday, as such programs added 6.73 points to the Dow and
2.25 points to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, said Jim Bohart, an
official with Birinyi Associates, a stock market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's 100-point selloff of the Dow, stocks traded
higher throughout much of the day Monday, with prices buoyed by a
temporary abatement of concern about Asia's economic crisis and new
round of merger news.
</P>
<P>
   Some buyers viewed Berkshire Hathway's planned $21.7 billion
purchase of General Re Corp. and the educational software maker
Learning Co.'s offer of $420 million in stock for Broderbund
Software as signs that some investors still see value in the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Both offers valued the stocks at prices higher than their recent
closing price before the announcement of the deals.
</P>
<P>
   In taking stocks higher during the day, investors were scooping
up shares that had fallen sharply recently, such as International
Business Machines. The computer maker, which fell 10 points last
week, was the leading gainer among Dow stocks Monday. It closed at
108[, up 2 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow ended down 1.74 points at 8,711.13. Procter &AMP; Gamble,
American Express and Merck were the leading decliners.
</P>
<P>
   Moves last week by the United States and Japan to sell dollars
to lift the sagging yen stemmed further declines in stocks, said
Charles Pradilla, chief investment strategist at Cowen &AMP; Co. The
sales were viewed as an effort to curb further erosion in the
Japanese currency. If the yen continued to fall, many investors
feared its weakness could amplify the Asian economic crisis and its
impact on American companies which do business in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market feels it's bought some time,'' Pradilla said.
``Ultimately it may not change things, but it takes the idea that
there is a financial crisis off the front burner and puts it on to
the back burner'' for a while, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index inched up 2.59 points, to
1,103.24. The Nasdaq composite index rose 24.53 points, after a
36.24-point gain last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that maybe some of them were oversold,''
Robert Basel, a trader at Salomon Smith Barney, said of the buying
rage for technology shares. ``There was really no fundamental
news.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the bellwether technology shares,
Internet-related companies were beneficiaries of Monday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   The bookseller Amazon.com rose 5 9/16 points, to 81], amid news
that Bertelsmann AG had purchased a stake in Nuvomedia. The
fledgling company, founded last year, is developing technology that
allows people to download books over the Internet. Barnes &AMP; Noble,
an Amazon.com competitor, also owns a stake in the company. Some
analysts are skeptical that reading books on an electronic device,
like the one being developed by Nuvomedia, will become popular.
</P>
<P>
   Other Internet-related shares also rose. Yahoo rose 10 5/16
points, to 139 9/16, and Earthlink Network rose 6 points, to 72.
America Online and Lycos also closed higher.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts warned that investors might be too
enthusiastic about the stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com is not going to make money for another couple of
years,'' said Warren Epstein, head trader at Richard Rosenblatt &AMP;
Co. in New York. ``But the company is valued at more than $4
billion and Barnes &AMP; Noble is valued at $2 billion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrationality sometimes goes a little farther than anybody
thinks it will. I'd be surprised if all of the companies were
thriving in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein pointed to Spyglass, which traded as high as 55 in
January 1996. The stock closed Monday at 10 15/16, up 1/16 point.
The company, which went public in June 1995, is an Internet
software manufacturer that created one of the first World Wide Web
browsers.

 Includes a color slide of Ben Affleck in a scene from
``Armageddon.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    They were two young actors out for dinner at a Los Angeles
restaurant _ harmless enough, apparently, but not if you're Ben
Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, which they were.
 &HT;    The paparazzi gathered outside the restaurant and, as the couple
emerged, tried their best to create an incident and generate the
kind of angry, violent photos the tabloids love.
 &HT;    ``I saw your mother at the Academy Awards,'' one photographer
yelled to Affleck, ``and she looked like a real slut!''
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Affleck _ like his good buddy Matt Damon _ was
the kind of tough street kid they depicted in their Oscar-winning
screenplay for ``Good Will Hunting'' (1997). Reflexively, his fists
clenched.
 &HT;    ``When that photographer attacked my mother, I was in a rage,''
he recalls. ``I literally wanted to kill.
 &HT;    ``I mean, my mother? My mother is a saint,'' he adds. ``And
where I grew up, if someone talked about your mother, it could only
be followed by fists.''
 &HT;    But Oscar winners have to take such jibes, along with cracks
about his name, Paltrow's bust size or whatever else comes his way.
 &HT;    ``The rules have changed,'' says the 26-year-old Affleck, a
broad-shouldered hunk in jeans and a sweater. ``I'd be lying if I
didn't say it's hard to get acclimated in Hollywood. I'm going,
`Wait a minute. I just can't smack this guy?'''
 &HT;    On an early Sunday morning on a sun-splashed patio at the Ritz
Carlton in Marina Del Ray, Calif., Affleck is still adjusting to
his newfound stardom.
 &HT;    ``I'd be an idiot to complain,'' he admits. ``I take
responsibility for what I am. I am certainly willing to benefit
from all the good things that have come my way _ I'd feel a little
bit disingenuous to start kvetching about the minor
disadvantages.''
 &HT;    The heat should only intensify when ``Armageddon'' opens, on
July 1. Affleck is cast as a young oil-rig driller _ believe it or
not _ sent into space with a team aiming to blow up an asteroid
which is on a crash with the earth.
 &HT;    Along the way, he also enjoys a romantic subplot with Liv Tyler,
who plays the daughter of the space mission's commanding officer
(Bruce Willis).
 &HT;    Actually, though, Affleck says he had trouble with the romantic
scenes.
 &HT;    ``We've known each other a long time,'' he says of Tyler. ``It's
like kissing your younger sister.''
 &HT;    Affleck has been a stalwart of the independent-film scene, most
notably as the lead in Kevin Smith's ``Chasing Amy'' (1997). What's
he doing in a $140 million Bruce Willis movie?
 &HT;    ``It sounds like it might be selling out,'' he admits. ``The
real irony is that I was never the guy who wanted to do indie films
_ I was the guy who grew up going to the multiplex to see `Star
Wars' (1977), `Back to the Future' (1985) and Indiana Jones.
 &HT;    ``You would never catch me seeing some boring foreign number or
an art film,'' he insists. ``Those movies were alien to me _ I was
Mainstream Man. So doing `Armageddon felt like doing a real movie
to me.''
 &HT;    Both aspects of his career will be on view in future films.
Affleck recently shot Smith's new film ``Dogma,'' due out next
year, with himself and Damon as fallen angels. Also due next year
is ``Shakespeare in Love,'' casting Affleck opposite Paltrow.
 &HT;    ``That movie has given Bruce Willis no shortage of amusement,''
Affleck says, laughing. ``Bruce has yelled at me, `What are you
doing wearing tights in a movie? I can't believe you.' He thinks
I'm just ruining everything _ he couldn't be more disappointed in
me.''
 &HT;    This summer Affleck will start filming a romantic comedy with
Sandra Bullock, ``Forces of Nature.''
 &HT;    Oh, yes, he and Damon are also working on a new script for
Miramax.
 &HT;    ``We'll be writing some stuff this summer,'' he says. ``I'm
going to go to Italy, where Matty's doing a movie. In our spare
time, we'll write.
 &HT;    ``I know it sounds bad,'' he adds, smirking. ``Like I need an
excuse to go to Italy so I called up Miramax and said, `Send a
ticket. We're writing. Don't worry. Cover expenses. We're really
working.'''
 &HT;    As for rumors that he's jealous of Damon's ascent to leading-man
stardom, Affleck says they're so much hot air.
 &HT;    ``I've heard, `Why did you write a Matt Damon vehicle with `Good
Will?' Are you nuts?''' Affleck says. ``People ask, `Shouldn't you
have insisted on writing yourself a bigger role?'
 &HT;    ``That perception is pretty funny to me,'' he says, ``because I
was always very happy with my role in `Good Will.' I got to be
funny and I got to have an emotional scene.''
 &HT;    Their next film may find Affleck as the hero, Damon in a
supporting role.
 &HT;    ``The plan was that in the next movie I would be the lead,'' he
says. ``Now I don't know. We don't want to be self-conscious about
what is fair. It's still about telling a good story.''
 &HT;    The two writer/actors grew up together in Central Square, the
non-affluent part of Cambridge, Mass.
 &HT;    ``Our mothers are both teachers. There was this common thing,''
Damon says in a separate interview. ``The minute I met Ben, you
just knew it was a lifelong friend. There's a loyalty about him.
He's the guy you call in the middle of the night when there's a
crisis.''
 &HT;    They got agents and made some television commercials together,
and got turned down for lots of movies. Both were cast, however, in
small roles in ``School Ties'' (1992), which led Affleck to ``Dazed
and Confused'' (1993).
 &HT;    After lackluster college attempts in Vermont and California and
a breakup with his girlfriend, Affleck went to stay with Damon and
another friend in a small, two-bedroom house in Los Angeles. There,
frustrated at the lack of opportunities to act, they began work on
``Good Will Hunting.''
 &HT;    A long, twisting road finally brought the project to Miramax,
then to movie screens and finally to Oscar night, where co-star
Robin Williams captured a Best Supporting Actor statue while
Affleck and Damon took the Best Original Screenplay award.
 &HT;    Luckily for Affleck, he and Damon were given separate statues.
 &HT;    ``I would have had to duke it out with him in the parking lot if
that wasn't the case,'' he jokes.
 &HT;    The other big thing in his recent life is Paltrow, but Affleck
says the two have agreed not to discuss their relationship in the
press. It may seem futile, but he insists it can work.
 &HT;    ``I know some celebs who are couples and they manage very
successfully to keep themselves out of the paper,'' the actor says.
``They go to restaurants where the press doesn't hang out. You can
make it work if you keep the world out of it.''
 &HT;    That the world actually cares whom he is dating still amazes
him, Affleck admits.
 &HT;    ``All of this really hasn't sunk in,'' he says. ``I'm actually
really afraid now.
 &HT;    ``With `Good Will Hunting,' I didn't expect anything going in,''
he recalls. ``I didn't expect it to hit or be such a publicity
machine. I didn't expect to win an Oscar. Now I am ripe for
disappointment.
 &HT;    ``You'd have to be deaf, blind and dumb not to be acutely aware
of the dynamic that goes on with celebrities and publicity,''
Affleck adds. ``People are built up. Then it's not so much fun
holding them up there anymore. People can't wait to take shots.
 &HT;    ``I'm ready for it.''

 Includes a color slide of Jessica Lange with Elisabeth Shue in a
scene from ``Cousin Bette.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jessica Lange's laugh is a throaty, sexy chuckle, informal,
inviting _ and exactly what you won't catch her doing in ``Cousin
Bette,'' her latest film, based on Honore Balzac's classic novel.
 &HT;    ``I've always liked to play characters that can let their
emotions explode on screen,'' she says, ``but Cousin Bette is the
kind of woman who, although full of tremendous passion, doesn't
show it.
 &HT;    ``She's also living in 19th-century France, where women weren't
encouraged to be demonstrative,'' Lange adds, ``so I had to be very
careful not to use my hands too much, which is a very natural thing
for me to do.''
 &HT;    The 49-year-old actress still radiates the sensual beauty that
made her a star as a model and a sex symbol in such early films as
``King Kong'' (1976) and ``The Postman Always Rings Twice'' (1981).
But, again, you'll see little of that sexiness in ``Cousin Bette,''
where her character is a bitter, vindictive woman seeking revenge
on her own family and friends.
 &HT;    ``I got this very dark wig that fit like a helmet,'' she says,
``because Balzac had referred to Bette as a `black crow.' I skipped
makeup, except something they put on to make my skin look sallow,
and I let my eyebrows grow in. Everything we did was designed to
make me look worse.''
 &HT;    Laughing, Lange admits that watching the film wasn't easy.
 &HT;    ``As an actress, I still have tremendous vanity,'' she says.
``If my face is going to be up there 40 feet wide or whatever, I
would love it to look good. Sometimes I would close my eyes when we
were watching the dailies. But I knew that we shouldn't compromise
and do some glamorous Hollywood version of `Cousin Bette.'
 &HT;    ``There was something about changing my appearance that appealed
to me more and more,'' she continues. ``It's the idea of wearing a
disguise, and getting further and further away from the person you
really are and how you really look. I even considered wearing a
prosthetic nose for the role, but it would have taken too much time
in makeup to put it on.''
 &HT;    Many actresses, particularly those who have reached an age at
which Hollywood traditionally views actresses as ``too old,'' might
have hesitated to take so unglamorous a role. Not Lange, she says.
 &HT;    ``I wanted the challenge of playing Cousin Bette,'' she says.
``I really wanted to step outside of the work that's easy for me to
do, these kind of big, emotional women who go on big emotional
journeys. Bette was the antithesis of that. It was interesting to
repress so much and still be able to show what was going on inside
her.
 &HT;    ``I first read the novel when I was 21,'' she recalls. ``I loved
it, and I really can't tell you why, but it stuck in my mind. At
the time, I hadn't even considered acting a career. So all these
years later, when they came to me and asked to me play Cousin
Bette, it seemed like a very natural thing to do.''
 &HT;    ``Cousin Bette,'' in which Tony Award winner Des McAnuff _ who
staged ``The Who's Tommy'' and ``Big River'' _ makes his big-screen
directing debut, also stars Elisabeth Shue as a courtesan who sings
and dances at the Folies Bergere and Australian hunk Aden Young as
the lusty artist who melts Bette's heart.
 &HT;    ``If I could put a neon sign above the title of this film,''
Lange says, ``It would be, `This is not another Jane Austen clone!'
 &HT;    ```Cousin Bette' is a little dirty and a little naughty,'' she
says. ``It's what Balzac did best _ lampooning all the human
foibles, all of our worst qualities. It's not a 19th-century
costume drama, it's a deliciously farcical black comedy.''
 &HT;    As she faces the half-century mark, Lange is still challenging
herself. She is considering a part in the upcoming film version of
Shakespeare's ``Titus Andronicus,'' with Anthony Hopkins in the
title role, and early next year will star in a London stage revival
of Eugene O'Neill's ``Long Day's Journey Into Night.''
 &HT;    Prestigious roles in Shakespeare and O'Neill reflect a long
life's journey from Lange's critically trashed debut in Dino Di
Laurentiis' much-maligned remake of ``King Kong.'' The film almost
ended her career before it had begun, but Lange insists that she
has no regrets.
 &HT;    ``It was really a lark for me at the time,'' she recalls. ``I
was studying acting and living in the Village, working part-time as
a waitress. When they asked me to audition I thought, `Great.' When
I got the part I didn't think of it as a momentous career move, I
just took it as a kind of a goof.
 &HT;    ``It turned out to be sort of an initiation by fire to the
business of filmmaking,'' she admits, ``but I never felt it was the
wrong thing to do.''
 &HT;    Looking ahead, Lange faces new obstacles, particularly as an
``aging'' leading lady.
 &HT;    ``Certainly, the powers that be seem to think that sexuality has
something to do with age or lack of it,'' she concedes. ``It's not
a problem for older actors _ you get Jack Nicholson with Helen Hunt
or Nick Nolte with Julia Roberts. The guys don't seem to be
embarrassed by playing love scenes with women who are 20 years
younger than they are. I find all of it rather funny.''
 &HT;    Lange has participated in some of Hollywood's hottest sex
scenes, including a controversially explicit kitchen-table bout
with Jack Nicholson in ``The Postman Always Rings Twice.''
 &HT;    ``You hear actors complaining a lot,'' she says with a smile.
``They're always saying, `Ohhh, love scenes, I hate them.' I've
never felt that way.
 &HT;    ``I suppose they could be hateful if you hated the person you
were doing them with,'' she admits. ``But I must say, in `Rob Roy'
(1995), for instance, it wasn't hard to imagine being in love with
Liam Neeson. It's not like you have to push yourself to the limits
of your craft to make it believable.''
 &HT;    Offscreen, Lange has lived with playwright Sam Shepard for many
years. They have two children, 12-year-old Hannah and 10-year-old
Walker, plus Alexandra, Lange's teen-age daughter from an earlier
relationship with dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov. Home is a farm in
Stillwater, Minn., the state where Lange grew up.
 &HT;    Combining her acting career with her desire to be a strong,
supportive mother had been difficult, Lange says.
 &HT;    ``My own mother was a model parent,'' she says. ``She had
incredible patience and sweetness. I fall short in those areas
because I have a temper. I really have to work at not letting it
flare up.''
 &HT;    That's not hard to believe for anyone who's seen any of Lange's
signature roles as troubled, emotionally volatile women _ as a
misunderstood and psychologically troubled actress in ``Frances''
(1982), for which she received an Academy Award, for example, or
her second Oscar-winner as an unstable military wife in ``Blue
Sky'' (1994). On stage, she scored a hit as Tennessee Williams'
deranged Blanche Dubois in ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' on Broadway
in 1995.
 &HT;    Lange cheerfully acknowledges that unsettled characters are her
specialty.
 &HT;    ``My daughter Hannah said to me, `Mom, do you think playing all
those crazy women is going to make you crazy?''' Lange recalls,
laughing.
 &HT;    ``I said, `I think it's just the opposite. Playing all those
crazy women lets me get it all out, so I don't end up being crazy
myself.'
 &HT;    ``I think it's true,'' she says. ``If I weren't an actress, I
think I'd be quite mad.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struck for the first time Monday
against the federal government's aggressive use of forfeiture,
ruling that a forfeiture intended as punishment is unconstitutional
if the amount seized is ``grossly disproportional'' to the gravity
of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Applying that test in a sharply contested 5-4 ruling, the court
went on to declare that the government could not constitutionally
seize $357,144 in undeclared cash that a Los Angeles man and his
family had tried to bring in their luggage on a flight to Cyprus.
The money itself, intended to repay a family debt, was not the
proceeds of a crime; the man's only crime was failing to obey a
federal law that requires reporting all currency being taken out of
the country in excess of $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the penalty for violating the reporting law is the
forfeiture of ``any property, real or personal, involved in such
offense'' _ in this case, in the government's view, the entire
$357,144.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the 1992 law requires ``grossly
disproportional'' forfeitures from ``innocent owners,'' it is
unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of
``excessive fines,'' Justice Clarence Thomas said in the majority
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was joined, for the first time in a 5-4 decision, by the
court's four most liberal members, leaving his usual allies in the
court's conservative bloc to label the decision a ``serious error''
that ``portends serious disruption of a vast range of statutory
fines,'' as Justice Anthony Kennedy put it in his dissenting
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling marked the first time the court has applied the
excessive fines clause, a relatively obscure part of the
constitutional provision that is better known for its prohibition
of ``cruel and unusual punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was limited by Thomas' suggestion that the
forfeiture would not have been excessive had the money's owner,
Hosep Bajakajian, been involved in some separate offense like money
laundering or evading taxes or customs duties. Thomas said that in
this case, the government had lost nothing except ``the information
that $357,144 had left the country.'' Forfeiture of the entire
amount ``bears no articulable correlation to any injury suffered by
the government,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the majority's analysis, forfeitures that are designed to
reimburse the government for a loss are remedial, rather than
punitive, and so are not ``fines'' that could be deemed excessive
for Eighth Amendment purposes. But in this case, ``the forfeiture
serves no remedial purpose,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision did not displace a ruling from two years ago in
which the court held that the government could impose both a
criminal penalty and civil forfeiture for the same offense without
violating the constitutional prohibition against double jeopardy.
The forfeitures typically involved in those cases are the proceeds
or location of a crime, and as a legal matter the confiscation is
an action against the property rather than its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, however limited in application, the ruling Monday
was surprising for a court that has expressed fitful concern about
the government's forfeiture policy for several years without ever
ruling that a particular forfeiture violated the Eighth Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration was vigorous in its defense of the
forfeiture in this case, arguing in its brief that the forfeiture
of ``the very case involved in the offense'' cannot be regarded as
an excessive fine because by taking all the undeclared money, of
whatever amount, the forfeiture is ``perfectly calibrated to the
seriousness of the defendant's conduct.'' The money was
``instrumental to the violation,'' the administration said, arguing
that strict enforcement of the reporting requirement played an
important role in detecting money laundering schemes.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion in the case, United States vs. Bajakajian, No.
96-1487, Thomas traced the history of forfeiture. He noted that it
was only in 1970 that the government began imposing criminal
forfeiture of the type at issue in this case, as opposed to civil
forfeiture that is based on the fiction of the property as the
guilty party. His conclusion was that while there is a respectable
common law tradition for government forfeitures, the current
practice is a recent development, not blessed by history.
</P>
<P>
   The decision affirmed a 1996 ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, in San Francisco, which had applied the excessive
fines clause in refusing to order the forfeiture of Bajakajian's
money. Earlier, the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles had set
$15,000 as a ``reasonable'' forfeiture, a figure the 9th Circuit
let stand because Bajakajian had not separately appealed it. Thomas
said Monday that the question of whether $15,000 or some other
figure below the full amount would be acceptable was not properly
before the court because the government's appeal sought only a full
forfeiture.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' opinion was signed by a group of justices he had never
before joined in a 5-4 decision: Justices John Paul Stevens, David
Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist, along with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and
Antonin Scalia, joined Kennedy's dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The dissenters said the majority was improperly dismissive of
the importance of the reporting statute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress deems the crime serious, but the court does not,''
Kennedy said. He said that ``one of the few reliable warning signs
of some serious crimes is the use of large sums of cash,'' adding
that the court gave no reason for rejecting the congressional
judgment that a ``blanket punishment'' was the most effective way
of addressing that problem. Without full forfeiture, ``the fine
permitted by the majority would be a modest cost of doing business
in the world of drugs and crime,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   There were also these other developments Monday as the court
pushed to finish its term within the week.

STEVEN SODERBERGH: AN INDIE SUPERSTAR VISITS THE MAINSTREAM

 Includes a color slide of Steven Soderbergh directing a scene from
``Out of Sight.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Even by independent-filmmaker standards, Steven Soderbergh's
career output is eclectic in the extreme.
 &HT;    It started with ``Sex, Lies and Videotape'' (1989), the
surprise-hit drama/comedy/whatever that took the Sundance Film
Festival by storm and changed the independent-film world forever.
 &HT;    He followed that with ``Kafka'' (1991), a shadowy semibiography
starring Jeremy Irons as the tormented Czech writer.
 &HT;    Then came the critically praised ``King of the Hill'' (1993), an
offbeat, Depression-era family drama.
 &HT;    Then ``The Underneath'' (1994), a film-noir-inspired thriller.
Then ``Schizopolis'' (1997), a black comedy in which Soderbergh and
his ex-wife, actress Betsy Brantley, starred as a couple in a
crumbling marriage. And ``Gray's Anatomy'' (1997), a filmed version
of a Spalding Gray monologue.
 &HT;    All of them weird, many of them wonderful and none of them
obvious precursors of ``Out of Sight,'' opening June 26. With a
comparatively gargantuan budget of $49 million and a cast of big
names _ George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames, Dennis Farina,
Don Cheadle, Steve Zahn, Albert Brooks _ this adaptation of Elmore
Leonard's novel is unapologetically mainstream.
 &HT;    ``It was emotional, but not externally emotional, which is
territory I feel comfortable with,'' the straight-talking
Soderbergh says during a telephone conversation from a Los Angeles
hotel. ``At the same time, it was very clearly a character-driven
piece that required a little bit of gimmickry to keep it
interesting.
 &HT;    ``I thought I knew what the gimmickry should be,'' he says.
``When I read it, I saw the movie in my head and felt like I knew
what to do with it. I felt that, for better or worse, I had a take
on the material. I'm seldom right, but I'm rarely in doubt.
 &HT;    ``Also, even though I grew up in a suburban subdivision and
Leonard's world is definitely not a world in which I traveled,
there's a certain ironic tone that I understood and could
recognize,'' the director adds. ``That was enough to carry me
through the rest of it.''
 &HT;    Soderbergh professes disinterest in questions of commercial vs.
art-house films, mainstream vs. independent or even accessible vs.
personal.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what all of those terms mean, and I never have,''
Soderbergh says. ``Everyone applies them to me, but I don't know
what relevance they have anymore.
 &HT;    ``Every movie I've made I made because it interested me at the
time,'' he says. ``In terms of being commercial, I don't know how
to make a movie more accessible, more palatable than `King of the
Hill.'
 &HT;    ``That film has a classic American narrative,'' the director
says. ``Nobody went to see it, and there was nothing arty or
esoteric about it.
 &HT;    ``It's not like I'm off in some weird limbo saying commercial
films are for boobs,'' he adds with a laugh. ``I will say that,
coming off `Schizopolis' and `Gray's Anatomy,' two ultra-low-budget
movies, `Out of Sight' seemed pretty appealing.''
 &HT;    Clooney and Lopez are probably the highest-profile stars he's
worked with, but Soderbergh has nothing but praise for the two.
They came in prepared and energetic, he says, an attitude that made
his task easier.
 &HT;    ``I got the film I wanted,'' Soderbergh says. ``Whether or not
that translates into people liking it or commercial success, I have
no idea.
 &HT;    ``I hope it does well, but I would always rather be happy with a
movie than just have it perform at the box office,'' he says. ``The
movie itself is the thing that sits there and is a constant.
 &HT;    ``The rest of it _ critical and commercial response _ is always
shifting one way or another,'' the director adds. ``I can't control
what movies open the same weekend that mine do.
 &HT;    ``All I can do is try is make my films as good as they can be.''
 &HT;    It's been nearly a decade since Soderbergh arrived on the scene
from Baton Rouge, La., with ``Sex, Lies and Videotape,'' a timely,
erotic drama widely credited for launching the indie-film craze.
Much has been written about Soderbergh's output since then, as
observers wondered aloud if the director, now 35, lived up to
expectations.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have any expectations,'' Soderbergh says dryly.
``It's astonishing to me that this would be a topic of conversation
with anyone other than my parents.
 &HT;    ``I like the range of movies I've done,'' he says. ``I think
it's an eclectic group. Some of them work, some of them don't, but
they're all attempts at something.
 &HT;    ``They all feel like they were made by an individual and not by
a committee. There's nothing embarrassing about that.''
 &HT;    In looking back at his own films, Soderbergh is frank in
assessing his own successes and failures.
 &HT;    ```Sex, Lies' works on its own term,'' he says. ``People seem to
like `King of the Hill,' and it works pretty well, as does `Gray's
Anatomy.'
 &HT;    ```Kafka' is a bit of a mess, but an interesting mess,'' he
admits. ```The Underneath' was tough. I felt I blew it _ at its
heart, it's flawed in a way that I was never going to fix.''
 &HT;    Most of the few people who saw it felt the same way about
``Schizopolis,'' a black comedy which many found self-indulgent,
with its parallels to the real-life breakup of Soderbergh and
Brantley.
 &HT;    It was, Soderbergh explains, the work of a filmmaker in personal
and professional turmoil.
 &HT;    ``I look back on it fondly because it meant a lot to me
creatively,'' he says. ``It was the shedding of a skin that I think
was beginning to suffocate me.
 &HT;    ``If the movie is out of control and incoherent, that's because
I felt that I was in danger of being too controlled, too coherent
and becoming too much of a formalist,'' he adds. ```Schizopolis'
was, to me, a necessary step I had to take to get to `Gray's
Anatomy' and `Out of Sight.'
 &HT;    ``Hollywood is a hard place in which to play it out,''
Soderbergh says, ``but a filmmaker has to have these mistakes. You
have to go down some blind alleys.
 &HT;    ``Some people don't understand that, and the business just
doesn't support it,'' Soderbergh says glumly. ``But it's necessary
if a filmmaker is going to move and not stagnate.''
 &HT;    By his own admission not the ``vacationing type,'' Soderbergh is
actively seeking his next project. It may be something he scripts
himself, he adds, or it may not.
 &HT;    ``I've got to find something before June 26, when `Out of Sight'
opens,'' he says with an easy laugh. ``I've got to build the bridge
in front of me before they burn the one behind me.''

 WASHINGTON: the week. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parole Rights
</P>
<P>
   In another 5-4 decision, the court ruled that illegally seized
evidence, which would be barred by the exclusionary rule from use
by the prosecution at a criminal trial, can be used in parole
revocation hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, in an opinion by Thomas, overturned a ruling by
the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The case involved a search by
parole officers of the home of a paroled murderer, who was barred
from owning any weapons. The officers found guns and other weapons,
and they began parole revocation proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion in the case, Pennsylvania Board of Probation vs.
Scott, No. 97-581, Thomas said that the costs of the exclusionary
rule were always high, unjustifiably so in the parole context.
``The costs of allowing a parolee to avoid the consequences of his
violation are compounded by the fact that parolees (particularly
those who have already committed parole violations) are more likely
to commit future criminal offenses than are average citizens,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist and O'Connor, Scalia and Kennedy joined the opinion.
Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg and Breyer dissented. ``If the police
need the deterrence of an exclusionary rule to offset the
temptations to forget the Fourth Amendment, parole officers need it
quite as much,'' Souter said, referring to the constitutional
prohibition against unreasonable searches.
</P>
<P>
   Class-Action Settlements
</P>
<P>
   Accepting a case for its next term, the court agreed to revisit
an issue it last dealt with a year ago when it rejected a huge
class-action settlement that had purported to resolve the liability
of 20 former asbestos manufacturers to workers who had been exposed
to the deadly substance but who had not yet become ill. In last
year's case, Amchem Products vs. Windsor, the justices said the
settlement unfairly limited the ability of future victims to get
redress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time it decided that case, which was from the
federal appeals court in Philadelphia, the court summarily vacated
another appeals court's decision that had upheld a similar
settlement between a different asbestos maker, Fibreboard Corp.,
now a subsidiary of Owens Corning Fibreglass, and a different group
of plaintiffs. The justices told the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in New Orleans, to study the Fibreboard case again in
light of the principles established in the Supreme Court's Amchem
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   In a cursory five-paragraph opinion, adopted by a 2-1 vote, the
5th Circuit reinstated its earlier opinion, finding that
differences in the way the Fibreboard settlement was structured
made the Supreme Court's ruling disapproving the other settlement
irrelevant. The appeal the Supreme Court accepted Monday, Ortiz vs.
Fibreboard Corp., No. 97-1704, argued that the earlier ruling was
directly relevant and made the Fibreboard settlement insupportable.
``Some people just can't take a hint,'' Laurence Tribe of Harvard
Law School, the lawyer representing the challengers, said in an
unusually breezy introduction to his successful petition seeking
court review.
</P>
<P>
   Disabled Prisoners
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the court turned down an appeal by California
that challenged Congress' constitutional authority to bring
disabled state prison inmates within the protection of the
Americans With Disabilities Act. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled
that the act did apply to state prisoners as a matter of statutory
interpretation, but did not address the constitutional issue raised
by this case, Wilson vs. Armstrong, No. 97-686.

 Includes a black-and-white slide of Harry Houdini in a scene from
``Biography.'' 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who tune in A&AMP;E's popular program ``Biography'' each
night may not know who they're getting, but they know what to
expect: a nonjudgmental, hour-long portrait of a prominent person.
</P>
<P>
   There is no protocol to the selection _ with more than 500
episodes of ``Biography'' aired thus far, the subject range has
veered from figures legendary _ such as Jesus, Attila the Hun and
Nostradamus _ to offbeat _ Houdini, Santa Claus and Benedict
Arnold. The famous _ Amelia Earhart, W.C. Fields, Bing Crosby _
have mingled with the notorious _ Adolf Hitler, Howard Stern, John
Gotti. Each night, a new life unfurls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biography's'' succinct formula has also made it a phenomenon
in television-industry circles. In the United States, it's far and
away A&AMP;E's top-rated show. In the past few years, it's even
outranked CNN's ``Larry King Live'' in the ratings, a feat all the
more impressive when you realize that ``Biography'' only went from
once-a-week to nightly format in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   It took time for ``Biography'' to grow in the United States.
However, according to its executive producer, Michael Cascio, the
show became an immediate hit in an unlikely market: Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians just got the show faster,'' Cascio says. ``We were
embraced more quickly by the Canadian audience, because I think
they know documentaries better than the U.S. audience. And we hear
disproportionately from our Canadian viewers, because they're also
pretty knowledgeable about what works and what doesn't. They love
the show.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the television program itself, which now airs seven days
a week, the franchise also includes a glossy monthly magazine with
a circulation of 350,000 and a best-selling video series.
</P>
<P>
   The show's popularity has also resulted in a `Saturday Night
Live' skit in which affable host Jack Perkins, who shares
weeknight-host duties with Peter Graves, was portrayed as a
scotch-tippling blowhard. Maybe not the best advertisement _
Perkins himself was reportedly not amused _ but it demonstrates
that the show is now part of popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other night,'' Cascio says, ```Biography' was the answer
in final `Jeopardy.' A couple of years ago, we were happy if
somebody just mentioned to us they'd seen the show. Now we're a
parody on `Saturday Night Live.'
</P>
<P>
   ``In the most recent U.S. TV Guide,'' he adds, ``Julia Roberts
said her favorite show is `Biography.' And we're still, like,
`Somebody noticed!'''
</P>
<P>
   As with most quality television series, a lot of hard work goes
on behind the scenes on ``Biography.'' With the addition of the
weekend versions, ``Biography This Week'' and ``Biography for
Kids,'' the series demands a hefty 130 episodes a year.
</P>
<P>
   To feed the beast, A&AMP;E employs a network of nearly 500
producers, writers, researchers, editors and various technical
staff to assemble the shows. At any given time, there are more than
100 in production, and that means various stages of research,
preproduction or postproduction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much that goes into these things,'' Cascio says.
``Much of the time is spent assembling the visuals, but research
takes equal status: We're very rigorous and we source everything.
We're not going to say J. Edgar Hoover wore a dress unless we're
really convinced that is a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, it takes a few months to properly construct a
``Biography,'' but there are also those occasions when Cascio and
his staff have to move fast, particularly when it comes to
``Biography This Week,'' which profiles that week's biggest
newsmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come in Monday and it's like: Who is it this week?,''
Cascio says. ``And it's not just when someone dies. We did Kenneth
Starr, the Unabomber ... Every week we have to move fast. It gives
us what we feel like is a bit of an edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Another clever ``Biography'' innovation has been the
well-promoted Theme Weeks, in which five personalities are linked
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps reinforce the idea we're on five days a week,'' says
Cascio, who created the concept. ``Now it's a game with us to come
up with new ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Theme Weeks in recent memory have included ``Great Monsters'' _
Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr. _ ``Poor Little Rich
Girls'' _ Christina Onassis, Camilla Parker Bowles, Doris Duke _
and ``Addicted to Fame'' _ Andy Warhol, Tennessee Williams, Truman
Capote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our highest-rated week was `Attention, Shoppers,' which was
about the Woolworths, Marshall Fields and J.C. Penney,'' Cascio
says. ``We ran it during the holiday season, so it tied into what
most viewers were probably doing at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ``Biography'' is like public television, except
that there are no pledge-drive breaks. Cascio takes obvious pride
in the fact that he's developed a television series which, while
adhering to a rigid 44-minute format, nevertheless manages to both
enlighten and entertain.
</P>
<P>
   The tough part, of course, is deciding who gets the
``Biography'' treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, some subjects appeal to some people more than
others,'' he says. ``The most satisfying thing for me is when we do
someone like Oscar Levant. He was this neurotic, piano-playing side
character in movies, and he was a favorite of mine, but I thought,
`Who's going to know who he is?'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we took a chance, and it did a wonderful rating _ a
terrific rating. Now a lot more people know about Oscar Levant.''
</P>
<P>
   Cascio also takes a measure of pride in the fact that
``Biography for Kids'' is part of the curriculum in school systems
across the United States. And the franchise keeps growing, with
plans for an all-``Biography'' cable channel in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, ``Biography'' has plenty of material.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in no danger of running out of people any time soon,''
Cascio says confidently. ``Look at the people in recent history,
and then of course there's traditional biographies from history.
And then there's revisionist versions of the same people, so ... As
long as there are people, there'll be `Biography.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you ever tried to buy a dress you couldn't see?
</P>
<P>
   I have, because I'm blind.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, I used to shop with friends. I stopped doing so
after an incident which showed me that I needed to be more
discriminating about their tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Happily bringing home a dress which a friend had helped me
choose, I modeled it for my husband, Don.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fit is great,'' he said, ``but do you like all those huge
fish?''
</P>
<P>
   The dress went back.
</P>
<P>
   Now I rely on Don and my guide dog Misty as my shopping
partners. On a recent visit, we entered the store and made a
beeline for the dress department.
</P>
<P>
   Don saw two or three salespeople scatter, and the aisles
emptied, as if a bomb threat had just come in.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment we were puzzled _ and then I realized that the
threat was about a foot in front of me. I don't blame them,
actually: Once I too was uneasy around large dogs. Although she is
better behaved than most children, I know a 65-pound German
shepherd is imposing.
</P>
<P>
   A brave saleswoman approached us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I help you?'' she said to my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm looking for a dress,'' I replied _ since I would be
wearing it, not him. ``Maybe something in red or white.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Red or white,'' she said, very slowly and loudly _ though my
hearing is fine. I managed not to fall as Misty jumped back onto my
feet, frightened by the woman's booming voice.
</P>
<P>
   Don was distracted, too. I heard him rustling through hangers on
a nearby rack. I called his name softly to get his attention, but
another man answered my call. What were the chances of two Dons
being in earshot?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great!'' my Don said, holding up a treasure.
</P>
<P>
   I swept my hand over the dress to examine it. It had a neckline
that plunged to the hemline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmm,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   I'm in good shape _ I walk three miles daily with Misty _ and I
stay current with fashion, but I'm positive this costume would have
looked best on one of the Spice Girls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I chose three dresses to try on. Before I could start
for a dressing room, however, another shopper distracted Misty,
even though the harness sign reads: ``Please do not pet. I'm
working.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Your dog reminds me of my Max, whom I recently put to sleep,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help being sympathetic. We discussed her loss for 15
minutes, until Don came back. He told me the route to travel to the
dressing room. I commanded Misty: right, left, right and straight
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   We wove our way past several small voices: ``Mom, why is that
dog in the store?'' ``Mom, is that a dog or a wolf?'' And, my
personal favorite, ``But that lady's eyes are open.''
</P>
<P>
   I trust such parents to explain: ``The lady is giving her guide
dog commands. Her dog is a helping dog. They're partners.''
</P>
<P>
   I wonder whether this positive message is being communicated,
however _ I once heard an adult say, ``Oh, there's one of those
blind dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   Other people, though well-intentioned, can interfere with my
effective use of Misty.
</P>
<P>
   Guide dogs are highly trained and very dependable, but
occasionally make potentially dangerous mistakes. On my way through
the aisles, Misty bumped me into a pointed rack, requiring my quick
action. I used a firm tone to correct her, and she flopped to the
ground like a dying actress.
</P>
<P>
   Witnessing this performance, another shopper chastised me for
being cruel. I was shocked. Misty's pride was hurt, but I needed to
point out the error in order to avoid future mistakes. If I did not
discipline her, what would prevent Misty from walking me off a curb
into traffic?
</P>
<P>
   Composing myself, I was delighted by the saleswoman's
suggestion: ``Can I take you to your dressing room?''
</P>
<P>
   I was less delighted when she grabbed me and pushed me ahead
while Misty trailed us on a leash.
</P>
<P>
   I wriggled out of the woman's wrestling hold. Gently pushing her
ahead, I lightly held her elbow in sighted-guide technique _ so
called because the person who sees goes first.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better,'' I said. ``Please put my hand on the door
knob. I'll take it from here.''
</P>
<P>
   In the room, Misty plopped down and sighed with boredom. I
sighed with relief that she was still with me. Once, I was so
preoccupied with trying on clothes that Misty sneaked out beneath
the dressing-room doors. I heard her tags jingling as she left, but
was half-dressed and couldn't retrieve her. Fortunately, Don was
outside the door and snagged her leash.
</P>
<P>
   I modeled the dresses for Don and, feeling numb, bought all
three.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the store, Misty's magnetism, like the Pied Piper,
attracted a toddler who draped himself over her. She remained calm
as he tried to ride her, until his fun was halted by his frantic
mother.
</P>
<P>
   When we returned to our car, I give Misty a treat and lots of
praise. A good day's work deserves a good day's pay _ for both of
us.

 Includes a 300-word sidebar 
 By ROUL TUNLEY  
 c.1998 Family Circle  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It started as an innocent walk in the countryside. It ended as a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Parrish and her children, 9-year-old Blake, 6-year-old
Chase and 2-year-old Skye, had taken many walks in the rolling
hills around their hometown, Waukesha, Wisc.
</P>
<P>
   But that day in 1992 was especially inviting. It was the first
warm day of spring, and there wasn't a trace of snow. They knew
they might find wild asparagus, so they headed for the tall grass.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in shorts, they pushed their way through the hip-high
sea of green, marveling that they had the place to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never occurred to us that people might have been staying
away for a reason,'' Parrish says.
</P>
<P>
   That night Parrish picked a tick from Blake's ear.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the whole family came down with flulike symptoms _
the whole family, that is, except for Parrish's husband Wayne, who
hadn't gone on the walk.
</P>
<P>
   Nagging ill health plagued Parrish and her children all summer.
Then, in September, Chase had a stroke. This was followed by a
second a month later, and then a third.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors were at a loss, and could only suggest that the family
seek a milder climate. And so the Parrishes moved to Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's strokes stopped, but the children continued to have
health problems. Skye would fall down for no apparent reason, and
the boys continued to have flulike symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   One day Parrish found a strange rash on her calf, but by the
time she got to her doctor's office, it had disappeared. She asked
the doctor to test her for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just laughed at me, saying that everybody thought they had
Lyme disease,'' she recalls. ``If he had only tested me for Lyme
disease, it might have saved us years of agony, to say nothing of
thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   But that visit did accomplish something: It convinced Parrish
not to rely on doctors alone. She began spending hours at the
library, poring over medical texts and journals for symptoms that
matched her family's.
</P>
<P>
   Then, one day in 1995, Chase had another stroke. Panicked,
Parrish insisted that doctors test him for Lyme disease, refusing
to sign any release forms until the test was done. The results
revealed that Chase did indeed have the disease _ as did the whole
family, according to subsequent testing, except for Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   From her studies Parrish knew that Lyme disease is an infection
caused by a spirochete _ a type of bacteria _ called Borellia
burgdorferi, which is carried by some deer ticks. If diagnosed
early, it is easy to cure with antibiotics. But, left untreated, it
can cause arthritis, eye complications and neurological and
cardiovascular problems.
</P>
<P>
   After AIDS, Lyme disease is the fastest-growing disease in the
United States. In 1995 there were 11,700 reported cases, while in
1996 there were 16,455 _ an increase of 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While her family underwent an ongoing regimen of intravenous
antibiotics, Parrish continued her research. She learned that Dr.
Charles Ray Jones, a noted Connecticut-based pediatrician, was
perhaps the nation's leading authority on the disease. She called,
and he agreed to see her children.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by the support of her church _ the congregation raised
$4,000 to pay for the trip _ the Parrishes traveled to Connecticut.
Jones confirmed the diagnosis, and told Parrish about a new
experimental treatment conducted by William Fife, a professor at
Texas A. &AMP; M. Health Science Center in College Station. He
suggested the Parrishes try it.
</P>
<P>
   The month-long treatment requires patients to sit in a
hyperbaric chamber wearing helmets flooded with pure oxygen in an
attempt to destroy the bacteria. Because the procedure is
experimental, there would be no charge, but the plane fare and the
cost of a month's lodging and food would come to $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Help came from an unexpected source: New York Yankees owner
George Steinbrenner, a Tampa native, who saw a television program
on the Parrishes' plight and immediately sent them a check to cover
all costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Parrishes' situation improved somewhat after the
hyperbaric-chamber treatment, but Jones is doubtful that they can
be cured by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symptoms can be alleviated so they can live more normally,''
he says, ``but because the disease got such a big head start,
they'll probably always have some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In the year since the chamber treatment, the children have
continued to rack up a number of hospitalizations. And last winter,
Parrish herself was diagnosed with an inoperable brain aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   For the Parrishes, every new day can usher in a new worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the sun's out one minute, and the rain comes rolling
in the next,'' Wayne Parrish says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Parrish fights to maintain a normal family life and tries
to keep everyone's spirits up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we've been able to cope because we don't let things
get us down,'' she says. ``I now have a routine. Whenever we have
to go to the hospital, I call one of the pastors and ask him to
pray. Somehow we get through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard people say they live from day to day,'' Parrish
says. ``In our case, we live from hour to hour, never knowing what
might happen next.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I'm sure of is that I will rely on prayer and
love and support from friends and family _ for everything,'' she
says. ``Believe me, it works!''
 &UR; SIDEBAR: LYME DISEASE: THE FACTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much remains unknown about Lyme disease, but some facts have
been determined:
</P>
<P>
   + It's a relatively new disease.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme disease was first discovered in the United States in the
1970s, when an unusually high number of children in Lyme, Conn.,
developed rheumatoid arthritis. A mother suspected the outbreak was
not a fluke, and persisted in her campaign until medical experts
confirmed her hunch.
</P>
<P>
   + It's a bacterial infection.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme is an infection caused by a spiral-shaped bacteria called
Borellia burgdorferi, named after the doctor who identified it.
</P>
<P>
   + It's transmitted by ticks.
</P>
<P>
   A bite from a tick that carries the bacteria can pass the
disease on to humans. Dogs, cats and other animals can carry the
tick.
</P>
<P>
   + It's widespread.
</P>
<P>
   All 48 mainland states have reported cases, but Lyme is most
prevalent in the Northeast. The largest number of cases, in
descending order, are found in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey,
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   + It's been spreading until recently.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1996 the number of cases soared each year. But in 1997
cases were down, perhaps because of drier weather or because people
were learning how to protect themselves from Lyme.
</P>
<P>
   + Stop ticks, stop Lyme.
</P>
<P>
   Ticks prefer wooded or grassland habitats. Shaded lawns can
harbor ticks, although most lawns are too short and dry to support
them.
</P>
<P>
   + It's a summer disease.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-risk months are from May through August.
</P>
<P>
   + It can be hard to spot.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosis is tricky _ early blood tests of Lyme patients often
show up negative. Symptoms are so similar to those of other
ailments, such as flu or arthritis, that anything except a clinical
diagnosis is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The recent discovery of an antibody in the spinal fluid of Lyme
patients, however, may make it easier to detect the disease in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   + It is often curable.
</P>
<P>
   Lyme is treatable and is not contagious. If it is detected
early, antibiotics can practically ensure a cure. When it goes
undetected for months or years, as with the Parrishes, it can be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   + Help is on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Two different vaccines for Lyme are currently being tested.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on the disease, its diagnosis or its
treatment, call the American Lyme Disease Foundation at (800)
876-LYME.

MANHATTAN'S SKYLINE SHIELDS THE STREETS FROM LIGHTNING
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By C.CLAIBORNE RAY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Do buildings in Manhattan need lightning rods? I never see
any.
</P>
<P>
   A. Although historically speaking, New York City is less prone
to thunderstorms than many areas of the country, the island of
Manhattan is not immune to lightning. For example, the Empire State
Building is struck by lightning an estimated two dozen times a
year, on average.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Manhattanites is that modern high-rise
buildings have built-in lightning protection systems. Because the
highest object in the area runs the greatest risk of being hit by
lightning, the tall, protected buildings help shield lower
structures.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning is an electric charge trying to complete a circuit,
and it seeks the shortest route to earth to do so. A lightning
protection system provides it with such a path to the ground,
carrying the current around the structure.
</P>
<P>
   The best time to plan the system is when the building is still
on the drawing board, according to the United Lightning Protection
Association, an industry group. A complete lightning protection
system, consisting of air terminals, bases, conductors and
groundings, can be concealed within the framework of the structure.
</P>
<P>
   People who are outside in a thunderstorm, even in Manhattan,
should take shelter in a substantial structure (a bus shelter will
not do) or failing that, a fully enclosed metal vehicle, the
National Lightning Safety Institute advises. They should stay
inside, away from water, windows, phone lines and appliances, until
30 minutes after the last thunderclap.

 By AVA L. SIEGLER  
 c.1998 Child magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``How come you're sitting alone in your room?'' asks 5-year-old
Rosalie's mom. ``Why don't you go outside and play with your
friends next door?''
</P>
<P>
   As parents, we worry when we see a child by herself. Is she sad?
Is she feeling left out? Does she have trouble making friends? Is
she getting sick?
</P>
<P>
   But being alone from time to time is essential to every child's
well-being. It's only in solitude that a child gets a chance to
think, reflect and discover, to renew and replenish her energies,
and to have time and space for creative work.
</P>
<P>
   Here are ways to think about your child and solitude.
 &UR; BIRTH TO AGE 1 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's so exciting to have a newborn that it's hard to keep your
hands off him. And certainly babies flourish with lots of love and
attention.
</P>
<P>
   But even the tiniest infant needs some time to himself _ time to
watch his mobile move in the sunlight or listen to the sounds in
the street _ so that his growing brain can learn to make sense of
what he sees and hears.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving your little one to his own devices for a few minutes at
a time encourages him to become more curious about the world and
helps build his self-reliance. After all, a baby who can amuse
himself is a baby who is learning to build and rely on his own
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Take your cues from your child. Some babies have an independent
temperament and are happy to watch the world from their infant
seat. Other babies need your constant presence to feel comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a youngster who can't be without you, try to balance
care and comfort with some moments alone. Even a 3-month-old can
spend five minutes lying on a blanket on the floor while playing
with a squeaky toy or rattle.
</P>
<P>
   And be sure to take advantage of any such time. Use those few
free moments to put your feet up and enjoy some well-earned
solitude of your own.
 &UR; 1 TO 3 YEARS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once your child begins to walk and talk, all kinds of
possibilities open up. Mobility means that she can literally walk
away from you if she wishes, separating herself from your authority
and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   The development of language contributes to this independence: A
toddler's adorable chattering _ ``Where's Bunny? Bunny loves Katie.
Katie is a good girl'' _ helps to fill the space left by these new,
self-initiated separations.
</P>
<P>
   She may express a desire for privacy for the first time, and
start to recognize some of the positive meanings of being alone _
feeling like a big girl, being able to do things by herself _ as
well as the negative connotations, such as feeling left out or
anxious without a grown-up around.
</P>
<P>
   At this age, parents often begin to use time-outs as punishment.
Make sure your child understands that a time-out is not about being
left alone, but rather about taking time to consider what she's
done wrong or to calm down after a tantrum.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, a child this age still needs adult supervision.
Create a space near you where your little one can play while you
watch from a distance. Learning to enjoy this kind of semisolitude
will help your child feel comfortable with being completely alone
when she gets older.
</P>
<P>
   Remember also that putting a child in front of a television is
not the same as helping her to play on her own. Television shapes
and directs your youngster's thoughts and feelings, while solitary
play enables her to think and feel whatever she wants.
 &UR; AGES 3 TO 7 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time your child reaches this age, his growing
intellectual awareness, physical competence and maturing judgment
make it possible for him to spend some real time alone _ digging in
the back yard, playing with dinosaurs in his room, building a
hospital with Legos on the porch.
</P>
<P>
   While you still need to keep watch, a young child can generally
be left alone for 10 minutes to 20 minutes before being checked on
by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   At this age, kids experience a lot of intellectual and emotional
growth that is nurtured by solitude. Your child is using his alone
time to figure out how to make decisions without you, how to
exercise his judgment and how to develop his fantasy life.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, your youngster's need for privacy is expanding.
Kids this age want to have their own thoughts and ideas, their own
secrets and their own surprises. Solitude gives your child the
opportunity to shape a separate, independent personality and also
to strengthen his ability to think about and manage the increasing
challenges in his young life.
</P>
<P>
   Try to have your child spend at least 15 minutes a day on his
own in a safe environment, occupying himself without the
participation of his parents or playmates.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize the significance of solitude to your child, make an
effort to respect his time alone: ``Dinner's ready, but we can wait
until you finish your puzzle, since you're almost done.''
Similarly, encourage him to respect your solitude: ``Mommy needs to
finish reading this chapter right now _ I'll come and tell you a
story in a few minutes.''
 &UR; AGES 7 TO 10 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By the time your child is 7 or 8, she's become a thinking
person. Now she can read, write, figure things out and come up with
ideas of her own.
</P>
<P>
   Solitude provides her with further opportunities to learn,
letting her focus on and pursue her own interests and hobbies
without distraction. She can also use time to herself to develop
habits of concentration and study that will serve her well in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   But many kids this age have difficulty being alone. With their
developing social skills, making, keeping and spending time with
friends is extremely important. That's one reason why doing
homework alone in one's room can feel like such a tremendous
struggle. In fact, many kids have trouble distinguishing between
being alone and being lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty or 30 minutes of alone time every day provides your
grade-schooler the important opportunity to develop a rich inner
world of thoughts and feelings that will help her be alone, not
lonely.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is such a thing as too much solitude. A child
who retreats to her room for hours at a time, who has difficulty
joining family or friends, or who consistently turns down chances
to be with others may be anxious, depressed or experiencing
academic or social problems.
</P>
<P>
   If you think this might be the case, it's more important than
ever to keep the lines of communication open. Encourage your child
to talk about her feelings and share what's happening at school.
</P>
<P>
   Your youngster's teacher or doctor can provide additional ideas
on how to help, as well as referrals to a specialist if necessary.
 &UR; AGES 10 TO 12 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As your child approaches the teen years, his need for solitude
will increase: He's likely to come home from school and spend most
of his time locked in his room.
</P>
<P>
   This is because the preteen push for independence causes a shift
from the need for attachment to a need for separation. Privacy
takes on important new meanings, including the opportunity to
explore one's thoughts and one's body without the scrutiny or
supervision of others.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, being alone gives your preteen a chance to
explore brand-new sexual feelings without exposure to humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, your preteen will begin to spend time alone
daydreaming and fantasizing about the future. While daydreaming may
seem like a waste of time, it actually helps your youngster
anticipate events and prepare for the complexities of adolescent
life.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, daydreaming _ like so many solitary activities your
child will engage in as he grows _ will help him to meet the
challenges of adult life.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past 18 years, Jack Gray has cultivated blueberries and
rare medicinal herbs on his 14-acre farm outside Eugene, Ore. Maybe
you've plucked fresh herbs from the produce section of your
supermarket or relished plump blueberries from Winter Green Farms.
If so, you've enjoyed the fruits of Gray's labor.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of his nationwide success, about six years ago Gray
felt a strong urge to grow food for his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I carved out three acres and began growing vegetables for the
community,'' he says, adding that he regards those three acres of
community-supported agriculture as ``the soul of the farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Community-supported agriculture is more than a basket of
vegetables. It's an interdependent, fast-spreading commitment to
the survival of small farms and preservation of agricultural land.
It's a way for people to directly support small organic farms, and
in return to receive healthy, savory produce.
</P>
<P>
   CSA's innovative roots were planted in Japan, where a group of
women concerned about an ongoing increase in food imports and
decrease in the farming population initiated a direct link between
the farmer and the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement _ called teiki, which translates as ``putting
the farmer's face on the food'' _ made its way to Europe in the
early 1980s. By 1985, Indian Line Farms in Barrington, Mass., had
become the first CSA in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are craving a connection to community,'' says farmer
Kerry Sullivan, who started Kimberton Farm outside Philadelphia 11
years ago. ``There's a real hunger to know where our food comes
from and how it's grown.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Biodynamic Farm and Garden Association, an
educational clearinghouse for consumers and farmers which is also
based in Kimberton, Pa., CSA has spread to nearly every state. The
association lists 650 CSAs in its database.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a CSA involves three dedicated groups: the farmer,
the members and the consumers. The farmer raises produce for a
limited number of consumers _ also called sharers _ at a
predetermined price rather than for a general market. The members
are responsible for budget, community events and distribution. The
consumers financially support the farm and reap the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Practices, prices and produce vary within CSAs. Most deliver to
several drop-off points in cities or nearby communities. Some
require payment at the beginning of the season, others quarterly.
Sometimes families split the cost of a share, while others trade
work for produce.
</P>
<P>
   Although not mandated, CSA farms usually are either organic or
biodynamic, a more holistic approach that follows stricter,
self-sustainable farming practices.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship offers members high-quality produce, often at
below-retail prices, and the growers are guaranteed a reliable
market for a diverse selection of crops.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of produce available through a CSA varies from farm
to farm, and from season to season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we have too many rutabagas and not enough plums, or
we experience an unexpected weather tantrum, but that's a risk both
consumer and farmer share,'' says Nigel Walker of Eatwell Farms
outside Sacramento, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who formerly grew organic products for Safeway stores in
England, and his wife, Frances, the granddaughter of a Georgia
peach farmer, prepare 120 baskets a week for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all CSA farms, we strive for a truly sustainable
operation by expanding to provide additional food items such as
honey, fruit, eggs and poultry,'' says Walker, who admits that
about one-third of his sharers may opt out of their weekly baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attrition usually has nothing to do with the occasional okra
or green garlic in the basket,'' he adds. ``Sometimes expectations
are not met, or schedules and drop-off points are inconvenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Cordes discovered Eatwell Farms at her son's preschool in
San Francisco, one of Eatwell's seven city dropoff points.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first I wasn't sure about a bushel of vegetables for three
people,'' Cordes says. ``Then came the exotic surprises _ arugula,
vine-ripe tomatoes and aromatic peaches, artistically arranged
around a weekly newsletter and recipes to spawn spontaneity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Walker contentedly cultivates his crops in California's
winter sunshine, Pete Seely slogs through the snow in Plymouth,
Wisc., to check on his hothouse cucumbers.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers lease land, but Seely owns his 15-acre farm,
Springdale, the oldest CSA in the Midwest. Seely is an
unpretentious man who holds a degree in philosophy, not farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the garden in the Quaker School where I taught that
triggered my interest in farming,'' Seely recalls. ``I quit
teaching, worked on a few farms and, together with my wife,
Bernadette, decided to get back to basics. That was 10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Today Seely delivers to 300 members between Plymouth and
neighboring Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard work,'' he admits. ``Nature has her own voice. A
drought can be disastrous, pests problematic. Crops, like
individuals, have their own personality _ some like water, others
don't. Pumpkins prefer space, lettuce likes compact quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks,'' he says.
``There's an incredible sense of community and commitment in my
life. I grow food for people I care about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Rice is one of those people. A longtime Springdale
member, Rice says Springdale is worth the $410 a year her family of
three pays to have Seely's farm produce delivered to Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's organic, it's healthy and it has taught me to eat
seasonally. I can't wait to dive into the red-tinged lettuce, dusty
root vegetables, fresh eggs and Bernadette Seely's recipes,'' says
Rice, who works on the farm in her spare moments.
</P>
<P>
   Roots run deep in Seely's CSA. When the farmer needed to invest
in new equipment, the families pulled together and obtained a
low-interest loan, something Seely says he wouldn't have been able
to do without community members.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's the community that organizes a CSA, not the
farmer. Sullivan and his wife, Barbara, were invited by a community
school to spearhead Kimberton Farms. The thriving farm does not
deliver produce _ families come to the farm to retrieve their
bounty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We prepare the baskets, but sharers have access to pick their
own flowers and odd crops such as peas and berries that are too
time-consuming for us to pick,'' Sullivan says.
</P>
<P>
   Kimberton's philosophy is to make sure those who want to
participate can, regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
   ``All members gather together and hammer out a budget for the
upcoming year,'' Sullivan says. ``Budgets vary depending on such
particulars as adding fruit trees or building a chicken coop. We
pass around a hat and let everyone decide what they can afford
based on their income. If the tallied-up papers agree with the
proposed budget, fine. If not, the hat goes around until the budget
balances. Sometimes people trade work for their share, but everyone
gets a share.''
</P>
<P>
   CSAs may not be for everyone. You get what the farmer grows, not
what's in the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers develop their own flavors and specialties,'' says Dave
Blume, founding farmer of Our Farm in Woodside, Calif., a four-acre
spread wedged between San Francisco and San Jose. Our Farm has 65
sharers and, like most CSA farmers, Blume invites members of the
community to visit and get their hands dirty.
</P>
<P>
   ``CSA is not about competition or globalization of food,'' Blume
says. ``It's about community and generosity. Even though CSA is a
flyspeck on the belly of big agriculture, it does what traditional
farming cannot always do _ it supports the farmer communally.''

`LICENSED TO KILL': THE UGLINESS AT WORK IN ATTACKS ON
HOMOSEXUALS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1977 Arthur Dong, a young San Francisco documentary maker,
narrowly escaped from four teen-agers on a gay-bashing spree. The
boys then got hold of a priest, who they thought was homosexual,
and inflicted severe head injuries. It's not the sort of experience
that is easily forgotten, and 20 years later the memory impelled
Dong, who had since won awards for ``Coming Out Under Fire,'' a
history of homosexuals in the military, to turn his camera on seven
men who have been convicted of assaulting and in some cases killing
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The answers to his question ``Why did you do it?,'' drawn from
police interrogations as well as his own interviews, are not easily
categorized. But in these disjointed and possibly dishonest
responses you can find plenty of ugliness at work.
</P>
<P>
   There are simple predatory attacks on people who are seen as
effeminate, vulnerable and sometimes engaged in risky cruising;
there are murderous outbursts justified by biblical injunctions or
by claims of past abuse by pedophiles; there is an ideological stew
that lumps together homosexuals, flag burners and people who are
against school prayer as fit targets of attack, and there are
intimations that anxiety about sex feeds the impulse toward
violence.
</P>
<P>
   One murderer says that his ``rage came from nowhere.'' A young
man says that being touched by an older man ``made me furious.'' A
fan of Pat Robertson, the television evangelist seen here
denouncing homosexuality, says, ``I was disgusted with these
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   There are expressions of remorse, whether at their crimes or
their long sentences you can decide. Dong uses newsreels and police
videos effectively to document the brutality behind the words.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to sort out candor from make-believe, dissimulation
from rationalization, manipulation from confusion in these
confessions. What are we to make of the super-articulate Minnesota
man, now serving two concurrent life sentences for murder and
attempted murder?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gay preferences,'' he says, ``but I don't really
embrace the gay community, and I'm religiously hostile to them. I
mean, there's a lot of contradictions there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no criticism of ``Licensed to Kill'' to observe that it
offers no certain or novel answers to ``Why did you do it?'' What
the program does reveal is a free-floating hatred that finds its
victims in a group already subject to discrimination. Nothing,
alas, new in that.

 GM TO EXPAND INVESTMENT IN BUILDING TRUCKS IN CHINA 
 (fb) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ General Motors announced on Monday that it
would invest $100 million in a joint venture with a Chinese company
to make pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles in northeastern
China.
</P>
<P>
   Coming on top of GM's $1.5 billion project to assemble a
Buick-style passenger car in Shanghai, the new plan reflects
optimism about the car market in China.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the current economic crisis in Asia, international
carmakers were expressing doubts about the buying potential in
China and complaining about the bureaucracy, bad distribution and
ever-shifting policies that made the car business here unusually
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   GM has already had a bad experience in Shenyang, the
northeastern Chinese city where a plan to spend $132 million to
make light trucks never really got off the ground. Production
started in 1992 but was suspended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of abandoning that project GM executives said Monday
that they would increase their investment to $230 million and try
another tack. They have a new partner, First Auto Works, which took
over GM's previous partner, Jinbei Automotive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the market is better, and the automobile agreement is
better,'' Stan Clemens, GM's executive director for truck
development in China, told Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the agreement, the new venture will
produce a Chevrolet Blazer sport utility vehicle and a revamped
Chevrolet S-10 crew-cab pickup. Production will start in the year
2000, with 4,000 vehicles assembled in the first year, increasing
to an eventual rate of 50,000 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   GM's new partner, First Auto Works, a large state-owned
automaker with 47,000 employees, can produce about 700,000 light
trucks a year. First Auto Works has 19 manufacturing subsidiaries
and operates 10 other businesses as well.
</P>
<P>
   The car market in China looks gloomier now than it did in 1995,
when GM was one of the car companies competing to win the right to
form a partnership with the Shanghai Automotive Industrial Corp.,
one of China's most profitable state-run industries.
</P>
<P>
   A finalist against the Ford Motor Co. and the Toyota Motor
Corp., GM apparently won the deal by offering Chinese car industry
officials what they most wanted: a top-of-the-line model. GM also
promised to manufacture engines and automatic transmissions, to
invest in parts making and to build a design and testing plant.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as GM completes its $1.5 billion plant in Shanghai, the
first Buick is expected to roll off the assembly line at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear how long it will take for that investment to
pay off. In a country where per capita income is $350 a year, the
Shanghai-made Buick is expected to cost more than $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   GM did not disclose the price for the sport utility vehicle and
pickup trucks to be made in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
   The sport utility vehicle will likely compete with the Chrysler
Corp.'s Cherokee, made by Beijing Jeep, which was the first
American car-making project in China when it was opened by American
Motors in 1984. A Cherokee now sells for about $23,000.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing Jeep sold 26,000 Cherokees in 1996. Chrysler executives
have said they expect to sell only about 13,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have dropped in part because government ministries have
abandoned a previous practice of routinely ordering Cherokees for
their various ministries and offices. The army and public security
services used to buy 70 percent of the production each year.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign car makers have had it even worse. PSA Peugeot
Citroen abandoned a car-assembly plant in the southern city of
Guangzhou last year, citing irreconcilable differences with its
local partner. Daimler-Benz has gotten bogged down in negotiations
over a plant to build mini-vans in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
   The only foreign car maker that has done well in China is
Volkswagen, which makes a simple, no-frills sedan called the
Santana, adopted as the standard taxi cab in many Chinese cities.
It has captured almost half the sedan market in China, which still
totals fewer than 500,000 vehicles a year.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have said that they aim to become one of the top
three auto makers in China in the coming years by taking 15 percent
the market. The company now operates 18 ventures in China, counting
its Delphi Automotive Systems and Delco Electronics component
companies.

 (JT)  
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A month before Hollywood discovered him, diverting his
singing career and the course of music history, a 26-year-old tenor
named Mario Lanza stopped here for an open-air concert with his
newly formed Bel Canto Trio. Showered with bravos and raucous
whistles, Lanza was pronounced a sensation, ``born to sing.''
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, half a century later, on a crystalline blue
evening with the city's landmark towers stitched in light, Chicago
turned out at the same Grant Park for a tribute to the myth-laden
star from South Philadelphia whose peculiar death at 38 in 1959 in
Rome is still mourned by legions of international fans even as they
celebrate his exuberant legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly detracting from Lanza's mystique are the persistent
rumors that he fell victim to a Mafia vendetta after canceling his
appearance at a benefit concert in Naples backed by Lucky Luciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name Mario Lanza brings a smile to just about every music
lover's face,'' said the tenor Richard Leech, who narrated and sang
the orchestral program, which included such Lanza standards as ``Be
My Love'' and ``Because You're Mine.'' Leech performed a similar
Lanza tribute to piano accompaniment for the Cincinnati Opera's
75th anniversary gala in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Although, astonishingly, Lanza sang only three opera
performances in his dozen-year career, heirs like Jose Carreras,
Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti, Jerry Hadley and Dmitri
Hvorostovsky have acknowledged a deep debt to the widely loved if
tormented figure forced into Faustian choices between Hollywood
money and operatic artistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' Leech told the Grant Park audience, ``it was Mario
Lanza, booming from my parents' hi-fi, that was my first exposure
not only to opera but to the tenor voice itself.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from receding as a historical figure, a pompadoured
curio from the early days of television and gossipy film fan
magazines, Lanza is looming ever larger as a cultural and cult
icon, an incarnation of his idol Enrico Caruso and possessor
perhaps of the greatest natural voice of the century, as Toscanini
famously declared in the mid-1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could sing like that,'' Frank Sinatra once told Terry
Robinson, who was Lanza's MGM trainer and became a close family
friend and biographer, ``I would put a bird cage around my head and
wouldn't let anyone near my voice.'' There are still those who
maintain that the Lanza voice was manufactured in the recording
studio and that he lacked the discipline and training to transform
himself into the serious operatic artist that his vocal gift
deserved. But he is also widely being seen as a pioneer of the
crossover phenomenon, an opera singer who bridged the worlds of
Classical and popular music, making opera more accessible to a mass
audience than anyone else until the Three Tenors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look in the record stores, Lanza is making a huge
comeback,'' said James W. Palermo, artistic and general director of
the Grant Park Music Festival, the nation's only municipally
sponsored free Classical music festival, which opened its 64th
summer season on Saturday night with the Lanza tribute. Although
the crowd of perhaps 12,000 fell well short of the 50,000 who came
to hear Lanza in July 1947, it included many younger fans who are
rediscovering him through his recordings and movie videos. It also
brought his daughter, Ellisa Lanza Bregman, from Los Angeles, and
the announcement of her presence drew appreciative ``aahhs'' from
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The signs of a Lanza bonanza, as some are calling it, are
manifold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems every week I'm looking at someone doing a tribute to
Mario Lanza,'' said Derek Mannering, an Irish writer now living in
Chicago who wrote a biography of Lanza, published in Britain by the
University of Calgary Press in 1991 and in Canada two years later.
With at least three earlier books on Lanza out of print, a
warts-and-all biography by a lawyer, Roland Besette, has been
promised for next year, prompting Lanza's daughter, Mrs. Bregman,
to say she will do her own memoir to counter any negative portrait.
</P>
<P>
   Fostered by the Internet, Lanza societies and fan clubs span the
globe, from Australia to Europe and the United States, along with a
year-old newsletter, ``The Lanza Legend,'' published in San Pedro,
Calif., by Lanza's son, Damon, and an associate, Bob Dolfi. In
Philadelphia, the Mario Lanza Institute and Museum puts on an
annual Mario Lanza ball.
</P>
<P>
   A new CD album of previously unissued recordings from MGM,
including a spirited rendition of ``Beloved'' that got him
dismissed as leading man in the film of ``The Student Prince'' in
1952, was released by Turner Entertainment this year. Two other new
albums are set for release in August and September, ``When Day Is
Done,'' from Lanza's 59 shows for Coca-Cola on CBS and NBC in 1951
and 1952, and a stereo remastering of ``Lanza Sings Christmas
Carols.''
</P>
<P>
   BMG Classics, which puts out Lanza's RCA recordings, says that
more than 350,000 CD albums have been sold in the last decade.
Radio stations in Greenwich, Conn., and Cleveland, among other
places, broadcast regular Lanza programs.
</P>
<P>
   His powerful voice, often described as ``a wall of sound,'' is
about to be heard in a new television commercial singing ``Ah,
Sweet Mystery of Life'' for Keebler biscuits, as it was recently
for Mercedes-Benz. His was the voice too in the soundtrack of the
dark Australian film ``Heavenly Creatures,'' about two New Zealand
girls who share an obsession with Lanza and become entangled in
matricide.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of Damon Lanza, a one-man musical revue, ``The
Mario Lanza Story,'' by an actor and singer, Charles Gavoian, has
been playing small stages around the country, with plans now to
open in England where Lanza fever has always run especially high.
And another performer dubiously billed as Lanza's illegitimate son,
Victor Lanza, has also been recreating the Lanza story _
spuriously, the Lanza family says.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Of course, no following like this would be complete without a
premier collector, and the Lanza bonanza has one: Vincent De Fini,
a retired Cleveland newspaperman who has assembled thousands of
Lanza artifacts, including Lanza's license plate (``Lanza,'' what
else?), the floor mats from his gold Cadillac, the pants he wore in
his first movie (``That Midnight Kiss'' in 1949), the hat he wore
in his last film (``For the First Time'' in 1959) and rosary beads
given to Lanza by a dying 10-year-old Newark girl, Raphaela Fasano,
whom the star befriended. ``To tell you the truth,'' said De Fini's
wife Antoinette, ``I feel Mario is a part of our family.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, Leech said before his Lanza tribute: ``He's cool
again. It's okay to say you like Mario Lanza.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who would be Lanza was born Alfred Arnold Cocozza in
Philadelphia on Jan. 31, 1921, the year Caruso died, a convergence
that Lanza later took as a divine sign that his idol's spirit was
guiding him. He was only child of Italian immigrants, Antonio
Cocozza and Maria Lanza.
</P>
<P>
   Young Freddy used to listen to records of Caruso singing ``Vesti
la giubba'' from ``I Pagliacci,'' until, the story goes, one day at
16 he began to sing along in a voice of startling power and tonal
fidelity. Within several years he began serious training and
assumed a more memorable stage name, by slightly altering his
mother's name.
</P>
<P>
   The conductor Serge Koussevitsky enthusiastically took him on
scholarship to Tanglewood, where, in 1942, Lanza sang in ``The
Merry Wives of Windsor,'' the first of his three operatic
performances.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, when he sang in the Army, he married Betty
Hicks, the sister of an Army buddy, and began pursuing his career
in earnest. In the hands of the redoubtable Arthur Judson of
Columbia Artists Management, he and a soprano, Frances Yeend, and a
bass-baritone, George London, formed the Bel Canto Trio, which
toured to ecstatic reviews. After their frenzied welcome in
Chicago, Lanza and Ms. Yeend took center stage at a symphony
concert with Eugene Ormandy at the Hollywood Bowl in August 1947.
Among the enraptured listeners was Louis B. Mayer, who quickly
signed Lanza to a lucrative seven-year MGM film contract sweetened
with a $10,000 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   From his debut in ``That Midnight Kiss,'' in which he sang
``They Didn't Believe Me,'' Lanza never quite escaped Hollywood. He
did, however, interrupt the filming long enough in 1948 to sing two
performances as Pinkerton in a New Orleans Opera production of
``Madama Butterfly'' in St. Louis, his only other complete opera
roles.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, 82, the former MGM trainer and a runner-up for the
1940 title of America, got orders from Mayer to knock 25 to 30
pounds off the new male lead, who had a 50-inch chest and a 19-inch
neck. They did it, but Lanza, who was not big for a tenor, was
forever on a ruinous binge-and-diet cycle.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest screen role came in 1951 with ``The Great Caruso,''
which broke all records at Radio City Music Hall. By age 30, he was
perhaps the world's best-known operatic tenor, but his chances of
getting back to the stage receded. He hit a low point in 1952 on
the set of ``The Student Prince,'' when his rendition of
``Beloved'' was criticized as too flamboyant for the dour prince.
He walked off the set, leaving just his voice behind on the
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   With four children and a lavish life style to support, he sank
into debt. One day in the '50s, Robinson recalled, the fighter
Rocky Marciano visited the Lanza house with the Mafia boss Thomas
Lucchese, who proposed to settle Lanza's debts in return for some
appearances. Lanza threw them out.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 he decamped for Italy to make another movie, ``Seven
Hills of Rome,'' in which he introduced ``Arrivederci, Roma.'' He
and his family lived luxuriously in the formerly royal Villa
Badoglio in Rome, where, again according to Robinson, Lucky Luciano
was an occasional visitor. Lanza, by then suffering from a host of
ills, including phlebitis and high blood pressure, was supposed to
sing at a charity concert Luciano was supporting in Naples in
September 1959 when his overeating and drinking landed him in the
Valle Giulia Clinic. On Oct. 7, 1959, he died unexpectedly from
what the clinic called a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that a stunned Betty Lanza returned from Rome
voicing suspicions that her husband had met with foul play.
Grief-stricken, she died six months later, at 36, of what her
family called a broken heart. Damon Lanza, in his newsletters, has
debunked the speculation of a contract hit by Luciano. But his
sister Ellisa, the only other surviving sibling, who has not always
seen eye to eye with him, said she was still looking into the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Leech said he too was keeping an open mind but that Lanza's
legacy would survive any revelations that emerged. ``He never let
singing be about making a sound,'' he said. ``He lived it.''

BRITAIN LOWERS GAY CONSENT AGE, CREATING A SINGLE STANDARD
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The British House of Commons voted overwhelmingly
Monday night to lower the age of consent for homosexuals to 16,
easily overcoming objections from leaders of the Church of England.
</P>
<P>
   The action, much less contentious than a similar move four years
ago reducing the age from 21 to 18, brings the law into line with
that for heterosexuals and brings Britain into conformity with laws
elsewhere in Europe and with a recent decision by the European
Human Rights Commission. The Finnish parliament passed the same
measure last Monday, and Austria, the one remaining country with 18
as the legal age, is scheduled to follow suit next month. In the
United States the age of consent is set by individual states and is
normally 16 or 17.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers and applause rang out from the packed public galleries
when the huge margin of 207 votes _ 336-129 _ was read out.
</P>
<P>
   The motion, an amendment to a law-enforcement bill, was
supported by Prime Minister Tony Blair and William Hague, the
leader of the opposition Conservatives, and Paddy Ashdown, the head
of Britain's third major party, the Liberal Democrats. The decision
was on a so-called ``free vote'' in which legislators are not bound
by their party's position and can follow their ``consciences.''
</P>
<P>
   The Church of England opposed the change, saying it ``may give
wrong messages both to young people and to our society as a
whole.'' The Anglican bishops said the church and state had a duty
``to protect young people from harm and exploitation and to offer
them a vision of what is good.''
</P>
<P>
   Their statement continued, ``Pressures are at work to legitimize
any and every lifestyle, irrespective of any difference of value
and quality between them. These pressures should be resisted.''
</P>
<P>
   The archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, felt so strongly
about the reform that he personally appealed to the prime minister
to oppose it even though Blair had voted for the first reduction
four years ago and had spoken out forcefully in favor of the new
one.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign four years ago witnessed one of the biggest lobbies
ever organized in the history of the British Parliament, provoking
thousands of letters to lawmakers, public discussions of the
position of lesbian and gay people in British society and a vigil
outside the House of Commons on the night of the vote. A motion
then to lower the age to 16 failed by 27 votes.
</P>
<P>
   The only serious dispute this year centered on an amendment
offered on the floor to make it an offense for adults in charge of
youngsters under 18 to have sex with them. It was voted down
234-194 after the Home Office spokesman, Alun Michael, expressed
sympathy for the notion of protecting youngsters from predatory
adults but said the amendment was a ``technically'' flawed way to
deal with it. He said a government working group would take up the
issue and make a recommendation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the debate, a Conservative legislator, Sir Patrick Cormack
brought jeers and cries of, ``For shame!'' from Labor benches when
he recalled the old saying about the Navy's being ``rum, sodomy and
the lash'' and said, ``I do not believe that every single young man
who followed that way of life was born into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Winterton, another Conservative, also provoked hoots of
derision when he said, ``If the Lord Almighty had meant men to
commit sodomy with other men, their bodies would have been built
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's vote and the days leading up to it passed
quietly, a reflection of rapidly changing attitudes in a
legislature where at least six members are openly homosexual or
lesbian and a government where one avowedly gay cabinet member,
Culture Secretary Chris Smith, attends formal functions with his
longtime male partner.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the motion swarmed into committee rooms to watch
the debate on television while others milled about the entrances to
the Parliament. Among those in the press gallery was British actor
and director Sir Ian McKellen, who in recent years has become an
activist for gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Keen, the Labor legislator who introduced the bill, has a
gay son, and she said that there is enough pressure on a teen-age
boy discovering he is gay without the worry that he might be
breaking the law if he had sex. ``Many of these young people and in
particular their parents want a responsible but an equal law,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action, Keen said, concerned ``discrimination'' rather
than sex at 18 or 16. ``Our laws at the moment discriminate against
many of our young people who are gay young men,'' she said, ``who
start their adult life as a criminal, which has got to be
unacceptable.''

JUSTICES FACE 9 MORE CASES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also SCOTUS and SCOTUS-HARASS) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After issuing decisions in five cases Monday, the
Supreme Court has nine cases left to decide before it completes its
1997-98 term. The court has scheduled additional decision days on
Thursday and Friday, but whether the justices will meet Chief
Justice William Rehnquist's goal of concluding the term on Friday
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Following are brief summaries of the remaining cases; as usually
happens at this time of year, they include a number of the term's
most important cases.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment: Two cases, Faragher vs. City of Boca Raton,
No. 97-282, and Burlington Industries Inc. vs. Ellerth, No. 97-569,
could define the liability of employers for sexual harassment under
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The basic question in
the Boca Raton case, a suit by a former city lifeguard who was
harassed by her supervisor, is whether the city can be held
accountable for misconduct of which it had no direct knowledge. The
Burlington Industries case raises the question of whether an
employee who refused to submit to a supervisor's sexual advances,
and who suffered no adverse consequences on the job, can still
bring a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Line Item Veto: Whether Congress violated the constitutional
separation of powers by giving the president the authority to
cancel portions of appropriations bills he has signed into law is
the question in Clinton vs. City of New York City, No. 97-1374.
</P>
<P>
   HIV discrimination: In Bragdon vs. Abbott, No. 97-156, the court
will decide whether the Americans with Disabilities Act protects
people who have the virus that causes AIDS; the ruling may also
define the scope of legal protection for other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Privilege: The question in Swidler &AMP; Berlin vs. United States,
No. 97-1192, is whether the attorney-client privilege always
survives the death of the client _ in this case, the death of
Vincent Foster Jr., the deputy White House counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Decency test: In National Endowment for the Arts vs. Finley, No.
97-371, the Clinton administration is defending a decency test for
the awarding of federal arts grants.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth Amendment: The court will decide in United States vs.
Balsys, No. 97-873, whether a person who faces deportation can
claim the Fifth Amendment's protection against compelled
self-incrimination on the basis of likely prosecution overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Liability: The question in Eastern Enterprises vs. Apfel, No.
97-42, is whether the government can constitutionally impose
retroactive liability on the coal industry for health benefits for
retired miners.
</P>
<P>
   Double Jeopardy: In Monge vs. California, No. 97-6146, the court
will examine the relationship between ``three-strikes'' laws that
impose added penalties on repeat offenders and the constitutional
protection on double jeopardy.

CLINTON PROVIDES DETAILS OF EFFORTS TO INSURE MORE CHILDREN
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ President Clinton announced a series of
low-cost federal initiatives Monday intended to encourage hundreds
of thousands of poor families who lack health insurance to enroll
their children in state and federal health care programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding many of the health-care themes that Democrats have put
near the center of their domestic agenda this year, Clinton said at
a conference on health and families at Vanderbilt University that
schools, health clinics and a variety of federal government offices
should be used more aggressively to educate low-income parents
about government health care programs such as Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the finest health care in the world, but we still
can't figure out how to give everybody access to it in a quality,
affordable way,'' Clinton said at the conference, which was
organized by the family of Vice President Al Gore, a Tennessean.
``We have to do a better job of turning laws into reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies show that the number of uninsured people in
America is increasing, despite the healthy economy. Health care
experts have said that the reasons include the growth of low-paying
jobs that do not provide health benefits and changes to welfare
laws that have ended cash benefits for many families. In those
cases, experts say, many parents do not realize that their children
remain eligible for Medicaid even after they leave the welfare
rolls.
</P>
<P>
   There are nearly 12 million uninsured children in the country,
government and private studies show. About two in five of those
children, or 4.7 million, are eligible for Medicaid, the
state-federal program that serves the poor. More than 18 million
children are served by Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policies the president outlined Monday, which do not
require congressional approval, the leaders of eight federal
agencies will be required to send letters to 350,000 government
employees urging them to help enroll uninsured children in Medicaid
or state health programs. Information on government health care
programs will also be distributed at thousands of health centers,
schools, welfare offices, tax offices, housing projects and other
agencies that serve low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also announced Monday that the federal government would
begin a study into which brands of cigarettes are most poplar with
teen-agers. The president said the survey, which was also called
for in comprehensive tobacco legislation that died in the Senate
last week, would help focus public pressure on tobacco companies
that tailor their marketing to adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will clearly demonstrate that there is something in the
nature of the advertising that has something to do with this,''
Clinton told reporters outside the White House Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill that was killed in the Senate, tobacco companies
could have been fined if they did not reduce the number of
teen-agers who smoked their brands. Clinton said the federal survey
could be used to target companies for such fines if a tobacco bill
was enacted later this year.
</P>
<P>
   The survey will be made part of a study of drug abuse conducted
by the Department of Health and Human Services each year.

<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korean military forces seized a suspected North
Korean submarine Monday night after it became entangled in fishing
nets in South Korean waters, immediately raising tensions between
the countries.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae-jung of South Korea ordered his armed forces
to step up their defensive posture and to be on the alert for
incursions along the coast.
</P>
<P>
   The capture of the submarine is quite likely to be a setback for
a central policy effort of Kim, a ``sunshine'' policy intended to
show conciliation to the North to ease tensions between the two
Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   The captain of a South Korean fishing boat, Kim In-yong, told
Korean television that he had spotted the dark green submarine
after its periscope had become entangled in drift nets 11 miles
east of the town of Sokcho. He said he saw several crew members in
North Korean uniforms trying frantically to cut the nets.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean military forces rushed to the scene and, under
intensive security, towed the submarine to port overnight. Defense
Ministry officials said they could not confirm the nationality of
the submarine until they had examined it closely, and they are
proceeding carefully, for fear that the crew may still be inside
and planning to blow it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no signs that identify it by country,'' a spokesman
for the ministry, Park In-young, said. ``But it could be a North
Korean submarine, as it is not a South Korean or U.S. submarine.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the submarine was believed to be a Yugo-class
boat, 70 tons and 60 feet long. North Korea is believed to have 14
Yugo-class submarines, used for spying and dropping off special
forces in enemy territory.
</P>
<P>
   While the incident created an anxious stir in South Korea, it
seems for now quite different from an incursion by a North Korean
submarine in September 1996. That submarine ran aground on the
South Korean coast, apparently while trying to drop off armed
commandos, and the crew and commandos all slipped ashore.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the submarine found on Monday was 11 miles off the
coast, and the fishing captain said it had been drifting. He did
not know whether it had lost power.
</P>
<P>
   From an account of the Defense Ministry, the submarine appeared
to have been perhaps 30 miles south of the line that divides North
and South Korean waters.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has not commented so far, but after the incursion in
1996 it said that the submarine had drifted off course and asked
for its return. Eventually it apologized.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugo-class submarine would usually have three to seven people
aboard, and South Korean officials said they believed that the crew
was still on board. South Korean officers tried to communicate with
the crew but did not get any response, and the South Koreans
decided not to open the hatch until they had towed the submarine to
a military base where they could control the area.
</P>
<P>
   North Korean military officers, especially those entrusted with
submarines, have in the past been extremely dedicated and ready to
commit suicide rather than accept capture. But if some of them
agree to cooperate with the South Koreans, a result could be an
intelligence bonanza for the South and for the American analysts
who will also ask to take part in the interrogations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The United States declined immediate comment but said South
Korean officials were briefing them on the incident. ``We don't
have all the facts,'' said a spokesman for the State Department,
James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The finding of the submarine will be a delicate challenge for
President Kim. A longtime dissident who took office in February and
who is still not entirely trusted by the armed forces, he needs to
show that he is tough in the presence of any North Korean
challenge. But too much toughness might endanger his policy of
engaging North Korea economically and building mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
   One fruit of the policy is a landmark meeting Tuesday between
American and North Korean generals in the border town of Panmunjon.
The meeting was set up as a channel of communication in the event
of a crisis, and it is expected to deal with the capture of the
submarine.

<P>
   BOUAFLE, Ivory Coast _ Ibrahim Diarra had no idea what city he
was in when he straggled into the courtyard of the elderly man from
his native Mali recently.
</P>
<P>
   The man offered Diarra, 23, and three teen-age friends shelter
after their escape from a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Wet from the rain, exhausted and famished, all he knew was that
he had just spent four months working on a plantation somewhere in
Ivory Coast in a job that bore a strong resemblance to slavery and
that on this morning, after his second attempt to get away, he was
free.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his bondage, Diarra said, he was sent out at daybreak
each morning, seven days a week, to work fields planted high with
corn and cotton.
</P>
<P>
   Under the stern gaze of an overseer, he and other workers there
had to weed row after row of the crops planted in the dark, rich
soil with their simple hoes and carry countless sacks of harvested
crops the three miles back to the farmhouse. When they were thirsty
they had to fetch water from a distant well.
</P>
<P>
   The only break came in the evenings, when they were allowed to
return to their camp for the only meal of the day _ invariably a
thin corn porridge _ and then were locked inside their mud-walled
pillbox shelter, where they were kept under guard until sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I once told the boss I couldn't do this work anymore,'' Diarra
said, ``and I fled the next day. But they quickly caught me,
stripped me naked, tied my hands and made me sit in the open under
the sun all day. Some of the others who tried to escape were
whipped in front of the rest of us until they bled badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Diarra and his three friends, also from Mali, constitute merely
the tip of an iceberg of thousands of coerced migrant laborers,
many of them children, in this overwhelmingly agricultural country.
As escapees who found someone from their homeland instead of being
snared in the web of overseers, bounty hunters and informers, they
count among the luckiest ones.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is a tale as old as the ages in an Africa of abundant,
hard-to-work land and sparse labor _ seemingly immutable realities
that fed an indigenous slave trade long before the arrival of the
first Europeans. But it is also a near-universal phenomenon and has
been seen from the sugar estates of the Florida Everglades and the
Dominican Republic to the cotton-bearing loam of the Mississippi
Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The ruses that are used to lure and retain the workers from
desperately poor hinterlands of neighboring countries like Mali and
Burkina Faso are just as tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other Malians, Diarra said he was recruited to
do farm work in Ivory Coast by an unscrupulous countryman back home
who promised him $250 for a year's work _ a fortune for many
Malians _ and room and board on a plantation.
</P>
<P>
   He was transported across the border by truck at night. He
realized he had been duped when he reached the northern Ivorian
town of Korhogo and overheard a negotiation between the transporter
and a plantation owner in which he and his fellow travelers were
effectively sold for the equivalent of about $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always told me there was a lot of money to be made
in Ivory Coast,'' Diarra said. ``But as soon as we reached the
plantation, we were locked up and placed under guard. We knew right
away that it was a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ivory Coast's independence movement gained momentum in the
1940s and 1950s as a reaction against the forced labor imposed by
French colonialists bent on building a cash-crop economy based on
cocoa and coffee here.
</P>
<P>
   But today, the wealth of this country, West Africa's most
prosperous, rests to a large extent on the backs of poorly paid
immigrants whose labor has helped make the Ivory Coast an
agricultural giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've found plantations here where the owners keep 45 children
locked in a single room from dusk till dawn, with the only
provision for a toilet being a hole in the wall,'' said Fassiriman
Dembele, the Malian consul to Ivory Coast. His recent work
traveling to towns like Bouafle in the central Ivorian countryside
has brought public attention to the plight of migrant workers from
his country for the first time. The embassy will help Diarra go
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 2 million Malians living in Ivory Coast,'' he said,
``working in every sector of the economy, including tens of
thousands of farm workers. The government cannot afford to admit
the extent of the problem, so they close their eyes. If all of
these workers went home, they could no longer produce crops here.''
</P>
<P>
   An official of the Ivory Coast Ministry of Social Protection,
Mama Fofana Kone, said her government had learned of the plight of
Malian migrant workers only from recent press reports and had begun
an investigation. ``With these kind of charges, we must verify the
information ourselves,'' she said. ``Until then we cannot make any
declarations.''
</P>
<P>
   From the vantage point of Dembele, no better place to begin an
inquiry exists than in his office, where a dozen or more ragged
plantation escapees, most of them children, arrive almost every day
seeking shelter or help in returning home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a bad mistake in coming here,'' said Souleymane Konate,
a shy 12-year-old laborer with downcast eyes who had just reached
Dembele's office at the Malian Embassy the other day. ``But my
parents couldn't clothe me anymore, and there was nowhere to go to
school in our village. I had no choice but to look for work.''

   NEW YORK _ For summer, hairstyles should be no fuss, easy and
casual, to withstand heat and humidity, especially if you spend a
lot of time outdoors. Hair that's long, and of one length, can be
pulled back into a pony tail or pinned into a French twist. Short
hair dries quickly and bares the neck to breezes, winning it fans
this summer like Marla Maples of the formerly long blond tresses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maples' cut is boyish, but short hair needn't be. Jennifer
Lawrence, the head stylist at the Louis Licari Color Group, has
been cutting two variations of short hair into layers that are just
long enough to be worn in slightly different styles.
</P>
<P>
   Both are close to the neck in back but thick, not shorn-looking,
so the effect is feminine. The front may have short chunky layers
around the face or longer layers, perhaps three inches, on top and
in front, which can be worn as bangs, combed to the side or even
slicked back.

AU PAIR TELLS BBC SHE WAS U.S. SCAPEGOAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Louise Woodward, the British au pair convicted of
killing the 8-month-old Massachusetts boy she had been paid to care
for, declared on Monday night in a BBC television interview that
she was innocent and that the American criminal justice system had
prevented her from getting a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything wrong,'' said Ms. Woodward, 20, who left
Boston last week after the state's highest court upheld a judge's
decision to reduce her murder conviction to manslaughter in the
1996 death of Matthew Eappen. ``If anything, I tried to help him as
best I could and didn't do anything to hurt him or harm him in any
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 45-minute interview, on BBC's ``Panorama'' program, Ms.
Woodward said she had been made a scapegoat, particularly by
Matthew's parents, Deborah and Sunil Eappen of Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel it right that the mentality is that somebody has
to pay,'' she said. ``That, well, if the parents didn't do it, who
did; there is only you left. And there was the whole feeling that
somebody has to pay and that somebody had to be me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward expanded on remarks she made last week in which she
accused the Boston district attorney's office of being ``purely
political'' and called the jury pool ``tainted.'' On Monday night
she said she had been used by the system, comparing it unfavorably
with the one in Britain, where the news media are forbidden to
report anything but the barest details about criminal proceedings
outside of trials, which are not televised.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Boston, the prosecutors use the media to pretty much
convict you before you even set foot in the courtroom,'' Ms.
Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   John Mirick, a lawyer for the Eappens in a civil lawsuit against
Ms. Woodward, said they would watch the interview but not comment
until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Woodward's decision to argue her case on television was met
with criticism. The Daily Mirror branded the interview ``An Insult
to Diana,'' saying that Ms. Woodward ``seems to model herself'' on
the Princess of Wales, who spoke to the same interviewer, Martin
Bashir, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``The BBC is now in the gutter,'' the paper quoted Denis
MacShane, a member of Parliament, as saying.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ads, Again, From Anne Klein &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Anne Klein is gambling its reputation on 30 accomplished women,
who will appear in 32 pages of advertising in the August issue of
Elle magazine. It's an understandable yet necessary roll of the
dice for the company: five years ago, it was one of the premier
names in American sportswear, and now it is battling for position.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign will unveil the first bridge collection bearing
the Anne Klein name. The Anne Klein II signature, once on more than
a dozen products including bridge sportswear, has been dropped
except for watches and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is in a turnaround, and an ordinary effort of a
model looking into a camera with a logo underneath was not going to
do the trick,'' said Laura Wenke, the company's senior vice
president for marketing. ``We wanted to get the industry behind us
as well as consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-page spread will run in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and
Mirabella this fall, and smaller selections of the group portraits
will be seen in seven other publications. Anne Klein, which has not
advertised for almost two years, is spending $5 million to $6
million on the ads, Ms. Wenke said.
</P>
<P>
   The photos were taken by Annie Leibovitz and bear more than a
trace of the look she developed for Vanity Fair's fold-out
Hollywood covers.
</P>
<P>
   Marrying the style and substance of real women and men to sell
fashion is not new _ the Gap, Macy's, Donna Karan and Coach have
used the combination effectively. But the wide swath of Anne
Klein's push is remarkable. Among the women featured are Ann
Richards, the former governor of Texas; Anna Deavere Smith, the
actress and playwright; Denyce Graves, the mezzo-soprano; Jenny
Thompson, the Olympic swimmer; Esther Dyson, author and publisher;
Bebe Neuwirth, star of ``Chicago'' and ``Cheers''; Julie Taymor,
the ``Lion King'' director and Sylvia Rhone, the chairwoman of
Electra Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The women each received $1,000 a day, which many donated to
charity, and a $2,000 certificate that can be redeemed at Anne
Klein's employee store, Ms. Wenke said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Back in New York &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The thinning ranks of prominent American designers presenting
collections at the New York shows, to be held July 27-30, will be
bolstered by the return of Donna Karan and John Bartlett. Last
season, Karan, Bartlett and Calvin Klein defected to Milan, where a
growing cadre of designers with global expansion in mind now
introduce their collections, aiming to meet earlier sales and
delivery deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett, who will present his first collection for Byblos on
July 1 during the Italian men's shows, thought it better to keep
his own line in New York this season. The signature collection is
to close the New York shows on July 30 at 7 p.m. His move back to
the United States is not necessarily permanent, Bartlett said.
</P>
<P>
   The same holds for Karan, who plans to return to Milan in 1999.
She is showing in New York this year for a practical reason: to
stay close to home as she oversees the introduction of tailored
suits, jackets and trousers in an offshoot of her secondary line,
DKNY. Licensed to Peerless Clothing Inc., a Canadian company, the
line will be shown with the rest of DKNY sportswear on July 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's DKNY, and DKNY is so much about New York, we
wanted to show it here,'' said Patti Cohen, a senior vice
president.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that summer is here, it's too late to buy summer clothes.
Anyone with a yen for a pair of white pants had to shop for them
while the weather was cold. Tough luck if you've waited until now.
Go into just about any fashion store in June, and you'll find the
remnants of warm-weather clothes that have already been marked down
to make room for the first wave of fall styles.
</P>
<P>
   Because of this situation, designers don't even do summer
collections anymore, but instead include summery clothes in their
late spring deliveries, affording them a short shelf life. So, the
best time to find summer wares is, paradoxically, in October,
November and December, when resort clothes are in the stores. Right
now, designers are showing retailers the resort lines that
customers will find at the end of this year. And designers are very
aware that not all the resort clothes will be heading for holidays
in Miami Beach or the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done an extensive collection,'' Calvin Klein said,
``because it's an important season. Those three months are the one
time women get an opportunity to buy clothes after fall. They know
that the clothes they buy for resort are the clothes they'll wear
in the summer. And from our point of view, it's a long selling
season.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there is more to the resort collections than summery
clothes. There are also citified styles a woman could wear in her
hometown and evening clothes she could wear just about anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell these clothes around the world,'' Klein said, ``but
they're based on how Americans live and travel.''
</P>
<P>
   He has concentrated on natural fibers. There are crisp cotton
shirts, often cropped above the waist, to go with drop-waist skirts
that graze the ankle; unlined linen jackets and elastic-waist
pants; sweaters of cotton or lacy cashmere; a fitted silk shirt
jacket with stretch cotton pants; stretch slot-cotton dresses, and
stretch silk balmacaans.
</P>
<P>
   Military colors like khaki and olive drab raise the clothes to a
high level of sophistication. And Klein believes they look fresher
than the usual navy or black.
</P>
<P>
   Evening is important because of end-of-the-year parties. Klein
has used textured and crinkled silks in the palest blue or ivory in
simple loose shapes or with draping in back, but his favorite
outfit is a low-neck black sweater over a full skirt of dark gray
satin with a slight shimmer. ``It's quintessentially us,'' he said,
``just a sweater and skirt but really strong.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The sweater and skirt for evening were a recurring
theme in many fall collections and, sure enough, can be found in
most of the resort lines being shown now.
</P>
<P>
   In an all white and neutral collection, Donna Karan teamed
hand-knit cashmere sweaters with skirts of layered organdy or
satin. She also experimented with new ways of incorporating burnout
techniques and devised one-piece dresses with panels of fabric that
wrap and tie to look like a T-shirt and skirt. ``Everything is
cotton, cashmere or charmeuse,'' Karan said. ``It's all about how
clothes feel. I don't think it's a question of take away or not
take away.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to all the soft, airy pieces, she showed jackets
with laser-cut edges that look raw and unfinished and eliminate the
need for linings or facings. They look crisp and clean, a very
modern alternative to tailoring and one that will potentially have
a tremendous influence on fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Lauren has also turned away from strict tailoring in favor
of shirtlike unlined jackets, featherweight cashmere sweaters,
dirndl skirts, apron-wrap jumpers, and dresses. ``Everything is
lightweight, easy and very feminine,'' said Buffy Birrittella, the
company's design director for women's wear. ``We're getting rid of
inner facing and everything that adds weight or structure to
jackets.''
</P>
<P>
   While many of the fabrics and colors are light enough to head
south, it is more urban than past Lauren resort collections. He's
used neutrals like taupe and cream rather than true colors, and
instead of swimsuits there are suedes, though the suedes are so
thin and silky they are actually seasonless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Working with our retail stores,'' Ms. Birrittella said, ``we
feel the customer at that time of year is looking for new spring
clothes. She's tired of her winter clothes and is looking for
things that give a lightness to her wardrobe and will carry her
into spring.''
</P>
<P>
   For pure resort wear, there are the Michael Kors, Isaac Mizrahi
and John Bartlett collections.
</P>
<P>
   Kors used mainly aqua, cantaloupe and black for silk tank tops
and cashmere sweaters, knee-length wrap skirts that close with
hidden magnets, shantung clam-diggers and long silk faille skirts.
The collection was a dressy take on sportswear and obviously aimed
more at the woman headed for Palm Beach, Fla., than the one going
to St. Bart's. (His first resort line for Celine spotlights intense
colors like buttercup yellow and robin's-egg blue for separates
that he describes as ``American sportswear meets Riviera chic.'')
</P>
<P>
   Mizrahi's approach to resort, which he terms spa, is: ``What,
besides khakis, is worth buying to take away?''
</P>
<P>
   His solution was unexpected takes on blue denim, including silk
denim, linen denim and, for swimsuits, knitted denim. He also used
violet cotton satin for apron-wrapped culottes, red jersey for a
floor-length sweatshirt dress, gray tropical-weight wool for a
hoodless anorak and natural straw cloth for hot pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to be dressy,'' Mizrahi said. ``The American look
is to be casual. Spa has less to do with fashion than with life
style.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he managed to infuse plenty of fashion into the collection,
but the kind of fashion many women would feel comfortable in.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett's influence was nautical. He used dark navy and white
for sailor pants and skirts of stretch canvas; sailcloth anoraks
and drawstring-waist skirts; leather A-line skirts and sailor
pants, and sweaters of cashmere and silk. He was the rare designer
who used pattern, showing horizontal and geometric stripes for
sweaters, swimsuits and cover-ups. It was sporty without losing the
sexy edge he is known for.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: LINDA MCCARTNEY NEVER LET FAME OBSTRUCT HER
VIEW  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGARETT LOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To be claimed by fame is to be pigeonholed. But Linda
McCartney, who died of breast cancer in April at 56, never seemed
to feel fame's constraining effects on her life or her photography.
</P>
<P>
   She was best known for the unvarnished black-and-white portraits
of rock stars that she took in the mid-1960s to support herself and
her young daughter. After she married Paul McCartney in 1969, she
was invariably identified as his wife (and as a committed
vegetarian and animal-rights activist), but she had the luxury of
broadening and deepening her work throughout the next decades.
</P>
<P>
   A self-taught photographer, Ms. McCartney brought an engaged,
intuitive and minimalist eye to her black-and-white landscapes and
still lifes of the 1980s and '90s. Two dozen or so of these images,
none of which have previously been shown in New York, are on view
at the Bonni Benrubi Gallery, at 52 E. 76th St. in Manhattan,
through July 2. (A memorial service for Ms. McCartney was scheduled
Monday night at Riverside Church.)
</P>
<P>
   These photographs are worlds apart from the rock star pictures
of the '60s and from the 1996 exhibition ``Roadworks'' at the
International Center for Photography Midtown. Those pictures,
mainly street and road scenes, were also published by Bulfinch in a
book of the same title.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCartney's portraits of rock-and-roll stars, which were
compiled in a 1992 book ``Linda McCartney's '60s: Portrait of an
Era'' (Bulfinch), reflect her love for the music. But they also
reflect her untutored eye at a time when the rock scene still had a
brash innocence.
</P>
<P>
   She was the only person with a camera allowed to join
journalists at a high-profile 1966 press reception for the Rolling
Stones aboard a luxury yacht cruising the Hudson, perhaps because
she was young, good-looking and blond. Nonetheless, seizing the
opportunity, she quickly showed that she could take pictures that
caught the freewheeling spirit of her subjects.
</P>
<P>
   She was at the time an occasional photographer and a full-time
receptionist at Town and Country magazine, which had received the
invitation. But her nonchalant pictures, especially a Lisette
Model-like frontal image of Brian Jones slouched back in his seat,
seemingly in mid-yawn and with his legs wide apart, put her on the
rock 'n' roll photographic map.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the pictures in ``Roadworks,'' on the other hand, show
an oddly disengaged and aimless photographer. Although a few of the
enigmatic images taken from cars have a Robert Frank feel to them,
far too many of them have nothing much to say, and many of the
blurred pictures are meaninglessly blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Among the handful of exceptional photographs in ``Roadworks'' is
``Boys on the Beach, Barbados'' (1969), which could be the obverse
of Martin Munkacsi's exuberant picture of three black boys running
into the sea. In Ms. McCartney's photograph, a half-dozen figures,
almost equidistant from one another, look at the gentle waves
rolling out, their still silhouettes beautifully contrasted with
the delicate, silvery marks left on the sand by the waves.
</P>
<P>
   The most stunning image in ``Roadworks'' is ``Out Here,
California'' (1975). As a pickup truck is about to whiz past, a
burly passenger sitting in the flatbed staring right at her, Ms.
McCartney takes the picture. With a surrealistic bluish cast, this
image balances a crisply, almost lovingly detailed truck, from its
pristine exterior to its immaculate hubcaps. It shows the fragile
lines of a bicycle in the back of the truck, the man beside it
looking straight at the camera, his long hair flying, his
sunglasses not hiding his grim eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The body of work currently on exhibit at the Bonni Benrubi
Gallery _ selected by Ms. Benrubi and approved by Ms. McCartney a
few days before she died at her Arizona home _ is titled ``Wide
Open.'' But a large part of the show is, paradoxically, intensely
private. You wouldn't think so from the subject, landscapes, but
the pictures of sea and sky, of trees and of clouds share a
profound aloneness. Grainy and confined to broad strokes of black,
gray and white, and in some instances resembling charcoal drawings,
these platinum prints say less about the human capacity to turn
natural vistas into asphalt and concrete and much more about the
kind of thoughts on Thomas Gray's mind when he wrote, in ``Elegy
Written in a Country Churchyard'':
</P>
<P>
   Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife,
</P>
<P>
   Their sober wishes never learn'd to stray;
</P>
<P>
   Along the cool sequester'd vale of life
</P>
<P>
   They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the quietly elegiac landscapes were taken in the
mid-1980s in Sussex, England, where the McCartneys had a home. One,
titled ``Lone Horse Rider'' (1985), shows the small figure of a
horse and rider on the slight incline of a dark horizon. Beyond it
are low smudges of gray, and above it a huge expanse of white sky.
A decade later, in ``Sand Sea Sky'' _ taken in East Hampton, N.Y.,
the year Ms. McCartney's breast cancer was diagnosed _ a tiny lone
figure sits on a beach, seemingly contemplating the waves washing
up to shore. The sky above, which takes up about four-fifths of the
frame, is a wash of gray and white that turns into roiling black.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the platinum prints, ``Wide Open'' includes
photogravures and silver-bromide prints. ``Wooden Bowl Indian Wood
Cuts'' (1994), a photogravure, has the graceful, minimalist vigor
of a Paul Strand still life and ``Ap and Shadow Painting'' (1996),
also a photogravure, is a dreamily mysterious study of a plastic
horse whose form is echoed in a nearby painting. (``Wide Open''
could have done without the greeting-card-pretty Polaroid
transfers.)
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Ms. McCartney's crisply sharp
silver-bromides, all made in the 1990s, would seem to be another
radical departure from her other work. But they, too, are spare and
the subject quite ordinary, shadows: the shadow of a bent figure on
a hard piece of land, wild mushrooms casting their shadows on the
lawn, the shadow of a beat-up old trumpet hanging on a wall.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in The New York Times on the vegetarian meal Ms.
McCartney cooked at the East Hampton home of the chef Pierre Franey
in 1994, Bryan Miller noted that Ms. McCartney was ``disarmingly
earthy and outgoing,'' and that she cooked without regard to
precise measurements. ``Everything is added in handfuls, pinches,
smidgens,'' he wrote. ``Her favorite measurement is `lots of.'''
</P>
<P>
   Her photography, too, could be disarmingly earthy. But her eye
was definitely precise. In a 1996 silver-bromide print of a glass
teapot, partly filled with hot water and placed majestically
outdoors, its clear lines are offset by the blurred dark background
and tall trees. Reflected in the water are the trees (upside down,
of course). And Ms. McCartney titled the image ``Through a Glass
Teapot,'' perhaps leaving the viewer to add the word ``darkly.''

TREASURY SECURITIES PRICES HELPED BY INCREASE IN DOLLAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prices of Treasury securities were mixed Monday,
supported by a rising dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting of the seven industrial nations over the weekend
failed to produce any new measures to bolster Japan's ailing
economy, thus strengthening the dollar Monday against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   A strong dollar makes investments like U.S. Treasury securities
more attractive to foreign investors, not only for the yield, but
also for the potential of additional gains through currency
translation.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gamba, senior vice president and manager of bond trading at
Cowen &AMP; Co., said Monday's trading session was mostly dollar
driven, but with a little undertone of cautiousness. ``I think the
market was expecting more out of the G-7 meeting, and really there
wasn't anything new or concrete to come out of it that would
stimulate the Japanese economy and reform its ailing banking
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year bond rose 2/32, to 106 20/32. The bond's yield was
unchanged at 5.66 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gamba believes the market will focus Tuesday on the two-year
note auction. ``The two-year notes will have little problem being
absorbed by the market,'' he said. ``The key here is what is
happening overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts agree that the lack of economic reports this week will
mean that bond market participants will focus on overseas events,
the dollar and stock market activity.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries traded well Monday because Asian stock markets had
slumped and investors sought the relative safety of U.S.
investments.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury will sell $23 billion in two-year and five-year
notes this week, with the two-year issue to be sold Tuesday and the
five-year note on Wednesday. In when-issued trading, the two-year
maturity was being offered late Monday at a price to yield 5.47
percent and the five-year note at a price to yield 5.46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Early talk in the market is that yields may need to increase on
the two-year issue to attract investor interest. After this sale,
the Treasury will offer five-year notes on a quarterly basis
instead of monthly. Monday's auctions of the three-month bill came
in at an average rate of 4.99 percent, down from 5.01 percent a
week ago, while the rate for a six-month maturity was 5.12 percent,
up from 5.065 percent. About $4.5 billion in corporate bonds are
expected to be issued this week, but demand has eased somewhat
because of the concern that the Asian economic turmoil could hurt
the U.S. economy and corporate earnings.

BRIEF ITEMS FROM THE WORLD OF SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
 (fb) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Eyes See, but the Brain Decides
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to think of one's eyes as cameras that feed real-time
images into the mind.
</P>
<P>
   But nature doesn't work that way. Those incoming images are
deconstructed at the retina, extensively processed and then
reconstituted somewhere in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists at the Institute of Neurology in London have
explored one of the higher-level stages of processing by sitting
subjects in a brain-scanning machine and showing different images
to the left and right eye in such a way that neither eye could see
the image shown to the other.
</P>
<P>
   When the brain is faced with conflicts of this kind, it tries to
spare the conscious mind the embarrassment of seeing two
contradictory versions of reality by presenting the two images in
alternation. Erik D. Lumer and his colleagues report in the current
issue of Science that this gatekeeping role is performed by a site
in the side and frontal lobes of the brain, far removed from the
optic cortex at the back of the head, where visual input from the
eyes is first routed. This is apparently the first time, Lumer
said, that the frontal lobes have been so clearly implicated in
influencing the content of visual awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Show Greater Tolerance for Contradictions  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contradictions, at least of the intellectual kind, are better
tolerated by Chinese than by Americans, according to a study by
Kaiping Peng, a former Beijing scholar who is now a psychologist at
the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   In a family conflict, Chinese are more likely to urge disputing
parties to agree, without apportionment of blame, whereas Americans
tend first to decide which party is right and then insist the other
capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the American way of dealing with contradiction may be
optimal for scientific exploration and the search for facts because
of its aggressive, linear and argumentative style,'' Peng
concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Clues to the Past Suggest Aggressive Dining by T. Rex
</P>
<P>
   Some of those aggressive, linear American scientists, along with
Canadian colleagues, report in the current issue of Nature their
discovery of the largest known dinosaur coprolite, probably from a
Tyrannosaurus rex that once roamed southwestern Saskatchewan where
the fossil was found.
</P>
<P>
   Coprolite is the paleontological term for fossilized excrement.
</P>
<P>
   Of what possible use is a large slab of lithified feces? The
ordure speaks to T. rex's table manners: the creature chewed its
meals (other dinosaurs) thoroughly, but apparently digested them
less well, the bone fragments being relatively pristine despite
their passage through the T. rexian gut.
</P>
<P>
   Butterfly Wings and the Evolutionary Scale
</P>
<P>
   Those scales on the dinosaur's hide may have metamorphosed into
feathers, as evolution, with its customary economy in making old
structures serve new ends, crafted the bird. But from what existing
structures did evolution create something so special as the scales
on a butterfly's wing?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is the bristle. The sensory bristles that stud a
fly's body have a pattern of development in the embryo similar to
that of the butterfly's scales. Sean B. Carroll and colleagues at
the University of Wisconsin at Madison now report in Current
Biology that the butterfly's scale control gene is related in its
DNA sequence to the fruit fly's bristle control gene.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll suggests that the wings of the first winged insects were
covered with sensory bristles. As butterflies evolved, the bristles
flattened into scales and acquired a palette of colors.
</P>
<P>
   Another clever transformation, but one achieved in minutes, not
the eons of evolutionary time, is the quick costume change
performed by the spirochete that causes relapsing fever. This
bacterium alternates between infecting a tick and the human or
other mammal that the tick may feed on.
</P>
<P>
   A principal difficulty of this mode of existence is that
different defenses are required against the immune systems of each
host. The bacterium can quickly change the proteins that make up
its outer coat.
</P>
<P>
   How does the microbe know when to do this, considering that it
is mindless? Its cue is the rise in temperature as it passes from
the coolness of the tick's salivary glands to a person's warm blood
stream, Tom G. Schwan and B. Joseph Hinnebusch report in the
current issue of Science.

SEATTLE EYES BOTTLING AND SELLING ITS TAP WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHY GEORGE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle gave the world Starbucks, Pearl Jam and Bill
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   How about tap water, too?
</P>
<P>
   The City Council thinks the stuff dripping from our household
faucets is so superior that it should be bottled and sold, just
like Evian or Perrier.
</P>
<P>
   And now the city is about to spend up to $50,000 to study
whether its public water utility should dive into the bottled water
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our drinking water is pure enough to bottle,'' Councilwoman
Margaret Pageler said Monday, moments before the council
unanimously approved the study.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Seattle's Cedar River water is so clean that
Congress exempted it from filtration requirements, council members
said a bottled version should be just as appealing as expensive
``designer'' water.
</P>
<P>
   And Seattleites might want bottles of their tap water if their
plumbing is bad, or just for convenience, Pageler said.
</P>
<P>
   The council already has a name for its potential product:
Seattle Rain.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea might turn out to be all wet.
</P>
<P>
   The city will hire a consultant to determine by September
whether a water-bottling venture is even legal, not to mention
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Questions to be answered include whether the law allows this
kind of commercial venture, whether the city can find a private
bottling partner and whether Seattle's neighboring cities will
tolerate any additional drain on limited regional water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Also, there's the bottom line. If the city can't net at least a
$500,000 a year, it's probably not worth the effort, Pageler said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her main goal in sponsoring the proposal is to raise
money for environmental projects, such as protecting salmon habitat
in the city's Cedar River watershed.
</P>
<P>
   It's also an opportunity to tell the world how clean Seattle's
water is, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any place known for great water, it's Seattle,''
said Lisa Fitzhugh, special assistant to Mayor Paul Schell.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, public utilities resisted the idea of bottling
water because it might imply that plain old tap water is somehow
inferior, Pageler said. But public officials are beginning to
realize that bottling can be used to promote tap water, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City already is bottling its municipal water, and San
Francisco is considering it.
</P>
<P>
   The trail blazed by other cities suggests that any legal
barriers can be overcome, she said, adding that the mayor's office
hopes to start bottling and selling tap water next year, ``as
quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The city already is talking to private local companies
interested in marketing Seattle's tap water, she said. She declined
to identify the firms.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers now spend up to 1,000 times more for imported bottle
water than for tap water in their own homes, according to a book
co-authored by several Seattle water managers.
</P>
<P>
   At current Seattle water rates, ``one penny will buy you 80 cups
of (tap) water,'' said D'Anne Mount, spokeswoman for Seattle Public
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The study will look at how much to charge for bottles of Seattle
tap water, and what kind of containers to use. Pageler wants
lightweight recycled materials.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uncertainties surrounding the city's splashy idea,
one councilman already is sounding like a salesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that our water is among the best-tasting, purest and
finest that you can find,'' Peter Steinbrueck said. ``I hope to see
it available all over the United States.''

CHINA VOICES HOPE ON JOINING WORLD TRADE GROUP
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A senior Chinese trade official said Monday that China
hoped to make progress toward joining the World Trade Organization
during President Clinton's visit this week.
</P>
<P>
   But in contrast with earlier hopes that China's entry could be
clinched soon, the official, Shi Guangsheng, minister for foreign
trade and economic cooperation, said there was no timetable. He
also reacted mildly to American statements that China was far from
satisfying requirements for opening its markets to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   He said that ``we will continue to hope for positive and
substantive progress'' toward agreement on entry into the trading
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``China wants to join the WTO because this is necessary for our
own economic reform and opening up,'' Shi said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization sets global trade rules. Its 132 member nations
must meet requirements for reducing barriers to trade and
investment, and in turn give each other better trading conditions.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday in Beijing the chief American trade negotiator,
Charlene Barshefsky, said it had become clear that Chinese leaders,
preoccupied with domestic economic dangers, were not ready to make
the major changes needed to qualify for entry. Besides general
tariff levels, American officials are especially concerned about
barriers to agricultural imports and to foreign involvement in
financial, accounting, tourism and other service industries.
</P>
<P>
   China has portrayed entry into the trade body as a political as
well as an economic goal, and has sometimes lambasted the West for
imposing what China considers unfair requirements.
</P>
<P>
   But Shi made only a muted complaint Monday, consistent with a
general effort by officials to minimize conflict with the United
States before the summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current difficulties are because the requirements set by
the United States and some European countries are too high, and
have exceeded the limits of the Chinese economy,'' Shi said. But he
added: ``We have no timetable, and we hope negotiations can
continue and we can continue to make progress.''

EDITORIAL: A COLLAPSE IN HONG KONG PROPERTY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 23:
</P>
<P>
   Few markets have been as subject to government influence as the
Hong Kong property market. Hong Kong's government owns most of the
land, and its decisions on how much land to release for development
have been crucial. Now the results of past decisions are haunting
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a decade, the supply of land for development was
kept low by agreement of the British and Chinese governments, and
the Hong Kong property market was strong for most of that period.
That seemed to serve everyone's interest. Britain took pride that
all was going well, China could boast that prices showed no one was
afraid of its takeover, and the big land developers could make
money without worrying about a huge new supply of land that would
drive down prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Hong Kong prices rose to dizzying heights and
the market took on a life of its own. Rising prices became the
reason to buy, as residents tried to purchase apartments before
prices went up even more.
</P>
<P>
   Now all that has ended. There was supposed to be a new auction
of Hong Kong land by the government on Tuesday, but talk was that
prices would be down sharply from the last government sale. The
Asian crisis has brought recession and high interest rates to Hong
Kong, and it is estimated that Hong Kong property prices are down
50 percent since the October peak. On Monday, as part of an
economic stimulation package, the government canceled plans for
land sales.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong is using fiscal stimulus to fight its recession. The
lack of revenues from new land sales means the end of a 15-year run
of balanced budgets, and tax rebates are being made as the
government tries to stimulate private spending.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still a lot of fear in Hong Kong. High interest
rates _ needed to support the currency's peg against the dollar _
have slowed business activity and helped to push down property
prices. The large number of Hong Kong residents who own their own
apartments feel much poorer, and banks are worried about bad real
estate debt.
</P>
<P>
   As Asia searches for stability, it is to be hoped that the
government's fiscal stimulus package works. But Hong Kong would be
far better off now if the government in years past had reacted to
soaring prices as private owners probably would have _ by putting
up more land for development and thus slowing an ascension of
prices that got out of hand.

   Song and show business celebrate the mighty Mississippi, the
Shenandoah and even the Wabash, but what about the Hudson River?
Well, to hear the organizers of a new festival tell it, the Hudson
_ the economic lifeblood of New York City since the Dutch settlers
_ has been unjustly neglected. So, as the sun sets Tuesday night,
the curtain (figuratively speaking) goes up on the summerlong
Hudson River Festival. Produced by the World Financial Center and
Battery Park City, and running through Sept. 1, the festival will
consist of dance, music, theater and film, among other arts, in the
public spaces of Battery Park City. Most events are scheduled for 7
p.m. to show off the sunset over the river. Included are
performances by the Paul Taylor Dance Company and Eliot Feld's
Ballet Tech; dance parties to the music of Tommy Dorsey and Duke
Ellington; screenings of ``Singin' in the Rain,'' ``Top Hat'' and
``An American in Paris,'' and more. Tuesday night King Sunny Ade
and his African Beats perform at the World Financial Center Plaza.

   Claus Peter Flor has been named principal guest conductor of the
Dallas Symphony Orchestra, beginning with the 1999-2000 season,
when the ensemble will celebrate its centennial. In announcing the
appointment, Andrew Litton, music director of the orchestra, said
Flor ``is one of the leading European conductors of his generation,
and he brings to Dallas a unique perspective on the great German
classical tradition.'' Flor, who was born in Leipzig, Germany, in
1953, becomes the orchestra's third principal guest conductor. He
follows Guenther Herbig, who served from 1979 to 1981, and Pinchas
Zukerman, who served from 1993 to 1995.

`WILL THIS DO?': SAVAGELY WITTY AND WISTFUL TOO, JUST LIKE HIS
FATHER  
 (PUBLICATION NOTES AT END OF REVIEW)  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A notoriously difficult man to please, Evelyn Waugh demanded _
no, insisted _ that his friends and family amuse him. He regarded
them as informants to be sent out into the world to gather
information and gossip, and to present him with a version of the
world commensurate with his own exacting expectations. The one
thing Evelyn Waugh would not, could not, tolerate was being bored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was many years before I could break the habit of viewing
every event with half an eye to the bulletin I would send to my
father,'' his son Auberon Waugh writes in his new book. ``Even now,
I find that when I hear a funny story about someone in whom he
would have been interested _ the child of a friend, perhaps, or
some grandee _ I mentally store it away to repeat to him. There
always follows a pang of bereavement when I remember that he is no
longer around to hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``Will This Do?: An Autobiography,'' Waugh the younger has
produced a lengthy bulletin that his father would have undoubtedly
liked _ a modest but terrifically entertaining book that's funny,
acerbic and a little sad, a book that demonstrates just what a fine
informant the author grew up to be.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a nearly four-decade-long career, Auberon Waugh
has written five novels, ``10 other books of varying degrees of
topicality'' and ``millions of words of ephemeral journalism''
including some scandalous columns for the satirical British
magazine Private Eye _ work that shows that Waugh fils shares the
taste of Waugh pere for antic exaggeration, corrosive irony and
Swiftean disgust, and a similar talent for producing sparkling
prose. What's new about this book are its occasional excursions
into tenderness and sentiment, qualities that show that the author
can be as touching as he's savage, as reflective as he's funny.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it cannot have been easy being Evelyn Waugh's son. As
his diaries and letters repeatedly made clear, Waugh had little
patience with his six offspring. ``I abhor their company,'' he
wrote his friend Lady Diana Cooper, ``because I can only regard
children as defective adults, hate their physical ineptitude, find
their jokes flat and monotonous.'' He gleefully shipped them off to
school as soon as he could and avoided them as much as possible
during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most terrifying aspect of Evelyn Waugh as a parent was
that he reserved the right not just to deny affection to his
children but to advertise an acute and unqualified dislike of
them,'' Auberon Waugh writes in ``Will This Do?'' ``This was always
conditional on their own behavior up to a point, and seldom
entirely unjustified, but it was disconcerting, nevertheless, to be
met by cool statements of total repudiation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many American memoirists, Waugh does not spend a lot of
time anatomizing the psyche of his family: there is no talk about
dysfunctional family dynamics, no analysis of emotional fallout.
Rather, Waugh writes matter-of-factly about his childhood, giving
the reader some sharp snapshots of life in the English countryside
and lots of comic portraits of his friends and relatives. There's
Uncle Alec, who ``wrote many books, each worse than the last,''
Great Uncle George, who ``would desert his pulpit to chase
imaginary mice round his church with a golf club,'' and Uncle Alick
Dru, who was called ``Whipper'' for being ``suspected of the secret
vice of whipping pigs.''
</P>
<P>
   About his father, Auberon Waugh is clear-eyed, observant and
slightly wistful. ``When he laughed, everyone laughed, when he was
downcast, everyone tiptoed around trying to make as little noise as
possible. It was not wealth or power which created this effect,
merely the force of his personality. I do not see how he could have
been pleased by the effect he produced on other people. In fact he
spent his life seeking out men and women who were not frightened of
him. Even then, he usually ended up getting drunk with them, as a
way out of the abominable problem of human relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is a little sad when one reflects that all he really
wanted to do in company was to make jokes, to turn the world upside
down and laugh at it, to enrich and enliven this vale of tears with
a little fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Evelyn Waugh abruptly died in 1966 from a coronary
thrombosis, his son felt a mixture of sadness and loss and relief _
relief that his death had ``lifted a great brooding awareness not
only from the house but from the whole of existence.'' Ironically
enough, his death would also rescue Auberon Waugh from ``the
tabloid grave I was digging for myself'' at a succession of
newspapers, and give him entree to the world of literary
journalism: his first of what would be many assignments for the
venerable Spectator magazine was to write an appraisal of his
father's obituaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although the latter portions of this book, which chronicle
Auberon Waugh's peregrinations from one journalism job to another
and his many feuds with other members of London's ``chattering
classes,'' may be too parochial to hold the attention of most
American readers, they do not seriously diminish the overall charm
of this memoir. Waugh's prose is so lively, his stories so amusing
that he not only gives the reader a vivid sense of his family and
their vanished world, but he also manages to infuse such well-worn
subjects as boarding school, the army and Oxford with admirable
energy and wit.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Waugh notes that perfectionism is not one
of his failings. ``The only question left hanging in the air is the
one which every journalist asks himself on submitting an article.
It is also the one with which we may all eventually, in trembling
hope, face our Maker: Will this do?''
</P>
<P>
   As far as this book goes, the answer is a happy ``yes.''

CISCO SYSTEMS IS GIVING UP THE HUNT FOR A PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, acknowledging that it has tried and failed to
forge partnerships with Lucent Technologies and Northern Telecom of
Canada, now intends to continue alone in defending its leadership
in the increasingly competitive market for advanced data-networking
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The networking industry has been roiled in recent weeks by
big-name mergers and by the emergence of a legal dispute between
Cisco and Lucent. In an interview Sunday evening, John T. Chambers,
Cisco's chief executive, explained how Cisco intended to move
forward in the rapidly evolving networking business.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said that Cisco intended to be one of the independent
makers of networking equipment left standing after the industry
consolidated into a handful of players. He took jabs at Lucent and
Northern Telecom, North America's largest makers of traditional
telecommunications equipment, saying they were ill equipped to
compete in the technology marketplace of the future.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy and rationale will also be detailed by Chambers on
Tuesday in a memo to the company's 12,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The basic architecture of big communications networks is
evolving toward an emphasis on data rather than voice traffic. That
shift is forcing a convergence _ and new competition _ between
makers of data-networking equipment, like Cisco, and older
telephone-based companies such as Lucent and Northern Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this consolidation occurs, Cisco is in a very unique
position,'' Chambers said. ``Voice traffic is going to come under a
data infrastructure and that is where we are strong.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Lucent says, `You're our main competitor.' Nortel
says, `You're our main competitor.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's success in the marketplace has been reflected on Wall
Street. The company has become one of the most widely held stocks
among institutional investors in recent years, riding the explosion
in demand for networking technology to a market value of more than
$85 billion on revenue last year of $6.4 billion. Northern Telecom,
with sales of $15.4 billion, has a market value of about $28
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of telecommunications equipment are trying to move
quickly because Cisco is making inroads among theit traditional
customers. When Sprint announced an ambitious plan earlier this
month to upgrade its network, the major equipment partner was
Cisco, not a traditional telecommunications company.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications International, the new long-distance
carrier, and US West, the Bell local telephone company, are also
working closely with Cisco, which is trying to negotiate
significant deals with other Bells as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going after Lucent or Nortel,'' said Don Listwin, an
executive vice president at Cisco who runs the unit that sells
equipment to big telecommunications carriers. ``We're going after
the market, and they happen to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   A big question in the industry and on Wall Street is: Will Cisco
go there together with Lucent or Northern Telecom, either in a
wide-ranging partnership or in a titanic merger?
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have loudly proclaimed the virtues of
independence only to agree to a lucrative takeover deal, and
Chambers acknowledges that he will continue to consider smaller
acquisitions. But when he talks about any potential merger of his
company with a telecommunications giant, he uses strong language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to do a blockbuster merger with somebody
else,'' Chambers said. ``Zero chance. It would be a disaster for
the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said he was adamant mostly because of cultural
differences between Cisco and Eastern telecommunications titans.
Lucent is based in Murray Hill, N.J.; Northern Telecom in Brampton,
Ontario. Were Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., to merge
with one of them, its most valuable asset _ its intellectual
capital _ could walk out the door, Chambers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our industry you are not acquiring geographic territory,
you are acquiring people,'' Chambers said. ``Our people have no
interest in working for a company like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucent is trying to compete in a New World environment when
they're an Old World company in terms of the rules of the Internet
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers did not always think that way. He approached both
Lucent and Northern Telecom early last year about possibly forging
a strategic partnership. But the talks foundered because both
companies wanted to develop products that would compete directly
with Cisco's.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco was willing to forgo competing in the core
telecommunications markets for big phone switches and corporate
phone systems. In return, Cisco wanted any potential partner to
refrain from moving into Cisco's main product area: high-speed
Internet switches.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent and Northern Telecom refused.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel C. Stanzione, the executive vice president who runs the
Bell Laboratories unit of Lucent, said in an interview on Monday,
``My feeling was that as we reviewed it here internally, they
wanted the attractive spaces to themselves and wanted to leave the
unattractive space to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the discussions between Lucent and Cisco
said the talks broke off three or four months ago. But the symbolic
end may have come just last week when Lucent filed a lawsuit
against Cisco, accusing Cisco of infringing eight of Lucent's
patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically it's huge,'' Chambers said of the suit. ``It
shows that some companies don't have a way to compete in this new
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanzione said the filing of the lawsuit was not related to the
collapse of the partnership talks.
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to Cisco said that the partnership discussions
with Northern Telecom fell apart a month ago because of the same
sort of competitive concerns that torpedoed the talks with Lucent.
</P>
<P>
   Talks between Cisco and Northern Telecom officially ended
earlier this month, when Northern Telecom announced that it had
agreed to acquire Bay Networks for $9.1 billion in stock. Bay has
been Cisco's main competitor in the market for equipment that
switches Internet data between different points at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way these people are trying to move is very high risk,''
Chambers said of Northern Telecom's senior executives. Referring to
the lukewarm reception the Bay deal received on Wall Street, he
added, ``It wasn't so much an issue of Nortel overpaying as it was
whether the market thinks they can really pull that off.''
</P>
<P>
   Northern Telecom declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, investors demonstrated confidence in all three big
networking players. Cisco's shares rose $1.50, to $84.625, in
NASDAQ trading. On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Lucent
rose $2.50, to $74.75, while shares of Northern Telecom closed at
$53.9375, up $1.

SUBTEXT OF THE GM STRIKE FOCUSES ON GLOBAL STRATEGY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Crippling strikes at General Motors parts factories
have left the United Automobile Workers union and GM fighting over
whether the auto maker is pursuing an ``America Last'' strategy,
but the reality lies somewhere in between their positions.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW is accusing the General Motors Corp. of spending
billions of dollars on factories in developing countries while
failing to invest in aging American factories. GM has responded by
publicizing what it calls plans to invest $21 billion in the United
States by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The company's financial statements and projections show that its
investments in the United States are substantial _ but that the
amount invested annually will not increase in coming years and may
actually decline. GM's annual investments overseas are rising.
</P>
<P>
   With few signs of progress toward resolving the strikes that
began June 5, the union raised the prospect Monday that the
walkouts could last into mid-August, which would make it the most
serious strike against the company since 1970. GM executives have
made no secret that they think the best long-term opportunities now
in the global auto industry lie in countries such as Brazil and
China where adults still outnumber cars, unlike in the United
States. But in the last two weeks they have also been promoting
their U.S. investment plans. The $21 billion figure GM uses works
out to an average of $4.2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unaware of any other company making that kind of
investment in the United States,'' Donald Hackworth, GM's group
vice president for North American car operations, said last week.
Most big companies do not disclose their investment plans, but
Hackworth's assertion is plausible because G.M. is the nation's
biggest company and it operates in a heavy-investment industry.
</P>
<P>
   But notes at the back of GM's annual report show that GM
invested $5.39 billion last year in North America automotive
operations and $5.18 billion in 1996. These figures include
relatively small investments in Mexico and Canada, although GM
refused to provide exact figures.
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Holmes, a GM spokesman, said the annual amount of GM's
car-building investments in the United States would stay flat or
decline slightly in the coming years. But he said that these
investments remained a majority of GM's planned investments
worldwide in building cars. The level of investments is also not
important, Holmes said, because GM has been working to make its
investments more efficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not indicative that we're doing less _ we're doing more
with less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   GM officials have consistently refused to provide figures for
GM's future investments overseas, but they totaled $2.45 billion
last year and are expected to grow. GM is building new assembly
plants in Argentina, Brazil, Poland, Thailand and China. GM also
announced Monday that it would invest another $100 million in its
joint venture in China. By contrast, GM has not committed itself to
building any new factories in the United States, where it still has
more assembly plants than can be justified by its market share,
which has been shrinking for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hackworth said in an interview last week that GM might cut back
even its current investment plans in the United States if the UAW
did not heed the company's demands for labor peace and more
flexible work rules in factories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikes and noncompetitive work practices jeopardize that
investment,'' Hackworth said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the main issue in the strikes at two parts
factories in Flint, Mich., was not where GM builds factories but
rather the insistence of some workers there on collecting eight
hours' pay for only four to six hours of work.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials have said that they are willing to change work
rules in Flint, but only if GM follows through on a promise to
invest another $180 million in one of the parts factories on strike
there. UAW officials had no immediate comment when told Monday
evening that GM's investments in the United States would show no
year-over-year increase and would likely decline.
</P>
<P>
   GM's claim to be putting a majority of its investments in the
United States also comes with a qualifier: All of its investment
calculations, including the $21 billion figure, are for GM's
car-building operations only, and exclude Delphi Automotive
Systems, GM's large auto parts subsidiary. Delphi, with $1.26
billion in worldwide investment last year, has been the most
aggressive of GM's units in building new factories in Mexico and
overseas while selling or closing them in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   GM has also chosen to focus on investment rather than jobs as
the measure of commitment to the United States. But GM investments
in the United States are mostly in costly operations like new
assembly plant equipment, which preserves a few high-paying jobs
for highly skilled workers. GM's investments abroad tend to be
parts factories that cost little to build but can employ thousands
of low-skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW appears to be preparing members for a protracted
struggle this summer. Stephen Yokich, the union's president, said
Monday at the opening of a union convention in Las Vegas, Nev.,
that the union would ``last one day longer'' than GM in the current
showdown.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shoemaker, the union's vice president for GM issues,
warned Monday at the convention that if no deal was reached this
week, the strike could last until mid-August. GM needs to begin
mass production of its 1999 models then and will be under
considerable pressure to compromise.
</P>
<P>
   GM's factories have long been scheduled to close at the end of
this week for the company's annual two-week summer vacation. Union
officials want to end the strike before then so that workers will
be entitled to full vacation pay.
</P>
<P>
   GM said that it had closed 24 of its 29 assembly plants,
including one in Ste. Therese, Quebec, that shut down Monday. The
strike has idled 122,400 GM workers across North America, while
outside suppliers have also laid off thousands of workers
temporarily.

AMERICA WEST ON FAA WATCH LIST OVER SAFETY CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Retransmitted for those needing)  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAWN GILBERTSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Federal regulators have stepped up scrutiny of America
West Airlines in the wake of safety concerns raised by the
carrier's mechanics and flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 9 memo to Federal Aviation Administration inspectors
in cities served by America West, an FAA supervisor in Phoenix said
the Tempe carrier had been placed on ``Troubled Air Carrier''
status.
</P>
<P>
   America West spokeswoman Patty Nowack described the FAA's action
as routine for carriers in protracted labor negotiations, and said
America West is cooperating. She added that ``no significant
maintenance or operating problems have been discovered as a result
of these additional inspections.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA memo suggested six areas for increased surveillance,
from in-flight procedures to compliance with critical maintenance
regulations. It was written by Ronald Rosenhahn, supervisor for the
America West Certificate Management Unit of the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The memo didn't cite the reasons for the FAA's increased
vigilance, but an FAA spokesman said it stemmed from complaints
called into the FAA's aviation safety hotline by America West
flight attendants and mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   He said the calls suggested labor unrest, which, along with
airline financial troubles, always trigger increased FAA scrutiny.
America West's flight attendants and mechanics are both in union
contract negotiations that have dragged on and now involve a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that we do when we get an indication that a
carrier is under strain, and because of the strain there might be
some temptation to skip some of things they're supposed to do,''
said Mitch Barker, public affairs specialist in the FAA's Seattle
office.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said Northwest Airlines, which also is involved in union
negotiations, is also on the FAA's watch list, the new name for
Troubled Air Carrier status. He said the latter term was used in
error on the memo about America West.
</P>
<P>
   The specific areas on the suggested surveillance list include:
</P>
<P>
   Minimum equipment list program compliance. The list includes
critical instruments that must be operating correctly or the plane
can't leave the gate, such as the radio used to communicate with
air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
   _Ramp inspections, with emphasis on indications of airplane
corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   _Performance of scheduled and unscheduled maintenance done by
the company and outside contractors.
</P>
<P>
   _Dispatch paperwork, emphasizing appropriate weather
information.
</P>
<P>
   _En route flight procedures, emphasizing checklist procedures.
</P>
<P>
   _In-flight/flight attendant training programs.
</P>
<P>
   Barker said America West's watch list status is open ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surveillance will continue at an increased level until we
don't feel it needs to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the inspectors find problems, fines could be levied. The
worst-case scenario is that major problems are uncovered and the
airline's certificate, or operating permit, would be suspended.
Last year, Iowa-based Great Lakes Aviation, a commuter airline, was
ordered to suspend service and agreed to pay $1 million in
penalties for sloppy maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   While not familiar with the details, one aviation expert is
unfazed by America West's watch list status. Arnold Barnett, a
professor of statistics at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology who specializes in safety issues, said ``there's no end
to (such) lists, in a certain way.'' He said he flies America West
often from Boston to the West Coast and wouldn't hesitate ``for a
moment'' to do so today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an airline that has done a lot of things very well,''
he said, citing its accident-free record and rapid expansion after
the industry deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   While this is the first time America West has been on the FAA's
troubled carrier/watch list, regulators have criticized the company
in the past for lax maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   During a major inspection two years ago, the FAA found serious
maintenance errors which it blamed on the company's decision, in
late 1995, to lay off 500 mechanics and transfer its heavy aircraft
maintenance to Tramco, a contractor in Everett, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA found, among other things, that more and more repairs
were being deferred to keep planes flying. An FAA official said the
airline's cost-cutting efforts had gone too far. Overall, however,
it said the carrier was safe.
</P>
<P>
   America West responded by saying it would hire dozens of
mechanics and increase the number of internal auditors who make
sure that paperwork is completed properly and that outside vendors
are properly qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Since then America West mechanics and their union, the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, have criticized the work
done by outside mechanics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, on the eve of America West's annual shareholders
meeting, the union raised concerns about flight safety and said
mechanics were going to follow the maintenance book to the letter
even if it meant flight delays. America West officials dismissed
the move as a negotiating tactic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very concerned about the maintenance and the
outsourcing at America West ever since December of 1996,'' said
Patrick Lacefield, a Teamsters spokesman in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our folks have seen a lot of the effects of the outsourcing in
terms of planes that come in and are supposed to be fixed and
aren't fixed and have to be fixed again.''
</P>
<P>
   The 350 remaining mechanics want America West to rehire the
mechanics it fired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   America West quietly terminated its maintenance contract with
Tramco in March. The work is now being done in Indianapolis by
United Airlines. The airline also uses other contractors, including
Air Canada, to service its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the Association of Flight Attendants, which
represents America West's 2,100 flight attendants, could not be
reached for comment. The negotiating committee is meeting in
Atlanta this week. &QL;

CAPITAL MURDER CONVICTION OF WOMAN ON TEXAS' DEATH ROW OVERTURNED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
1998c. Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge has overturned the capital murder conviction of
one of seven women on Texas' death row, paving the way for her
possible third trial in the 18-year old case.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein said Pam Perillo's right to a
fair trial was compromised because her attorney had a close
personal and professional relationship with the prosecution's chief
witness.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent hearing ordered by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, Werlein said, he discovered that Houston attorney Jim
Skelton failed to discredit Linda Fletcher's testimony on crucial
points during Perillo's 1984 trial.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Skelton failed to tell Perillo of his personal
relationship with the witness _ a relationship that began in 1980
when Skelton represented Fletcher on murder charges in the same
case, Werlein said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge noted Skelton admitted during the hearing he sometimes
lies to his clients. ``Skelton's credibility is questionable,''
Werlein's opinion stated.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton represented Fletcher when she, her then-husband Mike
Briddle and Perillo were charged with the February 1980 killings of
Robert Banks and Bob Skeens.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton later represented Fletcher on aggravated robbery charges
after negotiating a plea bargain for her testimony against Briddle.
</P>
<P>
   Months after convincing a Harris County jury to sentence the
battered wife to five-months probation, Skelton traveled to
California to give Fletcher away at her 1981 wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher stayed at Skelton's condominium when she came to
Houston to testify against Perillo two years later and also was
Skelton's guest when she testified against Briddle during his 1982
capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . this fact, as the court of appeals has held, tends to
confirm the reality of the conflict of interest position in which
Skelton placed himself,'' Werlein noted.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher's testimony that she was not present during the 1980
strangulation killings of Banks and Skeens went unchallenged,
despite statements that implicated Perillo, Werlein said.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton also failed to tell the jury that Fletcher had blood on
her jeans when arrested, nor did he reveal that only Fletcher's
fingerprints were identified at the crime scene, Werlein said.
</P>
<P>
   But Werlein stopped short of questioning Skelton's ethics.
Instead, he said Skelton shortsightedly put himself into a
situation where he had few options.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had Skelton successfully impeached Fletcher, he might have
been the instrument of subjecting her to perjury charges and, at
this point, the interests of Perillo and Fletcher diverged,''
Werlein wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Dusek, spokesman for Texas Attorney General Dan Morales,
said a motion has been filed asking Werlein to reconsider. If he
does not, the matter will be appealed to the 5th Circuit, Dusek
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County District Attorney John B. Holmes Jr. expressed
confidence that Werlein's ruling, issued Thursday, will be
overturned, but that he will retry the case if it is not.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Los Angeles, Perillo turned to burglary and robbery
as a teen-ager to support a heroin habit. While on a drug-induced
high, she, Briddle and Fletcher stole $800 from Skeens and Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Perillo later confessed to the killings and all three were
charged with capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Perillo did not implicate Fletcher in her statement to police,
but she told defense attorney Robert Scott during her 1981 trial
that she and Fletcher wrapped a rope around Banks' neck. Perillo
and Fletcher each took an end and pulled it taut, court documents
quote Perillo as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Perillo said she and Briddle then did the same to Skeens. All
three were initially charged with capital murder, but Skelton
convinced prosecutors that Fletcher played no part in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Perillo's capital murder conviction in the men's deaths
was overturned because of an error during jury selection.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, she was convicted of Skeens' murder and again sentenced
to death, but she appealed because of Skelton's involvement with
Fletcher.
</P>
<P>
   Briddle was convicted in 1982 and executed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Werlein noted disciplinary proceedings are pending against
Skelton by the State Bar of Texas in another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Heasty, spokeswoman for the State Bar, said the Supreme
Court of Texas Board of Disciplinary Appeals reversed a disbarment
judgment against Skelton on Feb. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was sent back to the State Bar's grievance committee
for a new hearing, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KHIRBET KILKES, West Bank _ On a sunbaked hill outside Hebron, a
Palestinian family lives in a tent beside the rubble of its house,
which has been demolished for the third time, after Israeli
authorities denied the family a building permit.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by broken furniture, smashed household goods and
other wreckage, the parents, Zuhur and Youssef Atrash, and their 10
children live in sweltering heat without running water or a toilet
and drink water from a tanker truck that serves nearby parched
Palestinian communities. Their water well was demolished along with
the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what Netanyahu has left us,'' Mrs. Atrash said, waving
toward a roofless floor where upholstered car seats were arranged
around an Arab water pipe under the jagged remains of a wrecked
ceiling. ``We're living like cave men, in a garage dump.''
</P>
<P>
   In Jewish settlements that flank the roads to Hebron rows of new
stone houses are sprouting on the rocky hills, and there is enough
water to sprinkle gardens among the red-shingled houses.
</P>
<P>
   But demolitions of Arab houses in the West Bank and East
Jerusalem have sharply increased in recent weeks, leaving scores of
people homeless because their dwellings lacked building permits.
The policy seems to be aimed at consolidating Israel's hold on East
Jerusalem and on areas of the West Bank that Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's government seeks to keep.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the State Department, James Rubin, has called
the demolitions a wrong signal at a time when efforts to restart
stalled peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have
reached a delicate stage. The Clinton administration is reportedly
pressing for a suspension of further demolitions as part of a deal
to renew the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of destruction has picked up sharply this month, with
23 Arab houses wrecked so far on the grounds that they were built
without permits, according to the Israeli group Peace Now, which
monitors the demolitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli military government in the West Bank, the Civil
Administration, said that it had destroyed 80 illegally built Arab
houses this year and that additional hundreds were scheduled for
demolition. Last year, 171 were wrecked, according to official
figures.
</P>
<P>
   To and Mrs. Atrash, the flourishing Israeli settlements a few
miles from their encampment may as well be on another planet. The
construction of a school building in their hamlet was halted by the
Civil Administration for lack of a permit. The Atrashes' children
walk three miles to the nearest school.
</P>
<P>
   Their neighbor Abdel Majid Abu Turki was killed last week as he
walked back from his field, clubbed on the head from a passing van
by Jewish teen-agers living in the neighboring settlement of Beit
Haggai. Abu Turki was walking on a road to the settlement that was
paved on his family's land.
</P>
<P>
   Now and Mrs. Atrash are preoccupied with obtaining a permit that
will finally enable them to have a roof over their heads. Three
times the Atrashes built their house as their family grew, even
though their request for a permit was refused. Three times the
house was torn down by Israeli bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   Family members resisted the last two demolitions, struggling
with Israeli soldiers, who beat and dragged them off.
</P>
<P>
   Worn down by the confrontations, the Atrashes are awaiting for a
reply to another request.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we want is to live in peace and security like they do in
Tel Aviv,'' Mrs. Atrash said. ``We have the right to breathe the
air and drink the water just like Netanyahu and his children, like
Israelis and their children. It's not asking too much from
Netanyahu to give us a permit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the battle over the house is part of the broader conflict
between Israel and the Palestinians over control of land in the
West Bank. Peace efforts are deadlocked over the scope of a further
Israeli troop withdrawal in the area that would turn over
additional territory to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Atrashes, who live in a zone under Israeli control, hope
that a possible pullback from their area south of Hebron will
enable them to build their house free of restrictions imposed by
the military government.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Civil Administration, Lt. Peter Lerner,
indicated that the Israelis were trying to curb the spread of Arab
construction in areas under Israel's control and those that it
would most likely claim in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any building outside the planning schemes is not an option,''
ant Lerner said, adding that the Israeli-controlled zones had to be
kept ``as open as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the Atrashes had failed to prove ownership of
the land that they had built on and had lost a petition to the
Israeli Supreme Court. The area had been designated as agricultural
land, and the house overlooks the bypass road leading to Beit
Haggai.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people build there it won't be a bypass road,'' Lerner
said. ``This is a court ruling that has to be carried out, like
law-enforcement agencies do anywhere else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atrashes assert that they built on land that has been theirs
for generations, noting that the house was standing when the
Israelis built the bypass and that the structure was far enough
from the road to meet Israeli regulations. A day before the
demolition last week, Atrash said, he had received approval in
principle for his plans at the local Israeli headquarters, with
only a few technical requirements to complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went home happy, but the next day, without warning, the
bulldozer and troops arrived, ready as if they were going into
southern Lebanon,'' he said. ``They even destroyed a tent near the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   Atrash's officially stamped plans were taken away by an officer,
but later grabbed back by Mrs. Atrash.
</P>
<P>
   Atrash used to work as a shoemaker. But his machinery was
destroyed in a previous demolition, and the family now depends on
meager income brought home by a son who works in the Hebron market.
</P>
<P>
   The younger children have been traumatized by the demolitions
and sometimes cry out in their sleep, Mrs. Atrash said. Her
husband, who recalled that he once saved an Israeli caught in a
fire when he worked years ago in Jaffa, is worried about the scars
that the destruction has left on his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My 3-year-old son says he wants a gun to shoot the Jews who
wrecked our house,'' Atrash said. ``This policy will only encourage
violence. They should give peace a chance, for our children and for
their children. Enough bloodshed.''

   NEW YORK _ Walter Gold, a songwriter and music producer, died on
June 7 at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colitis, his wife, Fredda, said.
</P>
<P>
   Gold, who wrote songs as Wally Gold, was born in Brooklyn. After
Navy service in World War II, he sang in a quartet, the Four
Esquires, before becoming a songwriter.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he and his partner, Aaron Schroeder, wrote ``It's Now
or Never,'' which was recorded by Elvis Presley and became a No. 1
hit. In 1963, Gold wrote ``It's My Party'' with John Gluck Jr. and
Herb Wienner, and it became a best seller for Lesley Gore. Later,
Gold worked as a record producer.

   NEW YORK _ James G. Wallach, the chairman and chief executive of
Central National-Gottesman Inc., a pulp, paper, and newsprint
marketing concern, died on Friday at his home in Scarsdale, N.Y. He
was 55.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a cerebral aneurysm, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach became president and chief executive of Central
National-Gottesman in 1979 and chairman and chief executive in
1997. The privately owned company is based in Purchase, N.Y., and
has sales of more than $2 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was after receiving a master's degree in business
administration in 1966 from the University of California at
Berkeley that he joined the Central National-Gottesman
organization. He foresaw the growing significance of Asia for the
pulp and paper business and directed a swift expansion in the
company's Asian operations in the early 1980s. It now has 22
offices in foreign countries, including 10 in Pacific Rim nations.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s he supervised the company's expansion into
sales of paper used in business forms and stationery. The company
also sells paper for use in book publishing, magazines and
catalogs.
</P>
<P>
   Wallach was a trustee of Bates College in Maine and a vice
president and a director of the University of Maine Pulp and Paper
Foundation. He was also on the boards of several Wallach family
charitable foundations. Beneficiaries of the family's philanthropic
largess have included the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan
Museum, the Central Park Conservancy and the American Museum of
Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan and raised in Scarsdale and went on to
graduate from Deerfield Academy in Deerfield, Mass., and in 1964
from Bates College.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 27 years, Mary Kerr Wallach; two
sons, Andrew and Scott, both of Scarsdale; his parents, Ira Wallach
and Miriam Gottesman Wallach, of Scarsdale; a brother, Kenneth, of
Manhattan; and two sisters, Sue Wachenheim, of Rye, N.Y., and Kate
Cassidy, of East Hampton, N.Y.

ISRAEL SAID TO ASSURE U.S. ON JERUSALEM EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Israel has provided assurances that a proposed
major expansion of the city limits of Jerusalem will not extend the
city's authority into the West Bank, the State Department said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials remained critical of the proposal
Monday but tempered their earlier statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prime minister told us that this decision is not an effort
to expand the municipal authority of the city into areas that
extend beyond the Green Line,'' said James Rubin, the State
Department spokesman, referring to the border that existed between
Israel and the West Bank before Israel's victory in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate that clarification,'' he said. ``At the same
time, this is a very complicated matter. And we are not certain
about what impact Israel's decisions may have in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``At a time when we are trying to break a prolonged
impasse in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, the last thing we
need from either party are statements or actions that raise
suspicions.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Israeli Cabinet approved a plan to expand the
city of Jerusalem's control far beyond its current borders, despite
angry protests from Palestinians and a warning from the State
Department that the plan was ``provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted that the plan has
no political ramifications and was not a violation of the
Israeli-Palestinian peace accords, under which the final status of
Jerusalem is to be negotiated with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a general presumption among Israelis and
Palestinians that the real goal was to strengthen Israel's hold on
what it has proclaimed its ``united and eternal capital'' and to
bolster its links to settlements to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who have called for the creation of a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, have denounced the
expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials involved in the Israeli-Palestinian talks said it
was difficult for them to make specific criticisms of the expansion
proposal since the Israelis have yet to work out many details of
the plan. The cabinet is expected to debate the plan again this
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to clarify the plan,'' a U.S. official said.
``One of our main problems now is the timing. Why do this now? Why
do this at a time when we're trying to hard to close the remain
gaps'' in the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

Olowokandi ends up 
big man off campus
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nigerian undisputed cream of center crop
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL MURPHY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Five years ago, not only could no one spell Michael Olowokandi's
name, but no one in the NBA _ or most anywhere else in this country
_ had ever heard of the native of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone wants him now.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if everyone in the league is lining up to try to get
one of the first two picks in Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because if you're third, you probably won't get the ``Kandi
Man,'' the 7-1 shot-blocker from Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto, Denver, Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Boston and Golden
State are all making pitches to Vancouver, which possesses the No.
2 pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   There is even talk that the Los Angeles Clippers, who were
expected to take Arizona point guard Michael Bibby with the first
pick, have been talking about perhaps taking Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy whose stock is skyrocketing is Olowokandi,'' said
Nuggets general manager Dan Issel. ``In fact, there's a lot of
people talking that the Clippers could be moving away from Bibby
and thinking about taking Olowokandi first. But I think the
Clippers will take Bibby. That makes sense for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibby is probably a legitimate No. 1 pick, he's big in Los
Angeles, and (agent David) Falk's got him, and David seems to
always be able to have it turn out the way David wants it to. So I
think Bibby will be No. 1, and I think there's a ton of teams that
would like to get to No. 2 to take Olowokandi.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi, who spent high school and his first year of college
in England, doesn't feel his lack of experience is a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I am somewhat inexperienced compared to the rest of
the guys, some might take that to be a disadvantage,'' Olowokandi
said. ``At the same time, I don't have a style of play which I am
accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm more like a sponge, so that is an advantage in
itself. You are presented with a lot of different opportunities in
life. It's about making the most of the chance that you have.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi's story should be familiar to Houstonians since it is
almost a carbon copy of Hakeem Olajuwon's.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was born and raised in Nigeria and moved to England
when his father, Ezikiel, was assigned a diplomatic post there.
Olowokandi played cricket, rugby and ran track and field at Brunel
University, which did not offer athletic scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   After picking up a basketball for the first time at age 17,
Olowokandi fell in love with the game and decided to come to
America to hone his skills. Olowokandi picked up a guide to
American colleges, randomly chose a spot and opened the book up. He
called the college on that page, the University of the Pacific, and
asked if he could transfer his college credits from England.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Yes, why?''' Olowokandi said. ``I explained the
whole thing, how I wanted to go to school and play basketball, and
they asked me how big I was, and I said that I was 7-feet tall and
265 (pounds) and they said, `We'll have you.' That's basically
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, as the clich goes, is history.
</P>
<P>
   While Olowokandi, who averaged 22 points, 11 rebounds and three
blocks for Pacific last season, is often likened to Olajuwon, there
are those who fear he might turn out more like Yinka Dare, the
former bust with the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Olowokandi will turn out be like) neither, and I'm not
straddling the fence here,'' said Boston general manager Chris
Wallace. ``Down the line, in three to four years, he'll be a top-10
center, if not a top-five center. With experience, that will
happen. He came to the U.S. without significant experience, and he
played (fewer than) 80 games in college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not consider him a project since he has offensive
ability, he has an NBA body and athleticism. When you get from him
(now) is more down the road than let's say Tim Duncan in San
Antonio or Shaq (O'Neal) in Orlando (where he was drafted).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the top center prospect in the draft, and I expect him to
go within the first two picks. He also has a tremendous work ethic
and is a bright and determined young man. He has all the bases
covered in terms of intangibles.''
</P>
<P>
   Marty Blake, who evaluates talent for the NBA, is blunt about
the fuss over Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only center prospect out there,'' Blake said. ``But
he's a couple of years away. He hasn't played that much.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could go No. 1. You need a center (to win), and he has
potential. He has improved tremendously, and there are no other
centers.''

APARTHEID INQUIRY WILL HEAR WIDOW OF MOZAMBIQUE'S PRESIDENT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Graca Machel, the widow of
President Samora Machel of Mozambique and now President Nelson
Mandela's companion, is to testify on Tuesday about the
circumstances surrounding her husband's death in 1986, officials of
South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission said on Monday.
She is to testify behind closed doors.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has been looking into the events leading to the
crash of Machel's plane. Earlier this month, it heard evidence from
witnesses including a Mozambican official, members of the former
South African Defense Force, and Craig Williamson, a notorious
former spy, who has admitted helping the apartheid-era government
plot assassinations of political activists.
</P>
<P>
   The crash, which killed most of Machel's top advisers, has
always been been deemed suspicious by Mozambicans. Mozambique had
regularly vexed the former South African government by giving
refuge to its political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the crash, the South African government ruled it
an accident due to pilot error. But Russian investigators, called
in because it was a Russian-built plane, said they believed a decoy
beacon pulled the plane off course. They concluded that it emitted
a signal on the same frequency as that of the airport at Maputo,
the Mozambican capital.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, on a flight from Zambia, crashed into mountains in
South Africa near Mozambique's border. Of the 45 people aboard, 35
died.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials said that Mrs. Machel had wanted to
testify. She made her own inquiries about the crash and wished to
share her information with the panel.

AS PRICES SINK, HONG KONG CURBS LAND SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Seeking to stop a frightening downward spiral in the
property market, Hong Kong's government Monday announced it was
halting the sale of land until next March. The action, which was
made public after the stock market closed, was the starkest sign
yet of how deeply the Asian crisis is hurting Hong Kong's normally
resilient economy.
</P>
<P>
   Property prices drive the broader stock market here, and the
government is the biggest single land owner, selling about half of
Hong Kong's new residential property at public auctions. By halting
land sales, officials will effectively try to freeze real estate
prices at current levels. It amounts to government intervention on
a huge scale in Hong Kong's most important business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian crisis has brought a lot of suffering and pain to
Hong Kong people,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief
executive. ``We believe we are in a critical phase and, therefore,
we have to be pragmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung announced a series of measures to restore consumer
confidence and ease the deepening credit shortage. These include
the lowering of import and export duties, a tax rebate and a freeze
in government salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tung acknowledged that no degree of stimulus would pull
Hong Kong out of what is fast becoming its worst downturn since
World War II. Property prices have plunged 40 percent in the last
six months, unemployment is at a 15-year high, and output declined
by 2 percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In a further setback, the Standard &AMP; Poor's ratings agency
warned Monday that it might lower the credit rating of the
territory's short-term and long-term debt, which would increase
government borrowing costs. Standard &AMP; Poor's said it had placed
Hong Kong on a credit watch list for review because of a ``growing
likelihood of a protracted economic downturn that could challenge
the ability of Kong Kong's government to maintain its prudent
fiscal policies and traditional noninterventionist stance toward
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Tung said the economy would shrink again in the second quarter _
the first official confirmation of recession. Unless the government
acted to stabilize property prices, he said, the financial
condition of Hong Kong's banks would deteriorate and a crisis of
confidence would overwhelm local financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Influential business executives in the territory applauded the
halting of public property sales, but the government's aggressive
intervention may frighten overseas investors, who value Hong Kong
for its untrammeled markets. Late Monday, some analysts were
already questioning whether Hong Kong would continue linking its
currency to the U.S. dollar at a fixed exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks, which had rebounded the previous four sessions, fell
sharply, with the benchmark Hang Seng index losing 4.5 percent on
Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Making matters worse, the Japanese yen declined. Its fall had
been broken by joint intervention in the currency markets last week
from the U.S. and Japanese central banks to prop up the yen's
value. But after Japan announced no persuasive details in its
latest plan to invigorate the economy, the yen weakened again and
Hong Kong's market followed.
</P>
<P>
   The action taken here on property sales is a sign that Hong Kong
officials see little hope of a rebound in the yen any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a rare animal if I said the situation in Japan were
stable,'' said Donald Tsang, the territory's financial secretary,
who devised the new measures in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Without any boost to the economy from outside, Tsang said Hong
Kong felt compelled to take the extraordinary action of halting
land sales. In the heyday of growth here, property auctions used to
draw scores of developers, who bid up the price of land to levels
some deemed absurd _ feeling sure that they could build towering
apartment complexes and sell the units for millions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the auctions have become dismal affairs. As for the two
million Hong Kong people who already own apartments, Tsang said
that the 40 percent decline in property prices was ``traumatic''
and that the government needed to reassure them that their
investments were not worthless.
</P>
<P>
   By foregoing auctions for nearly a year, he estimated that the
government would lose more than $30 billion (roughly $3.8 billion
U.S.) _ resulting in a rare budget deficit of $21.4 billion (nearly
$2.8 billion U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   Tsang and Tung reaffirmed Hong Kong's determination to continue
linking the currency to the U.S. dollar. But analysts said Monday's
action raised questions about how much economic hardship Hong Kong
was willing to endure before it devalued its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, in an economy with a fixed exchange rate, the
government would allow external market forces to depress the price
of assets such as property. That is what Hong Kong did over the
last six months. Unlike Asian countries that devalued their
currencies, Hong Kong defended the dollar by increasing interest
rates, even though that devastated the property market by making
loans prohibitively expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems to be bowing to political pressure to ease the
pain. The free fall in property prices hammered both powerful
developers and individual homeowners. Hong Kong's newly elected
legislators accused the territory's administration of insensitivity
toward the plight of ordinary citizens, while the tycoons pressed
top officials at private meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives said the decision would restore
confidence. ``It's the signal that the market has been waiting
for,'' said Nicholas Brooke, chairman of Brooke Hillier Parker, a
real estate brokerage firm here.
</P>
<P>
   But other experts said the government was engaged in an
increasingly desperate struggle to ease the consequences of a burst
bubble economy. ``Either land prices would have had to give or the
peg would have had to go,'' said Jan Lee, chief economist here of
the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.

LEHMAN BUYING SPECIAL DEVICES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Special Devices Inc., a maker of explosive
devices used to inflate automobile air bags, has agreed to be
acquired by a New York investment fund for nearly $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   A unit of J.F. Lehman &AMP; Co. will pay $37 a share, or $296
million, for the business, Special Devices spokesman John Vinke
said Monday. The price is 4.2 percent above the issue's Monday
closing price of $35.50.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which must be approved by shareholders, comes six
months after Special Devices hired Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette
Securities Corp. to help consider strategic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Vinke said the deal will not affect the company's day-to-day
operations and nearly all management will remain in place. ``It'll
continue operating just as it has. It'll just be privately held,''
Vinke said.
</P>
<P>
   Special Devices and the slightly larger OEA Inc., based in
Denver, are the top suppliers of automobile air bag initiators,
small explosive devices that rapidly inflate the safety bags in
crashes. The company also produces explosives used in military crew
escape systems.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Special Devices have gained 139 percent in the last
year, and the firm's earnings have risen 42.7 percent over the same
period. The company had 1997 sales of $140.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Special Devices is in the process of moving its manufacturing
plant and corporate headquarters to a facility under construction
in Moorpark. Venke said the proposed sale will not affect that
move.
</P>
<P>
   John Lehman, a general partner in J.F. Lehman, told Bloomberg
News that his firm likes companies with both commercial and defense
products. The fund has purchased five companies and has sold all
but two, he said.

JANZEN SHOWED HIS METTLE IN LAST ROUND
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For the second time in his career, and in
admirable fashion, Lee Janzen displayed the qualities it takes to
win a U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other major championship, the Open tests patience
and mental toughness, because bogeys are inevitable and potential
trouble lurks at every hole. It is one thing to tell yourself that
par is a good score. But it is much harder for a world-class golfer
to accept that mind-set for 72 holes.
</P>
<P>
   In many PGA Tour events, par is not good enough to make the cut.
But on Sunday, Janzen's final score of even-par 280 at the Olympic
Club was good enough to win by one stroke over Payne Stewart, who
missed a 20-foot birdie attempt on the final hole that would have
forced an 18-hole playoff Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen was at his unshakable, no-nonsense best on Sunday, when
he recovered from a poor start to capture the sweetest victory of
his career. After Janzen bogeyed the second and third holes, he was
4 over par, seven strokes behind Stewart. Few people gave Janzen a
chance at that point, but instead of panicking and taking foolish
risks trying to catch up, he never wavered from his game plan.
Then, once his swing began to click, he started to hit fairways and
greens, getting himself in position to make the pressure putts it
takes to win a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen's final 13 holes, which he played at 4 under par, may
have been the greatest stretch of his career, considering the
pressure and the unforgiving course conditions. With the
championship up for grabs, Janzen made the back nine look easy,
when it was anything but easy. And to those who thought that
Janzen's 1993 U.S. Open victory at Baltusrol was a one-time thing,
Janzen proved he is a special player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping your emotions in check is the hard part,'' Janzen
said, describing how he felt on the back nine. ``After No. 11, I
realized I had a chance to win. I kept thinking `This is the U.S.
Open, I have a chance to win.' I had to keep reminding myself that
when I lose focus, I could ruin any chance of winning. That's what
kept me going. I just said, `When this thing is over you can relax
and think about all the great things. But every shot, if you don't
give yourself full attention, you're not going to win this thing.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen walked the fine line of playing smart golf without being
too conservative. Usually, Janzen said, he keeps a close watch on
the leader board when he is in contention, but he took a new
approach Sunday and it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the scoreboard the entire week, but I made a point
to myself on the 13th hole that I would not look at the scoreboard
the rest of the day,'' Janzen said. ``I didn't want to know how I
stood. I was going to play my game the rest of the way in. If I got
lucky and got ahead, I didn't want to play safe. I just wanted to
continue to hit good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   While Janzen was rock solid Sunday afternoon, Stewart looked
unsure for the first time all weekend, making five bogeys and only
one birdie over his final 16 holes. Stewart started the final round
with a four-stroke lead over Tom Lehman and Bob Tway, while Janzen
and Nick Price were tied for fourth place, five strokes behind.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger, who won the 1993 PGA Championship, sounded like a
prophet Sunday morning when he cautioned that Stewart would not
have an easy day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm rooting for Payne, because I know how difficult it is to
lead a major for all four rounds,'' Azinger said. ``When I've led
the first three rounds, I wasn't quite able to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know what Sunday feels like? Have you ever gone to
the dentist for a root canal? Then when you get in the chair, the
doctor says something like, `Wow, this is worse than we thought.'
That's what it feels like. You have to be able to control that
feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   While Janzen managed to control it, others were left to wonder
whether a United States Open championship is in their future. For
Phil Mickelson (tied for 10th at plus-8) and Colin Montgomerie
(tied for 18th, plus-10), the quest for a first major championship
will continue. Tiger Woods (tied for 18th, plus-10) has plenty of
time to win the U.S. Open at age 22, yet until he does, some will
wonder if his aggressive nature hurts him in a tournament that
requires so much patience.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who finished tied for seventh at 7 over, admitted
that the U.S. Open is a learning process. ``It was hard yesterday,
hard the day before that, hard the first day,'' Duval said. ``You
can't define it. I mean, it's just so subtle. I'm still trying to
grasp it and learn about how I'm going to approach it next year.
You sit down and ask what you did, how things happened and why.''
</P>
<P>
   But instead of soul-searching, Janzen could celebrate. He had
not won on the tour since 1995, and as recently as this year's
Players Championship in March, Janzen faltered on Sunday and lost a
lead. Yet, when it comes to winning the U.S. Open, Janzen knows he
has what it takes. That is one of the greatest feelings any golfer
can have.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of golfers who are better than me, but that's
the best I can do,'' Janzen said of his performance. ``The
confidence will be there always that I can play tough courses
well.''

PAKISTAN'S ARMY FADES, EVEN IN NUCLEAR CHOICE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan _ For nearly 24 years of its half-century
existence, Pakistan has been ruled by military dictators, but its
most important military decision _ to explode nuclear test devices
_ was made by a newly established civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   The army remains the country's strongest and most cohesive
institution _ indeed, perhaps its only cohesive institution _ but
for the past decade it has been steadily backing away from
politics.
</P>
<P>
   The change began with death of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq in a
mysterious plane crash in 1988, after ten years in power. Zia's
mustache and impeccable uniforms gave him the air of a military
ruler straight from central casting.
</P>
<P>
   But today the army chief-of-staff, traditionally one of the
three most powerful officials in the country, is an unassuming
former tank commander, Gen. Jehangir Karamat. He is widely regarded
as a professional soldier who has resisted any temptation to wield
power.
</P>
<P>
   It was Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, elected in February 1997, in
the biggest landslide in the country's history, who made the
decision to match the nuclear tests of rival India. A main plank in
the platform that brought him his victory was a call for a
rapprochement with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a land still largely feudal and tribal, riven with
religious, linguistic and ethnic tensions, and where the legacy of
elected government is corruption and incompetence. Indeed, Sharif
faces more problems at home than he does in his confrontation with
India.
</P>
<P>
   While spending untold millions in its search for nuclear arms,
Pakistan, like India, cannot provide basic services for vast
numbers of its citizens. Its economy is a shambles, defense
spending and servicing the foreign debt consumes most of the
federal budget, and the taxes that do exist are almost universally
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the war in the 1980s in neighboring Afghanistan
has left the country awash in guns and drugs, as well as
fundamentalist Islamic preachers. Armed clashes, kidnappings, and
murders among rival groups occur daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army would like to get out of politics, but if the country
enters into chaos, the generals may again be forced to play a
role,'' said Stephen P. Cohen, a leading authority on the country
and its military, who is joining the Brookings Institution. ``This
could be a watershed, the best hope for Pakistan _ a government
with such a large majority _ but only if the civilians demonstrate
a degree of competence in running the country.''
</P>
<P>
   There was widespread agreement within the Cabinet that Pakistan
had to respond to India's nuclear tests with tests of it own. But
even though Sharif's decision to carry out tests was hugely popular
here _ political sniping has already begun over the austerity plans
needed to deal with Western sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made four phone calls to Sharif urging
Pakistan not to set off a nuclear explosion. His last offer,
officials here said, was this: from $3 billion to $5 billion in
World Bank and International Monetary Fund aid over the next five
years; a visit to Washington by Sharif; repeal of the Pressler
Amendment, which bans exports of weapons and military technology to
Pakistan because it was a developing a nuclear program; the release
of 28 jet fighter jets that the Pakistanis had bought and paid for
during the time of the Afghanistan war.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, Pakistani officials said, was judged not to amount to
much.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Nishat Ahmad, now retired, said: ``Pakistan wanted to
bargain, but this was, really, an issue affecting our national
existence. If the U.S. had come up with some kind of guarantee
against nuclear use by India, perhaps it could have been different.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Sharif would have been lynched if he traded national security
for a trip to Washington,'' he added. Before the Indian tests, the
Pakistani military had favored a kind of nuclear ambiguity, Cohen
noted in a forward to the forthcoming update of his book ``The
Pakistan Army'' (Oxford University Press).
</P>
<P>
   But afterward, military officers felt it was vital to show that
they could match their rivals, government officials here said. The
nuclear scientists were particularly eager to prove that their
device would work. However, an army staff college study also
suggested that there might be alternatives, like security
guarantees by outside powers or a conventional weapons buildup,
which would also have to be supported from the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was primarily a political choice,'' said Ahmad. ``The army
had input because it is a security issue, but the military has no
control over decision making.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the days when generals ran the country.
</P>
<P>
   Field Marshal Mohammad Ayub Khan took power in 1958, ousting
discredited politicians, but after ten years another military coup
installed Gen. Agha Mohammad Yahya Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the military fell into disgrace as the distant eastern
half of Pakistan revolted, becoming Bangladesh, and a war with
India was swiftly lost. The civilian government of Zulfikar Ali
Bhutto came to power then, but in 1977 as political strife and
widespread violence mounted, Zia seized power, put the squabbling
party leaders in ``protective custody,'' and declared martial law.
Bhutto, father of the current opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto,
was hanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the perception was our politicians didn't
manage well,'' said retired Ahmad. ``The unfortunate conclusion of
the military was that we can put it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Zia took over, the Soviet Union entered the fighting
in Afghanistan, in 1979. Pakistan soon became a proxy base as
American aid was resumed and money and arms, channeled through
Pakistani intelligence, flowed to Islamic fighters battling the
Soviet side.
</P>
<P>
   After Zia died, the new army chief, Gen. Aslam Beg, presided
over what were regarded as unusually free elections in 1988, with
Ms. Bhutto becoming prime minister. As she and Sharif rotated in
power, the army remained in the background but was sometimes a
mediator.
</P>
<P>
   When a political impasse loomed in 1993, for example, Gen. Abdul
Waheed, described by Cohen as ``hitherto politically invisible,''
persuaded both Prime Minister Sharif and President Gulam Ishaq to
resign and hold new elections, bringing Ms. Bhutto back. When
Waheed retired, resisting entreaties to stay on, he was replaced as
chief of staff by Karamat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a thorough professional with a good education,'' said
Ahmad, who taught Karamat at the army staff college here and saw
him go on to the U.S. army's Command and General Staff College at
Fort Leavenworth. ``He is not overly ambitious.''
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, Cohen wrote in the updating of his book on the
army, for the military leadership ``the Zia years are now regarded
with a degree of embarrassment.'' But, he added, the army's own
mistakes _ as seen by the officer corps itself _ pale in comparison
with those of the politicians, who are seen as responsible for
economic ruin and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Krepon, an authority on Pakistan who is president of the
Henry L. Stimson Center in Washington, said it is worrisome that,
unlike General Karamat, future generations of commanding officers
will not have been exposed to American training and values, because
schooling at elite staff colleges has been cut off under the
Pressler amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, what's happening inside the army,'' Krepon
said. ``The next generation of corps commanders, and, more
importantly, the generation after that. Where are the
fundamentalists in the army? How are the junior officers relating
to the senior officers?''
</P>
<P>
   Beg, the officer who had started the about-face from politics,
said that when Zia's plane exploded, ``it was expected of me as the
most senior army commander to step into Zia's boots as chief
martial law administrator. But I preferred not to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a great respecter of the constitution,'' he said. Then he
paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of my mind was the performance of the three
martial law regimes,'' he went on sadly. ``Ayub Khan, Yahya Khan,
Zia, I mean they made a mess of everything. It was a
disappointment, a complete disillusionment with the performance of
the military regimes. I knew it would have been a very clumsy
effort, something worse than the earlier efforts.''

TV SPORTS: 90 MINUTES HELD HOSTAGE BY SOMNOLENT ANNOUNCERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S.-Iran match should have animated the dead. It held
political import, for the animosity between the countries since
Iranian militants held Americans hostage for 444 days between 1979
and 1981. It held soccer import, for the U.S. team had to at least
tie to entertain a chance of playing in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Even a soccer dolt like me knew enough to be pumped. Brent
Musburger, ABC's studio host, was primed. He was wired! He was
loopy! ``In other words, this match against the United States is
Iran's World Cup,'' he stated, with an air of confident
obviousness. Then, the soccer authority boldly predicted the final
score: ``Three-nil, U.S., baby!'' Sure, he was wrong, but he was
Musburgerian: exciting fans, even hyperbolically.
</P>
<P>
   But would somebody awaken the game announcers Bob Ley and Seamus
Malin? Maybe they need honey to loosen their vocal cords. Malin,
the analyst, could make a whispering greenside golf announcer sound
like Michael Buffer.
</P>
<P>
   I roared when Malin, deadpanning like the comedian Steven
Wright, said during the second half: ``This is a tremendously
gripping game.'' Yes it is, I thought. Tell me!
</P>
<P>
   I've watched a few of Ley and Malin's games during this
tournament. But Sunday's was the nadir of their emotion-free
approach. Ley, one of television's best sports reporters and a top
``Sportscenter'' anchor, was hardly ever roused to a consistent
level of excitement.
</P>
<P>
   No, Ley need not sing a 90-minute aria like Univision's Andres
Cantor. But not to be jazzed by a goal? (Even an Iranian's?) Call
it as if it were no more of an event than a corner kick? The best
sportscasters raise their voices, step by step, as they describe
critical action or anticipate a score. Cantor is glorious fun not
only for his ``Gooooaaaalllll!'' call but for his touch-by-touch
narrative, which grows more invigorated with each pass.
</P>
<P>
   Try to imagine Mike Emrick or Gary Thorne, the pre-eminent
voices of hockey, calling soccer. They have the vocal juice to stay
excited for 90 minutes. Ley may yet show it, but hasn't so far.
Instead of raising his game at the end, he lowered it. ``This is
the final minute,'' he said at the 89th minute, as if he were
describing a funeral cortege.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Ley lacked vocal oomph, Malin lacked analytical brio.
He often leaned on the Americans' hitting the crossbar or the goal
post _ their inability to finish _ as reasons for their failure
Sunday. But those were symptoms of a teamwide problem Malin never
adequately analyzed. What were they doing wrong? What must they do
to correct their faltering offense? Whom should Coach Steve Sampson
send in to right the listing ship? How did the Iranian Mehdi
Mahdavikia get loose for a breakaway to make the score 2-0?
</P>
<P>
   Malin is not taking advantage of better production afforded by
ABC and ESPN and the French world feed. With better visuals, a good
analyst can provide the fruits of a full-field vision a view that
illuminates broad strategies. That didn't happen Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Of even greater concern than their verbal style were Ley and
Malin's apparent leanings. Sure, it's easy to root against Iran,
but that's not for announcers. No, they didn't outwardly cheer.
Maybe they didn't know when they sounded like homers.
</P>
<P>
   But when Ley showed emotion, it appeared more for the United
States. A shot on goal by Claudio Reyna pushed Ley to shout,
``Rey-na!'' He shouted ``Save!'' when Brian McBride almost scored.
When McBride scored, Ley said: ``Is that in? Yes. Is that a goal?
Yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Both announcers seemed a tad too hopeful that Coach Steve
Sampson's underachieving team would not only break their goal-less
string, but turn back the Iranians. They harped on the near goals
as signs that the Americans were playing great, save for the
trajectory of their kicks. But even a casual observer could sense a
great deal of confusion on the United States team. Yet Ley and
Malin seemed to hope more than explicate. When four minutes of
stoppage time were posted after the 90 minutes of regulation ended,
Ley said: ``So there is time? There is time.'' He sounded a little
too relieved.
</P>
<P>
   In a game when well-balanced emotion was absent, ABC offered an
emotional report by Gillian Findlay during the pre-game show on
Iranian star Khodadad Azizi. Her halftime report, on fan reaction
in a Tehran bar to Iran's first goal, was temporarily delayed by
Iranian censors. Eventually, before the second half, it went
through.
</P>
<P>
   AIRWAVES: The U.S.-Iran World Cup game generated an overnight
4.8 Nielsen rating for ABC, down from a 7.8 for the U.S.-Romania
game four years ago in a similar Sunday time slot. ... Lee Janzen's
comeback victory over Payne Stewart in the U.S. Open on NBC
captured a 6.7 overnight rating on Sunday, down 14 percent from a
year ago; Saturday's 5.0 rating fell 23 percent from 1997.

BANKERS TRUST OVERCOMES SCANDALS
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Variety headline might offer this take on the
Bankers Trust Corp.: Banking's Bad Boys Bounce Back.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived a series of financial scandals that tarnished
the vaunted trading house's reputation and tore into its bottom
line in recent years, Bankers Trust is refashioning itself as
investment banker to the nation's _ indeed, the world's _ smaller,
fast-growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, earnings have rebounded. But it remains to be seen
whether this strategy will give the New York bank the heft it needs
to go it alone on Wall Street and avoid becoming takeover bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proponents of the idea that bigger is not necessarily
better,'' said Frank N. Newman, who became the bank's chief
executive nearly three years ago as the company began recovering
from the trading scandals. ``We're trying to find markets where we
can add value.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman said Bankers Trust, currently the country's
seventh-largest bank, had no intention of trying to compete with
larger rivals like Goldman, Sachs, Merrill Lynch, or Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter for the juiciest spoils of Wall Street: stock and bond
underwritings and fees gleaned from mergers-and-acquisition advice
for the biggest corporations in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the bank is focusing its efforts on providing these
services to smaller companies in fields like high technology,
health care, the media and telecommunications, building on its
solid franchise as a junk-bond underwriter. And Bankers Trust also
sees itself as an aggressive competitor in emerging markets like
Asia and in an economically consolidating Europe, where it believes
its expertise in local markets gives it an edge.
</P>
<P>
   To these ends, Newman has led Bankers Trust on an acquisition
spree, scooping up the mergers boutique Wolfensohn in 1996 and the
brokerage firm BT Alex. Brown Inc. last year, to give the bank the
firepower it needs to provide financial advice and stock
underwriting for up-and-coming companies. The bank proudly points
to a $1.3 billion equity offering it co-led in March for Chancellor
Media, a radio broadcasting concern, as evidence of its new-found
underwriting muscle. It also cites recent deals it has done for
Channel Communications, a broadcasting concern, and Fred Meyer
Inc., which operates supermarkets in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that all the expertise that Bankers
Trust has been buying is really just a grab bag of disparate
businesses incapable of steering it through the competitive storms
swirling around Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Alex. Brown appears to be a good fit, sharply bolstering the
bank's revenue and profits from investment banking and immediately
making it a player in the financing of high-tech companies, where
Alex. Brown had built a stellar reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But the $200 million Wolfensohn acquisition is largely viewed on
Wall Street as something of a bust. Bankers Trust was able to boast
about snagging Paul Volcker, the Wolfensohn chairman and former
Federal Reserve chairman, but the purchase has yet to substantially
advance the bank's position in the mergers-and-acquisitions game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bankers Trust still has a long way to go to realize
the value of its franchise,'' said Raphael Soifer, an analyst with
Brown Brothers Harriman. ``If the markets cooperate, we should see
more benefits from their recent acquisitions. If the markets sour,
they could have fairly tough sledding.''
</P>
<P>
   Other problems loom that could weaken Bankers Trust's bottom
line and make it a more tempting takeover target. Relative to its
size, it is among the most exposed of American banks in Asia _ and,
as Asia's economic crisis has deepened recently, the specter of
escalating losses there could become a reality when Bankers Trust
reports second-quarter earnings next month.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust's stock closed Monday at $112.125, well below its
52-week high of $136.3125.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While Bankers Trust may be shrewd in trying to position itself
as the premier financier to growth companies, it will ultimately
have to contend with bigger investment banks that will move in for
a piece of the action if it proves to be profitable enough. The big
houses have already started to threaten Bankers Trust in junk
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're never immune to competition,'' said Yves C. de Balmann,
Bankers Trust co-head of investment banking. ``In the target
markets in which we have decided to play we are all things to those
people because we are not trying to be all things to all people.
And in our target markets I will compete head-on with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Bankers Trust's future, it is clearly a different
company than it was just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust has always been one of the most innovative banks
in the country, and by the early 1990s, it had earned a reputation
as one of the ablest purveyors of complex financial products known
as derivatives. The bulk of the company's profits came from
derivatives trading, but unseemly sales tactics and the widespread
perception that the bank was ruthless and predatory caused Bankers
Trust to run afoul of clients, regulators and investors. That paved
the way for the arrival of Newman, a former Treasury Department
official and BankAmerica executive, whose reputation for
circumspection helped sanitize Bankers Trust's image.
</P>
<P>
   Newman has sharply curtailed the bank's trading as he has
expanded the investment-banking business. That has touched off a
certain amount of upheaval and staff departures at the bank, as
many on the trading desks have felt slighted. Newman acknowledged
the turmoil, but said the changes were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Trading ``was a terrific business, but the ratios were wrong and
we had to be a more balanced company,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, at the height of its derivatives prowess, Bankers Trust
earned $1.1 billion, about 70 percent of which came from trading
and sales. Profits plunged to $686 million in 1994 and $311 million
in 1995 as the derivatives scandals and trading losses took their
toll. But net income recovered sharply in 1996 and rose to $866
million last year, with trading and sales accounting for only 22
percent of that pile. Investment banking kicked in 70 percent of
the profits last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Newman, this company has done a lot to become more
focused and better managed,'' said David Berry, an analyst with
Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``On the other hand, they're not earning
the kinds of returns they did before the derivatives debacle. But
analysts and investors were never really comfortable with the risks
they took in those days either.''
</P>
<P>
   But Berry, like many other Bankers Trust observers, is waiting
to pass final judgment on the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does Bankers Trust really have a long-term strategy?'' Berry
asked. ``Do they have something in place that will vault them into
the 21st century? I'm not sure yet.''

CAPTURING THE WILD WEST _ AS WELL AS THE NOT-SO-WILD REST OF THE
COUNTRY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL MARIE CROPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When executives of a Kentucky restaurant chain wanted
desert scenery and armadillos for a commercial, they knew where to
go.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, said Lynn Birdwell, co-founder of Rio Bravo
Pictures, the Houston production company that filmed the spot for
the chain, Texas Roadhouse of Louisville, Texas doesn't have any
trained armadillos. State law forbids selling the critters or
keeping them for sale except for limited purposes. So two had to be
flown in from Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sometimes arduous task of appearing Texan enough to
suit outsiders, the Lone Star State's commercial production
companies report a growing business. The industry was jump-started
in the 1980s by the television series ``Dallas,'' as locals gained
experience on the set and some out-of-state professionals chose to
remain in Texas, said Jeff Klein, executive director of the Texas
Association of Film/Tape Professionals, a nonprofit group.
</P>
<P>
   The state now ranks third _ or perhaps fourth _ in the amount of
money spent there to make TV commercials, he said. California is
first, with New York a distant second. Illinois, primarily Chicago,
would be the most likely rival of Texas for No. 3, according to
Klein.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the University of Dallas' Graduate School of
Management estimated that 678 commercials were shot in 1997 in
Dallas and Houston alone.
</P>
<P>
   While Houston and, especially, Dallas are the focal points of
the industry, production companies have also sprouted in Amarillo,
Austin, Corpus Christi, and El Paso, Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Copeland, director of the Texas Film
Commission, about $80 million a year is spent across the state
making TV spots.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is an obvious choice for beer commercials, given the
populace's drinking preferences. But commercials are produced here
for other reasons as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many varied looks in Texas,'' Copeland said, from
coastline and mountains to deserts and piney woods. Also, he said,
``the weather is probably going to be good,'' with lots of
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the mystique of the Old West, Copeland added,
despite the imported armadillos.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Edwards, co-founder of the Dallas production company
Bednarz Film, gave another reason. ``It's easy to shoot here''
compared with cities like New York and Los Angeles, she said,
because of less ``red tape'' in obtaining permits and other such
details.
</P>
<P>
   Wages and other costs are lower, Ms. Edwards said. ``They're
looking at $200-a-day for a hotel in New York, whereas in Dallas,
it's $75 to $100,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Costs can also be kept down, Klein said, because the state has
no income tax and does not levy a sales tax on film or equipment
rental.
</P>
<P>
   On top of all that, said Adolfo Aguilar Jr., president of one of
the nation's top Hispanic ad agencies, there is a growing market
for commercials aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers, who have a
large presence in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar said that his San Antonio agency, Bromley, Aguilar &AMP;
Associates, part of the D'arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles unit of
MacManus Group, often uses local production companies to make their
Spanish-language spots.
</P>
<P>
   While production crews can, of course, be imported to film in
Texas, there are now enough talented locals to do the work, those
in the state's industry say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually easier to find someone who's already in Texas
rather than bringing in the whole show,'' said Rodrigo Rodriguez,
the other co-founder of Rio Bravo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Texas production companies now compete nationally and
film spots elsewhere. Of the 26 spots Bednarz Film made last year,
Ms. Edwards said, 10 were set outside Texas. And Bednarz staff
members went to New York this year to shoot an American Airlines ad
featuring the city's bridges, part of a campaign created for the
New York market.
</P>
<P>
   Texas companies have produced commercials for Sports Illustrated
and McDonald's, Klein said. A recent Sprint commercial was also a
Texas creation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas companies sticking close to home are also doing well. Pony
Pictures of Lubbock, which produces mostly regional commercials,
saw its revenues double last year, said Dwight Harper, its owner.
</P>
<P>
   While some advertisers like the Texas look, Harper added, others
come to the state because it can look like somewhere else. He
recalled, for example, going to the mountains of West Texas
recently to shoot a commercial for a Mexican restaurant whose
owners ``wanted it to look like interior Mexico.''

SUNS, WITHOUT DRAFT PICKS, HAVE OTHER PRIORITES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Amid all the projections, evaluations, misinformation,
disinformation and speculation, only one thing is sure about the
NBA draft on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It has undergone a fundamental change in the way teams use it.
</P>
<P>
   And don't use it.
</P>
<P>
   Some general managers and scouts say it is overrated. Of course,
not one of them had a chance last year to pick Tim Duncan, who
restored the San Antonio Spurs' faith in at least one draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan, last year's No. 1 pick and subsequent Rookie of the
Year, appears to be the exception in a process that has slipped
from fundamental building block to something else. Overrated might
be an overstatement. But NBA teams clearly are not in a rush to
acquire picks that were so valued a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   An example: the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns do not have a pick in either of the two rounds. They
have some interest in trading for one in the mid- to late first
round, when two European big men, 7-foot-1 Radoslav Nesterovic and
6-11 Vladimir Stepania, might be available. But nobody within the
walls of the team's executive offices will cry if they don't
acquire a pick.
</P>
<P>
   They have other priorities, free agency being the biggest. It
also could be the most immediate if stalled talks for a new
collective bargaining agreement are resolved before July 1, when
free-agent shoppers would get the green light. Trades are the other
priority. A draft pick often is the prelude to a deal that day or a
trade later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can build through free agency and/or trade, typically
it is a better route,'' said Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo,
who has to decide whether the investment in a draft pick is worth
the salary-cap money that would be subtracted from the Suns' pool
to attract free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get there quicker with a trade or free agent because
you know what you are acquiring. You're dealing with a proven
commodity.''
</P>
<P>
   With draft picks, there is the uncertainty of how a player will
fit into your system and how well he will perform in the NBA,
Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most draft picks are a product of their colleges. Those
college systems might hold back one player and, in some cases,
accentuate positives that overvalue another player. It's always
more of a sure thing to look at a proven commodity through a trade
or a free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Nash is proof-positive that the Suns' philosophy is shared
leaguewide. Colangelo said he was swamped Monday by calls from
teams interested in the playmaker, the subject of widespread rumors
in February near the trade deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Nash's two years of NBA experience and his probable role next
season as Jason Kidd's backup are a powerful lure for teams seeking
a playmaker. A team would know what kind of player it is getting in
Nash, who was picked No. 15 in 1996 and was the only Suns draft
pick still on the roster at the end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   The same certainty cannot be applied to 20-year-old Mike Bibby,
the possible No. 1 pick from the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Colangelo does not dismiss the draft's potential
value. Depending on each team's makeup, a pick could provide
immediate help. In fact, NBA super scout Marty Blake argues that
Duncan had an immediate impact on the Spurs because veteran center
David Robinson already was in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no impact players anymore,'' Blake said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A young team might be better served by building through the
draft, Colangelo said. He cited three-year-old Vancouver, which has
drafted Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves, Shareef Abdur-Rahim and
Antonio Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Houston is at the other end of the spectrum. The aging Rockets
need youth, which they might try to acquire with three first-round
picks, Nos. 14, 16 and 18.
</P>
<P>
   But in each case, the key is patience, which is rare in today's
win-now-or-else NBA. Big money for young players _ some right out
of high school _ is another factor. Under the current collective
bargaining rules, a team might have a player for only two seasons
after it drafts and signs him. Then, he's gone.
</P>
<P>
   An example is Antonio McDyess, who was picked No. 2 in 1996 by
the Clippers and traded to Denver. Last, summer the Nuggets traded
McDyess to Phoenix in a three-way deal with Cleveland that included
the Suns' first-round pick (No. 23) in Wednesday's draft. The
Nuggets feared that they would lose McDyess with nothing in return
this summer in free agency.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's up to the Suns to re-sign McDyess. It's a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   But the Suns watched McDyess begin to develop. About him, they
know a lot. About the draft, they know enough to realize that they
have the same chances as a guy walking into a bingo parlor. &QL;

COYOTES' PRO TECTED LIST PRO DUCES FEW SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes excluded goalie Jimmy Waite and defenseman
Murray Baron from their protected list for Friday's NHL expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven players in all were left unprotected, with few
surprises other than Waite, who played well in the absence of
starting goalie Nikolai Khabibulin, and Baron, a top defenseman who
will become an unrestricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   Other notable Coyotes who were exposed, according to lists
obtained Monday, include left wing Darrin Shannon, left wing Louie
DeBrusk, acquired two weeks ago from Tampa Bay in the Craig Janney
trade, and 700-goal scorer Mike Gartner, 38, whose contract is set
to expire and who wasn't going to be invited back anyway.
</P>
<P>
   NHL rules stipulate that the Coyotes will lose only one player
to the Nashville Predators in Friday's expansion draft in Buffalo,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Also unprotected are: forwards Jocelyn Lemieux, Tavis Hansen,
Darin Kimble, Rob Murray and Scott Levins; defensemen Jim Johnson,
Norm Maciver, Michel Petit and John Slaney; and goalies Scott
Langkow and Darcy Wakaluk, who announced his retirement toward the
end of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Across the NHL, several big names were left unprotected,
including goalies Mike Richter (Rangers), Curtis Joseph (Edmonton),
John Vanbiesbrouck (Florida) and Sean Burke (Philadelphia), in
addition to skaters Brett Hull (St. Louis), Ray Ferraro (Los
Angeles), Wendel Clark (Toronto), Dale Hunter (Washington) and Tony
Granato and Marty McSorley (San Jose).
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Baron unprotected by the Coyotes comes as a bit of a
surprise. He was a top-four defenseman for much of his time here
after being acquired from Montreal in the Dave Manson trade. But
Baron is asking for more money than the Coyotes are interested in
paying the veteran, and he likely will sign elsewhere, regardless
of what happens.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville will pick one player from each of the 26 existing
clubs and can draft up to five goalies, one of whom might be Waite,
who was strong through Khabibulin's injury last season.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin was the only goalie the Coyotes protected, and most
other teams in the league also only protected one goalie. Phoenix
protected nine forwards and six defensemen.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the forwards are right wingers, three others are
centers.
</P>
<P>
   The lone left winger protected was captain Keith Tkachuk. The
rest of the protected list includes centers Bob Corkum, Jeremy
Roenick and Cliff Ronning, right wingers Rick Tocchet, Jim Cummins,
Shane Doan and Dallas Drake and J.F. Jomphe, obtained last week
from Anaheim for Jim McKenzie.
</P>
<P>
   The defensemen protected are veterans Teppo Numminen, Keith
Carney, Gerald Diduck and youngsters Oleg Tverdovsky and Deron
Quint.

   A Barnes &AMP; Noble Account in Review
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble Inc. said on Monday that it was searching for an
agency to handle the creative part of its account, which had been
handled for less than a year by Weiss, Whitten, Stagliano in New
York. Billings were estimated at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our needs have changed,'' said Mary Ellen Keating, a
spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble in New York, confirming reports of a
review this week in Advertising Age and Adweek.
</P>
<P>
   The company has invited eight agencies in New York to compete
for the creative account, Ms. Keating said, though she declined to
identify them. Among the possible contenders listed by Adweek were
Deutsch Inc. and Margeotes/Fertitta &AMP; Partners. The review will be
narrowed in mid-July to two to three finalists, she said, with a
decision by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Stagliano, president at Weiss, Whitten, said: ``Obviously,
we're disappointed. It was a challenging account, but they seemed
pleased with the work.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, Whitten recently began running a multimedia campaign that
reintroduces the Barnes &AMP; Noble Web site, which competes against
Amazon.com in selling books on line.

   Miller Brewing Sues 2 Former Agencies
</P>
<P>
   The Miller Brewing Company has sued two former agencies, Bates
USA and Zenith Media Services, both of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Bussen, a spokesman in Milwaukee for Miller, part of the
Philip Morris Cos., said that the lawsuit, which was filed in
federal district court in Milwaukee, accuses the agencies of
failing to seek television commercial time to compensate for spots
that ran on local stations in 1995 and 1996 and fell short of
reaching ratings goals. The lawsuit is seeking $6.9 million,
reflecting the estimated value of the free spots to make up for the
shortfalls, known as make-goods.
</P>
<P>
   The suit by Miller, the nation's second-largest brewer, is
seeking an additional $937,997 from Bates, accusing the agency of
``double billing'' Miller for services.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Torello, a spokeswoman for Bates USA, said: ``We haven't
had an opportunity to look at the complaint. But from what we
understand, we feel it is without merit.'' Rich Hamilton, chief
executive of United States operations of Zenith Media, said: ``This
action is utterly without merit. It relates to alleged guarantees
in local television, which were not made.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates is owned by Cordiant Communications Group PLC and Zenith
is a joint venture of Cordiant and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   ESC Medical Systems Names 5 Finalists
</P>
<P>
   ESC Medical Systems Ltd. in Needham, Mass., has named five
finalists to compete for a new consumer account with estimated
first-year billings of $12 million, which could grow eventually to
as much as $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Krinsky, a partner at Advice and Advisors in New York,
which was hired to help manage the review, identified the finalists
as Quantum Group in Parsippany, N.J., and four agencies in New
York: Gotham Inc., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies;
Jordan, McGrath, Case &AMP; Partners; Publicis, part of Publicis SA,
and Warwick Baker O'Neill. A decision is expected in mid-July. ESC
makes and markets devices like the Epilight hair remover that use
pulsed-light technology.

Kirk/Van Sant, Baltimore. Billings were estimated at $3 million for
a four-year contract.

   People
</P>
<P>
   -- Melissa Pordy was named senior vice president and print

A GUILTY PLEA TO DEFRAUDING ARGENTINA; BANKER'S FAKERY GOT BONUSES
FOR EXPORTS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ A director of an Argentine bank admitted on
Monday that he had forged financial documents to cover up a scheme
to defraud the government of Argentina of as much as $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to violate
the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act, the director, Luis E. Machado, 41,
explained how he had helped inflate sales figures for copper and
other metals exported to the United States. The scheme took
advantage of an Argentine government program to promote
manufacturing exports by rewarding companies with cash bonuses and
tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   The case was prosecuted in New Jersey because many of the
fraudulent sales were made to a dummy company in Holmdel, N.J.,
called Molds, Dies, and Novelties, which prosecutors said had been
set up specifically to handle shipments of relatively worthless
copper medallions and steel dies. Other fake sales were made
through Weekend Novelties, a company in Newtown, Pa., and
Intergold, a company in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the case was unusual because its strategy was
the reverse of most customs fraud schemes, in which the
conspirators seek to play down sales numbers so that they are
charged less in duty taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Machado, a Uruguayan citizen who worked for a Buenos Aires bank,
Banco Baires, testified in federal district court in Camden that he
had carried out the conspiracy with Enrique Piana, an Argentine
citizen and metals exporter. Piana pleaded guilty last August in
federal district court in Camden to bank fraud. According to their
pleas, Machado and Piana faked more than $130 million in sales of
copper and other metals.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the falsified sales figures, Piana collected as
much as $20 million in bonuses known as export rebates from the
Argentine government. The program, intended to increase
international trade, paid companies 12.5 percent rebates on metals
sales to the United States. In court on Monday, Machado admitted
faking bank documents to make Piana's sales appear legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to enriching the conspirators, the scheme also
skewed U.S. data on trade with Argentina, said Noel L. Hillman and
Colleen C. Piccone, the prosecutors who handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before Judge Joseph E. Irenas, Machado testified on
Monday that he had been assisted in falsifying bank documents by
unidentified officers of MTB Bank, a New York City bank that has
had a business relationship with Banco Baires for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Machado said that he had used MTB accounts set up under fake
names to conduct money transfers that seemed to legitimize the
sales in metals. Paperwork from the fake transactions was then used
by Piana, the president of Casa Piana, an exporting company, to
request the export rebates from the Argentine government.
</P>
<P>
   Machado also testified that the accounts, in the names of Paul
Sharpe and Tom Stewart, had been established years ago and that
prior to the export scheme they had been used to help people in
Argentina conduct clandestine overseas bank transactions. The
government of Argentina had been investigating Piana even before he
was arrested in the United States and is now seeking to have him
extradited.
</P>
<P>
   Faith S. Hochberg, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey, praised the
prosecutors, customs inspectors and Internal Revenue Service agents
who had uncovered ``a scheme as complex as this and revealed the
international intrigue and conspiracy that resulted in looting the
Argentine treasury of tens of millions of dollars.'' She added:
``It took an alert customs inspector to suspect an overvaluation of
goods to start this entire investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   When Machado is sentenced by Irenas on Sept. 18, he will face a
maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

TINY STEP FORWARD, GIANT LEAP BACKWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Call it a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Sampson won't, and neither will his players, but no matter
how much they protest otherwise, the United States' failure in this
World Cup is a setback.
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with not reaching the second round; the
Americans never were expected to get that far. To be eliminated
after their second game, with a devastating loss that one U.S.
Soccer official ranked as the worst in their history, is another
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampson, the U.S. coach, handled Sunday's 2-1 defeat to Iran
with a sense of pride. He was pleased, he repeated, with how his
team conducted itself, how it approached the match and how it
controlled play for much of the way.
</P>
<P>
   And with one Group F game to go _ here Thursday against
Yugoslavia _ he declared this World Cup a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came here with the goal of demonstrating that we have grown
as a soccer-playing nation,'' Sampson said. ``I believe we have
accomplished that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   There is some debate as to that, but other questions need to be
asked. Was that the proper goal for this cup? Was demonstrating to
the world that we can play their sport more important than
suggesting to Americans _ whose level of sophistication is such
that the many of the subtleties were bound to be lost _ that we can
win? Should a higher priority have been assigned to results?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is extremely disappointing for the fans and the general
public,'' defender Alexi Lalas said. ``In the past four years there
has been an increased awareness of this team, and with that comes
expectations to succeed at a higher level.''
</P>
<P>
   A win over Iran might have been success enough in this cup. Not
providing casual and non-fans something to grasp, like a win over
Iran, has damaged soccer's standing in the United States. That's
not good news for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, aside from those horrendous first 45 minutes
in the 2-0 loss to Germany in the opener, the Americans have not
performed that poorly. They applied a good 20 or 25 minutes of
pressure against a German team that is good enough to win this
tournament, and they were unlucky not to beat the Iranians after
hitting the posts and crossbar three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half against Germany was not a good half,'' Sampson
acknowledged. ``Three of the four halves, I believe, achieved our
goal of showing we've grown as a soccer-playing nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's true, or whether that's enough, is debatable. Not
all of Sampson's players agree with him, although few will say so
publicly. Not everybody, though, was willing to spout the company
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sad, disappointed,'' said midfielder Joe-Max Moore.
``I'm not sure what positives there are at this point. We work our
whole lives to get here ... and we just didn't do what we were
supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   A good deal of the blame should go to Sampson. Regardless of how
one feels about his actions leading to the cup _ the John Harkes
decision, the change of defensive personnel, the reliance on a
formation that was adequately tested just once _ there seemed an
element of desperation in the way he dumped the 3-6-1 alignment
after the loss to Germany. And he made questionable changes in
personnel, switching five starters before the Iran game and failing
to insert Eric Wynalda, the Americans' all-time scoring leader,
when a goal was an absolute necessity.
</P>
<P>
   If Sampson's three-year tenure as head coach has been solid,
there's plenty evidence that he failed during this World Cup. It
might cost him his job _ anywhere else it would _ but U.S. soccer
isn't so predictable.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's game, Sampson was asked if, given the quick
elimination, this had been a disastrous cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, of course not,'' he replied. ``It would have been
disastrous if we didn't play well. You the media now have to decide
whether the quality of soccer that's been demonstrated the last two
games demonstrates we've improved or not. That's in your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve, I don't think you want to go there.

   CHINA-FREEDOM (Shanghai) _ At a kitchen table strewn with glossy

talked about what it is like to live together without being
married, an arrangement rarely allowed in China until recently.
More than being symbols of a sexual revolution, this young couple
signals a growing realm of personal freedom in China that allows
ordinary people to make choices about travel, work, study, and love
with less government interference than at anytime since the

   OPEC-REVENUE (London) _ The recent drop in oil prices, which

help pay for public spending program as it prepares to reduce its
budget by at least 10 percent and raise fees on government services
_ all to offset the most serious fall in oil revenues in a decade.

Shexsnayder entered the contest to design a logo for her hometown.
She was a stockbroker, not an artist. But using her colored pencils
and her computer she drew an oustretched hand, a family of four in
silhouette, and, to portray the centrality of religion in this old
railroad town with more than 25 churches and about 8,000 people,
she sketched the simple fish that she had regarded from childhood
as a universal symbol of faith. She won the logo contest and $100
prize. Now, suddenly, the little fish is causing an awfully big
splash. Someone complained about the fish to the American Civil
Liberties Union, and in February the organization sent a letter
asking the mayor to delete the fish from the logo because the fish
was ``unmistakably identified with Christianity.'' By Laurie

Almost everywhere else in the United States, the economy is booming

MERRILL LYNCH TO BUY CANADIAN BROKERAGE
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch has agreed to buy Canada's last major
independent brokerage firm, continuing an international acquisition
spree that has given Merrill commanding positions in markets from
Thailand to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill will pay $1.26 billion (Canadian), or $855 million
(United States), in stock for Midland Walwyn. The deal marks
Merrill's return to the Canadian market, which it left in 1990
because of regulatory barriers to expanding its business there.
</P>
<P>
   The deal adds another niche in Merrill's growing worldwide
network of retail brokers and fund management firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they are doing is putting themselves into very strong
market positions in a variety of promising markets,'' said Raphael
Soifer, a securities industry analyst with Brown Brothers Harriman.
``It comes at a price, but they are betting that they will earn
back that price by putting more product and services through these
new channels.''
</P>
<P>
   By leveraging its rising stock price and its sharply higher
earnings, Merrill has become the most aggressive American broker
abroad. It bought Smith New Court and Mercury Asset Management,
making it a dominant broker and fund manager in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   It has hired 2,000 employees of Yamaichi Securities, the failed
Japanese broker that was once that country's fourth largest. It
also snapped up Phatra Thanakit, a leading Thai broker, at a
fraction of the price that the company would have commanded a year
ago, before Asian markets plunged. Merrill has also made
acquisitions in Australia and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition streak is not over. Merrill has its sights set
on an American financial company that specializes in advising
medium-sized American companies that are not yet ready to make
public offerings, said Jerry Kenney, Merrill's executive vice
president for corporate strategy and research. He declined to name
the target company. But he said the purchase would help Merrill
compete for initial public offerings business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be a financial provider to growing companies while
they are still private, so they might naturally turn to us when
they are ready'' to offer shares to the public, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill sold its Canadian retail unit in 1990 to CIBC Wood Gundy
Securities, a Canadian investment bank. But the rising United
States dollar _ in contrast to the Canadian dollar, which has
fallen to a historic low _ combined with Merrill's high stock price
made this a prime time to re-enter the Canadian market, Merrill
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Canada has recently relaxed rules that prohibited
links between banks and brokerage houses, leading to a scramble
among Canadian banks to buy leading brokerage companies there.
</P>
<P>
   The Canada purchase was further enhanced because government
authorities now allow Canadian pension funds to invest up to 20
percent of their assets abroad. Because the Merrill-Midland
combination is the only such foreign tie-up in Canada, officials of
both companies said the new entity, to be named Merrill Lynch
Canada, would have an upper hand in managing Canada's rapidly
growing pension fund assets.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, 0.24 Merrill share will be
exchanged for each Midland Walwyn share, valuing the Canadian firm
at $31.89 (Canadian) _ 17 percent higher than Midland's closing
price on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill told analysts that the purchase was equivalent to 21
times Midland's book value, considered an expensive price, said
Soifer of Brown Brothers Harriman. But Soifer said the new entity,
which can offer Merrill's broad financial product line in Canada's
less developed market, could expand its earnings faster than
Midland could alone, justifying the price.

PERU'S PRIME MINISTER URGES PARDON FOR U.S. WOMAN  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The new prime minister of Peru has startled U.S.
officials by publicly saying that Lori Helene Berenson, a New
Yorker jailed for life on charges of terrorism, should be freed
from her cell and expelled.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States said the new prime minister, Javier Valle
Riestra, might be speaking just for himself, and not for the
government. In a television interview on Sunday night, Valle
Riestra expressed disagreement with Ms. Berenson's trial in 1996 by
a secret military court that he characterized as repressive.
</P>
<P>
   His comments represented a sharp break from previous government
statements on the case. Ms. Berenson, 28, a former resident of New
York City, was found guilty of treason for helping stage an assault
on the Peruvian Congress by the Tupac Amaru revolutionary movement
in an effort to take hostages who could be exchanged for jailed
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of Ms. Berenson and several rebels apparently
thwarted the planned attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite her crime,'' Valle Riestra said, ``for reasons of
state and for the sake of Peru's prestige, she should be pardoned,
because of the mistakes made in classifying the crime and because
of the repressive legislation dealing with this type of offense.''
</P>
<P>
   A State Department official said the remarks ``came as a
considerable surprise to us.'' The official, who insisted on
anonymity, said Ambassador Dennis Jett pressed the prime minister
on Friday to look into the case and consider her release.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case remains a serious irritant in our relations with
Peru,'' said the official, because her trial did not follow the
norms of due process under international law. The cross-examination
of witnesses was not allowed, and the judges were anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berenson remains in a tiny cell high in the Andes in a
prison filled with convicted terrorists. Because of the constant
cold, U.S. officials have reported that she appears to be
developing circulatory problems. American consular officials are
allowed to visit her occasionally and take blankets and clean
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Senior consular officials on Monday pressed senior Peruvian
officials to free Ms. Berenson, but no other Peruvian official has
publicly reiterated the prime minister's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office three weeks ago, Valle Riestra, a
constitutional lawyer, has made several surprising remarks,
including one opposing President Alberto Fujimori's re-election in
2000. Valle Riestra's appointment as prime minister, effectively
coordinator of the Cabinet, was a surprise, because Valle Riestra
has long been a political opponent of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not clear what the prime minister's comments mean,'' the
State Department official said. ``His power remains to be tested.''

OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES FACING SEVERE CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lowest oil prices in 12 years have created a severe crisis
for oil-producing countries both inside and outside of OPEC, and
they have been struggling to reverse the decline.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has found
itself increasingly impotent in the oil market, and as its 11
member nations prepare to meet in Vienna Wednesday, a new, loosely
structured coalition has emerged, led by such big OPEC members as
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, as well as non-OPEC giants like Mexico
and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such a coalition can turn prices around remains very
much open to question, however. The production cutbacks that these
countries and others made in March fell far short of the amounts
pledged, and oil prices, which initially jumped, ultimately gave
back all their gains.
</P>
<P>
   Some oil industry analysts say that the coordinated production
cutbacks of these countries have kept prices from falling even
lower. Moreover, a second round of cuts has been announced for
July. Others, however, dismiss the current effort as doomed in the
face of such compelling market factors as the slowdown in Asia, the
increase in energy conservation and the development of technology
that has made the discovery and extraction of oil far more
efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, after many years of widespread cheating on
production quotas by its members, the once-mighty OPEC has become
virtually powerless to influence the oil market by itself. Prices
have plunged more than 48 percent from a 52-week high of about $23
a barrel in October, falling below $12 in the last week. But
Monday, in anticipation of the meeting, oil prices surged $1.59, or
13.4 percent, to $13.43 a barrel, the biggest one-day gain since
Jan. 22, 1991. Prices have now jumped 18 percent since hitting
their low last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the end of the old OPEC, but a wider organization
may take its place that may be more effective,'' said John
Lichtblau, the chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research
Foundation, a Manhattan-based research group for the oil industry.
He has attended OPEC meetings for the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all realize that they are in the same boat,'' Lichtblau
said, alluding to countries like Mexico and Norway. ``It's just as
important to them to keep up oil prices.''
</P>
<P>
   While there were efforts in the 1980s to have non-OPEC countries
cooperate in production cuts, they had only a limited effect
because some of them ignored their quotas when crude oil prices
began to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ann-Louise Hittle, the director of crude oil research at
Cambridge Energy Associates, an energy consulting group based in
Cambridge, Mass., said the OPEC and non-OPEC countries ``have come
up with agreements to cut which are more or less sticking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to be lasting,'' she said. ``This could be a
historic turning point.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have strong doubts. ``They have to do major
surgery and up to now they have been dealing with Band-Aids,'' said
Fareed Mohamedi, the managing director of market and country
analysis for the Petroleum Finance Company Ltd, a consulting group
for the oil industry in Washington. ``There's not much new that has
emerged.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mohamedi noted that even though oil exporters inside and outside
OPEC agreed in late March to cut oil output by a total of 1.7
million barrels a day, less than one million barrels was taken out
of production. Thus, this latest effort to rein in oil supplies has
raised skepticism similar to that faced by OPEC, which for years
has been unable to hold its members to output quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the meeting there are firm commitments from eight
nations for a second round of cuts totaling about 740,000 barrels a
day, or about 1 percent of the 74 million barrels consumed each day
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide consensus among analysts and other outside
experts that a cut of at least 1 million barrels a day has to
emerge from the meeting to keep oil prices from sliding further.
</P>
<P>
   The task was not made easier when Norway, the largest exporter
in Europe, said that it would not join other countries in another
round of production cuts, as it had done in March.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC has found it increasingly difficult to raise oil prices
because of its own internal divisions. Major producers often
ignored the production quotas that were set at meetings, eroding
the credibility of the group.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to regain some of its influence, OPEC decided to
raise its production quotas by 10 percent last November to 27.5
million barrels a day from 25 million, a move that merely
acknowledged how much the members were already producing.
</P>
<P>
   As oil prices began to slide in the spring, Saudi Arabia and
Venezuela were each waiting for the other to act first to cut back.
The standoff was broken by Mexico, which made an offer for cutbacks
that brought the two major OPEC producers together in an unusual
coalition to begin a round of cuts without first getting the
approval of the other OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
   While some experts see the coalition as a new, more realistic
approach, it has caused friction within OPEC. Some members have
objected that they are not consulted but are then asked to join in
an effort to cut back.
</P>
<P>
   There is agreement, however, that if the OPEC members do not
come up with further large cuts at the meeting, oil prices can
slide further, perhaps even below $10 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   While this will benefit oil importers like Japan, the United
States and Europe, it would cause deep economic pain and more
political instability among the producing countries.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE MODERN ART OF MASTERY ON THE MOUND
</HEADLINE>
  (fb) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Greg Maddux is an artist,'' Joe Torre, the Yankee
manager, has said. ``Every time you swing at one of his pitches,
it's a ball, and when you don't, it's a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Maddux, the Atlanta Braves right-hander, permits so
little activity on the bases that each game he pitches could be
titled ``Still Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Not Monday night, however. The canvas got a little crowded for
him at Yankee Stadium, in the first game of a series that has been
billed as a possible preview of the World Series. Maddux allowed
nine hits and three runs before departing after six innings with a
4-3 lead, and he learned from the showers that the Yankees had won,
6-4, with no decision for him.
</P>
<P>
   It was less than one of his routine masterpieces _ even Picasso
had the occasional bungle _ but when Maddux had to be dazzling, he
was. In the sixth inning, with two runners on base and one out in a
3-3 game, he struck out Scott Brosius and forced Joe Girardi to
bounce weakly to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux had to leave because of a stiff neck he had awakened with
and which troubled him so much, he almost didn't start. ``It was
killing him,'' Braves Manager Bobby Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux won the Cy Young award four straight years (1992-95) and
is the leading pitcher in the National League again, with a 10-2
record _ he has won eight in a row _ and a 1.62 earned run average.
And he has achieved his mastery so effortlessly that it's
mystifying.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grace, the Chicago Cubs first baseman, observed that Maddux
pitches ``like he's in a rocking chair.'' Like Grandma Moses?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know absolutely nothing about art,'' Maddux said last
weekend. ``If there was an art handicap like there is a golf
handicap, I would be a 50.''
</P>
<P>
   What, then, is the esthetic secret to his success, which is
certain to land him in the Hall of Fame? Now in his 13th major
league season, Maddux has nearly twice as many victories, 194, as
losses, 110, and his strikeout-to-walk ratio is also remarkable;
last year, he gave up just 20 walks while striking out 177 batters.
Last night, he whiffed four and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing outwardly noteworthy about perhaps the best
pitcher of our time. He has the demeanor of a bookkeeper. He is 32
years old, stands 6 feet tall, weighs 175 pounds. He wears glasses
off the field, has a physique that would not draw attention at the
beach, rarely shows emotion and frustrates batters to such a degree
that they nearly weep.
</P>
<P>
   Some pitchers throw the ball at nearly 100 miles an hour, some
have wicked breaking balls. Maddux has neither. ``I saw Sandy
Koufax and I saw Nolan Ryan,'' he said, ``and I knew I couldn't
pitch like those guys. I wasn't going to overpower anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   His fastball is generally clocked in the mid to upper 80's, and
he uses breaking balls sparingly. ``I found that velocity can be
misleading,'' he said. ``I rely on location of my fastball and on
changeups. If you stand by a highway and watch cars go by, you
can't really tell which one is going 80 miles an hour and which is
going 90. And if you throw real hard every pitch, hitters will
eventually time them.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux watched and learned from other masters of the mound. His
classroom was the dugout. When Maddux studied Mario Soto, he
discerned that one could win with, basically, two pitches. ``Soto
was able to pitch effectively with just a fastball and a
changeup,'' Maddux said. ``Which is what I do _ though his fastball
was better than mine. You locate your fastball, and you keep your
changeup down. If that doesn't work, you'll be backing up third and
home all day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many in sports who analyze and parse and dissect and
deconstruct the commonplace components of running, jumping and
hurling, Maddux wants no part of it. ``You do something well in
sports, it gets magnified,'' he said. ``I just throw a baseball for
a living.''
</P>
<P>
   His consistency, his professionalism and his understanding of
hitters and of his own abilities, however, belie such a casual
approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep it simple,'' he said. ``At the same time, I try
not to be too smart. The fewest amount of pitches you throw a
hitter, the greater your chances of getting him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a crucial element of success for Maddux is that less is
more. ``In art,'' Henry James wrote, ``economy is always beauty.''
Not in the eye of every beholder, to be sure. For batters who must
swing at pitches on their fists, or at their knees, or in the
crevices of the strike zone where they are least likely to do
damage, it is ugly. A ground tap here, a pop fly there, a lunge for
strike three. Ask Brosius or Girardi, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Modern art, one could almost hear a batter mutter. It stinks.

CLIPPERS STATE THEIR POINT

   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Clippers have decided whom to
pick, now the only question is whether they will keep the pick.
</P>
<P>
   With the No.1 selection in Wednesday's NBA draft, the Clippers
are a popular team, as clubs attempt to find out what it will take
to wrest the top pick away from L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot of calls,'' said Elgin Baylor, the Clippers
vice president of basketball operations. ``Thursday and Friday has
been the busiest time. I got a lot of calls (Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Vancouver is getting even more offers for the No.2
pick, since the Grizzlies are actively shopping their draft choice.
With the draft lacking a franchise player, the offers aren't as
attractive this year, but Baylor said he expects to hear from teams
up until the Clippers make their selection.
</P>
<P>
   There have been rumors involving Orlando's Penny Hardaway and
San Antonio's David Robinson, but Baylor denied that those players
were offered to the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, until something attractive comes out, we plan
to keep the pick,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Whom will the Clippers pick? ``We know who we're going to
pick,'' Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though the team will select Arizona guard Mike
Bibby, given its need for a point guard and his expressed desire to
play for the Clippers, a point not to be underestimated for this
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby refused to work out for any team but the Clippers, and his
agent, David Falk, has tried to do everything possible to make sure
his client is perceived as the top player in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   But late signals indicate that the Clippers may instead select
Pacific center Michael Olowokandi, and upset everybody's mock
drafts by grabbing the 7-foot-1 English import.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was summoned to Los Angeles over the weekend for his
second workout with the Clippers, proof that he is indeed getting a
serious look. If the the Clippers listen to Vancouver general
manager Stu Jackson, they would select Olowokandi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they have to (take him),'' Jackson said. ``Can you let
that go by?''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sorta an interesting young man,'' Baylor said. ``A
tremendous young man.''
</P>
<P>
   If you just based it on private workouts, Kansas swingman Paul
Pierce might have been the best player the Clippers saw in the past
few weeks. The reason there remains some mystery at No.1, however
slight, is because this draft lacks a Tim Duncan or even a Keith
Van Horn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you can say anyone is going to be an impact
(player),'' said Ryan Blake, who scouts and identifies college
players for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bibby, who would probably start for the Clippers next
season, has some drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are asking whether he's going to be an impact
(player) in the draft,'' Blake said. ``He's been shut down a couple
of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake also worries that Bibby is more of a shooting point guard
than playmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he going to be able to do that?'' Blake said. ``Will he
make L.A. or Vancouver a different team?''
</P>
<P>
   Local basketball fans will recall that Bibby was outplayed twice
this season by USC's Gary Johnson and burned repeatedly by Utah's
Andre Miller in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby has many more positives, however, and Baylor said if the
Clippers trade the pick, ``You better get an all-star player. If
it's a point guard, fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers also have to decide whom to select with the 22nd
pick, which they acquired from Miami in the Brent Barry-Isaac
Austin trade.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said nearly 20 players were brought in for workouts,
including UCLA's Jelani McCoy, Oregon State guard Corey Benjamin,
Michigan forward Robert Traylor, Ball State guard Bonzi Wells,
Cincinnati guard Ruben Patterson and Minnesota guard Sam Jacobson.
</P>
<P>
   No one would be surprised if the Clippers took somebody they
didn't work out. Baylor attended the pre-draft camp in Chicago two
weeks ago, and among those Baylor watched was Purdue center Brad
Miller (6-11, 250), who might be slow but would provide depth in
the post.
</P>
<P>
   If he's still around, the Clippers would also have to consider
Valparaiso guard Bryce Drew, who was probably the most impressive
player in Chicago. Another player worth keeping an eye on is 7-foot
center Radoslav Nesterovic of Slovenia, who has been playing in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Although they didn't work out UCLA forward J.R. Henderson, there
has also been speculation the Clippers might keep him in L.A.
