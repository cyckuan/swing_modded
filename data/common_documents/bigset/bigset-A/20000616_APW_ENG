GOP Blocks Arts Endowment Increase
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans used an eleventh-hour maneuver Thursday to
block what almost became the first significant budget increase for the National
Endowment for the Arts that the House has approved since 1992. Arts advocates
had moved to the edge of a surprise victory for the endowment with a preliminary
207-204 vote. Their goal was to add $15 million to the $98 million a fiscal 2001
spending bill contains for the agency, long in the crosshairs of GOP
budget-cutters and at the center of a partisan culture war. But Republican
leaders headed off the move by crafting an amendment that diverted the
additional money to Indian health services. That amendment prevailed by voice
vote.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans said Thursday their plan for
prescription drug insurance for the elderly envisions federal financial
incentives to insurance companies to make sure coverage is available nationwide.
''We've tried to allow as much flexibility with this ... to accommodate any
scenario that we might be able to run into,'' said Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C.,
among the architects of the GOP plan. A new draft summary of Republican
legislation being prepared for House action -- possibly as soon as next week --
offered no details about how much such incentive payments might cost.

Clinton Sees Two Cities in One

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton took a tale-of-two-cities tour of
Washington on Thursday and found signs of hope in each. In one of the poorest
neighborhoods, where barbed wire stands guard around empty lots, Clinton
celebrated the growth of an after-school learning center called the U.S. Dream
Academy where children, some with parents in prison, use the Internet to connect
with knowledge. ''What you do for these children, someone should do for every
child in the United States,'' Clinton told parents, administrators and some
excited but restless youngsters.

Feds Make Big Heroin Bust
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents made more than 170 arrests Thursday as they
broke up a multimillion-dollar Mexican heroin ring alleged to have smuggled
unusually pure and cheap black tar heroin into new markets from one U.S. coast
to the other. The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, was distributing
80 pounds of heroin each month, worth more than $7 million, in 22 U.S. cities,
said Joe Keefe, chief of special operations for the Drug Enforcement
Administration. The ring was marketing the heroin at such a high level of purity
and such a low price that the Mexicans pushed into eastern U.S. markets formerly
served by Colombian drug traffickers, Keefe said in an interview.

Gore Names New Head of Campaign

   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Al Gore named Commerce Secretary William Daley to take
over his presidential campaign Thursday in the second major shake-up of his
political operation, replacing Tony Coelho who abruptly resigned citing health
problems. Daley, son of former Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and brother of the
city's current mayor, is known as a savvy political operator with ties to both
President Clinton and Gore. Daley is a household name in Illinois, an important
presidential battleground.

Wildfires Raging in Colorado

   DRAKE, Colo. (AP) -- Blowtorch winds gusting to 60 mph whipped up two
wildfires and sent flames racing Thursday, forcing firefighters to retreat and
driving hundreds more people from their homes in the foothills outside Denver.
More than 200 National Guardsmen were called in to join the 1,500 firefighters
already battling the two blazes. The fires have burned nearly 15,000 acres and
destroyed about 50 structures, mostly homes, since Monday. Before the flareup

every new vehicle purchased by public fleet operators will have to run on

<P>
   VIRGINIA DALE, Colo. (AP) -- A small wooden sign heralds the
turnoff to the Abbey of St. Walburga in northern Colorado, blending
into the property's sagebrush hills and dusty road.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you end up in Wyoming, you've gone too far,'' said Sister
Hildegarde Dubnik, one of 20 Benedictine nuns who moved to this
mountain valley in northern Colorado three years ago to escape
increasingly crowded Boulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted it to be a real retreat. It should be removed, but
not so far removed that no one can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   The rumble of the cattle guard at the entrance and the washboard
road are a reminder that the Roman Catholic nuns do more than pray.
</P>
<P>
   They raise cattle, both for the table and for sale, and keep two
spitting llamas to scare away mountain lions. They grow hay to feed
the livestock and even do editing jobs for a Boulder computer
publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   But the main work of the nuns, who range in age from 27 to 87,
is managing a serene retreat for harried people looking for a place
to do some quiet reflection.
</P>
<P>
   For $20 a night, a guest may rent a small bedroom in a large
retreat house, sharing bathrooms and meeting rooms with other
visitors. For now, retreaters bring their own food to prepare, but
the nuns hope to get a license to serve food eventually.
</P>
<P>
   There are no televisions or radios, and guests, equally divided
between Catholics and non-Catholics, are reminded that the shared
telephone line cannot be used for electronic devices to access
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Retreaters may wander about half of the complex and join the
nuns for the prayers they chant five times daily.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Bauer, who runs a nondenominational Christian retreat
center, wanted two days at the abbey for her own reflection. She
brought a Bible to read, and a journal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think people are becoming hungry for peace and quiet and
depth in their relationship with God,'' said Bauer of Idaho
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The abbey was founded in 1935 on a 135-acre parcel in Boulder
County, a sanctuary for nuns fleeing religious persecution in Nazi
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, as Colorado's population boomed, subdivisions
began to creep closer to the abbey's land, bringing more traffic
and more people.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns decided they wanted a more rural site and, after a
five-year search, they accepted a donor's offer of 253 acres near
the Wyoming line, about 100 miles north of Denver.
</P>
<P>
   They lived in four modular houses until their permanent home was
finished last fall.
</P>
<P>
   It is a serene, sprawling ranch, far removed from civilization.
There is no public transportation, and it is a two-hour drive to
the abbey from Denver's airport.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns drive about 30 miles to get to a store. Mail is
delivered three times a week and Sunday's newspaper arrives a few
days late.
</P>
<P>
   Dubnik, a Chicago native who wears Birkenstocks and socks with
her black-and-white habit, emphasizes that the ranch work is just a
way to support the nuns' contemplative way of life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're nuns, not cowboys,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent spring day, the nuns chanted in the chapel just
before lunch. Wind whistled through the clear, open windows
offering views of granite outcroppings dotted with ponderosa pine
trees.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns left the chapel down a long hallway with arched
windows, which resembles the traditional monastic cloister walk,
and entered a private wing to eat lunch in silence. One nun usually
reads a religious, cultural or educational tract aloud during the
meal.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, the nuns sing more prayers, rest and then change
into work clothes and head to their assigned jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sister Monica Erwin's jobs is refinishing chairs brought
from the Boulder ranch. Wearing a smock and jeans with her white
hood, she sanded the wood in a garage workshop next to the retreat
houses.
</P>
<P>
   The door was rolled all the way up, providing a view of the
snowcapped mountains in the distance and another nun working in the
vegetable garden.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its remote location, the abbey is wired to the outside
world via a Web site on the Internet. Some send prayer requests,
and others want to learn about the order, said Sister Genevieve
Glen, who designed and runs the site. It is also a resource for
women considering entering monastic life.
</P>
<P>
   The nuns opened the retreat house in March. Already, it is
booked for weekends through the end of the year. Space remains
available on weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big gap if we can't welcome people and pray with
them,'' retreat director Sister Scholastica England said between
phone calls from volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's far enough away and it's not too far. People like that
they're going somewhere,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, a few visitors are drawn to this place by the rugged
scenery and by curiosity about what the nuns are doing in Virginia
Dale, a former stagecoach stop. Dubnik usually hands them a
brochure; there is rarely time to for guided tours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not hiding and praying, 'Leave us alone','' she said.
''Our tradition is that we have a rich prayer life and people can
take part in that any way they can.''

<HEADLINE> 6 More Arrested in NYC Park Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Six more men were arrested Thursday in the
attacks on women who were stripped and groped in Central Park last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also said they now believe the attacks may have
involved as many as 60 men. Previously, they had put the number at
about 40.
</P>
<P>
   The number of possible victims has risen from 24 to 32 as more
women have come forward.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests Thursday brought the total number of men arrested in
the attacks to eight. Police Commissioner Howard Safir said the men
will probably be charged with sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, speaking on WCBS-AM news radio Thursday
evening, said he plans to propose legislation making gang sexual
assault a felony punishable by 3 to 5 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The new arrests came after police distributed photographs
Wednesday of seven men believed to have been part of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said police are scanning videotapes
detectives have received from TV stations and private citizens,
hoping to identify more suspects in the attacks. Some of the
victims were stripped and fondled, while others were robbed.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 tips have been made to a telephone tip line, Safir
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least four victims have said police officers rebuffed them
when they asked for help. The department has opened an internal
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Acid Leak Reported in Derailment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLTON, Calif. (AP) -- A freight train derailed Thursday in a
rail yard, spilling diesel fuel and shutting down two offramps of
busy Interstate 10. fire officials said. No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen cars went off the tracks at 3:18 p.m. a few miles west
of San Bernardino. The cause of the derailment was not immediately
determined, county fire spokesman Dave Dowling said.
</P>
<P>
   A tanker car held sulfuric acid but it did not spill.
</P>
<P>
   A locomotive usually carries 2,000 gallons of diesel fuel,
county Fire Marshal Peter Brierty said. Colton Fire Department
spokeswoman Kathie Saidon said less than 50 gallons spilled.
</P>
<P>
   The I-10 exits were shut down as a precaution, but traffic
continued to flow on the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Brierty said the immediate hazard was a CalNeva liquid fuel
pipeline 4 feet below ground. CalNeva workers were checking whether
there was a rupture, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 4, Diamondbacks 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kevin Brown pitched a four-hitter for his
third straight complete game, and the Los Angeles Dodgers scored
quickly in Todd Stottlemyre's return to beat the Arizona
Diamondbacks 4-0 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brown (6-2) got his 16th career shutout, his first since last
Sept. 4 at Chicago. He struck out 10 and walked none, lowering his
ERA to 2.18, second in the NL behind Arizona's Randy Johnson
(1.40).
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre (8-4), activated from the disabled list before the
game, was down 3-0 after six pitches, giving up home runs to Todd
Hollandsworth and Gary Sheffield around Mark Grudzielanek's double.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre, coming off the fourth stint on the disabled list in
his 13-year career, hadn't pitched for the Diamondbacks since May
29, when he was forced out after 5 1-3 innings against St. Louis
because of tendinitis in his right elbow. This time, he allowed
three runs and five hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth, playing for the first time after missing 11 games
with a strained right hamstring, drove Stottlemyre's first pitch to
left-center for his fifth homer, his fourth leading off a game.
Grudzielanek doubled two pitches later and Sheffield hit a 1-1
pitch for his 19th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre allowed only two more hits -- a single and a double
by Hollandsworth. Stottlemyre struck out seven, including
Sheffield, Shawn Green and Eric Karros in succession in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave up a leadoff double by Tony Womack over the
outstretched glove of Sheffield in the first inning and stranded
him at third by striking out Matt Williams. The Diamondbacks got
only one more runner through the sixth, when Kelly Stinnett led off
the third with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Karros added an RBI single in the eighth against Vicente
Padilla.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Arizona optioned OF Turner Ward to Triple-A Tucson. ...
Steve Finley was 0-for-14 in the series with six strikeouts and is
5-for-27 (.185) in seven games against the Dodgers -- after coming
into this season with a .289 career average and 18 homers against
them. ... Green singled in the eighth inning, the 45th consecutive
game in which he has reached based with either a hit or a walk.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 10, Rangers 1  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle hit a grand slam for the second
straight night and also hit a solo shot as the Baltimore Orioles
stretched their winning streak to five by defeating the Texas
Rangers 10-1 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has lost eight straight, its longest skid since a 10-game
slide in July 1995. David Segui had two hits for the Rangers, who
have dropped six straight and 10 of 12 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Belle homered leading off the second for a 1-0 lead, hit a
sacrifice fly in the seventh that made it 4-1 and capped a six-run
eighth with his 13th career slam. The six RBIs matched a career
high.
</P>
<P>
   Belle has 13 homers, seven in his last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Six pitchers combined on a five-hitter as the Orioles completed
their first three-game sweep of Texas since July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The game was interrupted by rain after the third with Baltimore
up 2-1. After a delay of 2 hours, 7 minutes, Orioles manager Mike
Hargrove replaced starter Sidney Ponson, who allowed one run and
two hits.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck McElroy (1-0) pitched two hitless innings, Gabe Molina
worked out of a bases-loaded jam in the sixth and Alan Mills,
obtained Tuesday from Los Angeles, pitched a perfect seventh in his
return to the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Buddy Groom gave up two hits in the eighth and Mike Trombley
finished.
</P>
<P>
   Texas starter Esteban Loaiza (3-5) retired the first six batters
after the delay before Mike Bordick opened the sixth with a single.
Delino DeShields then delivered a perfect hit-and-run single and
B.J. Surhoff doubled in a run that made it 3-1 and chased Loaiza.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Cordero walked the bases loaded in the seventh before
Belle's fly. Harold Baines snapped a 1-for-26 skid with an RBI
single in the eighth, and DeShields walked with the bases loaded
before Belle connected.
</P>
<P>
   Before the rain came, Baltimore took a 2-0 lead in the second.
After Belle's homer, Cal Ripken and Will Clark hit one-out singles
and Baines hit a liner off Loaiza's thigh for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer singled in a run in the third. The Rangers are 2-16
when scoring fewer than four runs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Texas 2B Luis Alicea, who hurt his groin in Wednesday's
game, did not start and is day to day. ... Molina, recalled from
the minors Friday for his third stint with Baltimore, made his
first appearance since April 7. ... Lamb made his seventh error at
third base, second-most on the team behind Alicea (eight). ...
Baltimore is 19-10 at home and a major league-worst 10-24 on the
road.

high-speed access and free Internet providers squeeze them from both sides of
the market. The rapid expansion ofWorldCom Inc. and AT&AMP;T Corp. over the last
five years has ignited a feeding frenzy on large and mid-size Internet companies
and turned small ISPs into acquisition bait for the surviving regional dial-up

<HEADLINE> Daley steps into Gore Arena  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Though Bill Daley is a prominent member of one
of the country's most famous Democratic families, his favorite
quote comes from a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   On the table in his vast Commerce Department office is a framed
quotation from President Theodore Roosevelt. The Rough Rider says
that credit in life goes not to the critic but to ''the man who is
actually in the arena; whose face is marred by dust and sweat and
blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley was summoned Thursday by Al Gore to enter the biggest
political arena of all, taking over the job as chairman of the vice
president's campaign against Republican rival George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The son of the legendary Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago for
two decades, and brother to the current mayor, Richard M. Daley,
Gore's new campaign chairman is no stranger to political arenas.
</P>
<P>
   And Daley, 51 years old with a distinctive bald dome, is also
familiar with uphill political fights.
</P>
<P>
   His reputation in the Clinton administration is as the rescuer
of lost causes. He came in and pushed for congressional passage of
the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico in 1993 and
then again this year he helped win House passage of a landmark
trade agreement with China.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of the NAFTA victory, Clinton presented Daley
with an autographed photo of the two of them in the Oval Office,
with an inscription thanking him for his help on the ''Lazarus
Project.'' Like the biblical Lazarus, NAFTA had been given up for
dead before Daley arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton turned to Daley again this year to head up the
administration's all-out effort to win passage of legislation that
would end Congress' annual review of China's trade privileges with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   To both battles, Daley brought his political instincts, learned
in the rough and tumble of Chicago politics, first in growing up in
the mayor's household and then as one of his older brother's most
trusted advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Daley was actually Gore's first choice for campaign chairman
last year, but he was not ready to leave the Cabinet, a Gore aide
said, and so Tony Coelho got the job. Coelho resigned, citing
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gore and Coelho frequently consulted Daley, who was helping
with convention planning. Daley chaired the 1996 convention in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration, Daley at first was passed over
for a Cabinet job, accepting the consolation prize as head of the
NAFTA war room. His performance put him at the head of the list to
fill a Cabinet post after Clinton won re-election.
</P>
<P>
   His introduction to the media as Clinton's Commerce nominee in
December 1996 proved disastrous. Daley, who hadn't taken time to
eat that day, fainted on the stage as Clinton was speaking.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's handling of the scandal-plagued Cabinet department has
proven much more sure-footed.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress had accused Clinton's first Commerce
secretary, Ron Brown, of stocking the agency with political
operatives and using trade missions as payoffs for big Democratic
campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In response to those attacks, Daley instituted a number of
reforms, putting in place a revamped selection process for trade
trips and eliminating a hundred political jobs at Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Daley's selection as campaign chairman won praise from
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''This guy is probably the best person in America to be in
charge of this campaign,'' said Al From, head of the centrist
Democratic Leadership Council, citing his experience in Washington
and the heartland.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to helping in Illinois, a battleground state, Daley
is expected to provide strong links to the business community.
</P>
<P>
   But Daley's role in the bruising battle over NAFTA and China,
both of which were strongly opposed by organized labor, could cause
problems with that key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Teamsters spokesman Bret Caldwell called Daley's appointment ''a
big slap in the face to organized labor.''
</P>
<P>
   John Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO and an ardent Gore
supporter, said Daley's stewardship of NAFTA and the China trade
bill ''put him squarely on the opposite side of working families.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Wilhelm, a former chairman of the Democratic National
Committee and head of Clinton's 1992 campaign, said he didn't
believe labor's unhappiness would end up hurting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Daley certainly had good working relations with organized
labor in Chicago,'' said Wilhelm, who also managed the campaign of
Daley's brother. ''I think the people in organized labor will find
that his door is open.''
</P>
<P>
   Daley said he will move to Nashville to take over the campaign.
That won't prove disruptive to his family life because Daley's wife
and three children stayed behind in Chicago after he joined the
Clinton Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Daley has explained that it was easier that way because when he
wasn't out traveling the country and the world on Commerce
business, he was usually spending his time at the office anyway.

<HEADLINE> Report Urges Improved Vaccinations  </HEADLINE>
By LAURAN NEERGAARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vaccinations of America's toddlers may be at a
record high, but the immunization system is under critical strain
and the country risks disease outbreaks if it isn't strengthened, a
new report says.
</P>
<P>
   Some 11,000 babies are born each day who need shots, thousands
of unvaccinated inner-city children remain at risk of epidemics --
plus there are millions of unimmunized adults, the Institute of
Medicine warned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The institute called on federal and state governments to invest
$1.5 billion over the next five years to improve inoculations,
about $175 million more per year than is now spent. It's not just
to buy vaccines, but to shore up the public health infrastructure
to ensure the most at-risk people aren't missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're worried about children falling through the cracks,''
said report co-author Dr. David Smith, president of Texas Tech
University Health Sciences Center. ''It's very alarming.''
</P>
<P>
   But children aren't the only ones at risk. Up to 70,000 adults
die annually from vaccine-preventable illnesses, mostly flu but
also diseases ranging from pneumonia to hepatitis B, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee asked the IOM, a branch of
the National Academy of Sciences that advises Congress, to
investigate vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   The report ''raises troubling questions,'' said Sen. Jack Reed,
D-R.I. Reed and nine other senators wrote the committee to urge
that next year's federal vaccine budget, scheduled for a Senate
vote in the next few weeks, include an additional $85 million.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines are one of medicine's biggest successes, dramatically
slashing disease over the last century. Today, a record 80 percent
of toddlers -- those from infancy to age 3, the most vulnerable age
group -- have received the most critical vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 300 American children die each year of diseases vaccines
could have prevented, the IOM said. Far more are at risk if an
outbreak occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 20 percent of uninoculated American toddlers, most are
poor, inner-city children, said Dr. Bernard Guyer of Johns Hopkins
University, who chaired the IOM committee.
</P>
<P>
   For example, less than half of children in East Los Angeles are
properly immunized, vs. three-fourths of all Los Angeles children,
the report said. Worse, a Chicago study found just 36 percent of
black children -- and 29 percent of black children in public housing
-- were properly immunized, compared with 59 percent of all Chicago
children.
</P>
<P>
   These unvaccinated pockets are a reservoir for future epidemics,
just like the measles outbreak that sickened 43,000 Americans and
killed 100 in the early 1990s, the report warned.
</P>
<P>
   Immunization rates measure just the most critical, longest-used
vaccines. While the number of new childhood vaccines is expected to
triple within 25 years, cash-strapped health systems already are
having a hard time adding newer shots, the report said. Only 43
percent of children have been vaccinated against chickenpox, two
years after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
recommended it.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, only a quarter of adults at risk of influenza
complications get a yearly flu shot, and only 13 percent of lung
disease patients get a pneumonia vaccine, Smith said. ''This is
atrocious.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of problems contribute to these gaps, the report said:
Health programs inadequately track vaccine recipients so health
programs don't even know who to target. Families changing doctors
for insurance reasons -- either private insurers, managed care or
Medicaid -- can miss vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   Federal grants supporting state immunization programs have been
cut in half in recent years, the report said. Some states
compensated by investing their own money, while others severely
slashed immunization efforts. The IOM recommended that CDC change
vaccine funding to ensure the worst states get more money -- but
that each be required to invest state revenues, too.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the IOM urged Congress to allot $50 million to buy
vaccines for underinsured adults.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Women Question Future  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA BRYSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Syrian women stride the streets of their
capital in sleeveless T-shirts, even the occasional miniskirt,
while many of their sisters elsewhere in the Arab world wrap
themselves in veils and cloaks. It's a small sign that Syria
harbors modern ideas about what its female citizens can do and be.
</P>
<P>
   But Syrian women say it's far from true equality and many wonder
whether a Western-educated leader -- 34-year-old Bashar Assad,
anointed this week as his father's successor -- will help improve
their lot.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad, who died Saturday after three decades in power, was
credited with doing much to advance the cause of women's rights.
But tradition and culture didn't change overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Assad peppered his speeches with calls for women's
emancipation. His Baath Party was one of the first Arab parties to
make women's equality a platform plank, declaring in its 1946
constitution that ''the Arab woman enjoys all the rights of
citizenship.''
</P>
<P>
   Syrian women attend Damascus University in large numbers -- an
estimated 90 percent of its medical school students are women,
though the percentage of women teachers lags. Working women are
concentrated in teaching or medicine; few run their own businesses.
One runs a state bank; two sit on the Cabinet, as ministers of
culture and social affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they complain of limited opportunities and of struggling
to be treated as equals in the workplace -- then returning home to
husbands who expect them to end their day at the office with an
evening of housekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   ''All Syrian men want women at home. All men -- even educated
men, even if their wives are educated,'' said Dr. Gemma Adib, an
anesthesiologist who was one of 30 women in a class of 180 to
graduate from Damascus University in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women Adib went to school with stopped working when
they married. Adib, who is unmarried, pooled her resources with
three other women and opened a cosmetics factory six years ago -- a
business she runs in addition to her medical practice.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from medical school in Damascus and completing
specialized courses in Washington, D.C., Dr. Leila al Droubi sold
her apartment and took out a loan to open her own business 11 years
ago, a health club where Syrians could exercise under medical
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Al Droubi's family, though supportive, feared it was too much of
a challenge for a divorced mother. Her friends advised playing it
safe and working at a hospital. But she persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tiled-and-mirrored complex employs 24 people and is
crowded with treadmills, weight machines and brightly colored
furniture.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years, a room where al Droubi now holds private
exercise classes was her son's nursery. Few of her friends worked,
and she remembers crises of confidence -- worries that she was
spending too much time on business and not enough on her son, Omar.
</P>
<P>
   On one particularly frustrating day, Omar, then just 7 or 8,
comforted her. ''He said, 'Mom, do you think the other mothers who
don't work spend all day talking to their kids? They're on the
phone or watching videos ... I'm proud of you,''' she recounted.
''He made my day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think society made me pay any price for my choice.
People accepted me. Not only accepted, but respected me as a
successful woman. Women who don't think they will be accepted for
not conforming, they're just afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Many women, though, did not have the opportunities of the
44-year-old al Droubi. Her late father, a Baath party leader and
former ambassador, encouraged her independence. By taking his
family on his overseas posting, he also ensured she was exposed to
new ideas and possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the traditional assumption that girls should be raised
only to be wives and mothers remains, and some accuse the Baath
Party of trying to change Syria too fast.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s and 1980s, Assad's younger brother Rifaat -- now a
dissident but at the time his brother's top lieutenant -- recruited
women as well as men to serve their country, with the daring
romantic dream of parachute training.
</P>
<P>
   His ''girl parachutists'' became the bane of Islamic
fundamentalists, even storming the streets of the capital, ripping
veils from more conservative women. During a 1982 fundamentalist
uprising in the central city of Hama -- swiftly and brutally put
down by the government -- two young women parachutists were killed
in their beds by Islamic rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Maysa H. Diab, an art historian who runs her own antique shop,
says she has to work twice as hard to be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''People think that men are more committed, more prepared,'' she
said. But Diab, 43, is hopeful her 21-year-old daughter will find
more opportunities when she returns home from a university in Texas
to look for a job in journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just wait one more generation,'' she said. ''The girls who are
in their 20s now are learning from their mothers' mistakes. Their
mothers are sitting at home doing nothing and very unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the most optimistic and enterprising of Syrian women,
though, say real change may be slow in coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Bashar is going to make some changes. Maybe not
immediately -- that would create chaos,'' said Diab.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the late president's progressive pronouncements, Assad
made a traditional choice when it came to grooming an heir,
selecting Bashar over his first-born, a daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Diab rejected any suggestion Hafez Assad could have prepared his
daughter Bushra, said to be his favorite child, to take over Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, no,'' Diab said. ''Men are more accepted in this
society.''

<HEADLINE> Feds To Send Grizzly Back To Wild  </HEADLINE>
By DAN GALLAGHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Barrie Gilbert knows all too well what an
angry grizzly can do.
</P>
<P>
   A wildlife biologist at Utah State University, Gilbert was doing
research in Yellowstone National Park in 1997 when he surprised a
male bear that tore off his nose and scalp and clawed out his left
eye. His face had to be surgically reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mauling, Gilbert believes an educated public can
live alongside the great bear that for many symbolizes the West and
America's frontier past. Protecting the grizzly, he argues, would
say something extraordinary about Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The theory will be put to the test soon enough: The federal
government is preparing to reintroduce grizzlies in Idaho, the
first such effort involving bears in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the success of its Idaho wolf reintroduction five
years ago, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is expected to
announce plans this summer to release grizzlies as soon as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The agency contends grizzlies are the missing part of the wild
character in the largest contiguous wilderness in the lower 48
states, thousands of square miles across Idaho and into Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Critics argue that wolves are far different from grizzlies, that
few in Idaho are prepared for such big, powerful animals and that
releasing the fearsome predators is a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Dirk Kempthorne put it this way during a recent meeting
with federal officials: ''This is perhaps the first federal land
management action in history likely to result in injury or death of
members of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were confident that their
flintlocks were a match for any beast they might find in the
unknown West. Then they ran into the grizzly.
</P>
<P>
   Despite leveling a barrage that eventually brought one bear
down, the men who charted a path to the Pacific two centuries ago
were soon chased into the Missouri River.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Indians of this country seldom kill the bear,'' Clark
later wrote. ''They are very much afraid of them, and killing one
is as great a feat as two of their enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies are strong and exceptionally fast, quicker than even
the fastest sprinter, and have little to fear except humans. But
their habitat and numbers dwindled as people moved into the West,
and bears are designated as threatened under the Endangered Species
Act.
</P>
<P>
   While there are an estimated 50,000 grizzlies in Alaska and
Canada, there are only about 1,200 in the lower 48 states,
scattered across northern Montana, the Yellowstone ecosystem, the
Canadian-Idaho border and the northern Cascades.
</P>
<P>
   However, grizzly populations over the last decade have steadily
increased in the Yellowstone area and northern Montana, said Bob
Ruesink, the Idaho supervisor for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   The agency plan calls for transplanting 25 Canadian or American
bears over five years to nearly 6,000 square miles of rugged
mountains and canyons in the Selway-Bitterroot and Frank
Church-River of No Return wilderness areas of Idaho and Montana.
Each bear would be monitored by a radio collar.
</P>
<P>
   Bears would later be allowed to range over another 20,000 square
miles that encompasses communities as far west as Washington and
east into Montana. While there are essentially no people living in
the direct reintroduction zone -- all of it designated wilderness --
the wider area includes approximately 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wouldn't use any bears that have any conflict history with
people or livestock,'' said Chris Servheen, the bear recovery
coordinator in Missoula, Mont. Any grizzly could be trapped and
destroyed if it frequents areas of high human use, acts
aggressively toward humans or kills livestock.
</P>
<P>
   Hiker Tom Lopez of Boise describes himself as an
environmentalist. But after watching grizzlies in Alaska's Brooks
Range and running into one near Yellowstone, he has doubts about
creating another population.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one hand, I'm in favor of preserving as much as you can,
but the environment is too cut up to reintroduce them,'' Lopez
said. ''There's a lot of conflicts, and I'm not sure there's enough
empty space.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Allegrezza, too, once stumbled upon a grizzly. He doesn't
want to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   The Boise chiropractor and avid outdoorsman who owns the Sulphur
Creek Ranch in the proposed grizzly recovery zone, came close to a
bear while camping in Alaska several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''It scared the heck out of me,'' Allegrezza said. ''You have to
go through that experience. It makes the hair stand up on your
neck. I didn't sleep at all for the rest of the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't think of anyone who would want to go hunting in the
wilderness if there was a bear around.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is proposing a 15-member Citizen
Management Committee to oversee the recovery project. The concept
drew initial praise even from bear opponents until it became clear
that federal officials would hold veto power over any management
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Laird Noh, a sheep rancher and Idaho state senator, has been
broadminded about wolf reintroduction even while many fellow
ranchers have decried the predators' presence.
</P>
<P>
   Grizzlies, he said, are another issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''In terms of sheer numbers, the concerns I hear are people who
like to hike and camp with children in that country,'' Noh said.
''That will be the end of that. People will be frightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some 2,000 campsites within the wilderness areas that
are used by hunters, outfitters, fisherman and rafters floating the
Salmon River. Several Boy Scout camps lie at the southern end of
the grizzly recovery zone.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho leaders and many constituents are adamant about preventing
the federal government from adding bears to their back yard -- just
as it did with wolves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It represents a clear confrontation between man and species, a
confrontation in which Idahoans may pay the ultimate sacrifice,''
Kempthorne said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has vowed to sue to halt the project, and Idaho's
congressional delegation has threatened to impede funding for the
Interior Department. They have the support of their counterparts in
neighboring states, although outgoing Montana Gov. Marc Racicot
recently endorsed the reintroduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the plan say grizzlies don't breed until they are
4 years old and produce only two cubs every third year. It could
take as long as a century for the Bitterroot bear population to hit
the 280 target.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters also argue that grizzlies don't pose a serious threat
to humans. Yellowstone National Park reported only five fatal bear
attacks in 150 years through 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, who survived the bear mauling, admits he violated one
of the two cardinal rules -- never sneak up on a grizzly and keep a
clean camp so bears aren't attracted by food.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bears do get into trouble because we operate sloppily in the
forests,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   That's probably what happened to Lewis and Clark almost 200
years ago. By going after the bears for meat and grease, the
explorers were asking for trouble, Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bears weren't intentionally attacking them,'' he said.
''The grizzlies were trying to get away.''

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Stresses Worker Safety  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The challenge seems inviting: Join the Census
Bureau and help take the national head-count!
</P>
<P>
   For some, this is dangerous business. One enumerator was killed
by a pack of dogs and other census-takers have been shot at,
encountered slammed doors and fallen while retreating from angry,
uncooperative people.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Census officials reiterated that the safety of its
employees was of ''paramount importance'' -- even if it means not
getting the job done right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sent out as strong a signal that we possibly can that
the first concern we have is the safety of our census-takers,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a news conference. ''We
have census-takers in difficult situations, of course, especially
now when we are down to the last cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current door-to-door phase of the count, enumerators
still have about 900,000 of the country's 120 million households
left to contact, residents who have not yet returned a Census 2000
form.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the woman killed by dogs, six other U.S. Census workers
have died on the job this year, five in auto accidents and one
because of a stroke. Agency officials could not immediately say how
many have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Nashville, Ind., say it appeared 71-year-old
Dorothy Stewart was trying to count the residents of a one-story
log cabin when dogs attacked her. She died of multiple injuries.
Brown County sheriff's deputies arrived Saturday to find Stewart's
body about 3 feet from the home's front door, surrounded by more
than 20 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The driveway leading up to the house is posted with ''Beware of
Dog'' and ''No Trespassing'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jim Oliver said he has not ruled out filing criminal
charges against the dogs' owners, and is continuing his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Census Bureau's national office in Suitland,
Md., called Stewart's death an isolated, but tragic incident. They
could not recall an incident similar to her death, but said workers
are warned about risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They go through training which talks about potential dangers,
that if you feel uncomfortable, you leave the situation,'' said
Jerry Stahl, spokesman for the Charlotte, N.C., regional Census
office. ''But there's not extensive self-defense training or
something of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most census-taker jobs are part-time, they do not have
benefits, but are covered under workers' compensation guidelines,
Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Enumerators who feel unsafe can refer cases to supervisors. It
is up to local Census offices to determine whether workers should
be sent out in pairs for safety's sake in some areas, and some
local managers have asked police departments to monitor blocks
where census-takers are working, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, those in the field say safety isn't a great
concern, whether they work in high-crime neighborhoods or rural
areas. Some go to unusual lengths to complete the task -- like
census-takers in Maine who hitched rides on lobster boats to reach
isolated island homes, or workers in upstate New York who used
snowmobiles to traverse roads left otherwise impassible by snow.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, the job is fairly safe,'' said Nelson Bofford of
Lake Luzerne, N.Y., who worked as an enumerator in upstate New
York. ''But I believe the training was pretty good. They went out
of their way to make sure you are properly trained before you get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other enumerators say they've been pleasantly surprised by the
responses they get at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''One person offered me pie one time,'' said Michael Zdan, a
census-taker from Bear Creek, Pa.

   EREZ CROSSING, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Ali Sultan's permit to enter
Israel expired 20 days ago and his two trucks, which normally ferry
cargo between the Israeli port of Ashdod and the Gaza Strip, have
been standing idle.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan and tens of thousands of other Palestinians have been
locked out of Israel by a six-week-old strike of a few hundred
Israeli civil servants who issue entry permits at the crossings
from the Palestinian areas into Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Palestinian Authority retaliated by blocking
Israeli goods from the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   The border showdown has hurt both economies and illustrated how
much Israel and the Palestinians need each other, despite their
political conflict -- and likely will continue to do so even if the
Palestinians win independence.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli and Palestinian economies became linked when Israel
captured the West Bank and Gaza Strip during the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   During the Israeli military occupation since, the Palestinian
areas were a source of cheap labor for Israel and an outlet for
Israeli products. At the same time, Israel restricted investment in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   After the establishment of Palestinian self-rule in 1994, the
lopsided relationship continued, often exacerbated by Israeli
security closures that kept Palestinian laborers from jobs in
Israel for prolonged periods.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Palestinians have won some degree of economic
independence, said Samir Huleileh, a Palestinian economic analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The value of imports from countries other than Israel grew from
$54 million in 1994 to $800 million. The number of Palestinians
licensed to work in Israel has decreased from 120,000 in 1994 to
45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Ties remain strong. Exports to the Palestinian areas make up 15
percent of Israel's trade, while the Palestinians send 80 percent
of their products to Israel, said Shlomo Dror, spokesman for the
Israeli liaison office with the Palestinian areas.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial parks with both Israeli and Palestinian factories
have been established in border areas. Israelis and Palestinians
have set up joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
   However, the balance is easily upset.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, several hundred employees of the Israeli military
government in the West Bank and Gaza, the so-called Civil
Administration, launched a strike for better employment conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The strike meant that Palestinians whose permits expired could
not renew them. For now, only 27,000 laborers and 3,000 merchants
still have valid entry passes to Israel, but most will expire by
the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of others have been locked out, although some
from the West Bank have been able to slip through a porous border.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli military officials have tried to stand in for the Civil
Administration workers, but the effort was cut short when the
stand-ins ran out of the special paper used for the permits and
could not obtain a new shipment, Dror said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the strike, close to $100 million worth of goods
intended for Gaza are stuck in Ashdod port, said Nasser Saraj,
director general of the Palestinian Trade Ministry. Palestinian
officials have said the Palestinian economy is losing several
million dollars a day in lost wages and income.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Palestinians began turning Israeli trucks away
from Gaza, and on Wednesday, the Palestinian Trade Ministry ordered
them kept out of West Bank cities as well. An exception was made
for a truckload of cows from Israel that suffered badly in the
stifling heat and were allowed into Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   Dror said the Israeli government has gone to a labor court to
obtain a back-to-work order, and complained that the blockade was
counterproductive. But the Palestinians said this was the only way
to prod Israel to end the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan, the Palestinian trucker and father of nine, said he has
been losing about $1,000 a day. ''This is a destruction of the
Palestinian economy,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Focuses on Homosexuality  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- The furor over whether an international Gay Pride
festival should take place in the midst of a Vatican Holy Year has
done something the event's foes never expected -- made homosexuality
in Italy the talk of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Accommodating, but at heart conformists, Italians have always
taken a ''don't ask, don't tell'' approach. ''Our country has a
double morality. Some things can be done, but they can't be spoken
about,'' says Niki Vendola, the only openly gay member of
Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   So strong was the taboo that when a Cabinet minister broke it
recently, he was criticized not for being bisexual but for talking
about it.
</P>
<P>
   This couldn't have been what the Vatican intended when it went
public this spring with its objections to the World Pride Roma 2000
scheduled for July 1-9, which it said would be an affront to the
religious pilgrims visiting Rome for the Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders say the Vatican was especially annoyed because the
festival coincides with the Holy Year week devoted to Polish
pilgrims -- a group especially dear to the Polish-born pope.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition backfired. By attracting so much implacable ire,
the festival has energized Italy's long-reticent gay community and
become a cause celebre in liberal circles.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are talking, people are coming out,'' said Deborah
Oakley-Melvin, World Pride's international director. ''The
political and media attention has made this event exceptional.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival is expected to bring as many as 200,000 gays,
lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people to Rome. Courtesy of its
opponents, what started out as a party is becoming a political
event as well.
</P>
<P>
   Among the additions to the usual festival fare -- art exhibits,
fashion shows, music, films, a big parade -- is a roundtable
featuring the human rights group Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of activists weren't coming because they thought it was
just another pride event,'' said Oakley-Melvin, a veteran festival
organizer from San Francisco. ''They've changed their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican was clear about its desire to have World Pride
postponed or moved, but also relatively restrained. Things began
overheating when politicians jumped into the fray, along with a
small but vocal band of neo-fascists so far to the right that they
think the Vatican -- which holds that homosexual acts are a sin -- is
soft on homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The flap threw the city and the premier, whose governments are
leftist and viewed by Italians as tolerant, into a tizzy. Mayor
Francesco Rutelli began backtracking on an event his city had
approved in 1998 and Premier Giuliano Amato declared World Pride
''inopportune.'' Further spicing things up, the wives of the mayor
and the premier both differed publicly with their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Teetering between what appears to be a desire to please the
Vatican and at the same time not to seem to kowtow to it, the city
stopped short of canceling World Pride. Instead, it whittled away
at the edges. It withdrew official sponsorship, rejected most
festival venues and pulled funding for cultural events, forcing the
festival into a frenzy of last-minute reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley-Melvin said all events must take place in the Circus
Maximus, the ancient Roman chariot grounds in central Rome that
offer not a whisper of shade against the brutal summer sun. City
officials insist it is the venue easiest to protect against
counter-demonstrations by the tiny neo-fascist group, Forza Nuova.
</P>
<P>
   The organizers also canceled a few events the city objected to
most strongly, including the drag king contest and a photo exhibit
involving both biblical themes and homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The big battle now is over the route for the parade, the
festival's central event. The city wants the parade to go no
further than the Circus Maximus; the organizers are vowing to forge
ahead with the original plan and go all the way to the Colosseum.
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident that Rome was chosen as the host city for
World Pride in 2000 during the Roman Catholic church's Holy Year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the moment for visibility,'' Oakley-Melvin said. ''It's
the moment to open a discussion about religion and homosexuality.
That's the whole point of Pride: Visibility and equality.''

<HEADLINE> Officials Ponder Mexico Election  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- During Mexico's last presidential election
six years ago, guerrillas had seized much of southern Chiapas
state, the ruling-party candidate had been assassinated and a
Catholic cardinal had been killed in the cross fire between drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe President Ernesto Zedillo was elected by a ''vote
of fear,'' at a time when unrest was so great that people were
afraid to cast their ballot for anything other than the party that
has now governed Mexico for 71 years.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the July 2 election has been prefaced by relative
calm. But as opposition candidate Vicente Fox surges in the polls,
some analysts say the possibility remains that old-school ruling
party members could try to encourage violence -- or at least fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mexican political culture accepts the use of violence as a
political instrument,'' said Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the
Colegio de Mexico research institution.
</P>
<P>
   The elements of unrest are already in place:
</P>
<P>
   --Two guerrilla groups -- the Zapatista National Liberation Army
in Chiapas and the Popular Revolutionary Army, based in Guerrero
state -- continue to operate. Five other splinter groups of the
Popular Revolutionary Army are recruiting and occasionally carrying
out attacks.
</P>
<P>
   --Drug-smuggling gangs have stepped up their violence in recent
months, leaving bodies in streets and ranches along the U.S.
border. Although no national figures are available, analysts say
it's clear there's been an upsurge in killings this year.
</P>
<P>
   --A conflict with students of Mexico's prestigious National
Autonomous University in Mexico City continues months after police
raided the campus and arrested many of the leaders of a nearly
10-month strike. Negotiations remain stalled.
</P>
<P>
   --Social groups from across the country have stepped up their
protests in Mexico City, clogging traffic and occasionally clashing
with police. The protests concern low salaries and diminishing
funds for public education.
</P>
<P>
   Aurelio de la Vega left the guerrillas in the eastern mountains
of Mexico 20 years ago to become a deacon at a Roman Catholic
church. He says there's no reason to think there won't be violence
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The seedlings of the guerrilla movements are planted, and the
need, misery and corruption that caused them hasn't changed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say with only weeks to go before the election,
violence and unrest can have only a minimal effect on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there will be a vote of fear because it's too
late to create it, and I don't think any movement can have the
spectacular impact of the Zapatistas,'' said Sergio Aguayo, an
academic who studies national security.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however: ''The risk of instability in Mexico is always
latent because violence has always been a part of life.''
</P>
<P>
   One way in which this year's election is different from previous
ones is that, unlike other Mexican leaders, Zedillo has gone out of
his way to ensure a fair vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''Zedillo won't back any fraud,'' said Jorge Chabat, a
researcher on drug smuggling and national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a president who got there almost by accident, and if the
ruling party loses, he won't worry too much. He's more worried
about entering history as the president who allowed the democratic
transition.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if violence doesn't spark a vote of fear, there are
indications that the ruling party is trying to use memories of
unrest to scare people into voting for its candidate -- and for a
perceived stability.
</P>
<P>
   Election monitoring groups report that local ruling-party
candidates have told people they would lose welfare benefits if the
ruling party lost the election, or that the country would spiral
into crisis.

<HEADLINE> GOP Blocks Arts Endowment Increase  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans used an eleventh-hour maneuver
Thursday to block what almost became the first significant budget
increase for the National Endowment for the Arts that the House has
approved since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Arts advocates had moved to the edge of a surprise victory for
the endowment with a preliminary 207-204 vote. Their goal was to
add $15 million to the $98 million a fiscal 2001 spending bill
contains for the agency, long in the crosshairs of GOP
budget-cutters and at the center of a partisan culture war.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican leaders headed off the move by crafting an
amendment that diverted the additional money to Indian health
services. That amendment prevailed by voice vote, with most
lawmakers unwilling to deny money for health programs serving some
of the poorest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the move ignited bitter attacks by Democrats, who
accused Republicans of cynically using Indians to deny money to the
arts agency.
</P>
<P>
   ''You use them as cannon fodder in your crusade against the
arts,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., adding, ''This isn't
about priorities. This is about a political trick.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., who sponsored the GOP
amendment, said his amendment was aimed not at blocking money for
the arts but at helping Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't do it all,'' he said, citing budget constraints. ''I
hate to have you prescribe bad motives to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., asked ''are we to believe''
Nethercutt, ''the same man who supported term limits and now is
reversing himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt is among several House Republicans first elected in
1994 who promised to serve only three two-year terms. He is running
for re-election this year anyway, citing a desire to serve his
district.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying spending bill provides $2.4 billion for Indian
health services, $30 million more than this year but $200 million
less than President Clinton wants. The overall bill, which finances
land and cultural programs, was approved by 204-172.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know we have a majority of bipartisan support in the
House,'' endowment spokeswoman Cherie Simon said after the vote.
''But because our opponents once again would not allow a fair
fight, we now look to the Senate to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate version of the spending bill has not yet been
written, but that chamber usually provides more money for the arts
agency than the House does.
</P>
<P>
   The arts endowment began in 1966 with a $2.9 million budget that
grew to $176 million by 1992. But under conservative fire for
endowment grants that financed controversial art exhibits, its
funds began to slowly shrink.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans took over Congress in 1995, they sliced its
budget to $99 million for the 1996 fiscal year and proposed
abolishing the agency by 1998. But amid defections from moderate
Republicans, the agency survived -- though its budget had drifted
down to $97.6 million by this year.
</P>
<P>
   In its 207-204 vote Thursday, the House approved an amendment by
Rep. Louise Slaughter, R-N.Y., to take $22 million out of a clean
coal technology program. Twenty-five moderate Republicans defected
to support Slaughter's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan was to give $15 million to the arts agency, $5 million
to the National Endowment for the Humanities and $2 million for
museums and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has requested $150 million for the arts endowment for
fiscal 2001.

<HEADLINE> House Kills Curbs on U.S. Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A divided House approved a $14.6 billion
measure early Friday financing federal land and cultural programs
after killing a Republican move to curb President Clinton's ability
to preserve land by declaring areas to be national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   After debating the measure since Tuesday, the House approved the
overall bill by 204-172, setting up a possible veto battle with
Clinton. He objects to the measure's 70 percent cut in his proposal
for $620 million to buy federal and local park lands, and to
reductions in his plans for clean water and Indian, arts and
energy-efficiency programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to write its own version of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Republicans joined Democrats in deleting language that
would have prohibited the Interior Department from ''design,
planning or management'' of any national monuments designated since
the beginning of this year. The language, by Rep. James Hansen,
R-Utah, had already prompted a White House veto threat of the
spending bill that included it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of many Republicans and local businesses,
Clinton has designated eight new national monuments and expanded an
existing one since January. The new monuments cover nearly 2
million in acres in Arizona, California, Colorado, Oregon and
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ''This president is engaging in the biggest land grab since the
invasion of Poland,'' said Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., who led the effort to delete the
provision, accused Republicans of a ''backdoor'' attempt to, in
effect, prevent the president from protecting public lands.
Clinton's efforts to protect the land has been one of his signature
initiatives as president.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides looking ahead to this November's elections, the
fight echoed the numerous environmental battles waged between
Republicans and Clinton since the GOP took control of Congress in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., accused Republicans of an effort
worthy of ''extreme anti-environmentalists.'' Rep. Bob Schaffer,
R-Colo., said Clinton's designations were a campaign strategy in
which ''vast, beautiful landscapes are used as nothing more than
backdrop for political press conferences.''
</P>
<P>
   On the key vote, lawmakers voted 234-187 to reject an effort by
Hansen to keep his language intact. Thirty-eight Republicans joined
195 Democrats and 1 independent in opposing Hansen; 177
Republicans, 9 Democrats and 1 independent voted ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The House then voted 243-177 to delete the Hansen provision and
another section of the bill aimed at slowing government efforts to
tighten land-use restrictions in federal lands along the Columbia
River Basin in the Northwest. Later, the House reversed itself and
agreed to impede the Columbia Basin land-use regulations.
</P>
<P>
   In an administration policy statement, White House officials
wrote that Hansen's provision was an effort ''to nullify nine
recent designations, which the American public has strongly
endorsed, and to prevent the president from moving decisively in
the future to protect and preserve other sites for future
generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the designations under the 1906 Antiquities Act,
which allows a president to designate federal lands as monuments
for historic or scientific reasons. Republicans said he had used
the law to set aside more land than it intended, and had made
designations without informing local members of Congress and other
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It all comes down to one thing, an abuse of power,'' said
Hansen. ''I don't know of one president who has abused his power
more than this one has.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also designated the 1.9 million-acre Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in Utah in 1996, which would
not have been affected by Hansen's provision.
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 3.9 million acres Clinton has designated as national
monuments ranks him second among presidents who have used the
Antiquities Act. President Carter set aside 56 million acres, all
in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The type of activities allowed in national monuments varies.
Under Clinton, most allow existing mining and grazing operations to
continue but prohibit new ones to start. Permissible recreational
activities vary.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, an effort by Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., to
protect bill language preventing new management rules in the
Columbia River Basin was defeated by 221-206. But late in the
evening, with some lawmakers having left for home, the House voted
197-180 to restore Nethercutt's provision.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort that began in 1993, federal officials want to
impose new land-use regulations on 63 million acres of federal land
in Washington state, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are aimed at protecting forests, range lands and
endangered salmon and bull trout in the area. They would allow
increased logging but less grazing on the lands, close some roads,
and take steps to protect streams.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt said the rules would dramatically effect local
landowners, and said the administration was ignoring legal
requirements that the consequences on local businesses be
considered. Democrats said Nethercutt's language would hurt
preservation efforts.

<HEADLINE> Council Mulls Congo Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The Security Council is hoping a two-day
meeting of the warring factions in Congo's 2-year-old civil war
will boost the prospects for peace and cement the withdrawal of
Rwandan and Ugandan forces from the northern city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   The council is negotiating a French-sponsored draft resolution
that would demand the two former allies withdraw immediately from
the city, where they exchanged intense fire earlier this month,
killing an estimated 300 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But the draft also calls on Rwanda and Uganda and the three
other foreign armies fighting in Congo to withdraw from the country
as a whole, as called for by a peace agreement signed last year in
Lusaka, Zambia -- and threatens possible sanctions if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is how the council would make that demand -- and whether
Rwanda and Uganda would be called on to leave the country by a
specific date. Presumably that would be before the departure of
Namibia, Angola and Zimbabwe, which are in Congo at the invitation
of the government to help fend off rebel attacks.
</P>
<P>
   France, which is president of the Security Council this month
and is hosting the Congo meetings, hopes to adopt the resolution by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda entered Congo's war 22 months ago as allies
supporting rebels who wanted to topple President Laurent Kabila.
They say they are in Congo to protect their borders from their own
rebels operating in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, they battled each other in Kisangani, even
after agreeing to U.N. cease-fires and to withdraw from the
strategic city. The fighting ended Sunday after Rwandan forces
drove the Ugandans out of the northern sector of Kisangani and let
unarmed U.N. military observers deploy between the two former
allies.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at the start of a two-day meeting of the half-dozen
warring countries and Congo's main rebel groups, the U.N. special
representative for Congo asked the council to authorize about 250
armed U.N. soldiers to move into Kisangani quickly to maintain the
peace after Rwandan and Ugandan troops leave.
</P>
<P>
   Kamel Morjane said the deployment was specific for Kisangani to
fill a vacuum that had been created by the unusual situation of two
allies turning their guns on one another.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any vacuum could be very dangerous, especially for the future
of the whole process -- not only for Kisangani,'' Morjane told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. resolutions call for a 5,537-strong force made up of 500
observers and four battalions of armed security forces to protect
them to deploy around the country. So far, just 228 members of the
force have been deployed in Congo and in liaison offices in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   Morjane said that because of the difficulty in rounding up troop
contributions, he was seeking 240 soldiers to be sent to Kisangani
quickly. But, he said, that number would not be able to keep
security in the city and about 700 soldiers would be required.
</P>
<P>
   Council diplomats noted that a significant troop increase for
Kisangani had been envisaged previously but said the draft
resolution being negotiated on the sidelines of the two-day Congo
meetings wouldn't contain any new mandate requirements for the U.N.
force.
</P>
<P>
   That would have to come later, they said, without giving any
timeframe.

<HEADLINE> Philly Chinatown Deals With Change  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The face of Chinatown is changing in cities
all over the country, shaped mostly by tireless urban revival and
development.
</P>
<P>
   This city's century-old neighborhood has joined the ranks. With
a new baseball park in the works for the Philadelphia Phillies, the
community is facing a change many say will be too much to bear.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's the death knell of Chinatown,'' said Mary Yee,
who lives in Northeast Philadelphia but has frequented the shops
and restaurants of Chinatown since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The ballpark would be built on the northern edge of Chinatown, a
mix of residential, industrial and small business properties. The
City Council must still approve the stadium and a price tag
expected to be nearly twice that of building a stadium outside the
city center.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents say the ballpark would eliminate Chinatown's last
remaining frontier for development. Chinatown leaders also say the
quality of life in the already overcrowded area would be ruined by
45,000 baseball fans trooping through 80 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''People will move out and businesses will find some other
neighborhood to invest in,'' Yee said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinatowns nationwide are historically vulnerable to change
because they are a landing ground for new immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The tightly packed, inner-city neighborhoods offer dirt-cheap
apartments and entry-level jobs. Residents usually move out of
their cramped quarters as soon as they acquire job and language
skills.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Chinatown still has about 14,000 residents, but
only about half of them are Asian and just one-third are
non-citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not that Chinatown is dying, but the face of it is
changing and many things are being lost from a cultural and ethnic
basis,'' said Arnold Chin, co-chairman of San Francisco's Chinatown
Economic Development Group.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now people go to new Chinatowns, the mini-Chinatowns around
the San Francisco area. These have Chinese grocery stores and the
mom-and-pop stores that cannot afford rents downtown anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, people are leaving the crime-riddled downtown
Chinatown to settle in suburban Monterey Park's Chinese community.
Boston's Chinatown, located at the mouth of an expressway tunnel,
is also the red-light district. In Washington, D.C., Chinatown was
swallowed by the new MCI Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, all Chinatowns are not doing well,'' said Peter
Kwong, an Asian-American studies professor at Hunter College in New
York. ''Usually the least powerful political group is the Chinese.
That leads to urban development projects dumped in Chinatown.''
</P>
<P>
   Only New York's Chinatown, North America's largest with more
than 70,000 residents, continues to thrive and grow mostly due to
the city's inexhaustible need for unskilled laborers in factories,
warehouses and thousands of restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, 70 percent of Chinatown's 4,000 residents speak
no English, but the area also serves an estimated 250,000 Chinese
in the region, according to the Philadelphia Chinatown Development
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood was mostly young male immigrants running a
handful of restaurants and one grocery store until the mid-1960s,
when immigration laws changed allowing thousands of Chinese and
Asian families to move to America. Women and children congregated
at the Holy Redeemer School and Church, the only school in the area
and a meeting site for the new Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, the city proposed an eight-lane highway that
would bulldoze Holy Redeemer and cut Chinatown in half. The school
was spared, though the expressway was built through the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we saw it as a plan to get rid of Chinatown,'' said
Cecelia Yep, who has lived in Chinatown since the mid-1960s. ''It
was the only thing good in Chinatown at the time. We thought it was
a fight for survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar plans came up many times over the next 30 years, with a
federal prison, commuter rail tunnel, downtown mall and convention
center. Each was built with much compromising, and now they form a
circle around Chinatown's current core of about five city blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinatown is a symbolic center not just for the people who
live there, but for the Chinese-American community as a whole,''
said Debbie Wei of Philadelphia. ''What happens to Chinatown
becomes a symbol for what happens to us as a community.''
</P>
<P>
   Wei grew up in the Philadelphia suburbs, but her family came to
Chinatown every weekend for church and shopping. She now lives a
few blocks from Chinatown with her own kids and said she fears the
cultural costs of building a stadium in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethnic enclaves have always been the backbone of urban
development in America,'' she said. ''Each of these communities
contribute to the lifeblood of the city. When one of them is wiped
out and made extinct, it is an unalterable loss to the city.''

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands Fighters Share Food  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM FOREMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONIARA, Solomon Islands (AP) -- Fighters from the Solomon
Islands' warring factions put down their weapons and shared food
and hugs Friday at a frontline checkpoint, a sign that the latest
flare-up in a simmering ethnic dispute was easing.
</P>
<P>
   But after a friendly meeting of about an hour, the fighters took
up their guns again and vowed not to disarm until a peace deal has
been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting erupted last week on the main island of Guadalcanal
over a land rights dispute between the island's indigenous Isatabus
and people from the neighboring island of Malaita. For the past 18
months, the Isatabus have been forcing thousands of Malaitans off
land they have been settling on in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   Angry that the government failed to protect them, the Malaitans
raided an armory, seized the capital and demanded the resignation
of democratically elected Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu, who
quit Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Before stepping down, Ulufa'alu organized a special 12-member
committee made up of an even mix of government and opposition
leaders who will try to negotiate a peace deal with the rival
islanders. Ulufa'alu, who is serving as a caretaker prime minister,
said the goal was to resolve the tensions within two weeks so that
parliament, without acting under duress, could pick a new leader.
</P>
<P>
   In a spontaneous gesture, fighters from both sides came out of
their bunkers and met Friday on a bridge at Alligator Creek, on the
outskirts of the capital Honiara.
</P>
<P>
   ''After seeing them wave to us, we left our arms and walked
toward their bunker,'' said Amos Anilafa, a Malaitan rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''They sent militants to meet us ... we hugged each other and
shook hands. Some of us shed tears. We felt love for each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed that peace must be immediately restored (and) that
the government must give us amnesty to create a pathway to lasting
peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came amid new appeals Friday for an end to tensions
that have caused the collapse of the government and is threatening
to destroy the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated that men haven't brought peace, a group of about 70
women wearing scarfs of yellow, blue and green -- the colors of the
national flag -- approached the warring groups with a simple
message: Stop fighting and talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think as mothers, they are our sons. We brought them here
in our wombs and we love them and we want them to lay down their
guns,'' said Margaret Aihunu, a teacher who joined the women at a
rally in Honiara before leaving to meet the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the special committee, Governor General John Ini
Lapli, urged the rebels to seek a peaceful end to their disputes
and help repair the nation's democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''You all are endowed with wisdom and intelligence,'' Lapli said
in a national radio address, ''and you must use it to improve
yourselves, your communities and your beloved country, the Solomon
Islands.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Malaita rebels said they would allow police to
take over the security of the capital. But they have not returned
weapons that they took from the police and it was unclear how the
police could patrol unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides of the conflict have been honoring a 14-day
cease-fire, which expires next week.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the Isatabus are content with controlling the
countryside and the Malaitans lack the will and resources to expand
their territory beyond the capital.
</P>
<P>
   With many of the homes and shops empty in the capital, the main
source of revenue -- the retail industry -- has suffered and many
large factories have had to shut down because they can't find
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Solomon Islands lie 1,600 miles northeast of Sydney,
Australia. They were the scene of battles between the United States
and Japan during World War II.

Wind Sends Colo. Fire Toward Houses
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DRAKE, Colo. (AP) -- Blowtorch winds gusting to 60 mph whipped two wildfires
and sent flames racing Thursday, forcing firefighters to retreat and driving
hundreds more people from their homes in the foothills outside Denver. More than
200 National Guardsmen were called in to join the 1,500 firefighters already
battling the two blazes. But crews expected that calmer winds Friday would allow
firefighters to attack from the air again. The fires have burned nearly 17,200
acres and destroyed about 50 structures, mostly homes, since Monday. Before the
flareup Thursday, about 800 people had been evacuated.

Feds Make Big Heroin Bust
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal agents made more than 170 arrests Thursday as they
broke up a multimillion-dollar Mexican heroin ring alleged to have smuggled
unusually pure and cheap black tar heroin into new markets from one U.S. coast
to the other. The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, was distributing
80 pounds of heroin each month, worth more than $7 million, in 22 U.S. cities.
The ring was marketing the heroin at such a high level of purity and such a low
price that the Mexicans pushed into eastern U.S. markets formerly served by
Colombian drug traffickers, Keefe said in an interview.

6 More Arrested in NYC Park Attacks

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Six more men were arrested Thursday in the attacks on women
who were stripped and groped in Central Park last weekend. Investigators also
said they now believe the attacks may have involved as many as 60 men.
Previously, they had put the number at about 40. The number of possible victims
has risen from 24 to 32 as more women have come forward. The arrests Thursday
brought the total number of men arrested in the attacks to eight. Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said the men will probably be charged with sexual
assault.

GOP Blocks Arts Endowment Increase
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans used an eleventh-hour maneuver Thursday to
block what almost became the first significant budget increase for the National
Endowment for the Arts that the House has approved since 1992. Arts advocates
had moved to the edge of a surprise victory for the endowment with a preliminary
207-204 vote. Their goal was to add $15 million to the $98 million a fiscal 2001
spending bill contains for the agency, long in the crosshairs of GOP
budget-cutters and at the center of a partisan culture war. But Republican
leaders headed off the move by crafting an amendment that diverted the
additional money to Indian health services. That amendment prevailed by voice
vote.

Small Privately-Held ISPs Endangered
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Small Internet service providers that offer only
dial-up access are fighting for survival as telecommunication giants offering
high-speed access and free Internet providers squeeze them from both sides of
the market. The rapid expansion ofWorldCom Inc. and AT&AMP;T Corp. over the last
five years has ignited a feeding frenzy on large and mid-size Internet companies
and turned small ISPs into acquisition bait for the surviving regional dial-up
access providers looking for growth. If that isn't bad enough, at the other end
of the food chain, ISPs that offer free access to the Web are signing away
customers looking for a cheaper way to surf.

GOP Says Plan Would Ensure Coverage

''We've tried to allow as much flexibility with this ... to accommodate any
scenario that we might be able to run into,'' said Rep. Richard Burr, R-N.C.,
among the architects of the GOP plan. A new draft summary of Republican
legislation being prepared for House action -- possibly as soon as next week --

Report Urges Improved Vaccinations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vaccinations of America's toddlers may be at a record
high, but the immunization system is under critical strain and the country risks
disease outbreaks if it isn't strengthened, a new report says. Some 11,000
babies are born each day who need shots, thousands of unvaccinated inner-city
children remain at risk of epidemics -- plus there are millions of unimmunized
adults, the Institute of Medicine warned Thursday. The institute called on
federal and state governments to invest $1.5 billion over the next five years to
improve inoculations, about $175 million more per year than is now spent.

<HEADLINE> Man Fired For Religion Complaints  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMILTON, Ala. (AP) -- Greg Thomas got along with his neighbors
when they thought of him simply as the only Jew in town. They
didn't understand his conversion to Judaism from Christianity a few
years ago, but they tolerated it.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern hospitality evaporated after Thomas complained
about Christian prayers and an evangelism program conducted at
Hamilton High School.
</P>
<P>
   People stopped coming to plays staged by Thomas, who was
artistic director for a community theater and a drama teacher at
the local two-year college. Both positions were eliminated within
weeks, moves prompted solely by economics, his former employers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is moving away, forced out by what he describes as
small-town Christians who didn't appreciate his reminders about the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I rocked the boat, and I guess sometimes that's the price you
pay,'' said Thomas, 39, a member of the town's United Methodist
church until his conversion.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Kaiman, the regional director of the Anti-Defamation League
in Atlanta, said what happened to Thomas isn't unusual in the rural
South, where entire counties sometimes have no Jewish residents.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a calculated strategy in some of these isolated places
to integrate specific religious doctrine into a school
environment,'' Kaiman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Hamilton, a town of 6,300 people in rural northwest Alabama,
Christianity isn't just religion -- it's life.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant churches surround the courthouse square. A drawing of
Jesus hangs on the wall in the studio of the local cable station,
TV-23.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that channel where Thomas first saw the videotape of a
gospel show performed at Hamilton High during school hours in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are claiming this place for the kingdom of God, that Jesus
will be exalted over Hamilton High School and Middle School!''
local evangelist Karen Weaton said at the start of the program,
which was optional for students.
</P>
<P>
   The show included student testimonials and a skit depicting a
boxing match in which Jesus defeated Satan. God was the referee.
Another time, Thomas watched as players and coaches prayed together
on the football field at the end of a televised game.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas sought help from the ADL in educating school officials
about the Constitution and court rulings limiting the role of
religion in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The county then held a training session for principals about
religion in schools. Superintendent Bravell Jackson said coaches
were barred from praying with students, and revival-like programs
were banned.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not what school is for,'' Jackson said. ''We ought to
leave the teaching of religion and the Bible up to the parents at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Then rumors spread that Thomas planned to sue the school board.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors weren't true, but Thomas said people stopped talking
to him on the street. He said one woman called and accused him of
trying to turn the school into ''the Jewish League.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' shows suddenly weren't such a hot ticket. Only a few
people showed up for a performance of the Holocaust opera
''Brundibar'' by a children's drama troupe led by Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time for the Bevill Community Theater to perform a
play directed by Thomas, teachers who normally brought hundreds of
children stayed away. Shows were canceled, costing some $2,000 in
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mayhall, head of the theater board, said teachers told him
they didn't like Thomas' complaints about Christianity in the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of them said they had talked to other teachers in their
grade and they felt the same way,'' he said. ''I would describe it
as a boycott.''
</P>
<P>
   Low attendance led to more red ink in an already tight budget,
and Thomas' job of artistic director was eliminated in November.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Bevill State Community College eliminated its
theater program, cutting Thomas' part-time job of seven years and
leaving him without work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just had to close the theater department because a cost
analysis showed it was losing money every year,'' said the dean,
Camilla Benton.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas plans to enroll this fall at Richard Stockton College in
New Jersey to pursue a master's degree in Holocaust studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I'm taking the lessons I've learned in Hamilton, both
good and bad, and applying it to a master's degree,'' Thomas said.

<HEADLINE> Bishops Discuss Priest Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- The most pressing practical problem facing the
Roman Catholic Church is a growing shortage of priests that could
lead to fewer Masses, more priestless parishes and deacons leading
worship services, the nation's Catholic bishops say.
</P>
<P>
   A two-year study on the burgeoning problem was presented
Thursday to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, which is
meeting in Milwaukee through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, there were 58,132 priests serving 46.6 million
parishioners in the United States. Today there are 20 percent fewer
priests and nearly a third more parishioners, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Indications are the things will get worse over the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of Newark, N.J., said his diocese
projects the number of priests to drop from 540 to 192 in 20 years.
And Auxiliary Bishop Thomas Curry reported that due to immigration,
some parishes in the Los Angeles archdiocese have 18,000 Catholic
households.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problems are simply enormous,'' Curry said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishops provided a range of explanations for the shortfall:
fewer parents encouraging church vocations, church negativism,
secularism and materialism in society, and a reluctance to make
permanent commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, the situation is bound to worsen due to
the rising average age of priests -- currently 57 for those working
in dioceses -- retirements and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   As for future recruits, 3,474 candidates are studying in
graduate-level seminaries, a 57 percent drop from 1965. A quarter
of the seminarians are foreign born. Additionally, major
archdioceses are ordaining fewer than 10 new priests this year.
</P>
<P>
   The only functions limited to priests are celebration of Mass
and granting absolution from sins. But in practice, Catholics
expect priests to preside at baptisms, marriages and funerals and
to participate in other parish functions.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Stephen Blaire of Stockton, Calif., summarized the
findings of 18 focus groups with priests around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many say they feel inadequate, stressed and exhausted,'' he
said. He quoted one priest as saying, ''There are just too many
expectations, too much paperwork and not enough ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Priests also expressed concern about ''increased isolation'' and
less mentoring from fellow priests.
</P>
<P>
   Two liberal groups, Call to Action of Chicago and the
Cleveland-based FutureChurch, issued a statement repeating their
call for married priests and women priests. Pope John Paul has
ruled out consideration of those changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted that the U.S. bishops are finally beginning to
talk about the critical shortage of priests, but the solutions they
are proposing won't solve the problem,'' said the Rev. Lou
Trivison, co-founder of FutureChurch.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, bishops discussed a pending policy statement that
strongly criticizes the nation's criminal justice system and
indicated they are ready to endorse the measure to be voted on in
November.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-page statement declares the criminal justice system ''is
not really working: victims are often ignored, offenders are often
not rehabilitated, and many communities have lost their sense of
security.'' It also repeats the U.S. church hierarchy's position
that capital punishment must be abolished.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was ever a need for a statement, it is this one,''
said Bishop Joseph Fiorenza of Galveston and Houston, Texas,
president of the U.S. bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Cardinal Francis George said ''the freedom that should
characterize a free nation is reproached in the present system.''

<HEADLINE> Delegates Visit Figi Islands  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- An international delegation visiting Fiji to
press for the release of 31 political hostages welcomed the
military's commitment this week to restore a multiracial democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But the rebels who stormed parliament May 19 warned on Friday
that if the military plans to restore Fiji's 1997 constitution,
faltering negotiations to release the captives could collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives from the Commonwealth, an organization of
Britain and its former colonies, were meeting Friday with the
military as well as political, religious and indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the military understands only too well what the
consequences for Fiji are if Fiji does not return to a multiracial,
democratic and constitutional form of government,'' said
Australia's Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, the European Union and the United States have warned
that Fiji will be diplomatically and economically isolated unless
democracy is restored.
</P>
<P>
   Fijian nationalists, led by failed businessman George Speight
are holding 31 hostages including deposed Prime Minister Mahendra
Chaudhry -- the first ethnic Indian prime minister -- in parliament.
They are demanding the country's ethnic Indian minority be stripped
of political power.
</P>
<P>
   The military, which declared martial law May 29, said Thursday
it wanted to see Fiji return to multiracial rule, while also
addressing the concerns of indigenous Fijians. Military spokesman
Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini said Fiji's 1997 constitution, which
the army had pledged to scrap, could form a basis for the country's
next constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they are saying that, they are treading on very dangerous
ground,'' said rebel spokesman Jo Nata. ''This whole thing began
because of distaste over the 1997 constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationalists say the constitution gave too much power to ethnic
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main disputes between indigenous Fijians and ethnic
Indians is over sugar, the nation's cash crop. Indian farmers built
the industry by operating plantations on land communally owned by
indigenous Fijians and leased at low rates set by English colonial
law. The leases are due to be renewed, and Chaudhry's refusal to
accept demands for higher rent enraged many Fijians.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and his rebels were meeting Friday for a second day with
a delegation of Fijian tribal chiefs to discuss a resolution to the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Since Monday, when soldiers shot at Speight's car as it drove
through a roadblock, hundreds of supporters have trooped into
parliament. On Thursday, they brought food including home-baked
cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Civil unrest continues near parliament. A military spokesman
said soldiers fired warning shots Thursday night at a group of
people believed to have come from parliament who were looting a
nearby house.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Six more men were awaiting arraignment overnight
on charges they took part in attacks on at least 37 women in
Central Park following the Puerto Rican Day Parade.
</P>
<P>
   The six men were arrested Thursday, a day after police culled
their photos from amateur videotapes of the attacks and made the
pictures public.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall news conference, Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said at least 50 calls were made to the NYPD's crime hotline about
other suspects, and he hoped more arrests would be made soon.
Photos of more suspects were released Thursday after victims
identified their alleged attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men have been arrested in all, including two who were
taken into custody minutes after they allegedly attacked three
British tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said up to 60 men in various groups may
have participated in the attacks, in which girls and women were
doused with water, some groped and sexually abused, others robbed.
</P>
<P>
   One victim was only 14 years old, another a French tourist on
her honeymoon. All the attacks occurred in broad daylight, and the
majority of victims were assaulted in the southern end of the park,
near the Sixth Avenue entrance, the zoo, and across from the Plaza
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Safir identified two of the latest suspects as John Taylor, 24,
and Isaias Lozano, 19, both of Queens. He said he expected they
would be charged with sexual abuse, but the district attorney's
office will make the final determination.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki, speaking on WCBS-AM news radio Thursday
evening, said he plans to propose legislation making gang sexual
assault a felony punishable by 3-5 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano was arrested at his girlfriend's house in Queens, Taylor
at his mother's home in the same borough. Manuel Nunez, 18, of the
Bronx, was arrested near his apartment there.
</P>
<P>
   Lozano, Taylor and Nunez were found after police received tips
called into the Crime Stoppers hotline. If the trio are indicted,
police will pay the tipsters $2,000 each; if convicted, the amount
rises to $10,000 apiece to each of the tipsters.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD detectives also went to Jersey City, N.J., to pick up
Steven Burt, 31, who surrendered to a parole officer. Burt wasn't
on parole at the time, but wanted to turn himself into a law
enforcement officer, said Assistant Chief William Taylor, head of
Manhattan detectives.
</P>
<P>
   ''He saw his picture in the paper and on TV, and he was
concerned that his friends were going to give him up,'' Chief
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said Burt had the right idea: ''I suggest that they (other
suspects) surrender also because we are going to find you and we
are going to find the others who are involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Vargas, 18, of the Bronx, described by police as a
suspected ringleader, surrendered himself to police late Thursday.
''He seems to have orchestrated a lot of what was going on, or at
least was a main player,'' Chief Taylor had said. Vargas was
identified by a tip to Crime Stoppers, and police had visited his
apartment but did not find him.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Camacho, 16, of Inwood, Long Island, also turned himself
in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects arrested Sunday - David Rowe, 24, of Hempstead,
and Tremayne Bain, 23, of Brooklyn - were charged with
second-degree aggravated sexual abuse, first-degree sexual abuse
and second-degree robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe and Bain are friends, but police do not believe any of the
other men arrested had any connection to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani praised the police for the additional arrests, then
berated the media for focusing its coverage on allegations made by
several victims that police staffing the Puerto Rican Day parade
Sunday along neighboring Fifth Avenue did nothing to help them. The
mayor said the majority of officers did their jobs well that day.
</P>
<P>
   Both Safir and Giuliani again denied that police assigned to the
parade relaxed regulations on offenses such as drinking in public
due to tensions between the NYPD and minority communities.

<HEADLINE> State teachers to receive grants to work at local companies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Some of Connecticut's teachers will be
getting other jobs this summer, as part of an effort to better
prepare their students for the work force.
</P>
<P>
   In a program designed to give educators a better idea of how
their lessons are applied in businesses and industry, about 45 high
school teachers will be given summer jobs with Hartford-area
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers will bring their on-the-job experience back to the
classroom, designing curriculums based on their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Business and Industry Association is
administering $100,000 in grants to fund the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today's students need a lot more information about what
careers are available,'' said Lauren Weisberg Kaufman, vice
president for education and training for CBIA. ''Many teachers have
only worked in an academic environment. They don't always have a
frame of reference if they haven't had the opportunity to see
firsthand what certain careers are all about.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, A science, geology and physics teacher will be
working at a housing construction site this summer. When She
teaches her physics class in the fall she will be able to say how
these concepts can be applied to heating, plumbing, carpentry and
electricity, Weisberg Kaufman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other teachers are slated to work in fields including arts and
media, business and finance, science, manufacturing, tourism and
construction technologies.
</P>
<P>
   After completing the program, the teachers will present
professional development seminars to other educators in their
school districts to help them get involved in school-to-career
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   CBIA is the state's largest business organization, with 10,000
member companies throughout Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Gore Pledges Not to Miss a Beat  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Al Gore promised his troops that under
the new command of Commerce Secretary William Daley, ''We're not
going to miss a beat.'' But what some Democrats cheered as a
nothing-but-good choice for a campaign chairman, labor leaders
denounced as a slap and Republicans derided as ''another
reinvention.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his senior advisers were huddling today at the vice
presidential residence in Washington, using the weekly session to
plot a seamless transition that won't steal attention from his
''progress and prosperity'' tour, which resumes Tuesday in
Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also plans to meet over the weekend with AFL-CIO President
John Sweeney, as he promised during the labor leader's angry
telephone conversation with the vice president. Organized labor
branded Daley an enemy long ago for his championship of free-trade
deals.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt resignation Thursday of campaign chairman Tony
Coelho, for health reasons, fell on Day 3 of the three-week
campaign tour meant to help Gore claim credit for the good economy.
</P>
<P>
   At Gore's new campaign headquarters here, where phones were
still being installed after a weekend move, rank-and-file aides
seamlessly went ahead with lunch appointments and scheduled
briefings without much murmur about the surprise change at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, who flew to Cincinnati to meet up with Gore, seconded his
new boss' assurance that there would be no shake-up. ''I think the
campaign is in very good shape. We have to implement the game plan
laid out,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders in Washington, however, signaled trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, a powerful Democratic constituency, already
opposed Daley for his stewardship of the North American Free Trade
Agreement in 1993. And the fact that Daley was putting off his
official start date at Gore 2000 until July 15 in order to see
congressional passage of an equally hated China trade bill stung
all the more.
</P>
<P>
   Bret Caldwell, a spokesman for the Teamsters, called the
appointment ''slap in the face of labor'' and said it wouldn't help
Gore beat Republican rival George W. Bush for the union's
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, an ardent Gore supporter who muscled through the labor
federation's early endorsement of the vice president last year,
issued a surprisingly biting statement saying Daley's work on free
trade ''put him squarely on the opposite side of working
families.''
</P>
<P>
   A Gore campaign official said the operation, which is relying
heavily on union workers to help with voter turnout in November,
frantically tried to telephone labor leaders Thursday morning with
a soothing ''heads-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both the Teamsters and AFL-CIO said they received
no such courtesy calls. Gore, who told reporters Sweeney was the
first person he called about Daley, reached the labor leader only
belatedly. Those familiar with the talk described Sweeney as angry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wonder whether naming a new chairman involves yet another
reinvention of the Gore campaign,'' said Bush spokeswoman Karen
Hughes. ''Which Vice President Gore will campaign next week?''
</P>
<P>
   Several Gore campaign officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, underscored the good Daley brings:
</P>
<P>
   -- He chaired the 1996 Democratic convention in his native
Chicago, has a long personal relationship with Gore and knows the
campaign inside out. Gore and Coelho frequently consulted with
Daley, who participated in planning meetings for this summer's
convention in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   -- His political connections (he is a son of the late Chicago
Mayor Richard J. Daley and brother of current Mayor Richard M.
Daley) strengthen Gore's prospects of winning Illinois, a critical
Midwest battleground.
</P>
<P>
   -- He can actively and publicly campaign for Gore, a role the
low-profile Coelho, a target of Republicans and the subject of
State and Justice department investigations, did not play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing but a plus for Gore,'' said Democratic strategist
Bill Carrick.
</P>
<P>
   Coelho is under criminal investigation for financial
transactions he made in 1998 while serving as head of the U.S.
exhibition at the world's fair in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Stanley Brand, said ''nothing is changed'' on that
front and that the investigations played no part in his decision to
step down. ''It's purely health related,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   One senior aide noted that Daley was Gore's first choice for
campaign chairman last year. Gore turned to Coelho after Daley
indicated it wasn't the right time to leave the Cabinet, the aide
said.
</P>
<P>
   David Wilhelm, a former Democratic National Committee chairman
and manager of the 1992 Clinton-Gore campaign, said Daley ''brings
to the job what is always needed, the absolute confidence of the
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm hoped Daley's history of good relations with Chicago
union leaders will help overcome labor hostility now.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows and Al Gore knows that organized labor is going to be
critical to'' electing Gore president, Wilhelm said.

<HEADLINE> Exeter OKs Gay Dorm Parents  </HEADLINE>
By REBECCA MAHONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   EXETER, N.H. (AP) -- Without a sympathetic adult to turn to,
Phillips Exeter Academy college adviser Cary Einhaus felt isolated
when he was in high school and figuring out he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   Now he will get a chance to be the kind of role model he once
sought.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, trustees at Exeter, one of the nation's oldest
and most prestigious prep schools, voted to allow gay and lesbian
faculty and staff to serve as dormitory parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have helped me when I was a teen-ager if I had
someone I could identify with,'' Einhaus said. ''For kids who may
be questioning their sexuality or know they're gay, to not have
anyone to talk to or relate to is overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   The new policy also will help break down stereotypes about gays
and lesbians among heterosexual students, said Einhaus, who lives
alone in a boys' dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   The vote at Exeter and similar decisions at two Massachusetts
prep schools reflect how New England's elite private academies,
once attended solely by the scions of rich, white families, are
seeking to embrace diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want our students to be accepting and respectful of all
people, including people who are gay,'' said Kathy Brownbeck,
Exeter's dean of students. ''The trustees and faculty are committed
not only to the equity of our faculty but to supporting gay
students and educating students who are not gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy was supported unanimously by the trustees and nearly
unanimously by faculty at the 219-year-old school.
</P>
<P>
   At Exeter, faculty members are required to live in apartments in
the dormitories for 10 years. Until now, faculty members in
same-sex relationships, unlike their heterosexual colleagues, were
not allowed to live with their partners.
</P>
<P>
   The move puts Exeter in line with its sibling and rival,
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., which voted last October to
allow gay faculty couples in the dorms starting this fall. Concord
Academy in Concord, Mass., adopted a similar measure in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All three prep schools have extended health insurance benefits
to the partners of gay and lesbian employees for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like a natural transition for us, a logical
extension of a series of policies that have been established
granting equity for same sex couples,'' said Sharon Britton, a
spokeswoman for the Andover school.
</P>
<P>
   Exeter's policy will not take effect until the 2001-2002 school
year, so prospective students and their parents know about it
before their children apply.
</P>
<P>
   Brownbeck said her office has received numerous phone calls and
e-mails about the change, but only three were negative.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction at Andover was much the same: Only seven of about 30
e-mails were from concerned parents, Britton said. And at Concord,
the policy ''wasn't even an issue,'' said Brian Racine, a science
teacher who has lived in a dorm with his partner for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The transition was so totally seamless,'' he said. ''The kids
have been incredibly supportive, the faculty has been behind us all
the way. I don't even have to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Taylor, an Exeter student who was interviewed at a coffee
shop in town Tuesday, the day after school let out, said he
disagreed with the policy but would not be affected by it because
he does not live on campus.
</P>
<P>
   But Jean Rugby, who was visiting the campus with her 13-year-old
son Jonathan, a prospective applicant, approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the dorm parents are good and caring people, that's
all that matters,'' she said. ''We can't teach (Jonathan) not to
discriminate and then not choose Exeter because there's a policy
that might be offensive to some people.''

<HEADLINE> Prescriptions Hot in Election Year  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Voters are intensely interested in making
prescription drugs more affordable for senior citizens. Most
politicians agree something needs to be done. And everybody from
presidential candidates to state lawmakers are scrambling aboard
the bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   It all sounds like a formula for getting results, even in an
election year.
</P>
<P>
   Election pressures could increase the odds of Congress passing a
plan -- but President Clinton has said he wants Republicans to go
further in providing benefits than they have offered so far.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the political potency of the prescription drugs
issue, just listen to Nancy Ryman, a 72-year-old widow from Bay
City, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''My prescription drugs cost me $250 a month and I make $1,440 a
month from Social Security and my pension,'' said the retired nurse
with a heart ailment. ''I don't have any extra money. What do
people do who don't have as much money as me?''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of people around the country -- including two of the most
consistent groups of voters -- feel strongly about the issue, polls
suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Three-fourths of Americans age 61 and older say prescription
drugs will be very important in their presidential vote, according
to an ABC News poll last month. More significantly, two-thirds of
those between the ages of 45 and 64 -- people anticipating their own
medical needs in retirement and worrying about their parents -- rate
it as a very important issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the hottest issue we've seen in some time, in every
part of the country and every part of our membership,'' said John
Rother, legislative director for AARP, which lobbies on behalf of
older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is wrestling over what to do as Republicans rush to get
ahead of Clinton and Democratic congressional leaders on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has proposed a standard drug benefit under Medicare,
adding prescriptions to other health care services the program
covers if retirees pay an additional monthly premium. House
Republicans would enlist private insurers to sell
government-subsidized and approved prescription drug insurance
policies to Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday he had ''grave concerns about the GOP
proposal, which he said relied too heavily on private industry to
fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Thomas, the California Republican and chief
architect of the GOP plan, said ''the private sector can do a great
job'' but that government would step in where necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In the presidential contest, Democrat Al Gore favors providing a
standard Medicare drug benefit for those who choose it, while
Republican George W. Bush wants a bigger role for private industry.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats think it's a potent enough issue that it was the
subject of the Democratic National Committee's first TV campaign
commercial promoting Gore.
</P>
<P>
   When people were asked in the ABC poll who they trusted to do a
better job of handling prescription drugs, half said Gore and a
third said Bush. Women were more likely than men to say
prescription drugs were very important in their vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Geoff Garin said the president and Democrats
feel public sentiment is strong enough to hold out for a big
solution, not a smaller-scale plan like the GOP offering.
</P>
<P>
   State lawmakers recognize the magnitude of the issue, too.
Almost half of states already have some kind of program to help
seniors pay for prescription drugs, said Richard Cauchi, a policy
specialist with the National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Legislators report this is what their constituents are
clamoring for,'' he said. ''They see ways that states can afford to
do at least a piece of this. But a number of legislators hope
Congress will do something ... no state can afford to do a
Medicare-like benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican state Rep. Nancy Argenziano of Florida heard a clear
message while visiting constituents around the state to talk about
health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talk to constituents from different districts, the elderly
especially, and their number one cry to me was to help us with
prescription drugs. That was from the middle-income as well as the
poor,'' she said. Florida passed legislation this year providing
subsidies for some residents. And Texas Gov. Bush ''understands we
have to do something about the pharmaceuticals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Retired nurse Ryman is pessimistic a national agreement will be
reached anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just argue for arguments' sake,'' she said of the
politicians, adding that the people's concerns get left out.
''Republicans aren't going to do it to suit the Democrats and vice
versa.''

<HEADLINE> N.Korea Said Willing For Papal Visit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea has expressed a
willingness to invite Pope John Paul II to visit the communist
country, South Korean President Kim Dae-jung said Friday after
visiting the North for a historic summit.
</P>
<P>
   In a Cabinet meeting, the South Korean president said that
during the three-day summit, which ended Thursday, he asked his
North Korean counterpart, Kim Jong Il, to invite the pope to visit
his country, according to his spokesman, Park Joon-young.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Kim Jong Il) inquired about the pope's age and then said,
'Let him come and visit,''' the spokesman quoted the president as
telling the Cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit with the pope in the Vatican in March, Kim
Dae-jung, a Catholic, suggested a papal visit to the North, saying
that it would enhance peace on the divided Korean peninsula. At the
time, Kim said the pope showed an interest. He quoted John Paul as
saying that if he can go to North Korea, it would be ''a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea does not encourage religion among its tightly
controlled population of 22 million. It built three churches -- two
Protestant and one Roman Catholic -- in the late 1980s. South Korea,
with a population of 46 million, has some 4 million Roman
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials view the North's willingness to invite
the pope as another sign of the communist country opening up after
long isolation.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul has showed an active interest in concerns of the two
Korean states, giving thousands of dollars from his charities to
famine-stricken North Korea and encouraging others to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the inter-Korean summit began Tuesday, the pope
issued a special statement encouraging the two Korean leaders to
make peace.

<HEADLINE> Bush May Have Hope in Massachusetts  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Massachusetts is home to such famous Democrats as
the Kennedys, but its Republican governor and lieutenant governor
give George W. Bush a glimmer of hope this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving Thursday for two fund-raisers aimed at generating more
than $1 million for the Republican National Committee, Bush joked
that he would only take the outcome of his home state of Texas for
granted in the fall matchup with Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   It was optimistic talk, considering Bush lost the Massachusetts
GOP primary in March to Sen. John McCain, 65 percent to 32 percent.
In 1988, the state's governor, Michael S. Dukakis, was the
Democratic presidential nominee against Bush's father, former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recognize it's a Democratic state, but there have been some
notable exceptions,'' said Bush, flanked by Gov. Paul Cellucci and
Lt. Gov. Jane Swift. ''The only state that's almost certain is
Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush was heading to Canton, Ohio, on Friday for a visit to
Passages School, an alternative school for at-risk students.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor is fond of blasting ''the soft bigotry of low
expectations,'' saying all children can learn if placed in the
appropriate setting.
</P>
<P>
   Passages School, part of the city school district, is an
alternative place of learning for pupils who have been expelled or
suspended from their local public school.
</P>
<P>
   The primary goal is to provide a personalized education program,
allowing them to return to their regular schools. Students are also
encouraged to perform community service.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier in South Portland, Maine, Bush outlined a
five-year, $880 million plan to remove ''the last barriers to full,
independent, productive lives'' for the disabled on the job and at
home.
</P>
<P>
   And he kicked off a series of GOP fund-raising events netting
nearly $5 million in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also commented on the loss of computer files containing
nuclear weapons secrets from a New Mexico lab, saying the matter
was ''of great concern.'' He blamed the Clinton administration for
''another major security lapse'' and said he supports an
investigation into the missing files.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like all Americans, I'm deeply concerned about security lapses
at Los Alamos and I look forward to finding out what the facts
are,'' Bush said. ''I think it's very important that security be
tight. This is an administration that promised no more security
lapses and then there was another major security lapse.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he already had spoken with former Tennessee
Sen. Howard Baker, who is leading the investigation with former
Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also said that, if elected, he would not be deterred in his
efforts to build a national missile defense system. Defense
Secretary William Cohen faced opposition this week from Russian
President Vladimir Putin during discussions about a limited missile
system.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll find out how good of a diplomat I am,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   On the money front, he attended a $100,000 fund-raiser in Maine,
followed by two events in Boston raising $1 million. After school
Friday in Ohio, there is a $500,000 Republican National Committee
luncheon followed by a $600,000 event in Kentucky on behalf of the
state party.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was closing the week with events Saturday in Florida
expected to raise $2.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   Separately on Thursday, the Republican National Committee
announced a new ad targeted to Hispanic voters. The 30-second spot,
to begin airing Monday in New Mexico, is a Spanish-language version
of the Social Security commercial now running there and in 16 other
states.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Bill Deal Sought  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate-passed measure that would establish
the first national standard for drunken driving could hit a
roadblock in the House as negotiators from both chambers try to
adopt a compromise transportation spending bill this year.
</P>
<P>
   Other contentious issues include a proposal that would cut
operating hours for truckers and a move to allow a study of ways to
improve fuel efficiency for sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The drunken driving provision, which was contained in a $54.7
billion bill the Senate passed on Thursday, would make a 0.08
percent blood alcohol content the allowable limit for drivers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''This reasonable standard will save hundreds of lives and
prevent countless injuries each year and it should be put in place
across the country without further delay,'' President Clinton said
in urging Congress to send him a transportation bill that includes
the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., chief advocate of the national
standard, said 0.08 nationwide would save 500 to 700 lives a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the House has blocked past Senate efforts to make the
standard 0.08, which is now the limit in 18 states and the District
of Columbia. The other 32 states have less stringent 0.10 percent
levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would deduct a state's federal highway trust
fund share, 5 percent from 2004, if it does not adopt the 0.08
level.
</P>
<P>
   The advocacy group Mothers Against Drunk Driving says the risk
of a fatal crash is 11 times greater from a driver at 0.08 than for
a non-drinking driver. The American Beverage Institute contends
that its more important to get real problem drinkers off the roads
and cites a study finding the risk of an accident for a 0.10 driver
is the same as for a driver using a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would prevent the Transportation Department from
spending federal funds to impose new rules for how many hours a
truck or bus driver may be behind the wheel each day. The House has
proposed no such ban.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue is blamed for a third of the more than 5,000
truck-related fatalities every year. The Transportation Department
has proposed a rule that would limit driving to 12 hours in a
24-hour period. Current rules, dating back more than 60 years,
allow up to 16 hours in one 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   The trucking industry agrees that the rules must be updated but
claims the proposed rules would result in more accidents because
transport companies would have to hire more novice drivers and
drive in daylight hours when the highways are most crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ''The proposed rule just will not work in the real world,'' said
Jim Whittinghill, senior vice president of the American Trucking
Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater said he was ''very
disappointed'' with the ban on rule making. ''The proposed rule
focuses on the critical issue of fatigue, a significant factor in
crashes involving heavy trucks and of saving lives and preventing
injuries on our roadways.''
</P>
<P>
   In another area, it's the House that once again has barred the
Transportation Department from studying whether to raise auto fuel
efficiency standards, particularly on sport utility vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The current corporate average fuel economy standards, known as
CAFE, were set in 1975 at 27.5 mpg on new passenger cars and 20.7
mpg for light trucks, which today would include minivans and SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   With new fuel efficiency technology and soaring gas prices,
there is pressure from the Clinton administration and many
lawmakers to change those standards, but the auto industry claims
it would result in smaller, less-safe vehicles, and the House since
1995 has attached language to the transportation spending bill
prohibiting any study of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., and Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., won
support for a resolution putting the Senate on record as being for
lifting the study ban but with the condition that Congress must
approve the promulgation of any new fuel efficiency standards. Sen.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and others concerned about effects on the
auto industry agreed to the resolution on the condition the study
also covered vehicle safety and other factors that could affect the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill also contains language barring the
administration from issuing any rollover safety rules for SUVs
until the National Academy of Sciences completes a proposed
nine-month study of alleged SUV rollover tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is S. 2720.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Keep Troops in Korea  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The leaders of North and South Korea have
taken a first step toward peace, but the Clinton administration
says it's too early to talk about removing U.S. troops from the
divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, public pressure for a reduction in U.S. forces in
South Korea is likely to build if the Koreas actually move toward a
peace treaty, administration officials and outside experts said in
interviews Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what will happen almost overnight,'' said Robert
Riscassi, a retired Army general who commanded U.S. forces in Korea
from 1990-93. ''Clearly there will be a debate. It's inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   There are about 37,000 American troops in South Korea, mainly
soldiers of the Eighth Army, headquartered at Yongsan Army Garrison
in Seoul, and airmen of the 7th Air Force, based at Osan Air base.
The United States has maintained a continuous military presence in
South Korea since the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to be very clear that we intend to remain a force for
stability in that area as long as we are needed,'' said Kenneth
Bacon, spokesman for Defense Secretary William Cohen. Bacon said
the South Korean government has made clear that it expects U.S.
troops to remain ''for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point, we don't envision any change in the U.S. troop
status,'' said P.J. Crowley, spokesman for the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, meanwhile, announced a 50,000-ton
food donation Thursday for North Korea and also offered rare praise
for North Korean President Kim Jong Il for his role in bringing
about this week's historic summit with South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said the food
donation was long planned and should not be interpreted as a reward
for the breakthroughs achieved at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   The food aid brings to 450,000 tons the combined U.S. donations
over the past year through the U.N. World Food Program, which will
assure the deliveries. An additional 100,000 tons was distributed
through a private group.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has been suffering acute food shortages over the
years as a result of drought, flooding and mismanagement of the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
   As for Kim Jong Il, Boucher said the United States was ''pleased
that North Korea's leader demonstrated practical statesmanship as
he reached agreement with the South's president on a number of
important steps that we think do bode well for the future of the
peninsula.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher's statement marked a change in U.S. attitude toward the
North Korean leader, who has acquired few admirers in the West
because of his ruthless repression, attempts to intimidate
neighbors and policies that have contributed to famine.
</P>
<P>
   The suddenly brighter prospect of a Korean peace also has
sparked speculation that the Pentagon's push to build a limited
national defense against missile attack could be slowed. That's
because the potential attacker most prominently mentioned by the
Pentagon is North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said the administration welcomed diplomatic progress
toward reducing the ballistic missile threat from North Korea, but
he added that a U.S. missile defense system would be useful against
other countries too.
</P>
<P>
   ''North Korea is not the only country we worry about,'' Bacon
said. ''We worry about Iraq. We worry about Iran, and we worry
about other countries that are working on long-range missiles or
that already have chemical or biological weapons and would like to
have ways to deliver them with long-range missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon acknowledged, however, that the Pentagon's self-imposed
deadline for fielding a missile defense by 2005 was based mainly on
intelligence estimates that North Korea could have a missile
capable of reaching U.S. soil by that time. The CIA has said it
believes Iranian and Iraqi missile threats are farther in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it remains far from clear whether the agreement on
Wednesday by South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il to work toward a peaceful reunification of the
divided peninsula will bear fruit. The two sides have been at each
other's throats for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration's view, if the threat of a North
Korean attack on the South disappeared, there would still be reason
to keep U.S. troops on the peninsula -- as a stabilizing influence
in the greater Asia-Pacific region. That is the same reasoning
behind keeping U.S. troops permanently in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Koreans, however, might not see it that way if their
country were reunified with the North. Already there is a push --
small but sometimes forceful -- among South Korean youth to demand a
U.S. withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, the next step in promoting improved
relations with North Korea will be formal implementation of steps
announced last September to ease sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   Once the paperwork is completed, North Korea would be allowed to
export raw materials and goods to the United States and would open
air and shipping routes between the two countries. An announcement
on these measures is expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's order would not affect a ban on exports of military
and sensitive dual-use items or most types of federal assistance.

<HEADLINE> Feds Break Up Mexican Heroin Ring  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 13-month investigation into an international
drug smuggling operation led to the arrests of more than 200 people
and sparked fears that an inexpensive, but unusually potent form of
heroin is entering mid-sized U.S. cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican-based ring is operating in cities from Honolulu to
the Eastern U.S. markets usually supplied by Colombian dealers,
officials said. It gained a foothold on the East Coast by
underselling the Colombians by $800 to $1,000 per ounce of heroin,
Donnie Marshall, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said Thursday as officials announced a string of
new arrests in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA was alarmed to find that the ring was selling $10 street
doses of heroin, weighing half a gram, that were 60 percent to 85
percent pure heroin, said Rod Benson, deputy to the chief of
special operations for the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian heroin, which is white because it is more highly
processed, is sold in the United States in purities ranging from 70
percent to 90 percent. Marshall said seizures of heroin from Mexico
in 1991 averaged 15 percent purity.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he believes ''this operation has some significant
implications, not just for law enforcement but for the country as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This operation, I think, shows that heroin has re-emerged in
our society with a vengeance, and it is more potent and more deadly
in our country than ever before,'' said Marshall, speaking with
Attorney General Janet Reno at the DEA's suburban Arlington, Va.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug sweep, called Operation Tar Pit, grew out of a
June investigation that found a single organization was providing
most of San Diego's high-grade heroin. Agents linked the ring to an
investigation in Chimayo, N.M., where 85 people had died from
heroin overdoses between 1995 and 1998, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The higher purity actually allows users to smoke or inhale the
heroin rather than injecting it,and unfortunately many people think
that if it's not injected the heroin is not as dangerous,''
Marshall said, ''and that couldn't be further from the truth as the
sad and tragic events in Chimayo, New Mexico, will tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, is believed to
be led by Issas Hernandez-Garcia, who was arrested Thursday, and
Angel Hernandez-Ibarra, who remains at large. Authorities believe
the gang was distributing 80 pounds of heroin each month, worth
more than $7 million, in 22 U.S. cities ranging from Anchorage,
Alaska, to Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   To develop customers quickly, the distributors preyed on clinics
where heroin addicts receive the drug methadone to block their need
for heroin, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This organization operated in a dangerously efficient manner.
Not only did this group exhibit disregard for the law, but their
peddling of this powerful and addictive drug showed an even greater
disregard for human life,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy, said it was
encouraging that U.S. authorities had broken up the ring but
disputed characterizing the ring as Mexican. ''The heroin is
Mexican and the main heroin wholesalers were based in Nayarit, but
the gang and the main distribution center was based in Los
Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DEA and FBI agents had arrested 70 people through Wednesday. On
Thursday, they arrested 176 more people by early evening, searched
60 locations and seized 23 pounds of heroin. That brought overall
seizures to 64 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the gang sold heroin in San Diego, Los Angeles and
Bakersfield, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Honolulu; Anchorage, Alaska;
Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; Phoenix and Yuma, Ariz.; Albuquerque,
N.M.; Salt Lake City; Denver; Cleveland, Columbus and Steubenville,
Ohio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Chicago; Detroit; Pittsburgh; and
Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The gang also had distribution cells, not linked to one city, in
Kentucky, Minnesota, Alabama, West Virginia and New Jersey, Benson
said.

<HEADLINE> House Kills Curbs on U.S. Monuments  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is hailing the House's refusal
to limit President Clinton's ability to establish national
monuments as part of his land preservation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 204-172 early Friday to approve a $14.6 billion
measure financing the Interior Department and federal cultural
programs for next year. The White House has threatened a veto
because of its 70 percent cut in Clinton's proposal for $620
million to buy federal and local park lands, and reductions in his
plans for clean water, Indian, arts and energy efficiency programs.
</P>
<P>
   But in a win for Clinton and environmentalists, the House voted
to erase language authored by Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, that would
have barred the Interior Department from ''design, planning or
management'' of any national monuments designated since the
beginning of this year. That would have covered eight new monuments
created by Clinton since January and the expansion of a ninth,
covering nearly 2 million acres in Arizona, California, Colorado,
Oregon and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're delighted that the House is preserving this important
tool to protect America's national treasures,'' White House
spokesman Jake Siewert said later.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had objected strongly to the language.
</P>
<P>
   The overall bill was a battleground, as usual, over the National
Endowment for the Arts. And as usual, Republicans seeking to hold
the agency's budget to $98 million -- about the same as this year --
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Endowment proponents led by Reps. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., and
Norm Dicks, D-Wash., won a preliminary 207-204 vote in an effort to
provide an extra $15 million for the arts agency. For a while, it
seemed the endowment would win its first significant increase in
the House since 1992, when its budget peaked at $176 million.
</P>
<P>
   But GOP leaders headed them off by proposing to instead spend
the extra money on Indian health services. Their measure was
approved by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has designated the national monuments under the 1906
Antiquities Act, which allows a president to set aside federal
lands as monuments for historic or scientific reasons. Republicans
said he had used the law to set aside more land than it intended,
was ignoring the will of local members of Congress and other
officials, and was using the designation for election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't have a king with a stroke of a pen designate land,''
said Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   With both sides looking ahead to this November's elections, the
fight echoed the numerous environmental battles waged between
Republicans and Clinton since the GOP took control of Congress in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sam Farr, D-Calif., said Clinton had to make the
designations ''because this Congress, under this leadership, is
failing to deliver these things.''
</P>
<P>
   On the pivotal vote, lawmakers voted 234-187 to reject an effort
by Hansen to keep his language intact. Thirty-eight Republicans
joined 195 Democrats and 1 independent in opposing Hansen; 177
Republicans, 9 Democrats and 1 independent voted ''yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The House then voted 243-177 to delete the Hansen provision and
another section of the bill aimed at slowing government efforts to
tighten land-use restrictions in federal lands in the Columbia
River basin in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   That vote came after Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., lost an
effort to protect bill language preventing new management rules in
the basin. That vote was 221-206.
</P>
<P>
   But later, after many lawmakers had gone home, the House
reversed itself and voted 197-180 to restore the Nethercutt
language. The provision would affect a federal effort that began in
1993 involving 63 million acres of federal land in Washington
state, Oregon, Idaho and Montana.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has yet to write its own version of the Interior
bill.

<HEADLINE> CBS Books Its Second 'Survivor'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- ''Survivor'' is proving such a hit that a sequel
is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   The network has begun accepting applications for ''Survivor 2,''
which will be filmed in October and November for broadcast starting
January. CBS expects considerably more than the 6,100 applicants it
received for the first series.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the location will be the Australian outback -- not
nearly as wet as the tropical island where the series is now set.
The sun-baked, desolate territory has its share of kangaroos,
crocodiles, huge spiders and lizards, however. The filming will
take place late in the Australian springtime.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 23.2 million people watched the third installment
of the 13-week series Wednesday night, a 28 percent increase over
the previous week, Nielsen Media Research said Thursday. It was
CBS's biggest audience with regular programming for that time slot
since at least 1987.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time ''Survivor'' did not go head-to-head
against ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' But it did compete
against the NBA Finals in about one-fifth of the country, including
Los Angeles and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The soggy stowaways voted out a third person, 27-year-old San
Francisco lawyer Stacey Stillman, sending her away in a torrential
downpour.
</P>
<P>
   CBS knew after the first week's ratings that ''Survivor'' would
return, but wanted to make sure the interest built, said CBS
President Leslie Moonves. Casting for the second edition will be
just as important as the location, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relatability of these people is one of the chords that is
striking people,'' he said. ''Everyone imagines what they would do
because they are seeing people like themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Stillman, appearing Thursday on CBS's ''The Early Show,'' said
she expected she would be voted out because she was the weakest
physically in her group and her personality clashed with some of
her fellow islanders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did get cranky,'' she said. ''We hadn't eaten in nine
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' last August, ''Survivor''
is enlivening the normally dull summer rerun season. And it's been
a bonanza for CBS's often futile effort to reach a younger
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' alone drew a bigger audience than ABC, NBC, Fox,
UPN and the WB combined Wednesday night among viewers age 18-34,
Nielsen said. Normally, CBS's typical viewer tops age 50.
</P>
<P>
   That is already affecting the rest of the network, Moonves said.
The Wednesday movie that follows ''Survivor'' has reached a younger
audience over the past three weeks than it has all year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of shows on our schedule that do have a
younger appeal but people don't know to go there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The little-watched CBS ''Early Show,'' where each ''Survivor''
contestant voted out the previous night appears for a Thursday
morning interview, has even benefited. Last week its Thursday
ratings were higher than they'd been since February.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Survivor'' audience is likely to get even bigger, since
next week there won't be an NBA playoff game or ''Millionaire''
edition to compete with.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it still has some room to grow,'' Moonves said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's episode had the hungry castaways dining on seafood
caught with a spear and on rats. That angered People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals spokeswoman Lisa Lange, who said
''they basically abused animals.'' CBS responded that ''hunting and
fishing for sustenance have been acceptable since the dawn of
time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday ''it's very
important to get to the bottom'' of the loss of computer files
containing nuclear weapons secrets from the Los Alamos weapons lab
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we ought to do is see the investigation through
and see where the facts lead us,'' the president said. ''But we
need to do what we can to find out what happened, whether there was
a security breach and if so how we can change so it will never
happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in an interview on NBC's ''Today'' show. ''It's a
serious issue,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is investigating the disappearance from a highly secure
vault of two computer hard drives containing data on dismantling an
array of U.S. and even Russian nuclear weapons. As part of the
investigation, nuclear scientiests at Los Alamos are taking
polygraph tests.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the seriousness of the security breach, Clinton
said, 'It's not clear, but I think it's very important to get to
the bottom of it.'

<P>
   The university will own 20 percent of the new company,
Framingham Genomic Medicine Inc. Venture capitalists have committed
$21 million to form the company.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are expected to pay
annual fees to access the medical information, which will be placed
in a huge electronic database, the Boston Globe reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   University spokesman David Lampe said Friday the company would
sell analyses of the data, not the data itself, which is already
free to researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the data is available to everyone for free. It always has
been. It always will be,'' said David Lampe. ''We are not selling
any Heart Study data for a profit, only the analyses.''
</P>
<P>
   The university said patient privacy would be protected. Only two
of the study's 6,000 surviving participants have asked that their
records be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Fred Ledley, Framingham Genomic Medicine's chief scientific
officer, said the forthcoming release of the first draft of the
human genome -- the mapping of more than 100,000 genes -- means the
database will be a resource for pharmaceutical researchers looking
to identify the connection between specific genes, and health and
disease outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   Ledley said stock in the company would be put in a charitable
trust for the benefit of the city of Framingham. Lampe said the
company also would help fund an ethics advisory board and science
education in the city's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, which has contributed more than $40 million to the
heart study, expressed reservations about the proposal, saying he
didn't want one company to have exclusive access to the data.
</P>
<P>
   ''This data was obtained with public money. Why should we give
access to one person or one company?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said agency lawyers were reviewing the institute's agreement
with BU, and still sorting out who owns which portion of the heart
study data.
</P>
<P>
   The Framingham Heart Study has been collecting data for 52
years, accumulating vast amounts of information, including 500,000
chest X-rays and electrocardiograms, 5,000 blood samples and
truckloads of paper medical records that include diet diaries and
even early studies of male balding patterns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 published studies have stemmed from the data
collected from Framingham residents on their lifestyle and health
patterns. Among the basic concepts that scientists have learned
from them over the years are the roles of smoking and cholesterol
in heart disease.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Laments School Music Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday that ''it was
tragic'' that school music programs frequently are the easiest
target when budget-minded administrators have to cut education
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been very disturbed'' about the problem, the president
said. ''Over the last 20 years, more and more as schools have come
under financial pressure, they have tended to drop their music
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke on NBC's ''Today'' show in tandem with the ''Save the
Music'' fund-raising drive by music channel VH1 to preserve music
programs in schools across America. By some estimates, only 25
percent of American schools offer music programs as a basic part of
the curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was broadcast from a public elementary school in
East Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president was visiting an elementary school in Queens
to underscore the need for new school construction and repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a saxophone player who played in his high school
band, has long championed the cause of preserving music programs in
schools. He said he volunteered to get involved when he heard about
the VH1 program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know that a lot of our young children learn better if they
have access to music education,'' Clinton said. ''Not everyone
learns in the same way, not everyone's brain is stimulated in the
same way. And the schools that have vigorous music programs tend to
have higher academic performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the federal government should do more to ease the
financial strain on schools by providing more money to hire new
teachers and build more classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was important that parents raise their voices and
demand music programs for their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things that really happened is a lot of folks just
took the music programs for granted,'' Clinton said. 'A lot of
people who were making tough budget decisions assumed nobody would
care if they were eliminated. And it was tragic, what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ''You'll see a big infusion of public money going
back into these programs because of what VH1 has done and because
more and more parents will insist on the music being there. And
I'll be glad to do whatever I can to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was up early for the interview after spending the night
at his home in Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his New York visit, he was to speak at an evening
fund raiser for Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y. The president was
scheduled to stay in New York Friday night and return home on
Saturday.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heavy rains and the effects of a fire knocked
out all telephone service for about two hours at the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Even the sensitive operations center lost use of its telephones
during the outage Thursday night. Backup batteries that could have
been used to turn on some telephones were still out of commission
due to an unrelated fire in the department basement on Wednesday,
spokesman Philip Reeker said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. official said there was no serious impact on
the department's operations.
</P>

downpour that knocked out service and trees in various parts of the

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 68; Nasdaq Gains 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with technology shares
rising slightly and blue-chip stocks coming under selling pressure
after Xerox and a regional banking company issued profit warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In late morning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 68.06 at 10,646.76.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was down 6.62 at 1,471.98, and the Nasdaq composite index was
up 5.88 at 3,851.62.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all week, stocks were being pulled in
different directions on Friday, with many investors waiting to see
if slowing economic growth is hurting corporate profits and whether
the Federal Reserve once more raises interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market is moving laterally right not. We are not in a
dramatic upturn that we saw earlier this year or the slump that
happened last month. We are just kind of paralyzed,'' said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Some signs came on Friday. Shares of Xerox Corp. fell $4.50 to
$21.063 after the office machine maker said its second-quarter
earnings would fall short of Wall Street analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in
San Francisco, lowered its second quarter earnings projection,
sending its stock down $8.25 to $20.438. That came a day after
Wachovia, a respected banking company based in North Carolina,
warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks, especially those in the banking
sector, were rocked again Friday by the weak profit outlook. Mellon
fell $3.313 to $33.688 and Bank of American dropped $3.438 to
$48.625.
</P>
<P>
   Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce
Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to
its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand. That's a direct result of the Feds six inflation-fighting
rate increases over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent economic reports -- including home sales,
factory orders, retail sales and unemployment -- indicate the
economy is cooling down. Given that, a growing number of analysts
believe the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged when its meets
June 27 and 28. But the view is not unanimous and some analysts say
the Fed may still feel that more needs to be done to make sure
inflation is not revived.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 465.58 million shares
by late morning, well ahead of 299.35 million shares on Thursday.
The so-called ''triple-witching'' day -- marking the quarterly
expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts --
contributed to the higher volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index up 0.37 at 512.62.

<HEADLINE> Census Bureau Stresses Worker Safety  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The challenge seems inviting: Join the Census
Bureau and help take the national head-count!
</P>
<P>
   For some, this is dangerous business. One enumerator was killed
by a pack of dogs and others census-takers have been shot while
retreating from angry homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another census-taker checking a Chicago apartment building
was pushed down a flight of stairs by a resident on Wednesday,
Census officials said. The worker was unhurt, while the resident
was charged with impeding or assaulting a federal official, FBI
agent Frank Bochte said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Census officials reiterated that the safety of its
employees was of ''paramount importance'' -- even if it means not
getting the job done right away.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've sent out as strong a signal that we possibly can that
the first concern we have is the safety of our census-takers,''
Census Director Kenneth Prewitt said at a news conference. ''We
have census-takers in difficult situations, of course, especially
now when we are down to the last cases.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current door-to-door phase of the count, enumerators
still have about 900,000 of the country's 120 million households
left to contact, residents who have not yet returned a Census 2000
form.
</P>
<P>
   Beside the woman killed by dogs, six other U.S. Census workers
have died on the job this year, five in auto accidents and one
because of a stroke. Agency officials could not immediately say how
many have been injured.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in Nashville, Ind., say it appeared 71-year-old
Dorothy Stewart was trying to count the residents of a one-story
log cabin when dogs attacked her. She died of multiple injuries.
Brown County sheriff's deputies arrived Saturday to find Stewart's
body about 3 feet from the home's front door, surrounded by more
than 20 dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The driveway leading up to the house is posted with ''Beware of
Dog'' and ''No Trespassing'' signs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Jim Oliver said he has not ruled out filing criminal
charges against the dogs' owners, and is continuing his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Census Bureau's national office in Suitland,
Md., called Stewart's death an isolated, but tragic incident. They
could not recall an incident similar to her death, but said workers
are warned about risks.
</P>
<P>
   ''They go through training which talks about potential dangers,
that if you feel uncomfortable, you leave the situation,'' said
Jerry Stahl, spokesman for the Charlotte, N.C., regional Census
office. ''But there's not extensive self-defense training or
something of that nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Since most census-taker jobs are part-time, they do not have
benefits, but are covered under workers' compensation guidelines,
Stahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Enumerators who feel unsafe can refer cases to supervisors. It
is up to local Census offices to determine whether workers should
be sent out in pairs for safety's sake in some areas, and some
local managers have asked police departments to monitor blocks
where census-takers are working, Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, those in the field say safety isn't a great
concern, whether they work in high-crime neighborhoods or rural
areas. Some go to unusual lengths to complete the task -- like
census-takers in Maine who hitched rides on lobster boats to reach
isolated island homes, or workers in upstate New York who used
snowmobiles to traverse roads left otherwise impassible by snow.
</P>
<P>
   ''In general, the job is fairly safe,'' said Nelson Bofford of
Lake Luzerne, N.Y., who worked as an enumerator in upstate New
York. ''But I believe the training was pretty good. They went out
of their way to make sure you are properly trained before you get
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Other enumerators say they've been pleasantly surprised by the
responses they get at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''One person offered me pie one time,'' said Michael Zdan, a
census-taker from Bear Creek, Pa.

<HEADLINE> Waterston Performs With Actor-Son  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- Life has been good to Sam Waterston. He's
an award-winning actor with a hit television series. He has
traveled the world. He's financially secure. He has a close, caring
family.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all that, though, the easygoing Waterston confides he
wanted more. One simple treasure he truly coveted was the chance to
work alongside his eldest son, James, in a play.
</P>
<P>
   Appropriately, Sam and James will spend this Father's Day
playing father and son on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was worried that it might not happen,'' Waterston said
during a break in rehearsals of Eugene O'Neill's classic, ''Long
Day's Journey Into Night,'' at Syracuse Stage.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are lots of stage families that don't get to work
together. We almost missed this,'' said Waterston, the star of
NBC-TV's ''Law &AMP; Order.''
</P>
<P>
   James, 31, said he and his father had often discussed performing
together, and the Syracuse production proved a perfect fit. ''It's
a luxury that we have that we get to play father and son ... so we
wanted to choose our moment wisely and spend that privilege
wisely.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a convergence of timing, luck and desire that brought the
Waterstons together in Syracuse, where O'Neill's story of the
tormented Tyrone family runs through July 2.
</P>
<P>
   Sam is on a summertime hiatus from shooting ''Law &AMP; Order.''
James, a professional actor who lives in Los Angeles and does
regional theater around the country, had taken time off to prepare
for his wedding in late July.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jamie suggested we could squeeze it in. I didn't think there
was time to do it,'' said Sam. Especially since most theaters had
completed their seasons and the Waterstons were striking out trying
to find a stage on which to perform on such short notice.
</P>
<P>
   That's when luck stepped in.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were standing around after one of our last performances
just exchanging theater gossip when our lighting director asked if
anyone had heard about Sam Waterston going around New York trying
to peddle this play with his son. My ears perked up,'' said Robert
Moss, Syracuse Stage's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   So Moss made a blind call to Waterston and offered his
playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could hear the delight in his voice when he said, 'You
will?''' recalled Moss. Moss then called his longtime friend,
actress Elizabeth Franz, who agreed to join the cast. Franz won the
1999 Tony Award for best supporting actress for her portrayal of
Linda Loman in ''Death of a Salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   While father and son have long had the ambition to work
together, the idea of doing O'Neill's introspective masterpiece
came after Sam saw James play Edmund Tyrone at the Pittsburgh
Public Theater in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a scene in the fourth act. It's just Edmund and his
father, James,'' said the younger Waterston. ''I don't know when it
happened, but sometime during that, I was thinking what a scene to
have with Dad. It's an extraordinary scene that's at the end of a
very rough day. They are both kind of drunk and letting it all
out.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill, who won the Nobel and Pulitzer prizes, drew on his own
life to write his searing, unsparing portrait of the Tyrones.
Patriarch James Tyrone was modeled on O'Neill's father, James, one
of the most prominent stage actors of the late 19th century.
Edmund, the son, was based on O'Neill himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the play, O'Neill revealed his family's self-absorption,
cruelty, fury and outrageous thirst for alcohol for all the world
to see. It was a soulful examination of what reviewers called the
American tragedy: loss of faith.
</P>
<P>
   It also was O'Neill's way of confronting the ghost of his
father. Although father and son loved each other, they utterly
failed to communicate that devotion until the very end of James
O'Neill's life when reconciliation and understanding finally came.
</P>
<P>
   The roles are challenging, even for the talented Waterstons, who
say they have enjoyed a much different relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hasn't been a conventional life. But we've always been
close,'' said the elder Waterston, who first attained acclaim as a
Shakespearean actor and later starred in ''The Great Gatsby'' and
received an Oscar nomination for best actor in ''The Killing
Fields'' before turning to television.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, Sam Waterston has eschewed the glitter of
Hollywood and instead raised his four children at his farmhouse
home in Connecticut. Still, life was different for the Waterston
children, James said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no family vacations per se. Instead, Sam found
opportunities to take his children on location when doing a film.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those trips that provided the Waterstons with
their only other experience working together as actors. It was a
BBC film made for public television on atomic bomb builder J.
Robert Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was 10 years old. I remember we moved over to London for
three months for the shooting of it. They needed a kid, and I was
available. I had no lines. I was a glorified extra,'' said James,
whose biggest professional role was a part in ''Dead Poets
Society.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I remember there was a scene where he came in and had a very
dramatic moment ... and I just kept laughing,'' James recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, those days are gone,'' said Sam, trying to
manufacture a stern look for his son, then chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   During rehearsals, there was little evidence of the Waterstons'
relationship, beyond their strong physical resemblance and an
occasional ''family'' joke. The cast was strictly professional as
it worked to capture the powerful emotions of O'Neill's play and
learn nearly four hours of dialogue, said Moss.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, at dinner or over coffee or beer, is when father and
son talk. They have been in Syracuse rehearsing since early May,
living in separate apartments in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have distinct memories of calling Dad from sets or after
rehearsals and asking, 'This is what's going on in this scene. This
is what I don't understand. This is ...' Now we are talking about
the same play. He is in the rehearsal hall with me all day and I'm
there with him. Now the conversations are more frequent and more
intense,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we talk more freely as father and son than if we were
just two actors beginning to get to know each other through this
play. It's made it a lot more fun,'' added Sam.
</P>
<P>
   After this, there is another experience Sam and son hope to
share -- one that's far from any stage. They want to take a long
canoe trip.

fell $3.188 to $33.813 and Bank of American dropped $3.375 to

</P>
<P>
   Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce
Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to
its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts'

</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand. That's a direct result of the Feds six inflation-fighting
rate increases over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent economic reports -- including home sales,
factory orders, retail sales and unemployment -- indicate the
economy is cooling down. Given that, a growing number of analysts
believe the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged when its meets
June 27 and 28. But the view is not unanimous and some analysts say
the Fed may still feel that more needs to be done to make sure
inflation is not revived.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks rose slightly. Qualcomm was up $4.50 to
$65.938, bouncing higher after two days of steep losses.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 591.71 million shares
by midday, well ahead of 429.24 million shares on Thursday. The
so-called ''triple-witching'' day -- marking the quarterly
expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts --
contributed to the higher volume.

   The Russell 2000 index was down 0.11 at 512.14.

<HEADLINE> Mallett Could Succeed Daley  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Deputy Commerce Secretary Robert L. Mallett,
the department's No. 2 official, has emerged as one of the top
candidates to succeed William Daley, administration officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A final decision has yet to be made on the next secretary, but
Mallett will take over in an acting capacity when Daley leaves on
July 15. Mallett's name is on a short list of candidates President
Clinton will consider in filling the post permanently, the
officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore announced Thursday that Daley would take
over as manager of Gore's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett has focused on managing day-to-day operations at the
sprawling 40,000-employee Cabinet agency since taking the No. 2
post in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the administration, Mallett, a graduate of
Harvard Law School, practiced law in Washington and served as city
administrator and deputy mayor under former Washington Mayor Sharon
Pratt Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   Mallett has canceled a scheduled trip to several countries in
Africa to stay in Washington because of Daley's planned departure,
department spokesman Morrie Goodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman said because of the possible appearance of a
conflict-of-interest, Daley was reassessing how involved he will be
in pushing for Senate approval of legislation for normal trade
relations with China and with other Commerce issues during the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ''The general counsel is looking at all of that to see what he
can and can't do,'' Goodman said. Daley ''wants to be sure that
everything that he does is within the bounds of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about comments by a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott that Daley's departure ''is not helpful'' to efforts to
get the China bill to the Senate floor for a vote, Goodman said,
''There should be a quick vote in the Senate and that should have
nothing to do with whether the secretary is here or not.''

<HEADLINE> Scotland Yard Warns Madonna Boyfriend  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Madonna's filmmaker boyfriend escaped with a wrist
slap after admitting he assaulted a fan outside the singer's London
home.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Ritchie was cautioned Thursday for common assault, a
relatively minor charge, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie, director of the hit British film ''Lock, Stock and Two
Smoking Barrels,'' was arrested May 17 after Jonathon Sanders
claimed he was assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Ritchie said Sanders was an obsessed fan who had followed
Madonna for weeks, lurked outside her home in the ritzy Kensington
neighborhood and tried to get into her car.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guy pushed the guy. I'm not trying to justify what he did, but
he'd had enough,'' said Kris Thykier, Ritchie's spokesman. ''His
girlfriend is five months pregnant, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders denied he was a stalker but admitted he enjoyed taking
photographs of the singer.

<HEADLINE> Bigelow, Besson Reach Settlement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kathryn Bigelow and Luc Besson might not have
kissed, but they've made up.
</P>
<P>
   A settlement was reached Thursday in the American movie
producer's $2 million suit against the French director. At issue
was Besson's 1999 film, ''The Messenger: The Story of Joan of
Arc.''
</P>
<P>
   Although terms of the agreement were kept secret, Bigelow's
attorney, Gregory Dovel, said his client was satisfied with the
amicable settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''She plans some day to get her movie made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow, whose producing credits include ''Point Break,'' sued
Besson in 1998, saying the two agreed in 1996 to make a Joan of Arc
movie, ''Company of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow's suit said that Besson walked off the project to make
''The Messenger'' when Bigelow refused to cast his wife, Milla
Jovovich, as the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jovovich starred in ''The Messenger.'' The movie was a flop in
North America but critically acclaimed in Paris, where Besson has
achieved cult status. Jovovich and Besson have since divorced.

<HEADLINE> Country Star McGraw in Assault Rap  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Tim McGraw said he was trying to protect
his children when he intervened between New York police and fellow
country singer Kenny Chesney.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw and Chesney were arrested June 3 in Orchard Park, N.Y.,
after officers said Chesney took a police horse without permission
from a backstage area. Police said McGraw attacked them when they
tried to stop Chesney.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McGraw said he tried to intervene when he saw
officers trying to ''rip (Chesney) from the horse,'' even after
Chesney had raised his hands to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ''At no time did I throw any punches or put anyone in anything
remotely resembling a choke hold,'' McGraw said. ''One of the
officers pulled his nightstick and hit me at least three times on
my leg.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he also feared for the safety of his children, who were
playing in the area.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, 33, husband of country star Faith Hill, was charged with
felony assault, obstructing governmental administration, menacing
and resisting arrest. Chesney, 32, was charged with disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   A court hearing is set for July 18.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney has said he had permission to take the horse and that
the incident was ''blown way out of proportion.''

<HEADLINE> Rapper 'Flesh-N-Bone' Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Bone Thugs-N-Harmony member Stanley Howse has
been convicted of pointing an assault rifle at a man, despite the
victim's testimony that the rapper was a friend who never pulled a
gun on him.
</P>
<P>
   Howse, 27, has been convicted seven times since the mid-1990s of
crimes ranging from assault to spousal abuse, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy-award winning rapper, known as ''Flesh-N-Bone,''
faces up to nearly 20 years in prison. He was found guilty of
committing assault with a semiautomatic firearm and being a
convicted felon in possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was scheduled July 14.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Tarrance Vickers told them Howse pulled an AK-47 out
of a baby crib last December, loaded it and pointed it at him.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony this week, Vickers disavowed just about everything
police said he told them.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, Howse is to appear in court Tuesday on
charges of weapons violations, making a terrorist threat and
resisting an officer in January at a relative's house in Los
Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Visit China, So. Korea  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
make a hastily arranged trip to China and South Korea next week in
a trip that will take her also to Poland and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's talks in Beijing and Seoul will center on the
historic agreement between the presidents of North and South Korea
to work for peace and unity on the divided peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state leaves Tuesday and plans to arrive in
Warsaw by the weekend for a three-day conference of central
Europe's newly democratic nations, the State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also will go the Middle East, but Boucher did not say
how that stop will fit into a schedule apparently being put
together with uncommon speed.
</P>
<P>
   In China, he said, Albright will take up issues of both
agreement and discord. Referring to Taiwan, which China considers
an irksome, breakaway province, Boucher said, ''We have different
approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   China has good ties with both Koreas and helped arrange the
summit in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, that ended Thursday
with an agreement that asserted a need for reconciliation and
unification. Presidents Kim Dae-jung of South Korea and Kim Jong Il
of North Korea celebrated the pact with champagne toasts.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the accord, Boucher said this week that North
Korea still poses a missile threat to the United States. President
Clinton is considering a national missile-defense system but has
been unable to persuade Russian President Vladimir Putin to amend a
1972 arms control treaty to make it legal.
</P>
<P>
   The warming of relations between North and South Korea also
could have an impact on keeping 37,000 U.S. troops on the peninsula
a half-century after the Korean conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to hold talks in Beijing with Chinese
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan on Thursday, but apparently little
else has been decided for her quick visit.

   VONORE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration seized
hundreds of doses of prescription drugs and vaccines from a
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories shipping center, citing violations of
federal quality standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FDA did not spell out the violations Thursday, a
recent inspection report cited concerns about sterilization
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The products seized included vaccines against tetanus and
diphtheria, and the antihistamines dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine
and Phenergan.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst is based in Philadelphia. The distribution center
in Vonore is 30 miles southwest of Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   The drugs were produced at the company's Marietta, Pa., plant,
which has been ''undergoing substantial improvements for several
months in response to FDA concerns,'' company spokesman Doug Petkus
said. The plant ''has not been manufacturing any product for
shipment during that time.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Friday, with technology shares
rising slightly and blue-chip stocks coming under selling pressure
after Xerox and a regional banking company issued profit warnings.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 116.85 at 10,597.97.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500

up 10.05 at 3,855.80.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all week, stocks were being pulled in
different directions Friday, with many investors waiting to see if
slowing economic growth is hurting corporate profits and whether
the Federal Reserve once more raises interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''This market is moving laterally right now. We are not in a
dramatic upturn that we saw earlier this year or the slump that
happened last month. We are just kind of paralyzed,'' said Larry
Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Some signs came on Friday. Shares of Xerox Corp. fell $4.438 to
$20.875 after the office machine maker said its second-quarter
earnings would fall short of Wall Street analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in
San Francisco, lowered its second-quarter earnings projection,
sending its stock down $8.50 to $20.188. That came a day after
Wachovia, a respected banking company based in North Carolina,
warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks, especially those in the banking
sector, were rocked again Friday by the weak profit outlook. Mellon
fell $2.875 to $34.125 and Bank of America dropped $3.813 to

<HEADLINE> '60 Minutes' Stands by Its Report  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The CBS News program ''60 Minutes'' isn't
backing down from its story about a self-described Iranian
terrorist czar, even as the CIA and FBI reportedly brand him a
liar.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not distancing ourselves from the story at all,''
spokesman Kevin Tedesco said Friday. ''Nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The June 4 segment profiled an Iranian defector who days earlier
claimed that he had coordinated Iran's overseas assassinations and
terrorist operations.
</P>
<P>
   The man, who identified himself as Ahmad Behbahani, said it was
Iran that blew up Pam Am flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, in
1988, killing 270 people -- a crime for which two Libyans are on
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Such a claim would disrupt that trial and damage State
Department efforts to improve relations with Iran, correspondent
Lesley Stahl noted in the report, ''if his story can be confirmed --
and American intelligence is trying to do that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But after interviews conducted by intelligence officials, the
CIA and FBI concluded the man lied and lacked basic knowledge of
Iran's intelligence apparatus, according to a U.S. intelligence
official quoted anonymously by The Washington Post on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this has to be seen through what is the murky prism of
Middle Eastern politics,'' Tedesco of ''60 Minutes'' said. ''There
are many people who have reason to discredit this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Restating the show's faith in its report and the decision to air
it, he said: ''Any time we are aware of a suspect in the custody of
the CIA being debriefed about some of the biggest, worst terrorist
acts ever committed, and who has been confirmed by high government
sources as being in Iranian intelligence, that's a story we're
going to put on the air. And we'd do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   For its report ''60 Minutes'' was not able to film or record the
man, who was under armed guard in a Turkish refugee camp. Instead,
an Iranian-born associate producer was able to sneak into the camp
and question him a few days before the interview was aired.
</P>
<P>
   She then appeared on camera with Stahl outside the camp,
relaying additional claims by the man that he had been responsible
for the murders of numerous Iranian dissidents and intellectuals,
and that he had evidence that Iran carried out the bombing of the
Khobar Towers apartment complex in Saudi Arabia in which 19
American soldiers were killed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after a second clandestine meeting by the producer with
the man, he was taken away by Turkish authorities for Ankara, 150
miles away, Stahl reported. ''He managed to get a message to us
that he was afraid the Turks were going to send him back to Iran,
where he fears he faces certain death.''
</P>
<P>
   ''60 Minutes'' doesn't know his current whereabouts, Tedesco
said.

<P>
   Some signs that profits are under pressure came on Friday.
Shares of Xerox Corp. fell $4.50 to $20.813 after the office
machine maker said its second-quarter earnings would fall short of
Wall Street analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in
San Francisco, lowered its second-quarter earnings projection,
sending its stock down $8.75 to $19.875. That came a day after
Wachovia, a respected banking company based in North Carolina,
warned investors that its profits would be hurt by rising interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Financial services stocks, especially those in the banking
sector, were rocked again Friday by the weak profit outlook. Mellon
fell $3 to $34 and Bank of America dropped $3.813 to $48.25.
</P>
<P>
   Larger banks and brokerages also tumbled. J.P. Morgan was down
$6.938 at $119.563, contributing most to the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce
Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to
its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand. That's a direct result of the Fed's six inflation-fighting
rate increases over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   A number of recent economic reports -- including home sales,
factory orders, retail sales and unemployment -- indicate the
economy is cooling down. Given that, a growing number of analysts
believe the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged when its meets
June 27 and 28. But the view is not unanimous and some analysts say
the Fed may still feel that more needs to be done to make sure
inflation is not revived.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks showed some scattered strength. Qualcomm was
up $4 to $65.438, bouncing higher after two days of steep losses.
</P>
<P>
   And semiconductor company Rambus soared $26.563 to $83.25 after
signing a licensing deal with Japanese consumer electronics company
Toshiba Corp. The deal will boost Rambus's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 886.93 million shares
by late afternoon, well ahead of 771.77 million shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''triple-witching'' day -- marking the quarterly
expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts --
contributed to the higher volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 0.30 at 512.55.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Rejects U.N. Verification  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Friday
rejected U.N. verification of Israel's withdrawal from southern
Lebanon, saying Israeli forces were still in control of some parts
of Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Hoss said Israeli troops still manned several
positions inside Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''With deep regret, it appeared by Friday evening that Israel
has not yet withdrawn from all Lebanese territory,'' Hoss said
shortly after U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan told a news
conference in New York that Israel had completely pulled out its
forces from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Lebanese officers working with the U.N. team
inspecting the Lebanese-Israeli border had found ''there are still
several Israeli military outposts inside the Lebanese border. And
there are several tracts of Lebanese territory under Israeli
control in a flagrant act of encroachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that the secretariat-general of the United
Nations would have announced the withdrawal had been completed in
accordance with resolution 425 had it been informed of these
facts,'' Hoss added.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Annan confirmed the withdrawal, Lebanese President
Emile Lahoud warned that his government was opposed to the
U.N.-demarcated frontier and would consider Israel's pullout to be
incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's formal declaration of the withdrawal paves the way for
the 4,500-strong U.N. peacekeeping mission in Lebanon to deploy to
the Lebanese-Israeli border and help the Lebanese government
reassert its authority in the vacated territory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm delighted to tell you that the United Nations force in
Lebanon has today reported to me that Israel has withdrawn from the
country in full compliance with Security Council resolution 425,''
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a happy day for Lebanon but also for Israel,'' Annan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan did not address Lahoud's earlier comments, saying only
that he was heading to the Middle East later Friday to meet leaders
of all sides and ''to see what the United Nations can do to
consolidate and build on today's achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lahoud's warning underlined the Lebanese government's reluctance
to deploy troops in the area that Israel had occupied as a buffer
zone against guerrilla attacks. Beirut had said it will only deploy
military force in the area, where guerrillas are now the de facto
authority, after the United Nations had verified Israel's
withdrawal and deployed peacekeepers along the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak,
Gadi Baltiansky, refused to comment on the verification, saying the
government would respond either late Saturday or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel first invaded Lebanon in 1978. It occupied a strip along
the southern Lebanese border as a buffer against attacks on
northern Israel from 1985 until last month.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has promised to boost the U.N. peacekeeping
force in south Lebanon once Israel's withdrawal was verified.

<HEADLINE> Voting Documents Seized in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Militants supporting President Robert
Mugabe have seized identification and voting papers to prevent
suspected opposition supporters from casting ballots in next
month's parliamentary election, human rights groups said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In at least three voting districts, government supporters
destroyed ID cards, passports and other documents in an apparent
effort to intimidate voters ahead of the June 24-25 election, said
David Chimini of Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum, a coalition of
independent groups.
</P>
<P>
   The militants confiscated documents in the central region of
Gokwe, southern Mwenezi and eastern Mutoko, knowing the papers
could not be replaced in time for the polling, said the coalition
of nine legal, church and human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition Movement for Democratic Change also reported
government supporters burning documents in about 30 of the nation's
120 parliamentary districts.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of arson, beatings, torture, and intimidation have
forced rural voters to seek safety in towns and cities, where they
are not entitled to vote, Chimini said.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll published Friday showed the opposition -- which
now holds only three parliamentary seats -- could take as many as 70
slots in the 150-seat parliament. A total of 120 seats will be at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Opinion Institute at the University of Zimbabwe said
it canvassed 6,000 voters across the country and allowed a 10
percent margin of error in the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition research coordinator Tony Reeler said unruly
opposition members were also to blame for recent violence. But
their actions bore no comparison to the violence perpetrated by the
ruling party, its agents and members of the secret police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The government and its supporters were attempting ''to terrorize
the opposition into submission,'' Reeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Election monitors traced the violence back to February, when
ruling party militants and war veterans began illegally occupying
more than 1,400 white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Squatter settlements on the farms became bases for intimidating
farmers, their workers and nearby rural poor. At least 31 people,
mostly opposition supporters, have died in political violence since
February.
</P>
<P>
   ''The objective of this campaign has been to smash the
organizational capacity of the opposition,'' Reeler said.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe ordered police not to remove the squatters from farms,
insisting they were protesting unfair land ownership by whites
dating to British colonial rule.

<HEADLINE> Pisa Tower Isn't Leaning As Much  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISA, Italy (AP) -- The leaning Tower of Pisa is still leaning --
but about 250 years worth less than it did.
</P>
<P>
   The famed tower is scheduled to open to the public next year
after 11 years of work to keep it from toppling over.
</P>
<P>
   Michele Jamialkowski, the head of an international committee
organized to save the tower, said that all goes as planned, the
tower should remain stable for centuries. He said the rejuvenation
was like knocking 250 years off the 12th century tower's life.
</P>
<P>
   In a briefing on the rejuvenation, officials said Friday that it
won't be necessary to have underground anchors, as once thought.
</P>
<P>
   They also said tons of lead counterweights placed at the
monument's base as a counterbalance will no longer be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of dirt have been removed from under the foundation and
experts hope the tower will lean as much as 20 inches less than it
did. A decade ago, when the work began, the tower leaned 13 feet
off the perpendicular.
</P>
<P>
   A group of students will visit the tower Saturday in what
officials call a ''symbolic'' opening.
</P>
<P>
   The real opening is expected in spring 2001.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Attends Funeral of Top Cop  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, walking with
difficulty and using a cane, made a surprise public appearance
Friday to attend funeral services for a former secret police chief
who served under his dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet had not appeared in public since his March 3 return
from British detention, except to make several visits to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Gen. Humberto Gordon led Pinochet's secret police from
1980 to 1987, and later joined his ruling junta. He died Thursday
of a heart attack at age 72.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, 84, arrived in his usual motorcade of three armored
automobiles to the Military Chapel in western Santiago. Wearing a
cap and a heavy blue overcoat, Pinochet was helped by bodyguards to
step out of the car and walk into the chapel.
</P>
<P>
   He walked with difficulty, but did not use a wheelchair as he
has done in recent weeks. He told reporters in a low voice that he
felt ''well.''
</P>
<P>
   For about five minutes he stayed at the church, talking to
Gordon's widow, Maruja Maturana, and to retired Gen. Rafael
Villarroel, a former close aide.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter for radio Cooperativa of Santiago said he overheard
Pinochet tell Villarroel: ''Ones go first, others go later.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon died under house arrest, indicted in five killings that a
judge traced to the security service he once commanded.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet himself has been waging a legal battle to avoid trial
in Chile. He has an appeal pending before the Supreme Court to a
lower court ruling that stripped him of congressional immunity.
</P>
<P>
   In London, he was under house detention for 503 days fighting
extradition to Spain for trial. British authorities released him
after doctors said he was physically and mentally unfit to stand
trial.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official report, 3,190 people were killed under
Pinochet's regime, and more than 1,000 remain unaccounted for.

<HEADLINE> China-Trade Supporters Fear Delay  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Proponents of a bill to expand trade with
China expressed increasing alarm that they are losing momentum in
the Senate. It is now unlikely to come up before the Fourth of
July, Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle conceded Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle for the first time even held out the prospect that a
vote might be put off to September. ''It is more likely it will
come up later rather than sooner,'' he told reporters, calling its
chances of passage endangered.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters in both parties suggested Commerce Secretary William
Daley's upcoming departure to run Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign was further complicating the timetable.
</P>
<P>
   Daley, the Clinton administration's point man on the China trade
bill, is leaving his post on July 15 to assume the campaign job.
</P>
<P>
   That ''is not helpful'' to efforts to get the China trade bill
approved, said John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Czwartacki, responding to Daschle's comments, said Friday that
Lott has not ruled out a vote before the Fourth of July. ''That's
not to say that a vote has been scheduled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that Sen. Daschle is not suggesting that the world's
most deliberative body become a rubber stamp for what the House
does,'' Czwartacki said.
</P>
<P>
   While the legislation itself has wide support, it has become a
victim of political maneuvering in the rush to clear the
legislative decks before this summer's political conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Backers so far have been unable to capitalize on the momentum
they thought they had won from last month's larger-than-expected
237-197 victory in the House.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. business leaders, who have much of the lobbying muscle on
behalf of the bill, are now warning legislative leaders that
delaying the vote beyond July could prove disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Donahue, the head of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, met
privately with Lott on Thursday to urge prompt action.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to move this thing as quickly as possible,'' chamber
spokesman Frank Coleman said. ''Everybody knows that at any moment
there are issues that could arise that could complicate matters in
the Congress on this legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are blaming Lott for playing politics with the bill --
to gain leverage on other issues and to prolong Democratic
discomfort. ''The majority is playing a very risky game in delaying
this,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor, a key Democratic constituency, strongly opposes
the bill and plans to turn up the heat as elections approach. ''It
is no secret that this is not an easy issue for a lot of Democrats,
for most Democrats,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The South Dakota Democrat also said Daley's departure could have
''significant impact. He has a depth of friendship and credibility
on the Hill that is as great as anybody I know.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We have fewer than 35 legislative days remaining in this
Congress,'' Daschle added. ''I think it would be devastating if we
lost PNTR just because we've run out of time. But that is very
possible, especially if we wait until September.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would end annual votes on China's status and grant it
permanent normal trading relations (PNTR). U.S. companies could
then take advantage of market-opening concessions China made to
join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters hope to keep the bill from being further amended in
the Senate. The House added several provisions, including one for a
human-rights monitoring commission.
</P>
<P>
   Any changes made by the Senate would eventually require another
likely contentious vote in the House -- something proponents clearly
hope to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Amendments have been threatened by Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn. And Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said
he will pursue an amendment if he can't get a separate vote on his
bill to impose sanctions on China for weapons proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people want a clean bill, I understand that, but the
Constitution doesn't say anything about our requirement to have a
clean bill. It does require us to take care of matters of national
security,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., a top China-trade supporter, will meet
next week with Lott and Daschle to press for a commitment for a
vote in July, said his press secretary, Mike Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   ''His intent is on avoiding a scenario where the most important
Senate vote in a generation slips into the everyday mess of
Washington politics,'' Siegel said. ''In his estimation, it must
happen by the end of July, otherwise it could be lost for this
year.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feds Break Up Mexican Heroin Ring  </HEADLINE>
By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Jr.
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A 13-month investigation into an international
drug smuggling operation led to the arrests of more than 200 people
and sparked fears that an inexpensive, but unusually potent form of
heroin is entering mid-sized U.S. cities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican-based ring is operating in cities from Honolulu to
the Eastern U.S. markets usually supplied by Colombian dealers,
officials said. It gained a foothold on the East Coast by
underselling the Colombians by $800 to $1,000 per ounce of heroin,
Donnie Marshall, administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, said Thursday as officials announced a string of
new arrests in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The DEA was alarmed to find that the ring was selling $10 street
doses of heroin, weighing .05 grams, that were 60 percent to 85
percent pure heroin, said Rod Benson, deputy to the chief of
special operations for the DEA.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian heroin, which is white because it is more highly
processed, is sold in the United States in purities ranging from 70
percent to 90 percent. Marshall said seizures of heroin from Mexico
in 1991 averaged 15 percent purity.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said he believes ''this operation has some significant
implications, not just for law enforcement but for the country as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This operation, I think, shows that heroin has re-emerged in
our society with a vengeance, and it is more potent and more deadly
in our country than ever before,'' said Marshall, speaking with
Attorney General Janet Reno at the DEA's suburban Arlington, Va.,
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-drug sweep, called Operation Tar Pit, grew out of a
June investigation that found a single organization was providing
most of San Diego's high-grade heroin. Agents linked the ring to an
investigation in Chimayo, N.M., where 85 people had died from
heroin overdoses between 1995 and 1998, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The higher purity actually allows users to smoke or inhale the
heroin rather than injecting it,and unfortunately many people think
that if it's not injected the heroin is not as dangerous,''
Marshall said, ''and that couldn't be further from the truth as the
sad and tragic events in Chimayo, New Mexico, will tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The gang, based in the Nayarit state of Mexico, is believed to
be led by Issas Hernandez-Garcia, who was arrested Thursday, and
Angel Hernandez-Ibarra, who remains at large. Authorities believe
the gang was distributing 80 pounds of heroin each month, worth
more than $7 million, in 22 U.S. cities ranging from Anchorage,
Alaska, to Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   To develop customers quickly, the distributors preyed on clinics
where heroin addicts receive the drug methadone to block their need
for heroin, Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This organization operated in a dangerously efficient manner.
Not only did this group exhibit disregard for the law, but their
peddling of this powerful and addictive drug showed an even greater
disregard for human life,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy,
said it was encouraging that U.S. authorities had broken up the
ring but disputed characterizing the ring as Mexican. ''The heroin
is Mexican and the main heroin wholesalers were based in Nayarit,
but the gang and the main distribution center was based in Los
Angeles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DEA and FBI agents had arrested 70 people through Wednesday. On
Thursday, they arrested 176 more people by early evening, searched
60 locations and seized 23 pounds of heroin. That brought overall
seizures to 64 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said the gang sold heroin in San Diego, Los Angeles and
Bakersfield, Calif.; Portland, Ore.; Honolulu; Anchorage, Alaska;
Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; Phoenix and Yuma, Ariz.; Albuquerque,
N.M.; Salt Lake City; Denver; Cleveland, Columbus and Steubenville,
Ohio; Nashville, Tenn.; Atlanta; Chicago; Detroit; Pittsburgh; and
Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The gang also had distribution cells, not linked to one city, in
Kentucky, Minnesota, Alabama, West Virginia and New Jersey, Benson
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Chides GOP On School Funds  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- On a hot school playground in Queens, President
Clinton blasted House Republicans for zeroing out his request for
more than $1 billion to renovate the nation's dilapidated schools
and ease overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we think that we're going to build the future of our dreams
by making these kids go to school in places where they don't have
computer labs, they don't have music rooms ... their buildings are
being heated with coal and their teachers are trying to teach 40
kids when they ought to be teaching 20, we're living in a dream
world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke in front of three temporary classroom trailers
decorated with red-white-and-blue tissue paper flowers and signs
welcoming the president. He implored parents, students and teachers
crowded on the playground to push Congress to appropriate funds and
ask lawmakers: ''Where is the bill? Show me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed an appropriations bill on Wednesday that left
out the president's request for $1.3 billion in grants and loans to
support an estimated $6.5 billion in repairs and renovations to the
most dilapidated schools.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans fear it would create unnecessary bureaucracy
in Washington. They don't want the federal government to meddle in
local school district affairs, said Becky Campoverde, spokeswoman
for House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Rep. Bill
Goodling, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's prefers a tax credit plan like one Clinton vetoed last
year, she said, when Congress aimed to lower a school district's
cost of borrowing money for building projects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disagrees. ''Some people say 'Let them do it at the
local level,''' he said. ''We've got more kids in school than ever
before, but we've got a smaller percentage of taxpayers and it's
hard, if not impossible, to raise the money to build and repair
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is happier with a Senate measure, which includes $3.1
billion for a block grant program that school districts could use
for school construction and other projects to reduce class size and
train teachers. But he wants a specific program for school
construction because there's no guarantee the money would be used
to fix schools in serious disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, said the cost to build new schools and modernize
old ones is at least $112 billion, and more recent estimates say it
will cost much more. A GAO survey of 10,000 schools in 1995 found
one-third needed extensive repair or replacement of one or more
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our English language learners are taught in the hall,'' said
Mary Minnick, who began teaching at Abigail Adams when Lyndon
Johnson was president. ''Our science teachers are bag ladies,
carrying their wares from room to room.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton visited a public elementary school
in East Harlem, where he spoke on NBC's ''Today'' show to support
the ''Save the Music'' program. Time Warner Cable and the VHI Save
The Music Foundation began it in 1997 to support music education in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a saxophone player in his high school band, said music
programs are often the first to go when budgets are cut. In its
first year, the program collected more than $1 million in
instruments for music education in New York City. The program is
working to expand to 40 communities in 23 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Clinton was to speak at an evening fund raiser for
Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Man To Be Tourist Aboard Mir  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A one-time U.S. rocket scientist plans to
experience space flight from the other end as a tourist aboard the
Russian space station Mir, the company providing private investment
for the station said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement that Dennis Tito, who now heads Wilshire
Associates in Santa Monica, Calif., is preparing to head into orbit
came just hours after two cosmonauts returned from a two-month
mission that resuscitated the aging and often-troubled Mir.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Russia's cash-strapped space program had said the
14-year-old Mir would be decommissioned this spring unless
investors could be found to keep it aloft.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mir's time appeared to be ending, a Netherlands-based
company called MirCorp came up with funds for a mission that began
April 4. The mission was aimed at performing small repairs and
maintenance aboard the Mir to restore it to full service after
flying unmanned for eight months.
</P>
<P>
   A capsule carrying Sergei Zalyotin and Alexander Kaleri touched
down by parachute at 4:44 a.m. Moscow time near the town of Arkalyk
in the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan after a
three-and-a-half-hour descent, Mission Control spokesman Valery
Lyndin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cosmonauts confirmed that Mir is in good working order,
and they demonstrated the value of Mir to the world's business
community,'' said Chirinjeev Kathuria, one of MirCorp's main
investors. ''We now are preparing the groundwork for upcoming
missions to the station.''
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp spokesman Jeffrey Lenorovitz said later Friday that Tito
is undergoing training in preparation for a mission in early 2001
and that he was expected to pay a deposit sealing the mission
within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Lenorovitz declined to say how much the deposit would be, but
said the full ticket to fly was expected to cost about $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Tito, currently in Moscow, could not immediately be reached for
comment on what he expected to do on the mission of seven to 10
days. Lenorovitz said what a ''space tourist'' might do is an open
question.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know whether he's just going to enjoy the experience
... or perform experiments, Lenorovitz said by telephone from
France.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to do experiments, Tito has the background to cook
up something sophisticated. In a 1999 profile posted on Wilshire
Associates' Web site, the Los Angeles Times said Tito once worked
for the U.S. Jet Propulsion Laboratory and that his
responsibilities included working out the trajectories for Mariner
spacecraft, which reached Mars and Venus in the 1960s and 70s.
</P>
<P>
   RKK Energiya company, which built and runs Mir, has a 60-percent
stake in MirCorp and the remainder belongs to private investors.
</P>
<P>
   The aging station has seen a series of accidents and breakdowns,
including a terrifying fire and a near-fatal collision with a cargo
ship in 1997. MirCorp officials played down past problems.
</P>
<P>
   Russian space officials view MirCorp as the last hope to save
Mir, a symbol of the once-glorious Soviet space program that put
the first satellite in orbit and the first person into space.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. space agency NASA has been vexed by Moscow's decision
to extend Mir's life, saying it diverts scarce Russian resources
from the International Space Station project. The new station is
behind schedule because of Russia's failure to deliver a key
component, the Zvezda service module, currently set to be launched
July 12.

<HEADLINE> Man who killed four prostitutes avoids death penalty  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Jurors on Friday ruled against the death
penalty for a Trenton man convicted of sodomizing and strangling
four prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Balaam, 34, was convicted June 1 of killing the four
women over a two-year period during exchanges of sex for drugs.
After deliberating Thursday and Friday morning, jurors decided not
to impose the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was surprised, but I admire the jury,'' said Assistant
Prosecutor Brian McCauley. ''It's a tough decision to ask anyone to
make.''
</P>
<P>
   McCauley said Balaam, who did not testify during the trial, is
linked to the women's deaths by DNA evidence and a confession.
</P>
<P>
   Balaam was present at Friday's hearing, McCauley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He smiled like he did the entire trial,'' McCauley said. ''He
never said a word. He just sat there and smiled.''
</P>
<P>
   The slain women were: Debra Ann Walker, 37, killed July 29,
1996; Concetta Hayward, 27, killed April 10, 1995; Valentina
Cuyler, 29, killed March 19, 1995; and Karen Denise Patterson, 41,
killed Oct. 24, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   At his sentencing, scheduled for Aug. 25, Balaam could face a
total of 160 years in prison, according to McCauley.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent death penalty cases in Mercer County include
Ambrose Harris in 1996 and Jesse Timmendequas in 1997. In those
cases juries from Burlington and Hunterdon counties, respectively,
were used.
</P>
<P>
   The Balaam case marks the first death penalty trial to use
Mercer County jurors since 1994, when Donald Loftin was sentenced
to death for the fatal shooting of a Lawrence gas station
attendant.

<HEADLINE> Puerto Rican Activist Has Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYAMON, Puerto Rico (AP) -- Ruben Berrios, a key opponent of
U.S. Navy bombing on the island of Vieques, underwent an operation
Friday to remove a cancerous prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios, 60, was the most visible leader of the protesters who
camped out on the U.S. Navy bombing range on Vieques for more than
a year, preventing exercises after an April 1999 accident in which
a civilian guard was killed by two errant bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios' physician, Dr. Mario Maldonado, said Berrios was in
good condition after the surgery and would remain hospitalized for
a day or two for observation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The operation was a success and Ruben is recuperating very
well,'' Maldonado said.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios' wife, Vivian Alemany, said. ''The most important thing
now is rest and recuperation and we're going to work on that.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, federal agents removed more than 200 protesters from
the bombing range and the Navy renewed bombing with non-explosive
''dummy'' bombs a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   On May 10, Berrios and another activist were detained for
entering the range, and Berrios served a six-hour jail sentence
Tuesday for a federal trespassing conviction. A day later, he
revealed he had prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Berrios, head of the Puerto Rico Independence Party, is running
for governor of Puerto Rico in November elections.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Wants Sanctions Lifted  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar urged
the United States on Friday to lift its economic and military
sanctions against Pakistan's military-ruled government. Both Sattar
and U.S. officials said their resumption of high-level nuclear
talks went well.
</P>
<P>
   Sattar also criticized U.S. sanctions against Afghanistan's
ruling Taliban as ''counterproductive.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Pakistan's relations with the United States remain troubled
but friendly,'' Sattar said at a news conference disrupted by
Afghans shouting criticism of Pakistan influence in their homeland.
Sattar said he assured U.S. officials that Pakistan wants to
maintain a nuclear deterrent at ''minimum credible levels'' and is
not in an arms race with India.
</P>
<P>
   His visit came on the day India test fired a Prithvi missile --
an action which brought criticism from the State Department.
Spokesman Richard Boucher said such tests have ''the potential to
increase tension in the region'' because they prompt speculation
that one country is ahead of the other. Boucher said U.S. officials
believe no strategically significant difference exists between the
two countries' capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Sattar met Thursday with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and other top officials on security, nuclear and other issues.
President Clinton visited Pakistan briefly in March and
Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering was in Islamabad last
month, but a Sattar meeting Thursday with Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott was the first formal nuclear dialogue since talks
were suspended in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sattar said the talks led to ''better mutual understanding'' and
were ''very productive.'' He did not give specifics.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials also described the talks in positive terms,
saying they focused on ''our mutual concern about preserving South
Asian security while preventing proliferation of nuclear weapons
and missile delivery systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, speaking for the U.S. government, said the two explored
how to reduce tension between Pakistan and India, primarily over
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was agreement to continue to work closely together to
prevent further proliferation, an arms race, and conflict in the
region,'' Boucher said, adding that they also discussed how to move
ahead in negotiations for a fissile material cut-off treaty and the
possibility of a multilateral moratorium on production of such
nuclear materials pending implementation of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said U.S. officials would like a ''detailed roadmap''
for quickly restoring democracy to Pakistan. He said Sattar and
Pickering discussed that issue, with Albright participating briefly
in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has been pressing both Pakistan and India to sign the
global test ban treaty after both countries conducted nuclear tests
in May 1998 and declared themselves nuclear powers. U.S. officials
also are concerned about the state of democracy in Pakistan
following the Oct. 12 takeover by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who has
promised a return to elected civilian government in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are prepared to accept any restraints and nonproliferation
measures on a nondiscriminatory, regional or global basis,'' Sattar
said at the National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sanctions against Pakistan ''single out one country and are
not consistent with friendly relations,'' he said, adding, ''The
U.S. government and the U.S. Congress should adopt a more general,
evenhanded, balanced approach to Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Pakistan is concerned about a 28 percent increase in
India's defense budget and said its ''attempt to seek dominance in
the Indian Ocean region and beyond will be inherently
destabilizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Afghans were peacefully ushered out of the press
conference shouting accusations that Pakistan controls the Taliban
government in Afghanistan. Others in the group waved banners
denouncing Pakistan as Sattar entered and left the building.

<HEADLINE> Russian Missile Fuel Leak Hurts 10  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) -- Fuel leaked from a missile as it was
being unloaded from a ship Friday, unleashing a yellow cloud of
toxic fumes that burned the respiratory tracts of 10 Russian
servicemen, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The R-29 missile leaked fuel, which then oxidized when it
touched water and produced a cloud containing nitric acid, said
Irina Andriyanova, spokeswoman for the Emergency Situations
Ministry in the Far East region of Vladivostok. The 1.6
million-square-foot toxic cloud drifted east along the shore toward
Nakhodka, a large port for sea traffic from Japan, Andriyanova
said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear if the servicemen, employed at a nearby military
base, were on site when the missile was being unloaded. They were
hospitalized, but their conditions were not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Local radio stations warned nearby residents to stay indoors and
close their windows as the cloud drifted over a small town and out
to sea. No other injuries were reported, and the cloud dissipated
after six hours, Andriyanova said.
</P>
<P>
   The two-stage R-29 is designed to carry a nuclear warhead up to
4,800 miles after launch from a Delta-class submarine. Officials
said the missile's warhead had been removed.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Standing before a media horde at his first
Manhattan news conference last month, incoming Archbishop Edward
Egan acknowledged something wasn't quite right.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel like the boss,'' he confessed. ''But give me a
little time and I will.''
</P>
<P>
   Five weeks later, the time is now for the 68-year-old Egan. On
Sunday, in a St. Patrick's Cathedral ceremony, he officially
becomes the 12th head of the sprawling Archdiocese of New York and
its 2.4 million members.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an elaborate installation Mass complete with a
45-minute procession of 700 priests will mark the conservative
Catholic prelate's ascent to the St. Patrick's pulpit. There, he
will address a crowd of about 3,000 invited guests.
</P>
<P>
   The attendees are a mix of the sacred and the secular: eight
cardinals will join first lady Hillary Clinton, U.S. Rep. Rick
Lazio, Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas,
Gov. George Pataki, U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Egan is swapping suburban Connecticut for a Manhattan fishbowl,
moving into the official residence on Madison Avenue. He instantly
becomes America's most visible Catholic; his Sunday sermons will
soon become fodder for tabloid headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But the former bishop of Bridgeport wasn't talking about his new
job, putting off interviews until he put in a full week on the job.
He first wants to meet people and get a feel for the diocese and
its 413 parishes.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to familiarize himself as to where things stand now
in the archdiocese,'' said spokesman Joe Zwilling. There's plenty
to learn: New York is the nation's third-largest archdiocese,
behind Los Angeles and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Egan has yet to even set his regular schedule for celebrating
Mass in the cathedral, Zwilling said.
</P>
<P>
   But some things are already known about Egan: he is a firm
believer in church doctrine, unwavering in his opposition to
abortion and birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was born in Oak Park, Ill., the hometown of Ernest
Hemingway. He graduated from Rome's prestigious Gregorian
Pontifical University in 1958. Ordained in Rome, he spent the next
two decades in Chicago or the Vatican in several positions.
</P>
<P>
   Egan became a bishop in 1985, and spent the next three years
working with his predecessor, Cardinal John O'Connor, as vicar for
education in the archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988 he became bishop in Bridgeport, where he was hailed for
reorganizing diocesan schools, recruiting local men into the
priesthood, and fund-raising. But during his tenure, the diocese
was forced to defend itself against more than two dozen lawsuits
about alleged sexual molestation by local priests.
</P>
<P>
   Though all but one of the cases predated Egan's arrival, the
incidents raised embarrassing questions about whether the abuse was
covered up.
</P>
<P>
   Egan was named May 11 to replace O'Connor, who had died of
cancer eight days earlier after 16 years on the job. O'Connor will
be remembered in prayers at both ceremonies for Egan.
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop assumes his duties Sunday before an afternoon
prayer service.
</P>
<P>
   Egan will first bless the congregation with holy water before
his papal letter of appointment is read and notarized in the
cathedral's sanctuary. At that point, he officially becomes
archbishop.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Egan will celebrate the Mass of installation and
deliver the homily.
</P>
<P>
   The new archbishop's namesake nephew, Edward Michael Egan, will
present the gifts for communion. The archbishop selected some music
for the Mass; a friend, opera star Renee Fleming, will perform
''Alleluia'' from Mozart's ''Exultate Jubilate.''
</P>
<P>
   In his farewell news conference at Bridgeport, Egan said one of
his major objectives in New York was bringing in more priests and
other religious vocations. In his first Mass at St. Patrick's, Egan
installed five new priests.
</P>
<P>
   All five will attend the Sunday service with Egan.
</P>
<P>
   He must also deal with the archdiocese's school system - 238
elementary schools and 55 high schools with 113,000 students. Egan
has said he hopes to keep all the schools open.
</P>
<P>
   A bit of unfinished business remains in Bridgeport, Conn. - on
June 27, he will return to ordain a group of permanent deacons
there. Two days later, he will be in Rome to receive the blessing
of Pope John Paul II in his new job.

<HEADLINE> Fostering fatherhood at heart of state law  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA TOMMELLEO
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORWICH, Conn. (AP) - Louis Mercado used to stay out nights
clubbing. The 19-year-old high school dropout also vowed he would
never change a diaper. But the birth of his daughter changed his
head and his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he helps others like him deal with the challenges of
fatherhood thorough a Norwich agency, which received one of three
$200,000 pilot grants under the state's Fatherhood Initiative law.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a lot of responsibility... a lot of changes. I used
to go out, date girls left and right, but now that she came into my
life, no more going out,'' said Mercado, a Foxwoods Resort Casino
employee.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels good going home and having a daughter come up to you
and give you a hug and say I love you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jada Ashley Mercado arrived, all 9 pounds, 12 ounces of her, on
May 6, 1998 at William W. Backus Hospital in Norwich. Mercado and
Jada's mother, Nicole Bowers, live together and are both working to
support their family. He also has custody of his 12-year-old
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The proud papa is quick to pull out a handful of baby pictures
from his wallet upon request. The photos chronicle Jada's
development from newborn to toddler. Much like his daughter,
Mercado has grown over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He said the full weight of fatherhood hit him when he found out
his girlfriend was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right then, I knew it was my responsibility to keep her
healthy and all that,'' said Mercado, who participated in a panel
discussion at a conference on fatherhood Friday in Norwch.
</P>
<P>
   He finds support at Madonna Place, a downtown Norwich social
agency. It was one of three organizations to receive a $200,000
two-year grant from the state's Fatherhood Initiative, a program
designed to help noncustodial fathers stay involved in their
children's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Other grant recipients were Families in Crisis, a program
targeting young fathers at the state prison in Cheshire and Career
Resources, a Bridgeport-based program that stresses education,
training and employment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Department of Social Services, about 23
percent of all households have no father and more than half of
those are impoverished. Nationally, about 17 million homes are
fatherless. Connecticut is one of several states adopting
fatherhood initiatives, a relatively new concept since most job and
family related services for low-income people are directed to
women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have one of the most comprehensive pieces of
legislation on this issue,'' said Social Services Commissioner Pat
Wilson-Coker.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the money was another matter, she said. Enacted during
the 1999 General Assembly, the fatherhood law landed on
Wilson-Coker's desk with virtually no money to implement it.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like I've always said, 'vision is free.' I was told I could
find $100,000 in my budget and I did,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, lawmakers appropriated $600,000 for the three grants.
To be eligible for the grants, the organizations had to show they
had something built into their programs that would sustain them
after the grants ran out, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They also had to prove they were connected to the community,''
said Wilson-Coker.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna Place has been tied to Norwich for 13 years and has just
moved to larger building. About three dozen men attend the agency's
parenting groups, according to staff member and group leader Gary
Hotham. He said the fathers range from late teens to the forties in
age and many, said Hotham, bring their children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Louis has been one of the foundations of our Friday group.
He's been a rock for the other guys,'' said Hotham. ''They all turn
to jelly when they start passing Jada around. It's great to see
these guys experience that paternal instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   They also share in each other's sorrow, said Mary Mason, who is
affiliated with Madonna Place. She said one group member recently
lost touch with his child when the mother moved out of state and
left no address.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see our young dad still coming to the group and (he's) so
sad without his baby ... it's heartbreaking,'' she said. ''We see
it when it gets severed and how painful it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercado is trying to break the cycle he grew up with. He never
knew his father and his only male role models were cousins, who now
live out of state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been pretty much developing by myself,'' he said. ''I'm
getting there ... hopefully.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Pres Denies Mine Seizures  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe denied Friday
that he intended to nationalize foreign-owned mines, but said he
wanted more blacks admitted to white-dominated businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe, campaigning in preparation for parliamentary elections
on June 24-25, said news reports Thursday that mines would be
seized were unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the government would seek to persuade foreign
companies to enter business partnerships with black entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   The government was holding talks with mining conglomerates to
make shareholdings available to Zimbabwe's blacks, Mugabe told
supporters at Kadoma, 90 miles southwest of Harare.
</P>
<P>
   According to the reports, which were carried by the Independent
News Service of South Africa and the allied Independent newspaper
of London, Mugabe said in an interview that his government was
eyeing foreign-owned firms, including mines and some 400
British-controlled businesses, for possible seizure as part of his
campaign to ''Africanize'' his country's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Mining experts said such a threat could have severe
repercussions in Zimbabwe, which depends heavily on mining
revenues.
</P>
<P>
   In the reports on Thursday, Mugabe said foreign-owned gold,
copper, asbestos and iron mines face seizure once his government
completes the hand over of white-owned land to landless blacks
after the upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   ''There must be Africans as owners, not just as workers,''
Mugabe was quoted as saying. He said there are ''too many Britons''
in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The government has supported the violent and illegal occupation
of more than 1,400 white-owned farms by ruling party militants and
mobs of black squatters since February. Last month, the government
said it would nationalize 804 white farms over the next few weeks
without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say that militants supporting Mugabe have
also seized identification and voting papers to prevent suspected
opposition supporters from casting ballots in the election.
</P>
<P>
   In at least three voting districts, government supporters
destroyed documents to intimidate voters ahead of the election,
David Chimini of Zimbabwe Human Rights Forum, a coalition of
independent groups, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Incidents of arson, beatings, torture, and intimidation have
forced rural voters to seek safety in towns and cities, where they
are not entitled to vote, Chimini said.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion poll published Friday showed the opposition -- which
now holds only three parliamentary seats -- could take as many as 70
slots in the 150-seat parliament. A total of 120 seats will be at
stake.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Opinion Institute at the University of Zimbabwe said
it canvassed 6,000 voters across the country and allowed a 10
percent margin of error for the poll.

<HEADLINE> Millville hospital closing in South Jersey Hospitals consolidation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILLVILLE, N.J. (AP) - South Jersey Hospital Systems is closing
its Millville hospital as part of a consolidation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, which posted operating losses of $3 million last
year, will close its doors by year's end. South Jersey Hospital
Systems officials plan to sell the building to Filmore Street LLC.,
a developer of senior citizen housing.
</P>
<P>
   The closing is part of the company's plan to consolidate its
three Cumberland County hospitals - in Millville, Bridgeton and
Vineland - into one new hospital to be built in Vineland.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation will save $3 million annually, according to
Chester B. Kaletkowski, president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ''The savings will come from streamlining operations and
consolidating services,'' Kaletkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other New Jersey hospitals, the Millville hospital has been
struggling, according to Kerry McKean Kelly, spokeswoman for the
New Jersey Hospital Association, in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hospitals are under fire to become more efficient, with
managed care dictating shorter hospital stays, federal Medicare
cuts, the expense of caring for the uninsured and the state's
shortfall in reimbursing for charity care,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Bitter custody battle preceded murder of quads' mom, lawyer testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) - A South Texas millionaire voluntarily
terminated his parental rights after his ex-wife said for a second
time he had abused one of their two daughters, according to
testimony Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Blackthorne terminated parental rights. He would have no
further rights and no further obligations, including the obligation
to pay child support,'' said Ken Nunley, one of the attorneys for
Sheila Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Blackthorne has been linked in the shooting and stabbing
death of Bellush - the mother of six including quadruplets - in her
Sarasota, Fla., home. He is charged with interstate conspiracy to
commit murder for hire and interstate domestic violence.
Blackthorne faces a mandatory life sentence on the charges.
</P>
<P>
   By relinquishing parental rights, Blackthorne would have no
legal ties to his two daughters. ''After this was signed, there was
no turning back,'' Nunley testified.
</P>
<P>
   Nunley also testified that in September 1997 neighbors of
Bellush sought custody of one of her daughters after Bellush was
accused hitting the girl with a belt.
</P>
<P>
   Nunley said the neighbors were represented by Blackthorne's
lawyers, who had months before been locked in a heated custody
battle with Bellush.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbors later dismissed their custody suit and child abuse
charges against Bellush were dropped. Bellush and her two daughters
with Blackthorne soon moved from San Antonio to Sarasota.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed six weeks after moving from Texas. Her
2-year-old quadruplets from her second husband, Jamie Bellush, were
discovered unharmed, two of them crawling in their mother's blood.
Jamie Bellush and the children now live in Sussex County, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Blackthorne had terminated his parental rights in July 1997,
Nunley said, after Bellush alleged for a second time that he had
sexually abused one of the girls.
</P>
<P>
   The family court judge at that hearing testified Friday about
the bitter nature of the couple's dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ''From the beginning it was acrimonious, very acrimonious. There
were a lot of past hurts,'' said State District Judge Frank
Montalvo. ''It was obvious that all these folks wanted was to
settle the score.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he was ''shocked'' when Blackthorne asked to
relinquish his parental rights. He said Blackthorne was sobbing,
but did not seem sincere in his grief.
</P>
<P>
   The first abuse accusation against Blackthorne came during a
hearing in June 1993, when Blackthorne sued for increased
visitation rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Fenlon, Bellush's attorney at the time, testified Thursday
that Bellush intended to introduce allegations that Blackthorne
molested one of their two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''We broke for lunch and when we came back, Blackthorne and his
attorney were gone. They had dropped the suit,'' Fenlon testified
under questioning by prosecutor Richard Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross examination, previous court testimony was admitted
into evidence in which Stevie Bellush said her mother lied about
the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the jury heard details from a deposition Bellush
filed in her divorce from Blackthorne, in which she said
Blackthorne twice threatened to kill her and once to disfigure her
face.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony this week, Blackthorne's golfing buddy said
he asked friends to lie on his behalf if police arrested him for
the slaying of the man's ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Rocha, 30, is serving a life prison term in Florida for
solicitation of capital murder in Bellush's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony has linked Blackthorne to Jose Luis Del Toro, the
alleged gunman. Rocha testified he proposed the killing to friend
Sammy Gonzales, who in turn hired his cousin Del Toro in the murder
scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who is serving a 19-year prison sentence in Florida,
also is expected to testify. He pleaded guilty to solicitation of
capital murder and testified against Rocha.
</P>
<P>
   During that trial, Gonzales said Rocha told him the money and
the murder plot came from Blackthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Del Toro, 23, a former high school football star in Uvalde, is
scheduled for trial next month in Florida.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of a new television ads from Hillary Rodham Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An analysis of Senate candidate Hillary Rodham
Clinton's new
television advertisements:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TITLES: ''News Update: HMOs'' and ''News Update: Hate Crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   LENGTH: 15 seconds each.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Team Hillary, the Clinton campaign advertising group
that includes media guru Mandy Grunwald.
</P>
<P>
   AIRING: Statewide starting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   SCRIPTS: ''Update: The Senate just voted to kill the Patients'
Bill of Rights ....by two votes. Hillary supports it. In the House,
Rick Lazio voted against the bill ... siding with the Republican
leadership. Rick Lazio ... the more you know ... the more you
wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Update: The state Senate just passed tougher penalties for
hate crimes. Hillary fought for the bill. Rick Lazio was opposed.
But five days after it passed, he flip-flopped. The Post called it
an ''about face.'' Rick Lazio ... the more you know ... the more
you wonder.''
</P>
<P>
   IMAGES: Both ads feature a typewriter sound in the background as
the words the narrator is reading appear in white letters on a
black screen.
</P>
<P>
   ANALYSIS: The ads echo a new campaign strategy in which Clinton
is trying to portray issues-oriented differences between herself
and Republican Rep. Rick Lazio. She began on Tuesday in Westchester
County, questioning Lazio's commitment to hate crimes laws that
increase penalties in cases where there is gay bias or other forms
of discrimination. She also criticized Lazio for opposing the White
House-backed version of the patients' bill of rights, which would
give patients the right to sue health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has said he voted against the health care bill because he
believes it will benefit lawyers rather than patients. He says he
supports the hate crimes law that passed in the state Senate, but
abstained in 1990 while serving in the Suffolk County Legislature
on a measure calling for a hate crimes law to be enacted in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The tag line ''Rick Lazio ... the more you know ... the more you
wonder,'' seems to be the mantra the campaign will use in its bid
to define the little-known Long Island congressman.

<HEADLINE> Clinton chides Republicans on school construction funds  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - On a hot school playground in Queens, President
Clinton blasted House Republicans for zeroing out his request for
more than $1 billion to renovate the nation's dilapidated schools
and ease overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we think that we're going to build the future of our dreams
by making these kids go to school in places where they don't have
computer labs, they don't have music rooms ... their buildings are
being heated with coal and their teachers are trying to teach 40
kids when they ought to be teaching 20, we're living in a dream
world,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke in front of three temporary classroom trailers
decorated with red-white-and-blue tissue paper flowers and signs
welcoming the president. He implored parents, students and teachers
crowded on the playground to push Congress to appropriate funds and
ask lawmakers: ''Where is the bill? Show me the money.''
</P>
<P>
   The House passed an appropriations bill on Wednesday that left
out the president's request for $1.3 billion in grants and loans to
support an estimated $6.5 billion in repairs and renovations to the
most dilapidated schools.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans fear it would create unnecessary bureaucracy
in Washington. They don't want the federal government to meddle in
local school district affairs, said Becky Campoverde, spokeswoman
for House Education and Workforce Committee Chairman Rep. Bill
Goodling, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's prefers a tax credit plan like one Clinton vetoed last
year, she said, when Congress aimed to lower a school district's
cost of borrowing money for building projects.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton disagrees. ''Some people say 'Let them do it at the
local level,''' he said. ''We've got more kids in school than ever
before, but we've got a smaller percentage of taxpayers and it's
hard, if not impossible, to raise the money to build and repair
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is happier with a Senate measure, which includes $3.1
billion for a block grant program that school districts could use
for school construction and other projects to reduce class size and
train teachers. But he wants a specific program for school
construction because there's no guarantee the money would be used
to fix schools in serious disrepair.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the General Accounting Office, Congress'
investigative arm, said the cost to build new schools and modernize
old ones is at least $112 billion, and more recent estimates say it
will cost much more. A GAO survey of 10,000 schools in 1995 found
one-third needed extensive repair or replacement of one or more
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our English language learners are taught in the hall,'' said
Mary Minnick, who began teaching at Abigail Adams when Lyndon
Johnson was president. ''Our science teachers are bag ladies,
carrying their wares from room to room.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton visited a public elementary school
in East Harlem, where he spoke on NBC's ''Today'' show to support
the ''Save the Music'' program. Time Warner Cable and the VHI Save
The Music Foundation began it in 1997 to support music education in
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a saxophone player in his high school band, said music
programs are often the first to go when budgets are cut. In its
first year, the program collected more than $1 million in
instruments for music education in New York City. The program is
working to expand to 40 communities in 23 states, the District of
Columbia and Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Clinton was to speak at an evening fund raiser for
Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y.

<HEADLINE> Union opposes psychiatric hospital takeover plan  </HEADLINE>
By DIANE SCARPONI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Labor unions, upset over the
consolidation of the Yale Psychiatric Institute into the
university's hospital, are accusing a state official of improperly
changing the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling by the Office of Health Care Access means the hospital
will close 11 beds for adult psychiatric patients at a time when
demand for psychiatric services is surging, the Federation of
Hospital and University Employees claims.
</P>
<P>
   Yale-New Haven Hospital, which is taking over the university-run
psychiatric institute, maintains that beds are not closing and
services will improve under the merger.
</P>
<P>
   The union claims that Health Care Access Commissioner Raymond
Gorman had improper communication with Yale that led to a revision
of the terms of the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The union has filed a formal complaint with the agency, seeking
to reopen the process that led to Gorman's decision. They have
asked Gorman to recuse himself from the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman stood by his ruling Friday and said he did nothing
improper in clarifying his order at Yale-New Haven Hospital's
request. The union is not a formal party to the proceeding, so they
did not have to be in on the talks, Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorman also said he was skeptical of the hospital's plans
and would monitor carefully to see if more beds are needed for
psychiatric patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an extraordinary crisis in behavioral health right
now,'' Gorman said. ''The last thing I want to do is eliminate beds
unless I'm absolutely sure an appropriate mechanism has been put
in.''
</P>
<P>
   The union maintains Gorman's clarification fundamentally changed
the terms of the deal, said Mark Herz, a psychiatric assistant at
Yale Psychiatric Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's trying to sing two tunes at once out of one mouth,'' Herz
said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the number of beds available in New Haven for adult
psychiatric patients, and how and where they should be treated.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Yale Psychiatric Institute and Yale-New Haven
Hospital have 92 licensed psychiatric beds.
</P>
<P>
   Yale Psychiatric Institute is licensed for 66 beds, but on a
daily basis it houses an average of 55 patients, leaving an average
of 11 vacant beds. Yale-New Haven Hospital has 26 psychiatric beds
and houses 24 psychiatric patients on an average day.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital maintains the combined entity can provide good
services with 76 beds, because it also plans to increase day
treatment and outpatient treatment services for psychiatric
patients who would be better off at home than in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Gorman's ruling required the hospital to operate with 81 beds,
until it could prove that it could operate with only 76.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very skeptical that they can do with 76 beds what has
historically taken 81 to 84,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Office of Health Care Access plans to review the situation
in September to see how many beds are needed. If the hospital wants
to go below 81 beds, the agency will hold more public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   The union, however, maintains the ruling cuts out the 11 beds
that are currently licensed but not always used at Yale Psychiatric
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Herz pointed out that 55 is an average number of patients -
sometimes there are less and sometimes there are more.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 66 licensed beds, and we accommodate that many people
sometimes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital spokeswoman Katie Krouss said the Yale Psychiatric
Institute rarely had more than 55 patients at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're comfortable the level and quality and amount of care
we're providing will meet the needs of the New Haven population,''
Krouss said.
</P>
<P>
   The union, which represents clerical workers and aides, also is
upset that its members could lose their jobs to workers from the
hospital, who are not unionized.
</P>
<P>
   Krouss said Yale Psychiatric Institute workers can apply for
jobs with the expanded day treatment programs. Neither the day
programs or the combined facility, to be called Yale-New Haven
Psychiatric Services, will be unionized, she said.

<HEADLINE> Canada Boat Sinks, 2 Kids Missing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOBERMORY, Ontario (AP) -- Rescuers searched the cold, choppy
waters of Georgian Bay on Friday for two seventh-grade students
missing after a tour boat sank during a school outing.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-foot True North II went down near Flowerpot Island, a
popular tourist destination on the bay of Lake Huron, police and
Coast Guard officials said. A Coast Guard vessel rescued 15
students, two teachers and the boat's captain clinging to a large
life raft.
</P>
<P>
   After more than five hours, though, two of the students were
still missing in the 50-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously hypothermia is a major concern,'' said Coast Guard
spokesman Lawrence Swift. Five ships from the Coast Guard and Parks
Canada were searching the waters, aided by a helicopter and private
boaters who volunteered to help, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The True North II sank in rough water about 200 feet deep,
according to Parks Canada spokesman Ross Thomson. The rescued
children were taken to a nearby medical center, where some were
treated for mild hypothermia, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shipwrecks are a major attraction at Flowerpot Island, with tour
operators taking visitors in glass-bottom boats to look at them.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear where exactly the missing students were from.
They go to a secondary school in Tiverton, Ontario, which is
attended by children from rural towns throughout the region, 110
miles west of Toronto.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Woos Germany  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Unlike their predecessors, these German and
Russian leaders didn't need to sweat together in a sauna to bond.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping their shirts on, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder and
President Vladimir Putin said Friday their first summit was
nevertheless ''very friendly'' and should bolster economic and
political ties.
</P>
<P>
   After recent tension over NATO's war with Yugoslavia and the
Russian campaign in Chechnya, Putin's aim was to rekindle a sense
of closeness to Moscow's key ally. He urged Germany to help tear
down an ''invisible barrier'' still separating Russia and Europe
after the fall of the Iron Curtain a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''Germany was and remains our leading partner in Europe and also
in the world,'' he said at a closing news conference, where both
leaders oversaw the signing of billions of dollars in oil and gas
deals as the two-day summit wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit to the German capital, Putin often broke into
the German he once used as a KGB spy in communist East Germany, and
even joked with Schroeder on the podium as the business deals were
being signed.
</P>
<P>
   With such friendly moments, both leaders seemed intent on
signaling that they can build a pragmatic but personal relationship
even if it doesn't approach the apparent warmth between former
leaders Helmut Kohl and Boris Yeltsin, whose diplomacy included
sitting bare-chested in a Russian sauna.
</P>
<P>
   ''We weren't, if I may say, in the sauna,'' joked Schroeder,
adding that he didn't even have one at his Berlin villa. Still, he
said he planned a private visit to Moscow around Christmas with his
wife to meet Putin's family.
</P>
<P>
   While in Germany, a hard-nosed Putin also played skillfully on
common European and Russian reservations about U.S. plans for a
national missile defense, steered clear of detailed plans for
economic reforms and faced little criticism over Russia's war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putin wanted to work on his image as a friend of Germany. He
wanted to break the ice,'' said Alexander Rahr, a Russia expert at
the German Council on Foreign Relations. ''He got a lot out of this
summit, also for his standing in Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   But Putin failed to win debt relief from Germany, Europe's
richest nation and Russia's main creditor. Germany, however, moved
closer to implementing its part of an $8.1 billion debt
restructuring plan between Western governments and Russia after the
two countries resolved a dispute over loan guarantees that Germany
provides to companies that do business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is Russia's top Western trading partner and was its
biggest financial backer in the 1990s, supporting the
transformation from communism with $67 billion in loans, grants,
credits and other guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's debt is a result of massive German aid pumped in under
Kohl as thanks for Moscow's support for German unification after
the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1990. But Schroeder insisted that
while historic times may require emotional friendships between
leaders, German-Russian ties were too important to depend alone on
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The summit also produced important agreements, with Russia's
state-controlled Gazprom signing several agreements with German
firms. Among those was a partnership with Wintershall to jointly
develop an offshore oil field in Russia's arctic north.
Wintershall, a unit of BASF, will invest more than $1 billion in
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, culture ministers of the two sides pledged to make a
new push to return ''trophy art'' looted by both Soviet and Nazi
troops during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, Putin laid a wreath at the Soviet war memorial
in former East Berlin -- a towering statue of a Red Army soldier
holding a child in one hand and a sword smashing a swastika in the
other -- honoring the thousands of soldiers buried there.
</P>
<P>
   The statue in Treptow Park, surrounded by stones from Hitler's
smashed chancellery engraved with hammers and sickles and quotes
from Stalin, is one of three Soviet memorials in Berlin that Kohl
promised Germany would keep up after the last Soviet troops pulled
out.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Putin arrived in Moldova and began a first-round
of talks on the former Soviet republic's debt and the continued
presences of federal troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's 15-hour visit -- his first to a former Soviet republic
since becoming president-- was expected to help resolve the issue of
Trans-Dniester, a region of eastern Moldova whose Russian- and
Ukranian-speaking populations declared independence in 1990 fearing
the Romanian-speaking leadership would reunite with neighboring
Romania.
</P>
<P>
   Moldova was part of Romania until 1940, when was annexed by
Josef Stalin's Soviet Union. About two-thirds of the population is
ethnic Romanian. Advertisements and restaurant menus are often in
Romanian and Russian.

<HEADLINE> Civil rights finding against NYPD hailed by police critics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Civil rights activists and police critics
applauded a federal commission's finding Friday that the New York
Police Department uses racial profiling, saying it gives them
ammunition to push for outside oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ''It confirms what many of us have been saying all along - that
racial discrimination by cops is reality for people of color in
this city,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the department's ''stop and frisk'' tactics, the
report found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped far out of
proportion to their representation in a given community.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton - the organizer of countless protests accusing police
of singling out minorities for abuse - predicted the U.S.
Commission on Civil Right's recommendation for independent
prosecutors and monitors to handle disciplinary cases and civilian
complaints would pave the way for federal oversight of the nation's
largest police force.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a separate ongoing investigation by Brooklyn U.S.
Attorney Loretta Lynch into whether the NYPD fosters abuse of
minorities through lax discipline of officers who use excessive
force. The investigation was launched in 1997 after white patrolmen
were charged with torturing a black prisoner, Abner Louima, with a
broken broomstick in a precinct bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The city and Lynch's office have been negotiating over possible
reforms - a process aimed at avoiding a federal lawsuit against the
department.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton criticized Lynch on Friday for ''moving way too slow.''
One of Louima's attorneys in his $155 million lawsuit against the
city agreed.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Sanford Rubenstein, noted Louima himself went
before the commission to call for stricter discipline of wayward
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we have an official commission saying there is a problem
in New York,'' the lawyer said. ''Clearly, it's clearly time for
the federal government to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Lynch, William Muller, refused comment.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, meanwhile, continued to insist that the
commission's criticisms are inaccurate and overblown, and that the
department is capable of policing itself.
</P>
<P>
   Wielding a 700-page rebuttal to a draft of the report last
month, Police Commissioner Howard Safir insisted the NYPD does not
engage in racial profiling. He argued that the ethnic breakdown of
those stopped and frisked corresponds closely to the ethnic
breakdown of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing remarks by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Safir called the
final draft released Friday ''shoddy.'' He said the commission
should have incorporated his data to balance its report.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, they obviously are too lazy or not skilled enough to
do so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York Civil Liberties Union president Norman Siegel called on
city officials to ''stop the denials and stop minimizing the
problem of police conduct and failed community relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, Siegel said, ''told it like it is. It appears to
document the painful reality that there are serious problems with
enormous racial overtones. Hopefully, it will be a catalyst for
change.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Briefed on Korean Summit  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- During the historic Korean summit this week,
South Korea's president stressed to North Korea that development of
a nuclear weapons or missile program would be contrary to the
reconciliation the two nations agreed to seek, a senior Clinton
administration official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Kim Dae-jung did bring up the concern about the
possibility or the threat of development of either nuclear or
missile programs and stressed that he thought that they were
destabilizing,'' the official said in recounting what President
Clinton was told in a 25-minute meeting in New York with Hwang
Won-Tak, a senior South Korean security official.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department said Clinton's plan to ease sanctions
against North Korea, announced last September, will take effect
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher withheld comment on timing of the
announcement, but it appeared to be an effort to build on the
momentum generated by the Pyongyang summit.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced the relaxation of sanctions last September in
exchange for a North Korean pledge not to test a long-range missile
capable of reaching U.S. territory.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will permit North Korea to export raw materials and
goods to the United States and will open air and shipping routes
between the two countries. For 50 years, virtually all U.S. trade
and financial transactions with North Korea have been banned.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Washington, Senate Foreign Relations Committee
Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said he was encouraged by the new
overtures although it was ''too early to tell'' whether the status
of the 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's a temporary lull, we'll have to leave the people there
for a while. But if it's for real...then we ought to make plans to
bring those folks home,'' Helms told CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The administration official who briefed reporters in New York
said the South Korean leader told North Korea's Kim Jong Il that if
he was interested in reconciliation and eventual reunification of
the Korean Peninsula, his nation must stay away from nuclear or
missile programs ''because that was contrary to the general
atmosphere that the two were trying to create with the summit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the summit, Kim Dae-jung disclosed that he and Kim Jong Il
had discussed sensitive security issues, including the 37,000 U.S.
soldiers stationed in the South and the North's nuclear and missile
programs. He did not describe in detail what they talked about,
however, saying only that the talks were frank and productive.
</P>
<P>
   At the summit, which ended Wednesday, North and South Korea
signed an accord promising to work for eventual reunification and
pledging to allow separated families to meet. The pact also calls
for South Korean investment in impoverished North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ''The impression was that there were not a lot of specifics that
were discussed there, but that they did agree to further talks at
the ministerial level to flesh out how to implement that
cooperation,'' the administration official said. ''And they also
talked about how President Kim Jong Il agreed to make a visit to
Seoul, although no specific time was established on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a phone call to Clinton Thursday night, the South Korean
leader said that he was well received by the North Koreans. That
message was reiterated in New York by Hwang, who said South Korea
viewed the summit as the ''beginning of an opening up,'' the
administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president said he found the account fascinating,'' he
said. ''He found it on balance to be hopeful and agreed that it was
important that the United States and South Korea, along with Japan
and our other friends, consult closely on next steps.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli Army Defends BBC Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An Israeli tank that fired at and killed a
Lebanese driver working for the British Broadcasting Corp. in south
Lebanon last month acted according to accepted procedure, the army
spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC expressed dismay over the army announcement, insisting
that troops along the Israeli-Lebanese border were ''recklessly
targeting civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Abed Takoush, 50, died instantly when the car he was driving
just north of the border was hit by a tank shell May 23, the day
before Israeli troops completed a withdrawal from a self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The army said soldiers in the area had been under fire and
believed Takoush's vehicle carried anti-Israeli guerrillas who
intended to attack them.
</P>
<P>
   ''In retrospect it became clear that a tragic mistake was
made,'' the army said. ''An investigation found that, according to
the operational conditions ... the unit acted appropriately in
accordance with the circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The tank commanders had checked with their supervisors, who
approved the decision to fire on the vehicle, the army said,
expressing ''deep sorrow'' over the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The BBC said in a statement it was ''deeply dissatisfied'' with
the outcome of the army investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe the report does not address the overwhelming
evidence that ... the army was recklessly targeting civilians,''
said the head of news gathering, Adrian Van Klaveren.
</P>
<P>
   Video and witness accounts prove no guerrillas were firing in
the area at the time, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Accused rapist might be barred from school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOSHEN, N.Y. (AP) - An Orange County Court judge has signed
orders of protection that could bar a student accused of rape from
attending high school in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   James Cox pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges he raped two
girls, ages 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old girl attends Marlboro High School with Cox. She
already has an order of protection in the town of Newburgh but that
does not bar Cox from attending school with the girl.
</P>
<P>
   The order signed Thursday includes school grounds but the judge
said Cox, 17, can attend school next week for the one final exam he
has left. He also said Cox's lawyer could challenge the school
provision of the protection order.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Joseph, Cox's lawyer, said the charges are as yet unproved
and argued the student has the right to a public education.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Kelle Grimmer said Cox has tried to
intimidate the girl at school and on one occasion the girl fainted
due to his presence in school.
</P>
<P>
   Goshen is 50 miles north of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Charley Pride Named to Country Hall  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Charley Pride, whose first three singles
were released without a photograph in order to conceal his race,
has become the first black to be voted into the Country Music Hall
of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ''In our culture we're just ate up with what I call skin
hang-ups,'' the 62-year-old singer said Friday. ''I'm glad I'm in
the Hall of Fame. I'm glad I'm right next to people that I love --
Ernest Tubb, Marty Robbins, the whole bit. I don't care if they're
pink''
</P>
<P>
   Faron Young, a honky-tonk singing great, will also be inducted
during the Country Music Association Awards on Oct. 4. He shot
himself to death in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two singers will become the 73rd and 74th members of the
Country Music Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame members are selected by about 350 members of the
Country Music Association with more than 10 years of experience in
the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Pride was born in Sledge, Miss., the son of a cotton
sharecropper. He played baseball in the Negro American League,
served in the Army and unsuccessfully tried out for the California
Angels before starting a music career.
</P>
<P>
   Signed by legendary producer Chet Atkins to RCA Records in 1965,
Pride had his first hit single with ''Just Between You and Me'' in
1967. He followed with a string of hits stretching into the late
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a native of Shreveport, La., had a long list of hits from
1953 to the late 1970s. His first hit was ''Goin' Steady.''

<HEADLINE> Millville hospital closing in South Jersey Health consolidation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILLVILLE, N.J. (AP) - South Jersey Health System is closing its
Millville hospital as part of a consolidation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, which posted operating losses of $3 million last
year, will close its doors by year's end. South Jersey Health
System officials plan to sell the building to Filmore Street LLC.,
a developer of senior citizen housing.
</P>
<P>
   The closing is part of the company's plan to consolidate its
three Cumberland County hospitals - in Millville, Bridgeton and
Vineland - into one new hospital to be built in Vineland.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation will save $3 million annually, according to
Chester B. Kaletkowski, president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ''The savings will come from streamlining operations and
consolidating services,'' Kaletkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Like other New Jersey hospitals, the Millville hospital has been
struggling, according to Kerry McKean Kelly, spokeswoman for the
New Jersey Hospital Association, in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hospitals are under fire to become more efficient, with
managed care dictating shorter hospital stays, federal Medicare
cuts, the expense of caring for the uninsured and the state's
shortfall in reimbursing for charity care,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Meet Croatian Pres.  </HEADLINE>
By EUGENE BRCIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- A delegation of Chinese leaders opened
talks with the Croatian president and other top officials Friday
aimed at expanding trade and economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   About 120 business officials accompanied Li Peng -- president of
the Chinese parliament and the second most influential figure in
the Chinese Communist Party -- in his five-day visit to Croatia. The
trip is part of larger Eastern European tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Croatia and China have good bilateral relations, but it is
necessary to further develop economic links,'' Croatian President
Stipe Mesic's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia was particularly interested in cooperation in the
pharmaceutical, tourism and maritime industries, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Li said China would be looking at ways to expand trade with
Croatia, and said the former Yugoslav republic could expect Chinese
support for its aspirations toward joining mainstream Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike in neighboring Slovenia, where Li's visit earlier was
clouded by protests against China's human rights policy, the
meetings in Croatia went by without controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a few small articles in local newspapers, the only
real protest came from Croatia's Amnesty International office.
''Such talks must be a chance to improve human rights in any
country,'' Amnesty said in a statement. ''There are no
'untouchable' countries when it comes to human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   In Slovenia, about 50 human rights activists demonstrated
outside the Slovenian parliament against China's suppression of
dissent in Tibet and other human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   Li canceled a meeting with Slovene Prime Minister Andrej Bajuk,
apparently because the Slovene Cabinet includes the head of a local
pro-Taiwan group. Taiwan and China split in 1949 after the
Communists seized power on the mainland, and China considers Taiwan
a renegade province.
</P>
<P>
   Li's delegation was expected to visit the southern resort town
of Dubrovnik this weekend, and then to travel to Slovakia,
Azerbaijan and Ukraine.

<HEADLINE> Judge awards Ronettes $2.6 million in lawsuit against Phil Spector  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan judge Friday awarded the Ronettes, a
1960s girl group, $2.6 million in royalties and interest that
members should have received for recordings made for ''boy genius''
producer Phil Spector.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Paula Omansky found that Spector,
who kept the rights to all Ronettes recordings, made millions of
dollars in ways not authorized by his 1963 contract, while paying
the three women nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes received one payment of $14,482.30 - as a group -
for their work under the five-year contract, Omansky said. One of
the women testified that this was the only money they ever received
from Spector.
</P>
<P>
   In her 24-page decision, the judge said ''Defendants (Spector
and his company) acted in complete disregard of plaintiffs'
(Ronettes') rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Omansky said the contract covers only royalties on sales of
phonograph records, but Spector sold the recordings for use as
background music in movies, videocassette recordings, and
advertising. For example, ''Be My Baby'' was used with the opening
credits of the movie ''Dirty Dancing.''
</P>
<P>
   Omansky said the contract does not say he can do this, but if he
does, he must give the singers 50 percent of the money. Experts
testified at trial in 1998 that half was the current ''custom and
practice'' for sharing that income.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the judge said, Spector licensed without authority
the group's master recordings to third parties for re-recording -
in ''oldies'' compilations, for example, that also featured other
artists.
</P>
<P>
   Spector relied on contract language which said all recordings
under the contract ''shall be entirely our property, free of any
claims whatsoever by you or any persons deriving any rights of
interest from you.''
</P>
<P>
   But Omansky said an appeals court rejected a similar stance in
another case. She said the court found that the language should be
read to exclude, rather than authorize, uses other than those
stated in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   When Spector discovered the group in 1963, it included two
teen-aged sisters, Veronica and Estelle Bennett, and their
20-year-old cousin, Nedra Talley. On May 6, 1963, Spector and the
group signed a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes recorded 28 songs for Spector's Phillies Records
between 1963 and 1967. Their recording of ''Be My Baby'' hit No. 1
on Billboard magazine's pop music charts, and they had some lesser
successes.
</P>
<P>
   The women sued Spector 13 years ago, saying he had cheated them,
and the case went to trial before Omansky in Manhattan's State
Supreme Court in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica ''Ronnie'' Bennett Greenfield, for whom the group was
named, issued a statement Friday. ''I am so glad it's finally
over,'' the statement read by husband Jonathan Greenfield said.
''Maybe now I can get back to doing what I love - making records
and performing.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I worked very hard making those records in the '60s,'' her
statement went on. ''I didn't know I'd have to wait 37 years to get
paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nedra Talley Ross, who lives in Virginia Beach, Va., and owns an
import-export business, said, ''It's been a long time coming.
Justice is what we wanted, and I think we got justice. God is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ronettes' lawyer, Alexander Peltz, said the decision is
important because it is ''the first strong New York decision which
recognizes current custom and practice in revenue sharing, and acts
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peltz said he expects Spector to appeal. Spector's lawyer,
Andrew Bart, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Omansky said the women are entitled to one half of $3.35 million
that Spector got from commercial uses that were not covered by the
contract, plus $925,907 in interest, for a total of about $2.6
million.

<HEADLINE> UN: Progress On Global Warming Plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN, Germany (AP) -- About 150 countries negotiating a treaty to
reduce emissions of carbon dioxide and other global-warming gasses
made progress but no breakthroughs in resolving technical and
political differences, a U.N. official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The weeklong talks in Bonn and another round Sept. 11-15 in
Lyon, France, are intended to set the stage for signing a global
political deal in The Hague, Netherlands, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations are ''moving from detailed technical matters to
core political issues,'' said Michael Zammit Cutajar, executive
secretary of the U.N. climate convention.
</P>
<P>
   But there was ''still a great deal of work to do,'' he said in a
statement. ''Political leaders worldwide now need to get fully
involved'' if a political accord is to be ready for signing at the
November conference.
</P>
<P>
   A protocol for reducing greenhouse gases worldwide was adopted
in Kyoto, Japan, in 1997, but has not yet entered into force. Most
governments were holding off on ratification until agreement was
reached on how it would actually work.
</P>
<P>
   Countries have already agreed on some issues, such as guidelines
for measuring so-called greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining differences include whether there should be
restrictions on countries that want to achieve reduction targets by
buying ''emissions credits'' from other countries, or by paying for
cleaner technologies in the developing world, instead of pushing
through energy-saving measures at home.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union wants to limit such trading to 50 percent of
a country's reduction target to ensure that rich countries make
significant cleanup efforts. The United States, where emissions are
rising, rejects limits.
</P>
<P>
   Zammit Cutajar said agreement at The Hague should lead many
countries to ratify the protocol and bring it into force by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty sets a target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions
from industrialized countries by 5 percent between 2008 and 2112,
compared to 1990 levels.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Court Arraigns Pope Gunman  </HEADLINE>
By SELCAN HACAOGLU
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The gunman who shot Pope John Paul II
loudly proclaimed during an unrelated hearing Friday that he was
innocent in the killing of a Turkish newspaper editor who was
investigating right-wing extremists.
</P>
<P>
   Mehmet Ali Agca, who has already been convicted in absentia of
the editor's death, was being arraigned Friday on separate charges
of armed robbery and car theft.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Italy pardoned Agca for the 1981 attempt on
the pope, and extradited him to Turkey to serve a 10-year prison
term for killing the editor, Abdi Ipekci.
</P>
<P>
   Agca -- who belonged to a gang of rightist extremists -- was in
court Friday in yet a third case focusing on a 1979 armed robbery
of a soft drink factory and the theft of a car used in the getaway.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not Ipekci's murderer!'' Agca shouted. ''This is a fairy
tale, and I was an actor in the scenario!''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Turkey believe Ipekci was targeted by rightist gangs,
which later helped Agca escape from a military prison during his
murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I were guilty, I would have opposed my extradition,'' Agca
said. ''I came to Turkey because this is all a fairy tale and my
conscience is clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Agca was soaked in sweat in the sweltering courtroom, his blue
shirt hanging loosely over his jeans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been so many accusations against me,'' he said.
''These represent just the first floor of a 100-story skyscraper.''
</P>
<P>
   Ipekci had been investigating Turkish criminal gangs and writing
columns critical of nationalists when he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit welcomed Agca's extradition
as an opportunity to shed more light on the assassination. The
identity of a second gunman is a mystery, and it is unclear who
exactly helped Agca escape from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's arraignment could be the first of many court
appearances for Agca, who faces charges in at least two other
crimes that took place before he shot the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Nusret Ince set a July 10 trial date on charges of
stealing $4,500 from a soda factory and a getaway car in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The additional crimes include the killing of a left-wing student
and the armed robbery a jewelry shop.
</P>
<P>
   Ince said the jewelry shop case would be combined with the
factory robbery. Agca could face an additional 9{ years in a
Turkish prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Italy pardoned Agca earlier this week after he'd served almost
20 years for the pope shooting. Agca said at first that he had
acted alone in the attack in St. Peter's Square, and then claimed
the Bulgarian secret service and the KGB were behind the
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Agca confessed to killing Ipekci, but later retracted
his statements. He was sentenced to death in absentia but the
sentence was later reduced to 10 years in prison. He served 158
days of the sentence before escaping.
</P>
<P>
   Security at the courthouse was extremely tight Friday.
Sharpshooters stood watch from rooftops, and armored personnel
carriers patrolled the streets hours before Agca was due to appear.
Police searched the courthouse after a bomb threat, but found no
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   They also detained three members of a leftist party
demonstrating outside the courthouse with banners asking: ''Who do
the secret hands belong to?''

<HEADLINE> Turkish Court Sentences Extremists  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A Turkish court on Friday handed death
sentences to 33 people convicted of seeking to impose Islamic rule
in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The charges stem from a 1993 arson attack that killed 37
left-wing intellectuals at a hotel in the central city of Sivas.
The group had gathered to commemorate a 16th-century poet hanged
for opposing religious oppression.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers barred firefighters from the scene and chanted
slogans associated with Islamic extremism as the hotel burned.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second trial for the accused, ordered after an
appeals court determined that the defendants' identities had not
been sufficiently documented.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is officially secular, although predominantly Muslim. It
has not carried out an execution since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Down 266; Nasdaq Up 15  </HEADLINE>
By EILEEN GLANTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks fell steeply Friday after Xerox
and a regional banking company issued profit warnings that
resonated throughout the market. The Dow Jones industrial average
sustained its biggest selloff in two months amid fears that rising
interest rates will take a toll on corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were a lone source of strength, helping the
Nasdaq finish with modest gains.
</P>
<P>
   Driven down by financial components including American Express
and J.P. Morgan, the Dow plunged 265.52 points, or 2.5 percent, to
close at 10,449.30. It was the Dow's worst performance since its
stunning 617-point drop on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decline left the Dow with a loss of 164.76 points for
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators held up much better than the blue-chip
Dow. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 14.27 to close at
1,464.46, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 14.82 to 3,860.56.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks pulled the market lower Friday after
UnionBanCal Corp., a bank holding company based in San Francisco,
lowered its second-quarter earnings projection, sending its stock
down $8.75 to $19.938.
</P>
<P>
   The warning from UnionBanCal came a day after Wachovia, a North
Carolina banking company, delivered similar bad news. Both banks
have begun setting aside additional money to cover bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   A recent research note from analysts at Credit Suisse First
Boston raised the possibility that many other banks will follow,
depressing the entire sector. Mellon fell $3.063 to $33.938 and
Bank of America dropped $5.563 to $46.50.
</P>
<P>
   Larger banks and brokerages also tumbled. J.P. Morgan fell
$8.375 to $118.125, contributing most to the Dow's decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not a great fundamental reason for the whole sector to
be down so much,'' said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at
Jefferies &AMP; Co. ''But it's a momentum-driven sector, and some
people obviously feel that profits are going to come under
pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   An additional sign that profits are being threatened came from
Xerox Corp., which fell $4.75 to $20.563 after the office machine
maker said its second-quarter earnings would miss Wall Street
analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case all week, stocks were being pulled in
different directions Friday. Technology stocks showed some
scattered strength. Qualcomm was up $4.313 to $65.75, bouncing
higher after two days of steep losses.
</P>
<P>
   And semiconductor company Rambus soared $25.50 to $82.188 after
signing a licensing deal with Japanese consumer electronics company
Toshiba Corp. The deal will boost Rambus's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Something to take heart in is that the Nasdaq is hanging in
there even after it's risen substantially in the past two weeks,''
Hogan said. ''That's a testament to improving sentiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said many investors are still waiting to see whether
the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at its June 28
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not in a dramatic upturn that we saw earlier this year
or the slump that happened last month. We are just kind of
paralyzed,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Prudential
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Investors mostly shrugged off a report from the Commerce
Department showing housing construction fell 3.9 percent in May, to
its lowest level in nearly a year and weaker than analysts'
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggested that rising mortgage rates are cutting into
demand. That's a direct result of the Fed's six inflation-fighting
rate increases over the last year.
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of analysts believe the Fed will leave interest
rates unchanged when its meets June 27 and 28. But the view is not
unanimous and some analysts say the Fed may still feel that more
needs to be done to make sure inflation is not revived.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.43
billion shares, compared with 1.12 billion shares on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called ''triple-witching'' day -- marking the quarterly
expiration of stock and index options and index futures contracts --
contributed to the higher volume.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 1.49 at 513.74.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.1 percent.
Germany's DAX index fell 2.7 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.5
percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 0.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> US Defends No-Fly Zones Air Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department expressed regret Friday
over civilian deaths in Iraq from U.S. and British air strikes but
said the flights in the ''no-fly zones'' have prevented Iraq from
threatening citizens in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher commented in response to a report
Friday in The Washington Post that outlined the toll the air
strikes have taken on the civilian populations of these regions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and allied countries barred Iraqi planes from
flying in a large area of northern Iraq in 1991 and set up a
similar zone in southern Iraq in 1992. The people in these areas
had risen against the rule of President Saddam Hussein after his
forces were defeated by a U.S.-led international coalition in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The enforcement action has taken a violent turn since December
1998, when Saddam's order that his anti-aircraft batteries fire on
intruding aircraft prompted retaliatory strikes.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Iraq's air defense command told the Post that
about 300 Iraqi civilians have been killed and 800 wounded in the
strikes. The Post quoted a U.N. survey that documented some of the
Iraqi claims and accepted Iraqi reports on others.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said some Iraqi anti-aircraft equipment was built near
towns and villages to increase the possibility of civilian
casualties during retaliatory strikes. On the other hand, the
newspaper said, air strikes also occurred in vast open fields with
no anti-aircraft facilities in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said the allied aircraft act in response to Iraqi
threats.
</P>
<P>
   ''They never target civilians or civilian facilities,'' he said.
''If Iraq would stop targeting these aircraft that are carrying out
a humanitarian mission of protection, there would be no need for
pilots to respond in self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ''Since the no-flight zones were established, they
have succeeded in preventing the Iraqi regime from using air power
to threaten citizens in the south and the north, as they have done
in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under this protection, and with U.N. supervision in the
region, Iraqi citizens in the north live been in far better
conditions than Iraqis who live under the rule of Saddam Hussein.''

<HEADLINE> Corzine has 10-point lead in early Senate poll  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY PARELLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - In the first poll since the U.S. Senate
primary elections, more New Jersey voters said they would support
Democratic nominee Jon Corzine, but voters still have plenty to
learn about both Corzine and Republican Bob Franks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Neither candidate is well known by the New Jersey electorate,
which means there is a lot of potential for movement before the
election,'' Cliff Zukin, a Rutgers professor and director of the
Star-Ledger/Eagleton-Rutgers Poll, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we're trying to do with this survey is to say here's where
the candidates are at the beginning of the election,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the starting gate, Franks is behind.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine leads the congressman from Union County, 43 percent to
33 percent, according to the telephone survey of 618 registered
voters conducted June 8-13.
</P>
<P>
   Among those most likely to vote, Corzine's lead is only 7
percentage points, within the poll's margin of error of plus or
minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   And, there's still plenty of room for movement.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of respondents said they might change their
mind between now and November, and only 23 percent said they were
''very sure'' about Corzine, compared with 19 percent for Franks.
</P>
<P>
   The poll suggests that Corzine's unprecedented $34 million
primary spending blitz won him the name recognition the former
Goldman Sachs chairman was seeking. In comparison, Franks spent
$1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Franks' campaign said the first poll is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is surprising that, given the fact that Corzine outspent
Franks 20 to 1, that we're only 7 points behind,'' said Charlie
Smith, Franks' campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jon Corzine just finished spending $34 million and has failed
to reach 50 percent on the ballot test,'' Smith added. ''I think it
demonstrates there's a significant amount of concern among
independents and Republicans regarding Jon Corzine.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's campaign discounted the poll.
</P>
<P>
   ''A poll taken this early in the general election campaign is
largely irrelevant,'' said Steven Goldstein, Corzine's former
campaign manager who is now acting as a consultant to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously we're happy that Jon has a lead and we're confident
that Jon's lead has the potential for significant growth as he
talks about fiscal responsibility throughout the fall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of those polled said they knew ''a lot'' or ''some''
about Corzine. Only 44 percent had no opinion of him - an unusually
low number for this early in a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, 72 percent knew ''little'' or ''nothing'' about
Franks.
</P>
<P>
   That indicates the power of Corzine's television ads. By
contrast, Franks, who has represented New Jersey in congress for
nearly eight years, has gotten little media attention in a state
with no network TV station that consistently covers state news.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sad, but that's where people get their information,''
said Zukin. ''(Corzine) put on 3,700 spots. It's remarkable. It
sure produces weird dynamics in the state and how it makes
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll also indicated more negative sentiment about Corzine,
with 20 percent saying they had an unfavorable opinion of him. Only
6 percent said they didn't like Franks.
</P>
<P>
   That could help Franks, Zukin said, as long as he's able to
raise enough money to get out his moderate message and contrast it
with Corzine's more liberal one.
</P>
<P>
   ''Franks doesn't have to spend as much as Corzine, but he has to
raise enough money - at least $12 (million) to $15 million - to get
clear messages out to voters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to criticisms that Corzine is spending too much, he
recently announced he is reducing his staff by 51 workers, leaving
17 full-time employees. That will cut his monthly staff payroll
from about $1.1 million to $164,000.
</P>
<P>
   It's still not known how much money the multimillionaire plans
to spend in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine handily defeated former Gov. Jim Florio in the
Democratic primary. Franks emerged from a four-way Republican race
by a slim margin over state Sen. William Gormley. Corzine and
Franks are seeking the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Democrat
Frank Lautenberg, who will retire at the end of his term.

   The bodies of Norris and Nancy Price, 67 and 62 respectively,

<HEADLINE> Activists put Regis Philbin clothing line on the line  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - First it was Kathie Lee and sweatshops. And now
Regis?
</P>
<P>
   Labor activists on Friday put Regis Philbin's new clothing line
on the line - by charging that the ''Who Wants to be a
Millionaire'' host has put his name on shirts made by a company
with a history of production at abusive foreign factories.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin, who also co-hosts a television show with Kathie Lee
Gifford, appeared at Macy's earlier this week to introduce a shirt
and tie line called ''Regis by the Van Heusen Company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, members of the UNITE garment workers' union walked
into Macy's blowing whistles and handing out leaflets that read:
''Sweatshops for Father's Day? Shame!'' - near a display of the
$77.50 cotton shirt and satin tie ensembles that have become
Philbin's trademark attire.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're giving him a chance not to put his name on clothing made
by a company with ties to labor abuses,'' said UNITE spokeswoman
Jo-Ann Mort, adding that Philbin needs to ensure that the new line
of Regis ensembles are not made under sweatshop conditions.
</P>
<P>
   A call to the Phillips-Van Heusen offices in New York was not
immediately answered on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips-Van Heusen produces many of their clothes in overseas
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the New York-based manufacturer was named in a
class-action lawsuit claiming that workers on the Pacific island of
Saipan manufactured clothes under sweatshop conditions. The
company, and other garment makers, promised to establish a fund to
finance an independent monitoring program and provide money to the
workers.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1998, Phillips-Van Heusen closed a plant in Guatemala
after workers won a years-long struggle for a new union contract.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin's television partner, Gifford, has for years faced
charges that her clothing line was produced in sweatshops. While
the criticism persisted, she hired monitors and joined a national
task force that acts as a watchdog for labor conditions.

<HEADLINE> Witness pleads for mercy for convicted killer in boy witness case  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) - A jury deciding whether Russell Peeler
should get the death penalty for the murders of an 8-year-old boy
witness and his mother began deliberations on Friday but did not
reach a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Peeler, 28, was convicted last week in the 1999 slayings of
Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke. The same
jury must now decide if Peeler gets life in prison or the death by
lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The jury began considering the case at about 2:30 p.m. after
receiving instruction on the law from Judge G. Sarsfield Ford. The
panel went home for the weekend at 5 p.m. without reaching a
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of hours of deliberations, the jury asked the
judge to repeat his earlier instruction on the legal definition of
committing an offense in an especially heinous, cruel or depraved
manner. That is one of the so-called aggravating factors claimed by
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   In their deliberations, jurors must weigh aggravating factors
against mitigating factors presented by the defense in deciding
whether Peeler should get the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The judge explained that in order to find that Peeler committed
the crimes in an especially cruel manner, they must decide either
that Peeler engaged in intentional conduct that inflicted extreme
physical or psychological pain or torture or that he acted in a
callous or indifferent manner to the extreme pain that was
inflicted as a result of his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Peeler ordered his brother, Adrian, to
kill B.J. and his mother to stop the boy from testifying against
him in an earlier murder case.
</P>
<P>
   The defense argued a dozen mitigating factors, including: that
Russell Peeler, while a conspirator, had a relatively limited role
in the killings; that he is already serving a life sentence on
federal drug charges; that he lost his mother to cancer in 1993;
and that he was influenced by the violent subculture of inner-city
life and ''gangsta rap'' music.
</P>
<P>
   The jury is scheduled to resume its deliberations Monday.

<HEADLINE> EPA proposes eight-year, $92 million cleanup of Ciba site  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) - Federal environmental officials have
proposed an eight-year, $92 million plan to clean up contaminated
soil and buried toxins at the former Ciba-Geigy Corp. Superfund
site, which came under scrutiny after an unusually high rate of
childhood cancers was reported here.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal recommended by the Environmental Protection Agency
for the 1,350-acre site calls for excavating about 145,000 cubic
yards of soil and treating it at a building on the site, according
to Romona Pezzella, EPA project manager.
</P>
<P>
   During the treatment, called bioremediation, bacteria that exist
naturally in the dirt would be stimulated to feed on toxins and
speed up their decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also recommends removing about 35,000 drums of
waste material buried there and an additional 5,000 cubic yards of
contaminated soil, and treating the chemicals offsite.
</P>
<P>
   The two cleanup procedures would remove about 90 percent of the
underground pollutants and protect groundwater from future
contamination, Pezzella said.
</P>
<P>
   Many residents of Toms River blame Ciba-Geigy, now called Ciba
Specialty Chemical Co., for exposing the town to traces of dye and
nitrobenzene that seeped into three wells used by the Toms River
Water Co., which is now known as United Water Toms River.
</P>
<P>
   Organic dyes, epoxy resins and specialty chemicals were
manufactured for nearly 40 years on the site, which was formerly
known as Toms River Chemical Co. Solid and liquid waste from the
manufacturing was dumped in 20 different places at the site,
contaminating soil and ground water.
</P>
<P>
   Declared a federal Superfund site in 1982, the land has come
under increased scrutiny since 1996, when the state revealed an
unusually high rate of some childhood cancers in the area.
</P>
<P>
   After soliciting public comment, the EPA will officially select
a plan to clean up the site. Engineers will spend about two years
drawing up specific treatment plans, Pezzella said. It will take
another eight years, at an estimated cost of $92 million, to
complete the actual cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   Ciba Specialty Chemical, based in Tarrytown, N.Y., will pay the
entire cost of the operation and is currently working on a separate
groundwater cleanup that began in 1996, according to company
spokeswoman Donna Jakubowski.
</P>
<P>
   Residents attended a meeting Thursday night to review the
proposal. Other meetings are scheduled for June 22 and July 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very pleased that they selected the alternative that
they did,'' Jakubowski said of the EPA. ''We're happy that it's
acceptable to the community.''

<HEADLINE> Poland Sets Date For Pres. Election  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Parliament on Friday set Oct. 8, as the
date for the country's third presidential election since the
collapse of communist rule a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The early favorite is President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who
already has launched his campaign for a second term. An
ex-communist who defeated incumbent Lech Walesa for the post in
1995, Kwasniewski has become Poland's most popular politician, with
poll approval ratings of 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His closest challenger, according to recent surveys, is maverick
economist Andrzej Olechowski, who has support of about 10 percent
of voting-age Poles. He has served in the Cabinets of both leftist
and rightist governments in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Walesa, founder of the Solidarity movement that toppled Poland's
communist regime, has said he will run again. His successor as head
of the Solidarity trade union, Marian Krzaklewski, also is running.
Both have been getting poll ratings of less than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have said they will run include a radical farm
leader, Andrzej Lepper, and Kazimierz Switon, a Catholic activist.
</P>
<P>
   Under Poland's democratic constitution, the country elects a
president every five years.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Fires Brought Under Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- The worst fires in Cyprus in more than 30
years have been brought under control, a chief firefighter said
Friday, after the four-day blaze had devastated huge tracts of
land.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the major blazes are out, but we are still on full alert
in case of fresh flare-ups from still smoldering pockets during the
night,'' Fire Service chief George Hajigergiou said.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighting aircraft from Greece, Israel and the British
military bases on the island played a major role in containing the
fires, dousing them with tons of water.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Cypriot firefighters and villagers as well as scores
of fire engines worked through the night Thursday and all day
Friday to extinguish the blazes that were boosted by strong winds.
</P>
<P>
   Bulldozers cleared strips of ground to prevent the fires from
spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israeli helicopters and two water-carrying aircraft from
Greece arrived Thursday following an appeal from the Cyprus
government, joining three helicopters from the British bases in
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 fires blazed simultaneously in different parts of
the island earlier in the week, raising suspicions of arson.
</P>
<P>
   President Glafcos Clerides, who visited the worst fire front
Thursday, said an investigation has been ordered. ''Nothing is
ruled out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of acres of forest and agricultural land have been
burned, but there has been no official damage estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture and Environment Minister Costas Agathocleous said
the fires were the worst in more than 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Former SUNY administrator admits he stole $31,000 from foundation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - An award-winning Binghamton University
faculty member admitted stealing $31,088 from the Research
Foundation of the State University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Lewis, a finance professor with the School of Management
and former associate provost for budget and planning, admitted he
handed in 12 vouchers containing intentionally false information to
the research foundation between Oct. 1, 1998 and Sept. 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   With his plea to third-degree grand larceny, Lewis could get
probation or a conditional discharge if he pays back the money and
resigns his position and tenure rights.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began last fall when university officials
notified the district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Provost Mary Ann Swain relieved Lewis of his $106,775-per-year
job as associate provost for budget and planning in October, saying
she was unsatisfied with his performance. Lewis returned to a
teaching position.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is a past recipient of a State University of New York
Chancellor's Award and University Award for Excellence in Teaching.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Opens Bin Laden Trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Twenty-nine alleged followers of
America's most wanted terror suspect, Osama bin Laden, went on
trial in Lebanon Friday on charges of planning terrorist attacks in
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The trial coincides with one of 28 terror suspects in Jordan who
are alleged to belong to a group associated with bin Laden. They
are charged with planning to attack U.S. and Israeli tourists
during New Year's celebrations in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In Lebanon, only nine of the suspects appeared in the military
court. The nine pleaded innocent after which the court quickly
adjourned until June 30 at defense counsel's request. The other
suspects are being tried in absentia.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are accused of conspiring to carry out terrorist
acts and possessing weapons and detonators with the intent to use
them in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The charge sheet also alleged the group was involved in
circulating counterfeit money and forging passports.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment said the accused were followers of bin Laden, the
Saudi-born millionaire wanted for the 1998 bombings of U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The bombings killed 244 people.
Bin Laden is thought to be in hiding in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Those charged included Egyptians, Syrians and Lebanese, but
court documents gave no breakdown of the nationalities.

<HEADLINE> State Supreme Court delays convicted cop killer's release  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state Supreme Court agreed Friday to
keep a cop killer in prison while the Attorney General argues
against his parole.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court said Thomas Trantino deserves to be released after
37 years in state prison for killing two Lodi police officers.
</P>
<P>
   On June 9 the appellate panel ordered Trantino transferred to a
half way house and gave the state Corrections Department 30 days to
prepare him for release.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman immediately ordered Attorney General John
J. Farmer, Jr. to appeal. Farmer's deputies were able to convince
an appeals court judge to grant the emergency stay the day the
opinion was released.
</P>
<P>
   But the same panel that ordered Trantino's release would only
give the state seven days to get the Supreme Court to hear an
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the high court said it would hear the state's petition
for the justices to consider the case.
</P>
<P>
   A two-page order signed by Associate Justice Gary S. Stein
delayed the order to release Trantino but offered no reason.
</P>
<P>
   The order came after the request was ''duly considered by the
court,'' Stein wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased that the Supreme Court granted a state in this
case while it takes a close look at the actions of the Parole
Board,'' said Roger Shatzkin, a spokesman for Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer alleges that the Parole Board was right to deny
Trantino's release especially since some said he becomes agitated
by stress and had no clear plans for life after prison.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court set July 5 as the date to decide if it will
hear the full appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino will remain in a state prison until at least that date.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Roger Lowenstein said last week it was unlikely that the
full court will hear the case. A woman who answered the phone at
Lowenstein's home in Vermont said he was traveling and unavailable
for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trantino, who was convicted of killing two Lodi police officers
in 1963, has been denied parole at least nine times during his 37
years behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel said in a 66-page opinion that Trantino's
latest rejection by the state parole board was ''not supported by
any credible evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Trantino had been sentenced to die for killing the two officers
in a bar in August 1963. But when New Jersey's death penalty was
overturned in 1972, Trantino's sentence was changed to life in
prison. Sentencing guidelines in effect at the time made Trantino
eligible for parole in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   After an earlier appeal, Trantino earned another chance at
release and a hearing before the parole board.
</P>
<P>
   At a June 1999 session, the board rejected Trantino's plea for
parole. Board members relied on a number of points, including
claims by prison mental health examiners that he would likely
commit another crime.
</P>
<P>
   But Trantino argued on appeal that parole board members ignored
several key points on his behalf. Trantino cited a prison record
that showed no infractions since 1970 and a report from a private
doctor and other tests that said he appeared to be a good candidate
for parole.

<HEADLINE> Pirro as pure as Ivory soap, attorney says  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Albert Pirro, husband of the
Westchester County district attorney, is 99.9 percent pure, ''like
the old Ivory Soap commercial,'' his lawyer said Thursday in
closing arguments at Pirro's tax evasion trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the second and final day of his summation, defense attorney
Gustave Newman tried to convince the federal jury that Pirro was
simply running his business affairs informally, treating all his
various companies as part of his household, when he used corporate
checks to buy personal items ranging from a guitar string to a
Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if the funds were going ''from Al Pirro's left pocket
to Al Pirro's right pocket,'' Newman said, with District Attorney
Jeanine Pirro in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Pirro and his accountant, his brother Anthony, are
accused of conspiring to evade taxes on $1.2 million of Albert
Pirro's income by disguising personal spending as deductible
business expenses. After a four-week trial, the jury is to begin
deliberating on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Newman told the jurors, ''You know the informal way they
conducted business in that office. Pay it out of any account that
has money. ... The culture of one pocket - Al Pirro, the
corporations, one pocket, all interchangeable.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Pirro, a real estate developer and one of the
state's top lobbyists, as ''indifferent'' to his bookkeeping. ''He
was preoccupied with building business, his irons in the fire,''
Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a tiny line on a pie chart for the jury, Newman claimed
that only one-tenth of 1 percent of Pirro's corporate deductions
were being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   ''Like the old Ivory Soap commercial, he's 99.9 percent pure,''
Newman said. The advertising slogan was actually ''99-44/100%
Pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Without saying so, Newman seemed to shift the blame for improper
deductions to Anthony Pirro, noting that when Albert Pirro signed
his tax returns, they had already been filled out and signed by his
brother and gave him no reason to be suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   But Roger Stavis, Anthony Pirro's lawyer, said a lack of
communication between the brothers - as well as some admittedly
sloppy work by Anthony - was the cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirro brothers ''did not have a particularly close
relationship,'' Stavis said, noting that Albert had not attended
the christening of Anthony's daughter. Even counting social
occasions, they saw each other only a few times a year, Stavis
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What kind of a conspiracy is this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were other accountants involved in Albert Pirro's
bookkeeping, but Anthony ''happens to be the only accountant whose
name is Pirro.''
</P>
<P>
   Both defense attorneys took offense at prosecutor Cathy Seibel's
characterization of the Pirro brothers as ''crooks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Assistant U.S. attorneys are not supposed to call names like
that,'' Stavis said.
</P>
<P>
   In her rebuttal, Seibel laughed off some of the defense
contentions, and said Albert Pirro was resorting to ''the old
blame-it-on-the-accountant defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the government's case was circumstantial,
Seibel said the evidence was nevertheless clear that ''what they
did only makes sense as a tax fraud.''

<HEADLINE> Renowned violinist cancels Bartlesville appearance due to undisclosed emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BARTLESVILLE, Okla. (AP) - Renowned violinist Itzhak Perlman has
canceled his Saturday concert at the OK Mozart festival because of
an undisclosed family emergency, festival officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman was on a private plane bound for Bartlesville when he
learned of the emergency and asked that the plane return to New
York, said OK Mozart executive director Nan Buhlinger.
</P>
<P>
   Perlman's management group, IMG Artists, said it was only the
fourth time Perlman has canceled a performance.
</P>
<P>
   A personal friend of Perlman's, pianist Emanuel Ax, will step in
as the featured performer for the final OK Mozart festival concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this last-minute emergency, we are amazingly lucky that
Emanuel Ax was gracious enough to join us,'' said Ransom Willis,
the festival's artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   Ax first got the attention of the world stage at age 25 when he
took the top prize at the first Arthur Rubenstein International
Piano Competition in Tel Aviv in 1974.

<HEADLINE> NATO Troops Find Ammunition Depots  </HEADLINE>
By FISNIK ABRASHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KLECKA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Kosovo's NATO-led peacekeepers on
Friday found a huge stockpile of ammunition stored in two bunkers
that were stacked to the ceiling with grenades, mortars and other
ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers did not know who the weapons belonged to, but the
commander of the search operation suggested the find could be
linked to anti-Serb extremists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly somebody ... has spent an awful lot of money and
energy setting up this site,'' said Lt. Col. David Allfrey, a
spokesman for the British forces serving in the NATO force. ''What
their designs are, it's not my position to say, but there have been
a few killings in the Serb community in the last couple of weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   A year of persistent anti-Serb violence has increased recently,
leading to growing fears among the remaining Kosovo Serb minority.
Serbs have been targeted by ethnic Albanians seeking revenge for
the crackdown on Albanians that ended a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The find was part of an exhaustive search for weapons which
began Thursday and involved hundreds of peacekeepers who covered
about 40 square miles of the Drenica Valley region of central
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Tom Rees, of the British contingent that found the two
concrete bunkers near Klecka, approximately 20 miles southwest of
Pristina, said they contained large numbers of grenades, mortar
rounds and other explosives. He said a more thorough search would
be needed to take full inventory. The storage rooms, which measured
10 yards by four yards by two yards high, were filled to their
ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Klecka was one of the strongholds of the Kosovo Liberation Army
during its battle against President Slobodan Milosevic's forces
that ended last year with the arrival of NATO forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A military training area near the bunkers appeared to be
well-kept. There were fresh footprints in the area, according to
NATO personnel on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly been used for training, there is a very large
quantity of ammunition,'' Allfrey said. The search commander
suggested that they expected to find even more arms, saying there
appeared to be tunnels leading to other depots nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA was formally disbanded last fall as part of the
demilitarization of Kosovo. But rumors persist that it continues
clandestine operations.

<HEADLINE> Woman very much alive despite Social Security snafu  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WALLKILL, N.Y. (AP) - Dorothy Hunt-Ingrassia is alive and well
despite a federal foul-up that insisted she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   In April, two months of Social Security benefits disappeared
from her bank account. In May, she started getting Medicare bills
addressed to her ''estate.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a face-to-face interview at the Social Security office
to persuade the government that Hunt-Ingrassia, 70, was still among
the living.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, last week, Medicare sent a statement to
Hunt-Ingrassia's estate indicating it had paid for a mammogram.
Stranger still was the note on the bill that Medicare would pick up
the tab for another mammogram in 12 months: A mammogram for
somebody the government thinks is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank God I don't live on Social Security alone,''
Hunt-Ingrassia told the Times Herald-Record of Middletown. ''It
would have devastated me.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Social Security Administration thought she had
moved to Las Vegas. In April, U.S. Rep. Ben Gilman's office
convinced government computers that the Town of Wallkill historian
actually lives in Wallkill.
</P>
<P>
   Social Security officials say they're not sure what went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did get her back on the record as being alive and well,''
said Vivian Amato, a service representative at the Social Security
office in Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still don't know where I stand,'' Hunt-Ingrassia said.
''Every month I hold my breath and wonder what's going to happen
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallkill is in Ulster County, 66 miles north of New York City.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court strikes down three parts of Vermont campaign finance law </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Acting on First Amendment grounds, a federal
appeals court has decided that three sections of a new Vermont
campaign finance law are too vague and otherwise poorly worded to
be constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reinstates a challenge by the Vermont Right to Life
Committee to a law Vermont enacted in 1997 to reform its system of
campaign financing. The committee said fear of penalties had forced
it to limit its activities.
</P>
<P>
   The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-1 ruling dated
Thursday, reversed a lower court judge who had tossed out a lawsuit
the committee filed after the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The committee had sought a court declaration barring enforcement
of two parts of the law which require political advertisements to
disclose the identity of the entity paying for them and the
candidate, party or political committee who will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   It also had challenged a section of the law the requires
reporting of expenditures on radio or television advertisements
devoted to pure issue advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said it did not matter that the Right to Life
Committee could face only civil penalties rather than criminal
punishment if the state concluded it had violated the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fear of civil penalties can be as inhibiting of speech as
can trepidation in the face of threatened criminal prosecution,''
the appeals court wrote.
</P>
<P>
   It noted that the committee could be fined up to $10,000 for
each violation of campaign finance law.
</P>
<P>
   The committee had argued that it feared it was at risk for
penalties because it does not comply with a campaign finance law
requirement that political advertisements designate the name of the
candidate, party or political committee on whose behalf they are
published or broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The problem arises because the committee does not expressly
advocate the election or defeat of particular candidates other than
through its internal political committee, the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court, finding two parts of the new law
''impermissibly vague,'' sympathized with the committee's fear that
it would not know whether it was violating the law, especially when
engaging in classic issue advocacy that might amount to an implicit
endorsement of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''The constitutional defects are particularly serious because of
their impact on anonymous communications, which have played a
central role in the development of free expression and democratic
governance,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court returned the case to the lower court for
further proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Judge Milton I. Shadur said the lawsuit
should have been brought in Vermont state court, which could have
provided a definitive interpretation of the new law.

<HEADLINE> Swiss components maker testifies about ''urgent'' Libyan order for timers </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) - The co-owner of a Swiss company
that supplied electronic components to the Libyan government
testified Friday that he received an ''urgent'' order for 40 timers
just days before the 1988 explosion of Pan Am flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin Meister of the Swiss firm Meister and Bollier, Ltd., said
his business partner, Edwin Bollier, took 40 Olympus timers to
Tripoli at the request of the Libyan government, but brought all of
them back to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The timer the prosecution believes detonated the explosives
wasn't an Olympus timer, but another sort, called MST13.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Olympus clocks had been set to go off at 7:30 p.m. on
a Wednesday, Meister said. The bomb that killed 270 people,
including 189 Americans, went off at 7:03 p.m. on Wednesday, Dec.
21. Thirty-eight of the victims were from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were just astonished because it was quite close to the
incident,'' Meister said.
</P>
<P>
   Meister said that before the Lockerbie explosion, one of the
defendants now on trial had come to Zurich and discussed buying
shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   He identified the man as Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi. ''That's
him over there,'' he said, pointing to the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Meister set the stage for a crucial part of the prosecution's
case against al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, who are alleged
to be Libyan intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   They are accused of planting a suitcase bomb on board the New
York-bound jetliner, which exploded 38 minutes after takeoff from
London. They are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder
and endangering aircraft safety, crimes that carry a maximum life
sentence under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   They have pleaded innocent, implicating two Syrian-based
Palestinian factions in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began May 3 before a Scottish court at a former U.S.
air base following their surrender by Libyan leader Moammar
Gadhafi, who was seeking to alleviate economic sanctions against
his country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Verifies Israeli Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- In a setback for U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, Lebanon on Friday rejected the United Nations'
verification of Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon, saying
Israel still controls some Lebanese territory.
</P>
<P>
   Annan had said earlier Friday at U.N. headquarters that the
United Nations has confirmed the Israeli withdrawal is complete.
That announcement is supposed to clear the way for U.N. troops to
move into the border area and help Lebanese forces restore peace
and regain authority in the region.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a happy day for Lebanon, but also for Israel,'' the
secretary-general said. ''It is a day of hope for the Middle East
as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   After his announcement and a report to the U.N. Security
Council, he left to catch a flight to London en route to the Middle
East ''to see what the United Nations can do to consolidate and
build on today's achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan believed Lebanon had agreed to respect the world body's
decision on when Israel had completed its withdrawal, said Annan's
Mideast envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen. A Lebanese statement and a
telephone conversation Annan had with Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud gave the secretary-general that impression, Roed-Larsen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after Annan spoke, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss said Israel still controls Lebanese soil.
</P>
<P>
   ''With deep regret, it appeared by Friday evening that Israel
has not yet withdrawn from all Lebanese territory,'' Hoss said in
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   He said Lebanese officers working with the U.N. team inspecting
the Lebanese-Israeli border had found ''there are still several
Israeli military outposts inside the Lebanese border. And there are
several tracts of Lebanese territory under Israeli control in a
flagrant act of encroachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that the secretariat-general of the United
Nations would have announced the withdrawal had been completed ...
had it been informed of these facts,'' Hoss said.
</P>
<P>
   After Hoss' statement, Roed-Larsen called Lahoud and clarified
some points the Lebanese team working with the U.N. force had
raised, U.N. deputy spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
Members of the U.N. force and the Lebanese team were expected to
meet Saturday to go over the points, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection is likely to delay deployment of the Lebanese army
to the country's south -- a key U.N. goal.
</P>
<P>
   Israel occupied part of southern Lebanon as a buffer against
guerrilla attacks on northern Israel from 1985 until its withdrawal
on May 24. After it withdrew, Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas
who fought the Israeli occupation moved into the former occupied
zone. The zone, which runs right up to the Israeli border, is now
under the guerrillas' de facto control -- a concern for Israel,
where residents of northern towns fear guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Under resolutions the United Nations passed in 1978, U.N.
officials were to verify any Israeli withdrawal. Then, the U.N.
peacekeeping mission in Lebanon, now 4,500-strong, was to deploy to
the border zone to assist the Lebanese government in maintaining
peace and reasserting its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation of Israel's withdrawal paves the way for the U.N.
troops to move in. But the most important issue is the deployment
of Lebanese troops to take control of the region now filled with
guerrillas, said Roed-Larsen -- and the Lebanese government has said
it would not address that issue until the Israeli withdrawal was
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there are only about 1,000 Lebanese security troops
deployed in the south, Roed-Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before Annan spoke Friday, Lahoud warned that his
government was opposed to the U.N.-demarcated frontier and would
consider Israel's pullout incomplete. Nonetheless, Roed-Larsen said
U.N. officials thought Lebanon had agreed to respect the U.N.
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Lebanon had protested to the United Nations that the
newly drawn frontier was misplaced at some points, awarding Israel
small tracts of land. But U.N. cartographers say they have drawn
the 72-mile frontier according to the line fixed in 1923 by France
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty of establishing a boundary is at the root of the
lingering disagreement, Roed-Larsen said. He said it was very
difficult to identify a line that conforms to Lebanon's
international boundaries and even more complicated to transform it
from a map to a line on the ground -- and then to verify that Israel
had left all of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ninety percent -- even more -- of the problems we encountered on
both sides were of a practical nature and not of a political
nature,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's tough stand on the border's demarcation might be a
pressure tactic to make the United Nations push Israel into
conceding some territory that Lebanon seeks.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether Lebanon had consulted Syria on the
issue. In the past, the Beirut government routinely consulted
Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon. But the Damascus
government is now preoccupied with the expected succession of
Bashar Assad to the presidency after the death of his father, Hafez
Assad, on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   Roed-Larsen said Annan still wants the U.N. peacekeeping force
to be increased to nearly 8,000 troops and expressed hope that
Friday's announcement ''will trigger a contribution of troops from
relevant nations.'' The U.N. force will be increased to 5,600 next
month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annan was expected to visit seven countries in the Middle East
region, beginning with Morocco on Saturday. He planned stops in
Iran, Egypt, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Syria, ending May 23.
</P>
<P>
   Gadi Baltiansky, a spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak, said an official Israeli reaction to the U.N. approval of
the withdrawal will be made on Saturday night or Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Lazio investments brought sizable profit  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEPEW, N.Y. (AP) - Senate hopeful Rick Lazio Friday defended a
1997 investment that brought him a profit of up to 600 percent in
less than two weeks on securities in a company controlled by some
of his biggest contributors.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, the Republican congressman spent $2,300 on
securities trades in Quick &AMP; Reilly, a brokerage, weeks before it
was purchased by Fleet Financial Group, The New York Times reported
Friday. In what reportedly was Lazio's first foray into high-risk
options trading, he unloaded the options for nearly $16,000 on the
day Quick &AMP; Reilly announced it was being bought by Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   During a campaign stop at a suburban Buffalo manufacturing
plant, Lazio said he had ''absolutely'' no inside information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only conversation I had was with my broker on this, as is
the case with all the stocks we have,'' he said, ''and if you look
at investments that I make they're very modest investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's profits were reported Sunday in Newsday after a review
of financial disclosure forms from 1992 through 1998. Further
details were reported Friday in the Times.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Quick and Christopher C. Quick, former senior executives
of Quick &AMP; Reilly, who along with other company executives have
donated at least $35,000 to Lazio's campaigns since 1995, said they
had never discussed the company's stock with Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts in securities law told the Times that Lazio's entry
into speculative options trading, coupled with his sizable
short-term profit on the deal and his relationship with company
executives, might have led to an insider trading investigation by
the Securities and Exchange Commission had it been aware of the
trades at the time.
</P>
<P>
   There is no indication that Lazio's investments attracted the
attention of the SEC at the time. He described the investments in
disclosure forms in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been investing in the market for a long time, like a lot
of Americans, and you win some and you lose some,'' Lazio said.
''Believe me, I don't have the same financial adviser as Mrs.
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's Senate opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, had to respond
to reports about controversial investments several years ago. She
turned a $1,000 investment in the cattle futures market into nearly
$100,000 during a nine-month period in 1978 and 1979, when her
husband was attorney general and then governor of Arkansas. She was
assisted in her trades by an executive of Tyson Foods, which had
extensive business before Arkansas state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio bristled at comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of folks are trying to create some moral equivalency,''
he said. ''There is no moral equivalency with taking $1,000 and
making $100,000 and saying you got the information out of The Wall
Street Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said in April 1994 that she did not know whether
she should have been required to put up more money, but added that
she risked far more than her initial $1,000 investment by getting
into the market.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's investment in Quick &AMP; Reilly constituted a bet on a
company over which he wielded influence because he serves on the
House Banking and Commerce Committees, and members of the Quick
family had been officers of Wall Street's lobbying arm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ''totally comfortable'' with his dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's never any vote that I ever took that directly
impacted, in any focused way, the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1999 financial disclosure forms, Lazio revealed he had
purchased more than $15,000 in stock in Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. on the
day the investment bank went public.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, prominent members of New York City's Jewish
community hosted a fund-raiser for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tisch, co-chairman of the Loew's Corp., his wife Billie
and their daughter-in-law, Meryl, sponsored the fund-raiser at the
Regency Hotel in Manhattan. Kenneth Bialkin, chairman of the
American-Israel Friendship League, was a co-sponsor as was
Republican supporter George Klein.
</P>
<P>
   James Tisch, president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of
New York and Meryl's husband, also was to attend.
</P>
<P>
   The Tisch clan has supported of Sen. Charles Schumer, a
Democratic Clinton ally. Bialkin has been a supporter of outgoing
Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokeswoman Karen Dunn said the camp was not worried by
news of the fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ''Polls show that Hillary's support in the Jewish community is
strong, but she's not taking any votes for granted,'' Karen Dunn
told ''Forward,'' a weekly magazine that focuses on Jewish issues.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court throws out $5 million punitive award  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal appeals court has overturned the $5
million in punitive damages awarded to a woman who was
strip-searched by jail guards.
</P>
<P>
   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a ruling dated
Thursday let stand a $19,600 award for pain and suffering and
medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   A jury had announced both awards at a trial on a lawsuit brought
by Debra Ciraolo, 44, who had been arrested after a domestic
dispute in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   She was ordered by two female guards to disrobe and then to bend
over and cough. The jury found the city had acted with wanton
disregard or indifference.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the jury verdict, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had
predicted the punitive damages portion of the verdict would be
overturned.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers on both sides did not immediately return telephone calls
for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said it rejected the punitive award because
the city's unconstitutional policy had been adopted by municipal
officials without any clear endorsement of the policy by elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we emphatically deplore the city's conduct in adopting a
policy that this (federal court) had earlier clearly held
unconstitutional, the taxpayers themselves cannot be held to be
responsible for the policy,'' the appeals court said.
</P>
<P>
   The case was filed after lawyers said as many as 63,000 people -
and perhaps as many as twice that number - were illegally
strip-searched by guards in Manhattan and Queens in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Strip searches of people charged with misdemeanors and other
minor offenses are prohibited unless there is reasonable suspicion
that weapons or other contraband are being concealed.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the searches took place without the knowledge of
senior Corrections Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   The city said the strip searches occurred in error after a shift
in job functions between police officers and jail guards left

   But Edward Reilly, chief of the Department of Corrections, said
in court papers that the strip-searches were necessary because of

<HEADLINE> Rwanda, Uganda Delay Withdrawal  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda and Uganda did not withdraw as
planned Friday from the northern Congolese city of Kisangani, where
the erstwhile allies have fought in their mutual bid to oust
Congo's president.
</P>
<P>
   The two armies have clashed three times in Kisangani, the Congo
River port that both sides deem strategic for resupplying their
troops elsewhere in Congo. They were to have begun withdrawing
Friday but ''the final plan has not been agreed upon,'' said Lt.
Col. Hossein Akram, one of 30 unarmed U.N. military observers
stationed in Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   He said discussions were continuing but refused to go into
details.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. Security Council demanded Friday that
Rwanda and Uganda withdraw their forces from Congo immediately and
threatened to consider possible sanctions if they don't.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimously adopted resolution, the council also said
Rwanda and Uganda should pay for the damage and deaths they
inflicted on the northern Congolese city of Kisangani, where they
fought pitched battles earlier this month, killing an estimated 300
people.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution was adopted at the close of a two-day meeting of
the warring sides in Congo's 2-year-old civil war that included the
foreign ministers of Rwanda, Uganda and Congo and representatives
of the key rebel groups and other foreign armies involved in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Rwanda and Uganda sent their forces into Congo to back rebels
fighting to oust President Laurent Kabila. But differences over the
conduct of war and which of the three rebel factions to support has
led to fighting. The city is supposed to be handed over to unarmed
U.N. military observers.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had begun withdrawing when fighting broke out June 5.
The ferocious artillery battles ended seven days later when the
Rwandan army drove the Ugandans from the northern edge of the city,
making it possible for the observers deploy at the front line. At
least 150 civilians were killed and another 1,110 were injured in
the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both armies have promised to withdraw unilaterally
to points at least 60 miles outside of the city and hand control
over to the U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandan army spokesman Maj. Phineas Katirima said Ugandan forces
would be withdrawing from Kapalata training camp, seven miles north
of Kisangani, to Banalia, about 60 miles further north.
</P>
<P>
   Rwandan troops were to pull out to the south and southeast of
Kisangani from the city's two airports as well as from the center
of town, Rwandan military officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rwandans warned of a buildup of Ugandan troops in Buta,
161 miles north of Kisangani, where they said Ugandan planes had
been flying in troops and ammunition for the last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Only humanitarian flights loaded with food and supplies were
landing at the main, Rwandan-controlled airport northeast of the
city after the Ugandans demanded that no planes from the Rwandan
capital, Kigali, or Goma, in extreme eastern Congo, be allowed to
land.
</P>
<P>
   Goma is the headquarters of the Rwandan-backed Congolese rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, commercial flights carrying fuel, sugar, maize, beer
and soft drinks land daily in Kisangani from Goma. The water route
from Kisangani to the capital, Kinshasa, has been closed since the
rebellion against Kabila broke out in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace accord signed last year between Kabila and the
rebels, a 5,537-strong U.N. force of observers and troops to
protect them is supposed to oversee the withdrawal of foreign
troops from Congo. Fighting on Kabila's side are troops from
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.N. Security Council continued Friday to
negotiate a resolution in New York with the warring factions in
Congo that would cement the withdrawal of foreign troops from
Kisangani. The French-sponsored draft calls for foreign armies to
withdraw from the country -- and threatens possible sanctions if
they don't.
</P>
<P>
   France, which is president of the Security Council this month,
hopes to adopt the resolution by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Namibia started to exchange
prisoners of war under the auspices of the International Red Cross,
Rwandan and Red Cross officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange is part of the peace agreement and has been agreed
upon by the Joint Military Commission, on which sit representatives
of all the warring parties.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) - Two New York residents died when their
vehicle ran off Interstate 95 and overturned several times, the
Highway Patrol says.
</P>
<P>
   Din Stephenson, 21, and Benetta Johnson, 25, both of Mount
Vernon, N.Y., died following the wreck Thursday morning. Each was
thrown from the vehicle, Coroner M.G. Matthews said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson, who was driving, ran off the road and lost control,
and the car, which had been traveling at about 80 mph, overturned
five times, Highway Patrol 1st Sgt. Jo Nell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like he might have fallen asleep at the wheel and
then lost control, but we can't say that for sure. I know they had
been traveling all night,'' Nell said.
</P>
<P>
   They were heading to Georgia when the wreck occurred at about
9:30 a.m. about six miles north of Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson died at the scene and Johnson died at a local
hospital, Matthews said.

<HEADLINE> Summit Vows To Strengthen Democracy  </HEADLINE>
By JAVIER BAENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Amid military rumblings and
questioned elections in Latin America, a regional summit avoided
criticizing specific countries while pledging Friday to disperse
the ''dark clouds'' threatening democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We begin a new century committed to consolidating and
strengthening representative democracy,'' said the Cartagena
Declaration, a statement signed by the 15 presidents from the
19-nation Rio Group gathered in this walled Caribbean seaport.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy is the only legitimate political system, and a
prerequisite for ''peace, stability and development,'' the document
said.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding its annual two-day summit, the Rio Group also
urged world financial bodies to promote sound economic policies in
Latin America without further impoverishing the poor.
</P>
<P>
   But the most sensitive summit topic was what Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo called the ''dark clouds'' hovering over democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Although elected civilians have replaced generals in
presidential palaces around Latin America in the past two decades,
recent events show democracy is not solidly rooted everywhere in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, officers staged an unsuccessful coup in Paraguay and
President Alberto Fujimori of Peru won a third consecutive term in
balloting marred by serious fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a military uprising toppled Ecuador's president and
last year former coup plotter Hugo Chavez took office as president
of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is mired in drug corruption and a 36-year leftist
insurgency. And Mexico holds presidential elections July 2 amid
charges that the ruling party is using dubious tactics to preserve
its seven-decade hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, our region was synonymous with dictatorship, with
strongmen, with human rights violations,'' President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso of Brazil said Friday. ''Now we have a chance to
ensure that will never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Aspirations aside, it was unclear whether the Cartagena meeting
would lead to any concrete actions to strengthen democracy in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   The summit follows a recent emergency meeting of the region's
top diplomatic body in which the Organization of American States
rejected U.S. demands for sanctions against Fujimori. Latin
American governments are traditionally loathe to criticize one
another, considering it an infringement on national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   While urging softer loan terms from international lenders, the
summit did not act on a proposal to create a new regional body to
partially supplant the controversial International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics blame budget-cutting policies demanded by the IMF
of cash-strapped governments for the region's gaping rich-poor gap.
</P>
<P>
   In attendance at the Cartagena summit were the presidents of Rio
Group nations: Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, Honduras, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela.

<HEADLINE> Mo Farmland Recalls Turkey Products  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Farmland Industries is voluntarily
recalling about 86,000 pounds of sliced turkey products that are
possibly contaminated with lubricating oil.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest farm cooperative and the Department of
Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service announced the
recall on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The products, distributed nationwide, carry a small health risk:
temporary digestive discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   In March customers began reporting an off-taste and smell to the
products, Farmland spokesman David Eahart said. Subsequent
investigations turned up a small leak in a piece of processing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have already done a retrieval of most of the product from
our distributors,'' he said. ''Very little of the product remains
out there now, but consumer safety is always a top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The recall involves Farmland brand sliced turkey ham in 10- and
16-ounce packages. Package labels bear the establishment number
P2122 and expiration dates of July 5 or earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Also involved in the recall are the following brands of sliced
turkey breast, all in 16-ounce packages unless otherwise indicated:
</P>
<P>
   --Meijer brand, establishment number P-18029;
</P>
<P>
   --Albertson's Deli brand, establishment number P-19051;
</P>
<P>
   --Spring Hill smoked turkey breast, random weight packages,
establishment number P-19051;
</P>
<P>
   --Farmland Special Select, establishment number P-19051.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Policemen Found Beheaded  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A Muslim cleric was gunned down in
Chechnya on Friday, hours after urging peace, and two Chechen
police officers working for Russian authorities were found
beheaded.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers were found Thursday along with the bodies of
two civilians who had been shot to death near the town of Argun,
nine miles east of the Chechen capital Grozny, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Umar Idrisov, an imam or Muslim leader, was shot and killed by
attackers who burst into his home in Urus-Martan in southwestern
Chechnya. Local officials said that Idrisov was an opponent of the
Islamic fundamentalists who make up a significant part of the rebel
forces, and that he had just given a sermon calling for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a pure man with pure thoughts,'' said Shirvani Yasayev,
head of the Urus-Martan administration. ''It's a pity we failed to
protect him.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing was more evidence of the rebels' determination to
punish Chechens they view as traitors.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces took control of most of the rebellious region in
a military operation that began in September. But Russian officials
have struggled to create a pro-Moscow Chechen force, and
independence fighters have sometimes targeted pro-Moscow Chechens
as well as Russian soldiers and officials.
</P>
<P>
   Russian President Vladimir Putin has named another Muslim
clergyman, Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov, as civilian administrator in the
region. The mufti is viewed with suspicion by many Chechens, who
consider him Moscow's puppet.
</P>
<P>
   He has reportedly been the target of assassination attempts, and
his son was wounded by a remote-controlled bomb which Kadyrov
blamed on rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's spokesman for Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, said
Friday that Chechen Vice President Vakha Arsanov has offered a
reward to militants for the capture of Kadyrov.
</P>
<P>
   In Gudermes, Chechnya's second-largest city, the administrative
chiefs of several Chechen regions met to prepare a statement
denouncing Kadyrov, focusing on his support of separatists in the
1994-96 Chechnya war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody has heard that he has recognized his share of guilt in
the deaths of dozens of thousands of people,'' a draft of the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian artillery pounded suspected rebel positions
in the southern mountains Friday after another night of hit-and-run
attacks on Russian checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops were expelled from Chechnya in a 1994-96 war with
independence fighters. They re-entered the republic after Islamic
militants based there seized several villages in the neighboring
Russian region of Dagestan, and after about 300 people died in
apartment bombings the government blames on Chechens.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets from
the Los Alamos weapons lab have been located behind a copying machine within the
lab's secure area and are being evaluated, the Energy Department and government
sources said today. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the two hard drives,
which disappeared six weeks ago, were ''found within the secure areas of X
Division which houses the vault'' where they had previously been kept. Other
federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the devices were

the Israeli withdrawal is complete. That announcement is supposed to clear the

<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- George C. ''Nick'' Connor Jr., a high school
coach who set up the basketball game that led to the unification of
Louisiana's black and white athletic organizations, died June 9 of
prostate cancer. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   Connor, a longtime coach, teacher and athletic director at St.
Augustine High School and former state representative, was the
Catholic school's first lay teacher and the first coach of its
track, basketball and football teams.
</P>
<P>
   Because of segregation, St. Augustine played only other
all-black schools during most of Connor's coaching career. In 1965,
however, his basketball team played and won a secret game against a
then all-white Jesuit High School. The game was played on a
Saturday morning in an otherwise empty gym.
</P>
<P>
   The game was considered a precursor to the unification of the

<P>
   MARINA DEL REY, Calif. (AP) -- Dr. Irving Lichtenstein, who
revolutionized hernia surgery, died Sunday of Parkinson's disease.
He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   Lichtenstein refined hernia operations, announcing his surgical
breakthrough at a 1964 American Medical Association convention.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, hernia surgery required full anesthesia and was
followed by six to eight weeks of bed rest. Lichtenstein insisted
that with his technique the surgery could be done under local
anesthetic and the patient could be released from the hospital the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   As a Jew who had personally faced discrimination during his
medical training, Lichtenstein had a passion for individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he helped put the ACLU of Southern California on sound
financial footing when he created what became the Roger Baldwin
Foundation, which continues to finance litigation and educational
activities.

Mohawks Claim They Shouldn't Have To Pay Duties at Border
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Ontario and Quebec Mohawks, whose ancestors were
traders, say they have a right to bring goods into Canada over the
U.S. border without paying customs duties.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Mohawks from a reserve near Cornwall, Ontario, told
the Supreme Court of Canada on Friday that the right they seek
would not threaten Canada's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The case went to the Supreme Court after Grand Chief Michael
Mitchell won his case at two lower courts that agreed the Akwesasne
Mohawk should have the right to continue trading traditions that
existed before Europeans arrived in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government challenged those rulings, arguing that
extending the right to Mohawks would threaten Canada's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   The high court reserved its decision Friday.

   ''We had a proud day yesterday, proud because we stood up,'' he
said as some of his fellow protesters appeared at a downtown

   Premier Mike Harris reiterated his disgust Friday with the
tactics of the protesters, some of whom showed up at the
demonstration prepared for a riot.

''I don't think it has any place in a democratic free society, a

Newfoundland Premier Takes Aim at Ottawa in Shrimp War
</P>
<P>
   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- Premier Brian Tobin, once the
federal government's strongest provincial ally, has turned his back
on one of his Liberal brethren in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The Newfoundland premier, a former federal fisheries minister
who leads Canada's only Liberal provincial government, said Friday
he supports calls for the resignation of Fisheries Minister Herb
Dhaliwal following a federal decision to grant a shrimp license to
Prince Edward Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no more confidence in the minister of fisheries and
oceans for Canada,'' Tobin was quoted as saying by Newfoundland
Fisheries Minister John Efford.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, who is in Iceland to promote the province's Viking
festivities this summer, couldn't be immediately reached for
comment. But Efford relayed his conversation with the premier to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Dhaliwal's decision, handed down Thursday, has infuriated many
Newfoundlanders and damaged the reputations of the province's five
Liberal MPs.

Calgary Man Accused in Brink's Robbery Found Guilty
</P>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- A former military reservist was
convicted Friday in the botched, commando-style robbery of two
Brink's guards that ended in a hail of bullets at a Calgary
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ryan, 32, was also found guilty of stealing more than
$100,000 from an automated teller machine.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the 1998 robbery, in which more than 80
gunshots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   Disgraced former soldier Darnell Bass, who received a seven-year
sentence for conspiracy to commit the robbery, was the Crown's key
witness.
</P>
<P>
   Although police have been criticized in the two-year
investigation because only two of the eight people involved in the
crimes have been convicted, detective Tom Marriott said at least
they got the leader.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whenever we got evidence and were able to lay a charge we did
that,'' said Marriott. ''Unfortunately on some people we weren't
able to collect enough evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan will be sentenced next week.

<HEADLINE> Co. Founder's Death Ruled Accident  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN ANTCZAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Herbalife International Inc. founder Mark
Hughes died of an accidental toxic combination of alcohol and
anti-depressants, a coroner ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who was inspired to form the company after his mother's
accidental death from an overdose of prescription diet pills, was
found dead May 21 in his Malibu home.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs of foul play or trauma, and an autopsy
performed two days later was inconclusive. Toxicology tests led to
the final findings, said Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the Los
Angeles County coroner.
</P>
<P>
   Carrier said Hughes' use of the medication apparently involved
sleeping problems.
</P>
<P>
   The company said in a statement that Hughes was at a birthday
celebration for his grandmother earlier in the day and had consumed
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had also suffered from sleep apnea, a sleeping disorder
that caused him to occasionally take sleeping medication, which he
apparently had taken on the night he died,'' said the statement.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, who died at age 44, had a blood-alcohol level of .21
percent and a moderate amount of the anti-depressant Sinequan in
his system, Carrier said. A California driver is legally drunk with
a blood-alcohol level of .08 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of Sinequan in Hughes' system was normal and alone
would not have killed him, Carrier said. Taken in combination with
alcohol, Sinequan can cause excessive sedation and death, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herbalife International, which Hughes founded in 1980 at age of
24, sells weight management, personal care and nutritional products
in 48 countries. The company claims yearly sales of $1.7 billion.

<HEADLINE> SFC Warehouse Fire Destroys Wine  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA WADHWANI
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- As many as 50,000 cases of wine and
champagne were destroyed in a warehouse fire in the heart of
California's premier winemaking region, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The smoky fire at Kornell Champagne Cellars near Calistoga,
about 75 miles north of San Francisco, likely broke out Wednesday,
but wasn't reported until Thursday morning, officials said. On
Friday, firefighters in the Napa Valley continued to fight the
smoky blaze, which was expected to smolder for days.
</P>
<P>
   No major injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a concrete-sided building and the sides fell in and the
roof fell in on top of it, and it's got like 50,000 cases of wine
and champagne,'' said State Division of Forestry Capt. Thomas
Shores.
</P>
<P>
   No precise damage estimate was available Friday, but fire
officials gave a rough estimate of several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is owned by Frank-Rombauer Larkmead Cellars, which
stores and bottles wine under its own name at the site. Other
labels it produces, including Diamond Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon
and the entire inventory of Napa Cellars, were reportedly lost in
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The warehouse also stored wines from more than 30 local
vintners, restaurants and private collections. Other labels that
suffered significant losses include Pride Mountain, T-Vine and
Elyse, which retail for $50 to $150 per case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The small-time vintners could lose their business over this,''
said Eric Sims, an industry analyst with wine consultants Motto,
Kryla and Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Pryde, owner of Pride Mountain Vineyards in St. Helena,
returned from vacation Thursday to learn he had lost 125 cases of
1997 reserve cabernet valued at $130,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a heck of a thing to come home to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Dollar Could Fetch $100,000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN HOME, Ark. (AP) -- Three weeks after he wrapped up a
personal bankruptcy, Frank Wallis got some good financial news -- he
found a misprinted gold dollar that could be worth up to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis bought four rolls of Sacagawea $1 gold coins a couple of
weeks ago. He opened one, expecting to see the American Indian
guide's youthful face on the coins inside. But one bore a more
familiar profile: George Washington, in a pose usually seen on
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The error is believed to be the first of its kind in the
208-year history of the U.S. Mint.
</P>
<P>
   Even after spotting the mistake, Wallis didn't realize how
valuable the coin, minted in Philadelphia, might be.
</P>
<P>
   ''I decided probably at least it was a fun coin to own because
of the George Washington ad campaign,'' he said, referring to a $40
million campaign in which Washington, illustrated by his portrait
on the $1 bill, insists he doesn't mind being left off the new
coin.
</P>
<P>
   After contacting experts, Wallis realized the coin was likely
quite valuable.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake is known by collectors as a ''double-denomination
mule error'' -- two currencies stamped on different sides.
</P>
<P>
   Wallis' coin bears the front of the Washington quarter and the
back of the Sacagawea dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known whether other coins with the same error are in
circulation; 500 million Sacagawea coins were minted. A spokesman
for the U.S. Mint did not return a call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty days before he found the coin, Wallis, the business page
editor of The Baxter Bulletin, was completing a bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in financial ruin,'' he said, explaining that a hospital
stay in 1993 caused him to forfeit two months' salary. Since then,
he has been trying to get caught up.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now, if the Lord wills, I can pay the debts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted his fortunes may again change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today it's a valuable coin, but if somebody has found several
more, it's not so valuable,'' Wallis said. ''It's just another
error coin.''
</P>
<P>
   A dealer will auction the coin during the American Numismatic
Association's convention in Philadelphia in August.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Found  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two computer hard drives containing nuclear
secrets from the Los Alamos weapons lab have been found behind a
copying machine within the lab's top-secret secure area and are
being evaluated, the Energy Department and government sources said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the two hard drives,
believed to be the ones that disappeared more than six weeks ago,
were in an area that apparently had been searched before.
Richardson said investigators are looking into ''inconsistencies''
surrounding the whereabouts of the devices.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has examined the drives for fingerprints and they were
to be examined electronically on Saturday to determine definitely
whether they are those that are missing, and whether they had been
tampered with or the contents copied, said an official who spoke on
condition of not being identified further.
</P>
<P>
   Lab officials have said they ''turned the place upside down''
after the disappearance first was reported and investigators have
not ruled out the possibility that the two drives had been taken
elsewhere since last being seen in April.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
devices were discovered behind a copying machine in the secure and
highly restricted compound -- known as the X Division -- where
nuclear weapons designers work. One officials said while the
general area had been searched before, he was uncertain that anyone
had looked in the exact spot where they were found.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said that while the devices have been found, ''their
authenticity'' still must be evaluated. The FBI's continuing
criminal investigation has found ''strange circumstances and
inconsistencies that are being probed'' as part of the ongoing
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At least a half dozen Los Alamos scientists -- all among two
dozen people with free access to the vault where the devices had
been kept -- have been given polygraph tests and some answers have
raised suspicions among investigators, according to government
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to get to the bottom of why this happened and the
way it happened,'' Richardson said at hastily arranged news
conference in Phoenix, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The two hard drives, which contain an array of nuclear secrets
including highly technical information on the dismantling of U.S.
and foreign nuclear bombs, were used by a nuclear emergency
response team of scientists who worked at the New Mexico lab.
</P>
<P>
   The area where the drives were found ''is being treated as a
crime scene by the FBI,'' the Energy Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic tests will be performed to determine if the drives had
been compromised, one official said. White House chief of staff
John Podesta and National Security Adviser Sandy Berger were
alerted about the discovery, and Podesta was informing President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The disappearance of the hard drives triggered an uproar when
disclosed Monday. The House Intelligence Committee on Friday called
the disappearance ''a major failure'' and a ''potentially
devastating compromise ... in national security.''
</P>
<P>
   The recovery is unlikely to stem the criticism of security
practices at the Energy Department and its weapons lab, especially
Los Alamos which was the focus of another security flap last year
involving former lab scientist Wen Ho Lee. Lee has been accused of
illegally copying secret nuclear weapons computer files and is in
jail awaiting trial on charges of security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the government would ''continue to aggressively
pursue'' the investigation into the disappearance of the two hard
drives. ''This is not a victory speech,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are going to get to the bottom of this incident and we are
going to hold people accountable. There are going to be people
disciplined,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Six Los Alamos managers, including the head of the emergency
response team that used the devices and the head of the lab's
nuclear programs have been put on leave with pay, pending the
completion of the investigations. Several of these managers --
though not the most senior ones -- were aware of the missing drives
on May 7, but did not report it.
</P>
<P>
   The two hard drives, each about the size of a deck of cards,
were used by the Nuclear Emergency Security Team, or NEST, which is
trained to respond to nuclear accidents or nuclear terrorists acts.
They were found missing when two members of the team wanted to make
certain they were safe as a wildfire threatened to engulf the
laboratory on May 7. The next day the lab was shut down and
evacuated, and did not return to normal operations for 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   The drives were last reported seen in the vault on April 7 and
possibly were there as recently as April 27, according to lab and
Energy Department officials. A total of 26 nuclear scientists with
the highest security clearance had unescorted access to the
10-by-20-foot vault, but no procedures were in place to track when
the devices were checked out.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos lab director John Browne said he first learned of the
disappearance on May 31 and then ''ordered the laboratory turned
upside down'' but no trace of the two drives were found. More than
three dozen FBI and DOE investigators descended on the lab in the
first week of June and further searches failed to uncover them.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Bishops Condemn Condom Use  </HEADLINE>
By HAROLD OLMOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian bishops have reaffirmed
the traditional Catholic Church position against the use of
condoms, countering a report that some church leaders were
considering allowing their use to check the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But the bishops' statement irritated government officials who
have been campaigning against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Eugene Rixen, bishop of Goias and a member of the
Brazilian Church's Health Pastoral, sparked a controversy this week
when he said some in the Catholic Church were ''reflecting'' about
allowing use of condoms to fight AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks, led top Brazilian church bishops to issue a
statement reasserting traditional church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Church has not changed its position on this point,'' the
statement issued on Thursday said. ''It is important to remind the
young people that the publicity of contraceptives as a kind of
efficient vaccine against AIDS is fallacious.'' They added that
condoms are only 60-65 percent effective in preventing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The argument represents ''a disservice'' to the Brazilian
population,'' said Paulo Teixeira, coordinator of the Health
Ministry's anti-AIDS program.
</P>
<P>
   He said the bishops' statement had no scientific merit and that
''studies conducted by the World Health Organization prove that
condoms are 95 percent effective against transmission of HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement came after a Vatican official, Monsignor Javier
Lozano Barragan, president of the Vatican's Council of Health,
addressed the meeting in a closed-door session.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil has 200,000 registered cases of HIV, which causes AIDS,
and an estimated 400,000 unreported cases. Both figures are the
hemisphere's second highest after the United States.

<HEADLINE> Carjackers escape after robbery, 25-mile chase  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) - Two men stole $40 in a gunpoint
carjacking Friday before leading police on a high-speed chase that
ended when they jumped from the still-moving vehicle and escaped
into woods, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The men were caught Friday afternoon in Monroe Township,
Gloucester County.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began when the two, driving a silver Toyota
Corolla, approached two couples who were standing next to a 1997
Jeep Cherokee on a street corner.
</P>
<P>
   After turning off the headlights of the Toyota, one of the men
fired a shot at the foursome and stole $40, some jewelry and a
pocketbook from two of them, police Detective Jose Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   One then stole the car and drove off, the other man following in
the Toyota, Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Police broadcast a description of the vehicles and Egg Harbor
Township police spotted it - with two people inside - near Cardiff
Circle, beginning the chase west on U.S. 322, which is known
locally as the Black Horse Pike.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling at more than 80 mph, the black Jeep was chased by Egg
Harbor Township police and State Police west into Monroe Township,
where it turned left onto White Hall Road, striking a sign as it
did so, according to Monroe Township Police Chief Edwin Berwick.
</P>
<P>
   The Jeep headed south on White Hall Road before veering off the
road and entering the White Hall School grounds, where the driver
lost control and the two occupants jumped out while the Jeep was
still moving, fleeing into nearby woods, Berwick said.
</P>
<P>
   The chase route was about 25 miles. Capt. John Pope of the Egg
Harbor Township Police Department said police could have driven
faster but didn't because of safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''We try to drive reasonably and safely. This vehicle was not
doing that,'' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a bigger issue, which is officer safety and other
vehicles. There are limits that we operate within, which they
didn't have. (Police) never lost them, they were never far
behind,'' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the two who escaped were the same two involved in
the carjacking.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe Township authorities warned people in the White Hall Road
area to be on the lookout for the two.
</P>
<P>
   At about 2:30 p.m. Friday, Monroe Township police arrested one
of the suspects after he was seen at a pay phone in a bar parking
lot on the Black Horse Pike. Police said he was making arrangements
to be picked up.
</P>
<P>
   While police were on the scene, his ride arrived and he was
arrested because he had outstanding warrants, Monroe Township
police said. They did not release his name.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspect was arrested on White Hall Road.
</P>
<P>
   The carjacking suspects were identified as Kyle Wynder, 22, and
Antwan Freeman, 27, both of Vineland. Freeman used to live in
Pleasantville near where the carjacking occurred, Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynder and Freeman were turned over to Pleasantville police and
were charged with armed carjacking, weapons offenses, making
terroristic threats, conspiracy and aggravated assault, Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police also will file charges of eluding police and other
charges against the pair, Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynder and Freeman were to be taken to the Atlantic County Jail
in Mays Landing. They were being held on $50,000 cash each.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Empress Dowager Dead at 97  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT STODDARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Empress Dowager Nagako, a witness to Japan's
century, from its drive to catch up with the West to defeat in
World War II and rebirth as one of the world's richest nations,
died Friday. The widow of Japan's Emperor Hirohito was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako began having breathing difficulties early Thursday and
then fell into a coma, dying at home at Tokyo's royal palace, the
Imperial Household Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Much of her life as empress was spent in tumultuous times,''
Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori said. ''Even as society went through
big changes and faced difficult times, she always gave her best.''
</P>
<P>
   Nagako, a princess herself, was a modest wife who always showed
a subject's deference to her husband, but she and Emperor Hirohito
were willing to break tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his predecessors on the Chrysanthemum Throne, the world's
oldest dynasty, Hirohito declined to take an heir-producing
mistress after Nagako gave birth to four girls but no boys. She
later bore two sons, including the present emperor, Akihito, as
well as another daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And in contrast to the rest of Japan's somber royals, Nagako
usually appeared in public with a big smile on her face, waving her
hand in the traditional gentle seesaw royal greeting.
</P>
<P>
   The matronly empress won the affection of the nation in a way
her scholarly, aloof husband never did.
</P>
<P>
   ''Her smiling warmth played an important role in spreading
affection for the imperial family after the war,'' the national
Asahi newspaper said in an editorial Saturday. ''As she grew older,
the public saw her as a gentle, chubby grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
   But tradition is a hallmark of Tokyo's Imperial Palace, and
Japanese media widely reported that Nagako, along with other
members of the royal entourage, treated her daughter-in-law Michiko
harshly, in part because she was the first commoner to become
empress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, change crept into the moated royal enclave at the heart
of Tokyo, with the heir apparent to Emperor Akihito choosing a
career woman as his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Princess Masako did, however, give up her career to marry Crown
Prince Naruhito.
</P>
<P>
   Some see Nagako as a symbol of the palace's more traditional,
more exclusive days.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's the last person from the old system of the imperial
family, and I'm hoping that this will open the door to a new type
of imperial family,'' said Tokyo housewife Sumiko Omori, 66.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako married Hirohito in 1924 at age 20. They had seven
children. Their reign spanned Japan's military conquests in Asia,
defeat in World War II and climb from economic backwater to the
world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
   Hirohito assumed the throne in 1926 as a deity, a direct
descendant of the gods. He renounced his divinity in 1945, as
demanded by World War II's victors. He died on January 7, 1989.
</P>
<P>
   A painter, poet and musician, Nagako specialized in the
traditional arts of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   She has been out of public view for years. Nagako last attended
an official event on April 29, 1987: Hirohito's 86th birthday
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Nagako began to use a wheelchair in 1980 after damaging her
spine at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   Along with footage of Nagako's life, including her marriage to
Hirohito, an appearance at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games and a 1975
visit to the United States, TV news showed Emperor Akihito, Empress
Michiko, Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown Princess Masako arriving
to visit her on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After her death, the imperial family began the 150-day mourning
period, Kyodo News agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Flags throughout Japan were to fly at half-staff Saturday, a
spokesman for the prime minister's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Born March 6, 1903, Nagako was the eldest daughter and third
child of Imperial Prince Kuniyoshi Kuni. At 15, Princess Nagako was
one of several prospective brides selected for Crown Prince
Hirohito. They were married in an elaborate ceremony on Jan. 26,
1924.
</P>
<P>
   She became empress on Dec. 25, 1926, when Hirohito rose to the
throne on the death of his father, Emperor Taisho. Two years later
he was formally enthroned as the 124th emperor of Japan in rites in
the ancient capital of Kyoto.
</P>
<P>
   They were married longer than any imperial couple in Japan's
history -- nearly 65 years.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements were not immediately announced. Officials
at the prime minister's office and the Imperial Household Agency
declined to comment on a Kyodo report that Nagako's funeral will be
held after next month's Group of Eight meeting on Japan's southern
island of Okinawa.

<HEADLINE> Serbian Opposition Leader Wounded  </HEADLINE>
By ALEN MLATISUMA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDVA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serbia's best-known opposition figure
accused President Slobodan Milosevic's regime Friday of trying to
kill him and of transforming Yugoslavia into a ''lawless
concentration camp.'' Montenegro announced the arrest of some
suspects who had trailed Vuk Draskovic from Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement, was grazed in
the head by the shooting around midnight Thursday when gunmen fired
at his home near this coastal town in Montenegro, where he had been
vacationing for two days.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's deputy interior minister said Friday night that
police had arrested an undetermined number of suspects in the
shooting, the latest in a series of attacks against prominent
figures in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The attackers ''followed Draskovic all the way from Serbia with
a murderous intention,'' Vuk Boskovic said
</P>
<P>
   ''We arrested the perpetrators of this crime,'' he said. ''We
seized their weapons, we arrested people who helped them and we
know who ordered the crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Boskovic refused to provide other details, including how many
were detained, but said a full statement would be released
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, his head bandaged from a late-night shooting, said he
was watching television alone in the house when the shooting began.
During an interview with The Associated Press, his left ear and
right temple were bandaged where he said the bullets grazed him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was definitely organized by Serbia's state security,'' a
visibly exhausted Draskovic said at his summer home, where the
walls were riddled with bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Draskovic said he managed to run to a
neighbor's house and call for help. He was brought to a hospital in
Kotor, treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   ''They will persist with attacks,'' Draskovic said. ''They have
turned the country into a lawless concentration camp where
gangland-style killings continue to be the way of governing.''
</P>
<P>
   The government-run Tanjug news agency reported briefly on the
shooting, saying the circumstances were unclear. The agency said
Milosevic's allies in Montenegro urged authorities to find the
assailants ''to prevent speculations and cheap political
trickery.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, however, left little doubt whom he thought
responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is also definitely certain that another decision on my
liquidation could not have been reached without the knowledge of
those who run the country,'' he said. ''And in this case, it is
Slobodan Milosevic and his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic's wife, Danica, said her husband had told police he
was in Montenegro but declined their offer of protection.
Draskovic's four regular bodyguards were arrested by Serbian police
two weeks ago for illegal weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro's police chief, Vukasin Maras, interviewed along with
Draskovic, said police now face attempts by Belgrade to export
''state terrorism'' to Serbia's neighboring republic in the
Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a monstrous conspiracy,'' Maras said.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegrin police said the shooting was carried out by one or
more unidentified assailants who fired at least seven rounds of
.32-caliber ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, other Serbian opposition parties condemned the
shooting, saying it will increase tension and threaten the country
with ''anarchy and chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's foreign and security policy chief, Javier
Solana, said it ''illustrates the sad state of political affairs''
in a country ''where the use of brute force'' has become a standard
method for ''settling political differences.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Draskovic, Russia's foreign minister, Igor
Ivanov, also condemned the ''terrorist attack'' which he said
''threatens the process of democratization in Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the latest in a series of attacks against
prominent figures in Yugoslavia. On May 31, Goran Zugic, the
national security adviser to Montenegrin President Milo Djukanovic,
was gunned down in front of his home in Podgorica.	   In January, Serbia's most
infamous warlord Zeljko Raznatovic,
known as Arkan, was murdered in Belgrade. One month later, Defense
Minister Pavle Bulatovic was shot dead in a restaurant in the
Yugoslav capital.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic survived a road accident in October in which three
party associates, including his brother-in-law, were killed.
Draskovic suffered only minor injuries but called the incident -- a
head-on collision with a truck which swerved out of its lane -- an
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic and his party are considered key Milosevic opponents,
despite occasional cooperation with the Serb strongman. Before last
year's NATO bombing campaign, Draskovic briefly joined Milosevic's
government, but was fired after saying Milosevic was prepared to
bow to Western demands over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the regime dealt Draskovic another blow by taking over
his pro-opposition Studio B television in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has been demanding Milosevic resign and all-out early
elections be held only after free and fair election conditions can
be implemented.

<HEADLINE> Gymnast Miller To Compete  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMOND, Okla. (AP) -- Three months after announcing a comeback,
Olympic gold medalist Shannon Miller is competing this weekend for
the first time in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is taking part in the Gymnastics Challenge 2000 in
Mississauga, Ontario, along with other top gymnasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just want to get back into it,'' Miller said. ''I want to go
out and do the best I can and, hopefully, show that I'm ready for
the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, the most-decorated American gymnast ever, led the U.S.
women's gymnastics team to the gold medal in the Olympics in
Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Challenge 2000, Miller faces gymnasts from China, France,
the Ukraine, Russia, Canada, Australia and South America, most of
whom are Olympic hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   Miller was the only American invited.
</P>
<P>
   ''These will be Olympic-level athletes,'' said her coach, Steve
Nunno. ''We chose to do it because they allowed her to do whatever
events she wants. We need flexibility in the first meet and they
gave it to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said her return hasn't been easy, but she said she and
Nunno have been working to get her back in shape and ready for the
Olympic trials in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not in peak shape, but I don't want to be either,'' she
said. ''Steve has a plan. He wants me to peak at the right time so
I'll be able to perform at the big meets.''

<HEADLINE> One Last Look for Nicklaus  </HEADLINE>
By JIM LITKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Jack Nicklaus pulled his drive left,
bent over to pull the tee out of the ground and looked up in plenty
of time to catch a glimpse of his future.
</P>
<P>
   There, on the fieldstone porch of a multimillion-dollar home
alongside the 11th tee at Pebble Beach, two men in comfortable lawn
chairs stared back.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open is about to become a spectator sport for the man
who played it better than any other -- ever. Nicklaus said so
himself. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd say there's a pretty good chance this is the last,'' he
started, then stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very slim that I would play again. ... This place in many
ways started my golf game and almost 40 years later, maybe it's a
fitting place to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a minute or so later, when someone asked Nicklaus
about whether he'd ever consider coming back if the U.S. Golf
Association extended yet one more exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well,'' he began, ''if I won the Senior Open and I was playing
well and ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Stop right there, Jack.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's disappointing not making the cut, but it would be
hard to imagine a more fitting goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   On a sun-splashed afternoon, on the prettiest piece of ground
golf is played on, Nicklaus made a farewell tour and should leave
it at that.
</P>
<P>
   He had his oldest son, Jackie, toting his bag and his wife,
Barbara, standing behind the 18th green, red-eyed with tears, to
give him one last U.S. Open hug.
</P>
<P>
   ''He always said if he could play one last round, he wanted to
play Pebble Beach,'' she said. ''Obviously, he wanted to play four
rounds, but it was still wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus tried to say as much himself several times, but the
words wouldn't come out exactly that way.
</P>
<P>
   The hair is thinner and the middle thicker than when he was the
most fearsome presence in the game. But people who expect him to be
pleased with any effort have no idea what Jack is made of; even
now, concession speeches have to be wrung from him.
</P>
<P>
   At the Masters two years ago, the people in charge at Augusta
National honored 40 years of Nicklaus by putting his name on a
bronze plaque. An hour into Sunday's final round, he stubbornly put
it back on the leaderboard. Afterward, when his quest came up four
strokes short, the then-58-year-old Nicklaus took a seat in the
interview room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be pretty stupid to say I wasn't thrilled,'' he said
at the time. ''But I'd also be dishonest to say I wasn't
disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday's final tour of Pebble Beach, Nicklaus was mortified
at moments, disgusted at others, humbled by a few, but finally
touched. He was applauded at every green and nearly every fairway,
but the truth is there were precious few shots worth clapping for
on his way to a round of 11-over par -- Nicklaus' worst Open score
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the cruelty golf inflicts, it also allows for a
graceful exit. And for once, with 44 Opens come and gone, Nicklaus
availed himself of that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus was one of 75 golfers out on the course when fog
postponed completion of the first round. He played nine holes
Friday morning and when he arrived at the 18th tee a second time
late in the afternoon, he prowled the tee box and finally sat down
on a fence at the back.
</P>
<P>
   ''I took one big last look at it,'' he said. ''I was hoping
somebody would take a picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Nicklaus turned to Jackie and said he was going for the
green in two at the 543-yard, par-5 hole. He hadn't even attempted
the feat in 20 years, yet there was nothing but memories left to
play for.
</P>
<P>
   Sentiment props up a legend for only so long, but in this case
it was just long enough. Nicklaus drove his tee ball to the middle
of the fairway and airmailed a 3-wood to just in front of the
green. From there, accompanied by a growing roar, the ball rolled
to within 50 feet of the flag.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Nicklaus caught up with it, everybody in the
bleachers was standing and Nicklaus uncharacteristically milked the
moment for all it was worth. He pretended to be surprised to find
out he'd reached the green and he then stepped out of his putting
crouch when a seagull flying by squawked a goodbye of his own. Back
on the 18th fairway, meanwhile, old foe Tom Watson was applauding
and fighting back a few tears of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jackie told the old man to read the final putt himself.
Nicklaus missed.
</P>
<P>
   ''My eyes were blurry and I was trying to go through the
moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For just a heartbeat, you could sense how special this all was,
but Jack being Jack, he couldn't let it go.
</P>
<P>
   ''And,'' he finished, ''I topped the darned putt.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Phillies 2, Braves 1  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Curt Schilling won for the first time in
over a month, striking out a season-high 11 Friday night to lead
the Philadelphia Phillies over Tom Glavine and the Atlanta Braves
2-1.
</P>
<P>
   The ace of the Phillies' staff, Schilling had the team's highest
ERA coming in (6.34), which prompted him to throw extra batting
practice Monday, a day after his previous start.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (2-4), backed by Mike Lieberthal's two-run homer,
allowed five hits in eight innings and walked two, reaching double
digits in strikeouts for the first time since last July 4. He
lowered his ERA to 5.62.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, he fanned Chipper Jones and Andres Galarraga with
no outs and runners on first and third. After a walk to Brian
Jordan loaded the bases, he struck out Javier Lopez. Jeff Brantley
finished for his seventh save in seven chances.
</P>
<P>
   Since shutting out the Braves on 11 hits on May 7 -- his second
start following offseason shoulder surgery -- Schilling had been 0-4
with an 8.05 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   While he is 2-0 with a 1.64 ERA against the Braves, the
33-year-old right-hander is 0-4 with an 8.07 ERA in his other
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones gave Atlanta a 1-0 lead in the fourth with his
15th homer, but Lieberthal homered off the backdrop in left-center
following Mickey Morandini's leadoff single in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine (7-3) allowed just four hits in eight innings, struck
out five and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling struck out six in the first five innings, his fastball
reaching 96 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine retired nine of 10 before Morandini's single in the
fourth. He allowed only one hit after Lieberthal's homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: Schilling has reached double digits in strikeouts 47 times.
... Seven of Atlanta's last nine batters struck out. ... Lieberthal
threw out Veras in the first inning and has nailed seven of the
last 10 runners attempting to steal. ... Jones extended his hitting
streak to 15 with the homer. ... The game marked the first time two
University of Pennsylvania alums faced each other in the majors.
Phillies center fielder Doug Glanville and Atlanta shortstop Mark
DeRosa both played baseball for the Quakers. DeRosa also played
quarterback for Penn. ... Desi Relaford committed two errors. He
leads the majors with 18 despite being the last starting shortstop
in the NL to make an error this season.

<HEADLINE> Journalists' group criticizes police tactic of posing as TV reporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Committee to Protect Journalists on Friday
criticized police in New Jersey and Luxembourg for posing as
television crews during separate hostage crises.
</P>
<P>
   Even when carrying journalists' cameras seems necessary to stop
a crime, police must realize they risk endangering real reporters,
said the group, a non-profit organization that works to safeguard
press freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such actions compromise the perceived independence of all
journalists and increase the risks they face daily in covering
dangerous news stories,'' executive director Ann Cooper said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The committee criticized Newark, N.J., police for taking a
camera from a New Jersey Network news crew when a man allegedly
holding his 9-year-old son hostage demanded to be interviewed on
television. Police said the tactic helped save the boy's life.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Ali Kemoum killed his wife and mother-in-law Tuesday
and then held his son hostage for several hours, refusing to
negotiate until he could talk to a TV reporter. Officers borrowed a
camera from an NJN crew, and one posed as a reporter to interview
him.
</P>
<P>
   Kemoum released his son and was later charged with murder,
kidnapping and weapons offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ''While we understand that police often find themselves in
desperate situations, and that some law experts believe the
confiscation of a camera in such a situation is legal, we hope this
disturbing tactic does not become a trend,'' Cooper said. ''These
actions might very well serve to target journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Newark police defended their strategy, saying the camera helped
calm Kemoum and save his son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of an undercover police officer as a reporter was
pivotal in bringing a peaceful end to a six-hour tragedy,'' the
department said in a statement. ''Having an unarmed civilian, who
has not been trained in hostage situations, go inside of the house
for an interview, would give the suspect an opportunity to take a
second hostage or kill a third person.''
</P>
<P>
   The Newark incident came two weeks after police in Luxembourg
posed as a TV crew to lure a gunman into an ambush and end a
hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
   When the gunman emerged for an ''interview'' June 1 holding a
child in one arm and a grenade in the other, police posing as
cameramen killed him. Three adults and 25 children held hostage for
about 30 hours were rescued.
</P>
<P>
   The Brussels-based International Federation of Journalists also
criticized the police tactic. But Luxembourg police defended the
strategy, saying it minimized the threat to the hostages.

<P>
	   VESTAL, N.Y. (AP) - A 73-year-old motorcyclist remained in
critical condition Friday night after he flipped over a bridge and
fell 60 feet to the Susquehanna River.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred about 3:45 p.m. in the eastbound lane of
The River Bridge carrying Route 17 between Vestal and Endwell.
</P>
<P>
   Kimball Carroll of Endicott was riding his 1983 Suzuki
motorcycle to a routine inspection when he hit the curb and flipped
over the side, leaving the motorcycle on the bridge, investigators
told the Binghamton Press &AMP; Sun-Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   Within 5 minutes, police and fire departments from surrounding
towns were tracking Carroll - still wearing his white motorcycle
helmet - downstream. He was pulled out about 4 p.m. at a park about
a mile downstream, brought ashore by a hovercraft.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue personnel performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. State
police told the newspaper rescuers could not find vital signs until
about 4:15 p.m.

conference on Friday, Cuba said it would step up production of
sugar derivatives such as alcohol and animal feed.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Vice Minister Nelson Labrada, speaking on the last day of
the conference, said Cuba needs ''a diversification, a sufficient
capacity for flexibility'' to weather the ups and downs of world
sugar prices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Labrada said, about 15 percent of Cuba's sugar income
comes from about 30 different types of derivatives, including rum
and animal feed. Over the long term, Cuba aims to increase that to
40 or 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To cut costs in sugar production, Cuba also hopes to
increasingly replace petroleum with electrical energy and other
types of renewable, cheaper energy, the vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Although no longer Cuba's No. 1 source of hard currency, sugar
remains a key part of the communist island's economy -- accounting
for about half of all export income.
</P>
<P>
   Efficiency and diversification were explored during the four-day
conference that wrapped up Friday at Havana's convention center.
</P>
<P>
   With half the island's export income still coming from sugar,
Cuba has been hard hit by low prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 delegates from countries including Brazil, Canada,
Colombia, France, India and Great Britain attended the 6th
International Congress on Sugar and Sugar Cane Byproducts,
conference organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government also held a trade fair to show off the
latest equipment and techniques for sugar production as well as new
possibilities for the use of sugar and its byproducts.

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Reacts To Secrets Found  </HEADLINE>
By DEBORAH BAKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- It was good news, but not surprising
news, to people in Los Alamos when they heard that missing computer
hard drives from Los Alamos National Laboratory were found behind a
lab copying machine.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very understandable. I could have done it myself,'' lab
employee Albert Charmatz said as he was leaving work late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're going out to copy classified material ... and you're
in a hurry, I can see laying it aside and it falls off the back,''
Charmatz said, especially if it happened right before May 8, when
the lab was evacuated because of a raging wildfire. The lab was
reopened May 22.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not too surprised that it was found in a place where
people were doing legitimate work,'' Charmatz said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people thought the incident was blown out of proportion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like the airlines. They can have a million flights land
safely every day, but the one that crashes, even if no one's hurt,
that's what's going to make the news,'' said Ellen Green, who works
at a youth activities center in Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   Many people approached about the latest news about the missing
secrets case in this company town declined to comment Friday. Some
said they didn't know enough about it, others felt it wasn't their
place to talk.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every family here gets a paycheck from the lab, or does
business with it. The lab work force of 7,000 includes hundreds of
Ph.Ds making up one of the wealthiest, best-educated communities in
the country.

<HEADLINE> Orioles 4, Angels 3  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Albert Belle homered twice for the second
straight night and drove in four runs as the Baltimore Orioles
extended their winning streak to six by beating the Anaheim Angels
4-3 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Belle, who hit grand slams on successive nights against Texas on
Wednesday and Thursday, has five homers and 14 RBIs in his last
three games and nine homers in his last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Belle hit a three-run homer to put the Orioles up 3-0 in the
first inning and added a solo shot in the third to make it 4-1.
That gave him three homers in three at-bats, including his final
trip to the plate Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He was walked intentionally in the fifth and popped out in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Mussina (5-6) allowed two runs and eight hits in 6 2-3
innings to win his fourth straight decision. He struck out six and
walked two in improving to 12-4 against the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Timlin, the fourth Baltimore pitcher, gave up a run-scoring
groundout to Darin Erstad before retiring Kevin Stocker on a
groundout with the potential tying run on third for his seventh
save.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson had a single and three walks for the Orioles,
whose six-game winning streak matched their longest this season.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro had two hits and an RBI for the Angels, who
have lost three straight for the first time this season. Starter
Scott Schoeneweis (5-5), who gave up both of Belle's homers, left
in the fourth inning with a strained right ribcage.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson led off the first inning with a walk and B.J. Surhoff
hit a one-out single before Belle sent a drive to left that eluded
the glove of a leaping Palmeiro and landed in the hands of a fan in
the front row of seats.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy doubled and scored on a two-out single by Palmeiro
in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Belle hit his 15th homer in the third on a 2-0 count. He has hit
in 16 of his last 17 games, going 28-for-64 (.438) with 10 homers
and 25 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim made it 4-2 and chased Mussina in the seventh. Bengie
Molina singled, took third on a double by Palmeiro and scored on a
groundout by Erstad.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Belle has seven homers and 20 RBIs in seven games during
the homestand. ... Mo Vaughn, who came in with a .339 average
against Mussina, went 0-for-2 with two strikeouts and a walk. ...
Mussina is 3-0 with a 2.61 ERA in June. ... The Angels lost two in
a row 11 times this season before finally losing a third straight.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lead Lakers by 19 at Half  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose scored 22 points and Reggie
Miller added 18 as the Indiana Pacers took a 64-45 lead over the
Los Angeles Lakers at halftime of Game 5 in the NBA Finals Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Eight 3-pointers, including four by Rose and three by Miller,
helped Indiana take leads of up to 20 points in the second quarter
as the Pacers made a strong bid to stay alive in the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight baskets by Rose, including his fourth 3-pointer,
gave Indiana a 46-32 lead midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best, who bruised his shoulder in Game 4 and was
questionable until game time, scored two straight baskets in the
second quarter to push the Pacers' lead to 50-35. Rose then scored
two straight for a 54-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing minutes of the half, Miller scored a basket and
then hit two free throws after Kobe Bryant picked up his third
foul. The biggest lead for Indiana was at 64-44 before Shaquille
O'Neal hit one of two free throws with 10 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers shot 75 percent and hit all six of their 3-point
attempts in the first quarter, which ended with them ahead 39-28.
The Lakers' only lead was after Glen Rice hit one of two free
throws at the start of the game to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   A basket by Miller, a rebound basket by Rik Smits and the first
3-pointer by Miller gave the Pacers a 7-1 lead before the first Los
Angeles basket, a 3-pointer by Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which leads the series 3-1, tied the game at 9. But
two free throws by Smits and the first 3-pointer by Rose started
another big Indiana run.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Miller hit his second 3-pointer and was
fouled by Harper on the play. He hit the free throw to complete the
four-point play for a 22-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second 3-pointer by Rose made it 32-21, and his third
3-pointer in the closing seconds gave Indiana a 37-26 lead before
offsetting baskets by Robert Horry and Mark Jackson at the end.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 19 points for the Lakers, who shot 45 percent for the
half. No one else had more than seven points for the Lakers, and
Bryant had 6 points on 3-for-9 shooting.

<HEADLINE> Chiapas Expelled Man Wins Appeal  </HEADLINE>
By ALEJANDRO RUIZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- A Denver man won a
court battle Friday against a Mexican immigration policy that
critics claim punishes foreign supporters of leftist rebels in the
southern state of Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   District Judge Walter Arrellano threw out an order from Mexican
immigration officials to expel Kerry Appel from the country.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican immigration officials had ordered Appel to leave Mexico
after he attended a New Year's celebration in San Andres
Larrainzar, a town north of this city, sponsored by the Zapatista
National Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision of the authorities of the National Immigration
Institute was unfounded,'' Appel's lawyer Jose Montero said.
</P>
<P>
   Appel is one of hundreds of foreigner supporters of the region's
Zapatista rebels who have been ordered out of Mexico over the past
four years. But it was unclear if his decision would affect similar
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Another U.S. citizen expelled earlier, Tom Hansen of the Mexico
Solidarity Network, also won a court victory last year, but the
government promptly re-wrote his expulsion order and expelled him
again. Hansen appealed those actions but lost an appeal to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The government denies targeting supporters of the Zapatistas,
who have attracted widespread international backing after leading
an uprising in 1994 to fight for democracy and demand greater
Indian rights. But most of those expelled have been members of
Zapatista support networks or human rights organizations abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Appel was summoned on Jan. 3 to immigration offices along with
several other foreigners suspected of violating their visas.
</P>
<P>
   The government accuses expelled foreigners of violating terms of
their visas by meddling in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's Immigration Institute has 15 days to appeal the
decision.

Los Alamos Nuclear Secrets Found
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department and government sources said two
computer hard drives containing nuclear secrets from the Los Alamos weapons lab
have been found behind a copying machine within the lab's top-secret secure area
and are being evaluated. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the two hard
drives, which disappeared more than six weeks ago, were found today in an area
that apparently had been searched before. Richardson said investigators are
looking into ''inconsistencies'' surrounding the whereabouts of the devices.
They have not ruled out the possibility that the two drives had been taken
elsewhere since last being seen in April.

   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Name-calling on the world's most heavily armed

Relations between the two have warmed since this week's summit, when the Koreas'
leaders pledged to work together to end half a century of hostilities and unite
families separated by the Korean War. During the three-day summit, which ended
Thursday, North Korean leader Kim Jong Il ordered his state-controlled media and
military to stop all anti-South propaganda. South Korea reciprocated Friday.

Nations has confirmed the Israeli withdrawal is complete. That announcement is

Lebanese forces restore peace and regain authority in the region.

<HEADLINE> Twins 7, Mariners 2  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Cristian Guzman had a career-high four hits
and knocked in three runs and Brad Radke finally benefited from run
support as the Minnesota Twins beat the Seattle Mariners 7-2 Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Radke (4-8) snapped a four-game losing streak and won for the
first time since May 19. He gave up two runs on four hits, walked
three and struck out seven in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Three of Guzman's hits and all three of his RBIs came off Aaron
Sele (7-3), who lost for the first time since May 5. He allowed
five earned runs on 10 hits and four walks in just four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Guzman's major league-leading 11th triple drove in two runs
during a four-run fourth inning that gave Minnesota a 5-2 lead. He
also had an RBI single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, who was 12-2 with a 2.72 ERA against the Twins in his
career, also surrendered an RBI double to Jacque Jones and a
run-scoring single to Ron Coomer in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Coomer added a two-run double off Frank Rodriguez in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron's RBI single in the first and Tom Lampkin's fifth
homer in the third gave Seattle a 2-0 lead.
Notes: Matt Lawton walked four times for the Twins. ... In the
first two innings, the Twins were caught stealing twice and ended a
potential rally when Corey Koskie was struck by a ground ball off
Marcus Jensen's bat. ... Guzman is just five triples shy of the
Twins' single-season club record of 16 set by Rod Carew in 1977.
... Minnesota's 24 triples are best in the AL and second-best in
the majors behind Colorado's 30. ... The Twins, stung by criticism
that their 5,000 Harmon Killebrew bobble head dolls last week was
woefully low, double the number they'll give away of Tony Oliva
(July 21) and Kirby Puckett (Aug. 13). They didn't have enough time
to double the order for the Kent Hrbek model this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Civil rights panel finds New York police use racial profiling  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The New York Police Department improperly uses
racial profiling to stop and question people, the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights concluded Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This police tactic is a factor in the racial tensions that can
lead to ''tragic and unnecessary'' incidents like the shooting of
Amadou Diallo, according to a report approved 6-2 by the advisory
panel.
</P>
<P>
   The report also calls into question department training and
recruitment of black and Hispanic officers. It recommends creation
of an independent office to investigate accusations that police
wrongly used deadly force.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has embarrassed
itself by releasing a report that bears no relation to reality,''
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the commission was formed to study his police
department's practices in the aftermath of the Amadou Diallo
shooting, and since then it has ''held only one meeting, conducted
over the course of a single day.''
</P>
<P>
   That, plus the acquittal of the four officers involved in
Diallo's shooting, calls into question the validity of the
commission's report, Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir described the report as
inaccurate and shoddy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We provided a 700-page report with facts regarding the report,
and I believe the Civil Rights Commission has voted to append our
response to the report, which will be the only accurate part of
that report,'' he said. ''What I had hoped is they would have taken
the information contained in our response and amended their report.
However, they are obviously too lazy or not skilled enough to do
so.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing the department's ''stop and frisk'' tactics, the
report found that blacks and Hispanics were stopped far out of
proportion to their representation in a given community. For
example, 51 percent of people stopped and searched in the Staten
Island in 1998 were black, while the borough's population is only 9
percent black.
</P>
<P>
   The commission chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, said evidence
indicated that such rates of minority searches belied police
contentions that blacks and Hispanics were stopped more frequently
because they matched the descriptions of crime victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''They simply stop who they think they should stop,'' Berry
said, reading from the report. ''The NYPD needs to be careful not
to engage in racial profiling of this sort. ... It not only
violates the law but undermines respect for the police and can
cause deadly altercations, as in the tragic and unnecessary police
shooting of Amadou Diallo.''
</P>
<P>
   Diallo was shot and killed outside his Bronx home on Feb. 4,
1999, struck 19 times in a hail of 41 shots from police officers.
The four officers involved in the shooting were acquitted earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members Carl Anderson and Russell Redenbaugh voted
against the report.
</P>
<P>
   Like Giuliani and top city police officials, Redenbaugh said he
did not think the conclusions of racial profiling were supported by
the facts. He also gave officials credit for New York's sharp drop
in murder and other serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The notion that the racial mix of who you stop ought to
resemble the racial mix of the people in the neighborhood is a
specious use of statistics,'' Redenbaugh said. ''I don't know if
there is racial profiling or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report also found that unlike other major
cities, New York's police department has not fully adopted
community policing practices that minimize racial tensions and that
its training program ''reinforces stereotypes instead of
undermining them.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended police recruits earn at least a
two-year college degree. The commission found that officers without
that minimum education level are more likely to have misconduct
complaints.

<HEADLINE> Mets 7, Brewers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Al Leiter allowed three hits in eight innings
and Benny Agbayani had a leadoff homer and three RBIs as the New
York Mets beat the Milwaukee Brewers for the ninth straight time,
7-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (8-1) struck out seven and walked three, winning his
third straight start. He is unbeaten against the Brewers since June
27, 1994, when he was with Toronto and Milwaukee was in the
American League.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani's first career leadoff homer gave him home runs in
three consecutive plate appearances, the first Mets player to
accomplish the feat since Gary Carter at San Diego on Sept. 3,
1985.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza's 18th homer, a two-run shot in the sixth off Steve
Woodard, helped the Mets improve to 17-3 against Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Haynes (7-5) allowed four runs and nine hits in five
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mets right fielder Derek Bell made a nice sliding catch on
Jeromy Burnitz's sinking liner, ending the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton singled in the second and took third when third
baseman Jose Hernandez misplayed Melvin Mora's grounder for an
error. Leiter sacrificed, and Agbayani hit a slow roller between
first and second that rolled into the outfield for a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Consecutive doubles by Payton and Mora made it 4-0 in the third.
James Mouton hit an RBI single in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura had a run-scoring single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Brewers C Henry Blanco struck out pinch hitting in the
fifth. He had missed 12 games to be with his father, who died
Saturday in Venezuela. ... The Mets are 12-1 when Leiter pitches.
... The Brewers are 5-13 against left-handed starters. ... The
Brewers activated OF Lyle Mouton from the 15-day DL and designated
INF Sean Berry for assignment.

   BOSTON (AP) -- The Toronto Blue Jays placed catcher Darrin
Fletcher on the disabled list with a right shoulder strain on
Friday night, a move retroactive to last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto moved outfielder Dewayne Wise from the 15- to the 60-day
DL and purchased the contract of catcher Charlie Greene from
Triple-A Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The moves were made after Toronto's 7-4 loss to the Boston Red
Sox.

<HEADLINE> 500,000 Oil Barrels Go to Refinery  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in two days, the Energy
Department directed that 500,000 barrels of crude oil be taken from
the government emergency reserve and provided to a Gulf Coast
refinery that has been cut off from tanker deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   The department said it would provide the oil to the Conoco Inc.,
refinery at West Lake, La., to replace crude oil that is prevented
from reaching the refinery because of a blockage in the Calcasieu
ship channel near Lake Charles.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Conoco agrees to return to the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve an equivalent value of crude oil once the
shipping lanes are reopened. The first shipments of government oil
will be made to the Conoco refinery on Sunday, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department announced a similar arrangement on
Thursday with the Citgo refinery near Lake Charles. The government
reserve is not far from the two refineries.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are taking this action to avert a possible shortfall in
gasoline and diesel fuel to American consumers at a time when
supplies for these fuels are already tight,'' said Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Conoco and Citgo refineries were cut off from normal
tanker deliveries this week when a commercial dry dock collapsed
into the shipping channel just north of the Intracoastal Waterway.
Only a small amount of oil is being withdrawn from tankers and
moved around the blockage by barge.
</P>
<P>
   The oil from the government reserve will keep the refineries
running at normal capacity until the blockage is removed,
department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The last oil exchange involving Strategic Petroleum Reserve,
which contains nearly 600 million barrels of oil, was in May 1996,
when 900,000 barrels was lent to Arco because of a blocked
pipeline. An exchange is different from a decision to sell oil from
the reserve, something the Clinton administration has declined to
do, saying the oil should only be used to address severe supply
disruptions.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 7, Blue Jays 4  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Carl Everett and Brian Daubach hit back-to-back
homers and Hipolito Pichardo rescued Pete Schourek from a shaky
start on Friday night as the Boston Red Sox beat the Toronto Blue
Jays 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi hit a two-run homer in the first inning to give
Toronto the lead, but Kelvim Escobar (5-8) gave back five runs in
the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek he gave up two runs in the third to cut Boston's lead
to 5-4 and then loaded the bases with two out in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo (2-0) came on and struck out Tony Batista to end the
inning. The Red Sox reliever pitched 2 1-3 scoreless innings,
allowing two hits and an intentional walk while striking out three.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces pitched two scoreless innings and Derek Lowe pitched
the ninth for his 16th save. Nomar Garciaparra drove in three runs
as the Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East, a half-game
ahead of the Yankees, who lost 3-1 to the White Sox .
</P>
<P>
   Escobar settled down after the first, shutting Boston out before
leaving with a 5-4 deficit with one out and one on in the seventh.
He was charged with six runs on nine hits and two walks, striking
out six.
</P>
<P>
   But it looked like he might never make it out of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman flied out to left for the first out, then Jeff
Frye singled and Trot Nixon doubled, both of them scoring on
Garciaparra's single off the Green Monster. Everett followed with
his 22nd homer, and Daubach hit his 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Troy O'Leary walked and Wilton Veras singled, then Scott
Hatteberg flied out to right field. O'Leary tagged up, and he
appeared to score when Mondesi's throw eluded Batista at third and
Batista kicked it into the Toronto dugout.
</P>
<P>
   But Toronto appealed, and the umpires ruled O'Leary left second
too early. That erased the run and the error, and ended the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Pichardo had a rocky start with the Red Sox, failing to retire a
batter in his only other Fenway Park appearance on May 31, when he
was recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket. But in six outings since
then, he has trimmed his infinite ERA to 2.13, allowing just two
more runs in 12 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Mondesi's first-inning home run on Friday night helped
Toronto set a club record with homers in 15 consecutive games. It
was Mondesi's 13th of the year. ... Frye has hit safely in 10
consecutive games, and 22 of the last 23. ... Daubach had just nine
hits in his last 56 at-bats before homering in the first inning.
... The back-to-back homers by Carl Everett and Daubach were
Boston's fifth consecutive homers of the year. ... Offerman has
reached base safely in 17 consecutive games. ... Everett homered
for the sixth consecutive home game. ... The crowd of 33,638 was
the biggest at Fenway this season.

<HEADLINE> Wild Throws Plague Yanks' Knoblauch  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chuck Knoblauch walked into Yankee Stadium on
Friday with a new outlook.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees' second baseman joked with reporters,
laughed with teammates during pregame stretching drills and
playfully tackled Clay Bellinger as he rounded the bases during
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   What a difference from a night earlier, when Knoblauch stood
alone near second base following his career-high third error while
his teammates gathered at the mound for a pitching change.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, he summoned manager Joe Torre into the
dugout tunnel, said ''I'm tired of hurting this team,'' and was
sent home three innings early -- with a driver instead of in his own
car.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wasn't going to go home and do something stupid,'' said
Knoblauch, who led off and started at second base Friday against
the Chicago White Sox. ''I'm the same guy every day. I woke up
today, felt all right, looked outside and the sun was shining.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch's latest bout with throwing woes clearly had the
Yankees worried. Torre sent him home early Thursday and kept the
clubhouse closed for 20 extra minutes to meet with his second
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all felt for him,'' Torre said. ''He was hurting last
night. We're here to support him. He's one of our players and we
want him to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said most of his teammates called him Thursday night
or Friday to show their support. Many were worried because of his
reaction to one bad throw last month in Chicago, when he said he
was close to his ''breaking point.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It wasn't like Chicago,'' he said. ''It was a little
different. There were different type of errors. I threw these balls
hard, but they were just wild. It was a different frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch didn't know what frame of mind he was in during the
sixth inning Thursday. After his third error, Knoblauch stood
motionless at his position, hands on his hips.
</P>
<P>
   ''It bothered me,'' Torre said. ''I wasn't angry. I felt bad for
him. I knew he had this guilt about what was happening and he felt
he was contributing to us losing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the inning, Knoblauch returned to the dugout. He motioned
to Torre, and the two headed toward the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ''My first instinct was to hug him and make everything feel
good,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, wanting to spare his second baseman the ordeal of
postgame questioning by reporters, told Knoblauch to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's throwing woes were the talk of the town Friday.
Tabloid headlines read, ''CHUCK-E-E-E,'' ''Yip-EEE'' and
''YANKED.'' There was only one major topic on sports radio
stations, with callers suggesting all sorts of solutions to
Knoblauch's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't want to be anywhere else,'' he said. ''Whether I'm
under the microscope or not under the microscope it still is a
problem. It won't go away if I'm not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who was booed after his errors on Thursday night, got
a 20-second standing ovation before his first at-bat Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They treated him well and deservedly so,'' teammate Derek
Jeter said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch went 2-for-4 and only got one popup in the field
before being replaced by Clay Bellinger to start the ninth in New
York's 3-1 loss.
</P>
<P>
   ''It probably would have been better if I did get some
grounders,'' he said. ''But I felt pretty comfortable out there for
whatever reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense wasn't always a problem for Knoblauch. He made only
eight errors in 1996, then won the Gold Glove with Minnesota in
1997, a season that included a 47-game errorless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble began to show as soon as he joined the Yankees in 1998.
He made 13 errors his first season, doubled the total to 26 last
year -- most in the majors by a second baseman and most by a Yankee
since Graig Nettles in 1973. He has 12 in his first 43 games this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you make mistakes or errors, you can accept it,'' he
said. ''But I can't accept the errors I made last night. These are
errors that shouldn't be made. I have a problem obviously. It
confuses the hell out of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Zaichowsky, a sports psychologist at Boston University,
thinks Knoblauch should seek professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most players don't think consciously about a throw. But make a
couple of bad ones and you start dwelling on it,'' Zaichowsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, who talked about seeing a hypnotist or psychologist
during the offseason, wouldn't say whether he had sought help in
the past but hinted he would now.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, with the Yankees something will take place,'' he
said. ''Whatever road that is remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The player remembered for his heady, fundamental play in
Minnesota is now being defined by his mistakes: his inability to
make the simplest of throws, and for arguing with the umpire while
the winning run scored in Game 2 of the 1998 ALCS against
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But the four-time All-Star has also been a key component of New
York's consecutive World Series titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not winning without Chuck. That's the bottom line,''
said Jeter, one of Knoblauch's closest friends on the team.
''Everyone focuses on the balls he throws away, but the positives
outweigh the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   The inability to throw the ball has claimed a number of
promising careers. Steve Sax, also a second baseman, struggled with
the same problem while playing for the Los Angeles Dodgers and
Knoblauch sought him out for advice during last year's Series.
Catcher Mackey Sasser had trouble throwing balls back to the mound.
A similar problem caused Dale Murphy to be switched from catcher to
the outfield, where he became a two-time NL MVP and All-Star.

<HEADLINE> Police continue manhunt for suspects in Central Park attacks  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Two young men on their lunch break studied the
newspapers Friday, scrutinizing photos of suspects police believe
participated in Sunday's attacks on girls and women in Central
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're just looking to see if we know anyone,'' said Rudy Ruiz,
20, of the Bronx. ''If we do, we're turning them in for the reward
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Police believe up to 60 men were responsible for the harassment,
molestation and in some cases robbery of 47 women, ranging in age
from 14 to 40, including four tourists. On Friday, they released 17
more photos in hopes of adding to their arrest tally of 16. There
are videotapes of the 17 additional suspects committing crimes,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz and his friend were ready to help.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care if the person they're looking for is a good
friend - what they did was wrong and they should be punished,''
Ruiz said. ''And the money does not hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 men arrested so far, four have been found after people
called the NYPD's Crime Stoppers hotline. They were identified as:
John Taylor, 24, of Queens; Isaias Lozano, 20, of Queens; Manuel
Nunez, 18, of the Bronx; and Isaial Forbes, 18, of Queens.
</P>
<P>
   If these suspects are indicted, the police will pay tipsters
$2,000 each. If they're convicted, the city will kick in $10,000
for each.
</P>
<P>
   Nine suspects have surrendered. They were identified as: Steven
Burt, 32, of Jersey City, N.J.; Roberto Camacho, 16, of Inwood, on
Long Island; Julio de la Cruz, 22, of North Bergen, N.J.; Manuel
Vargas, 18, of the Bronx; Leslie Marcano, 19, of the Bronx; Mark
Daniels, 21, of Irvington, N.J.; Anthony Bryant, 25, of Manhattan;
Soto Jensen, 16, of Brooklyn; and Trevor Britton, 29, of Brooklyn.
All surrendered after seeing their photos either in newspapers or
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances of the arrest of David Garcia, 33, of the
Bronx, were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspects - David Rowe, 24, of Hempstead, on Long Island, and
Tremayne Bain, 23, of Brooklyn - were nabbed on Sunday after a
victim identified them.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir thanked the public for its
help, and asked people to continue to call the hotline at
800-577-TIPS.
</P>
<P>
   ''We even got a call from Italy this morning, from an Italian
tourist who was in the park that day who called to give us some
information,'' Safir said, adding that the tourist was a witness to
some of the attacks and was helpful. He declined to go into
specifics about the call.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 people caught, Safir said some have records, others do
not, and most did not know each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears to be something that happened relatively
spontaneously, and apparently some of them did not really recognize
the seriousness of the matters they were involved in,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 75 detectives have been assigned full-time to
identifying and nabbing the suspects, Internal Affairs
investigators are focusing on whether any officers failed to help
victims.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 police officers and supervisors assigned to patrol the
area where the attacks occurred have been interviewed, Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without prejudging, my sense is we'll probably find four or
five police officers who acted inappropriately while the vast
majority of them acted appropriately,'' he said. ''Those police
officers who acted inappropriately will be subject to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir said police have spoken to the seven victims who said they
were the ones to first notify police of the attacks. Five said the
police acted responsibly, and two said they did not.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the arrested were arraigned Friday night on first-degree
sex abuse and riot charges. A sixth man was expected to be
arraigned later Friday night, and five others through the weekend.
The District Attorney's office would determine the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The five arraigned Friday were held on bails ranging from
$30,000 to $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe and Bain, who are friends, have been charged with
second-degree aggravated sexual abuse, first-degree sexual abuse
and second-degree robbery. Their case has been adjourned to Aug. 1,
and their attorneys continued to maintain their innocence. Both are
free after each posted $10,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, during his weekly radio address, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani urged residents and tourists to flock to the city's parks.
He again called the attacks a travesty, but said the majority of
officers did their jobs that day. Only one caller referred to the
attacks, asking the mayor to clarify some news reports, which he
termed ''somewhat exaggerated and mischaracterized.''
</P>
<P>
   He ended his show by saying: ''Make sure you get out into the
park, enjoy yourself, have a great weekend.''

<HEADLINE> Horn of Africa Peace Is Fragile  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW ENGLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- As Ethiopia prepared to sign a
partial peace accord with its enemy Eritrea, doubts lingered in the
streets of its capital Friday that the ruinous conflict would end
anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   The two Horn of Africa foes are scheduled to sign an agreement
Sunday in Algeria ending hostilities in their 25-month border war.
Negotiations over delineating their bitterly disputed frontier are
to follow, an uncertain undertaking that could easily trigger
further fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia insists it will not withdraw its troops from Eritrean
territory until U.N. peacekeepers are deployed in a buffer zone
along the border. If clashes flare there again, Ethiopians already
know who to blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's simple because outside this country our neighbors know
the problem -- Eritrea is crazy,'' said Abebe Siyer, standing in the
souvenir shop where he works. ''He (Eritrean President Isaias
Afwerki) only wants to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning and night Ethiopians are inundated with reports over
state-run radio and television exulting ''valiant, heroic,
gallant'' Ethiopian soldiers and vilifying Eritrea's ''lying,
desperate, rogue'' regime.
</P>
<P>
   Both governments are renowned for waging war over the air waves
as well as on the battlefield. Asked Thursday when Ethiopia's
propaganda campaign would end, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles
Zenawi told diplomats he expected it to ''die a natural death over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan pledged U.N. support Friday
for the cease-fire and sent officials to Africa to discuss plans
for peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats have suggested a force of about 2,000 troops, but
others have said nearly double that many may be required.
</P>
<P>
   The war has not impinged heavily on daily life here, unlike in
Eritrea, a country of 3 million people where almost every household
has someone on the front lines and nearly 1 million people have
been displaced by the war.
</P>
<P>
   The front is 560 miles from the Ethiopian capital and the
economy has only recently begun showing war's ill-effects. In all,
both countries, two of the world's poorest, have spent more than $1
billion on arms since the war began in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the capital say food prices have increased and the
constant requests to contribute to the war effort have begun to
take their toll.
</P>
<P>
   The lucrative tourism industry is also lagging. Only 90,000
tourists visited Ethiopia last year, down from the 120,000 in 1997,
the year before the war began.
</P>
<P>
   The slacking economy has led to a growing clamor for the war to
end.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ethiopia needs only business, only development. We want peace
because war is unnecessary,'' Abebe said.
</P>
<P>
   In the ancient city of Axum, Ethiopia's main tourist attraction
45 miles from the contested border with Eritrea, teen-age boys
making their living hawking souvenirs say they have not seen
visitors for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to sell these for 40 birr ($5),'' said one boy, holding
up a miniature statue of the Queen of Sheba. ''Now all I see are
journalists, so I have to sell it for 20 birr.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as he and 60 million other Ethiopians are concerned, the
country's mission has been accomplished: the ''aggressor'' Eritrea
has been defeated, taught a lesson and put in its place. It's time
for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's peace we can get business. We can do anything,''
said Bihanu Dendrr, a trader.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi Prison Escapees Caught  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWELL, Ind. (AP) -- Two Mississippi prison escapees were
captured Friday, ending an intensive search for the men who
allegedly hijacked several vehicles and committed thefts in three
states during their three weeks on the run.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted killer John F. Woolard and convicted robber Roy
Randall Harper surrendered peacefully a few hours apart after being
surrounded by police, Sheriff John Buncich said. ''Evidently, they
were very tired and had some injuries from being in the underbrush
for so long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State Police captured Woolard, 37, Friday morning in a
field near the Indiana-Illinois line about 40 miles south of
Chicago. Harper, 42, was caught earlier walking along railroad
tracks in the town of St. John. Both men had loaded handguns tucked
into their waistbands, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after their arrests, the men were charged with two counts
each of attempted murder, attempted battery and resisting law
enforcement. They were ordered held without bail until a June 23
hearing. Each men faces up to 108 years in prison if convicted on
all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Woolard and Harper also could face charges in other states, but
Mississippi authorities said Friday they want the men returned to
finish their sentences. ''We are going to seek to extradite Woolard
and Harper on back to Mississippi and let the other states file
their charges after the fact,'' Mississippi Department of
Corrections spokesman Ken Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The two were accused of a series of crimes after their escape
May 28 from a state prison in Parchman, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they bound and gagged a couple in their home in
Webb, Miss., June 4, stole more than a dozen guns and made off in
their car. They also are suspected of attacking a 56-year-old man
on June 9 at a West Virginia motel, taking $300 and his van.
</P>
<P>
   They were spotted in Indiana on Wednesday and allegedly fired at
a police officer who had stopped their van for speeding. A
high-speed chase ended at a nearby gas station after authorities
blew out the van's tires. The men escaped into a nature preserve.
</P>
<P>
   They stole another vehicle Thursday night and headed to St.
John, and Woolard stole a van just after Harper surrendered, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities recovered weapons and jewelry reported stolen, along
with photographs the two men had taken of each other during their
flight, FBI special agent Bob Reilley said.
</P>
<P>
   Woolard was serving a life sentence for murder, and Harper was
serving 88 years without parole for robbery. Authorities said they
escaped by cutting through a metal plate under a louvered window
and a razor-wire fence.

<HEADLINE> Pacers Lead Lakers by 19 After 3  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jalen Rose had 28 points and the Indiana
Pacers took an 86-67 lead over the Los Angeles Lakers going into
the fourth quarter of Game 5 in the NBA Finals Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers, determined to stay alive in the best-of-seven
series, led 64-45 at halftime, took their biggest lead at 21 points
early in the third quarter and held off a brief Lakers rally that
cut the lead to 13 midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana led by 15 points when Rik Smits picked up his fifth foul
and left with 4:47 remaining in the third quarter. But a basket and
two free throws by Rose pushed the lead back to 19. Then, after two
baskets by Shaquille O'Neal, Austin Croshere hit two free throws on
a flagrant foul by Rick Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers kept the ball, and eight seconds later Kobe Bryant
picked up his fifth foul and Mark Jackson hit two free throws to
give Indiana an 84-65 lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, who had 29 points through three quarters, scored for the
Lakers before another basket by Jackson pushed Indiana's lead back
to 19 at the end of the period.
</P>
<P>
   No one besides O'Neal had more than 8 points for Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Eight 3-pointers, including four by Rose and three by Reggie
Miller, who had 18 points, helped Indiana take leads of up to 20
points in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Three straight baskets by Rose, including his fourth 3-pointer,
gave Indiana a 46-32 lead midway through the period.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Best, who bruised his shoulder in Game 4 and was
questionable until game time, scored two straight baskets in the
second quarter to push the Pacers' lead to 50-35. Rose then scored
two straight for a 54-35 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing minutes of the half, Miller scored a basket and
then hit two free throws after Bryant picked up his third foul. The
biggest lead for Indiana in the first half was at 64-44 before
O'Neal hit one of two free throws with 10 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers shot 75 percent and hit all six of their 3-point
attempts in the first quarter, which ended with them ahead 39-28.
The Lakers' only lead was after Glen Rice hit one of two free
throws at the start of the game to make it 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   A basket by Miller, a rebound basket by Smits and the first
3-pointer by Miller gave the Pacers a 7-1 lead before the first Los
Angeles basket, a 3-pointer by Ron Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles tied the game at 9. But two free throws by Smits and
the first 3-pointer by Rose started another big Indiana run.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Miller hit his second 3-pointer and was
fouled by Harper on the play. He hit the free throw to complete the
four-point play for a 22-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The second 3-pointer by Rose made it 32-21, and his third
3-pointer in the closing seconds gave Indiana a 37-26 lead before
offsetting baskets by Robert Horry and Jackson at the end.

<HEADLINE> 136 Arrested in NYC Park Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The number of arrests climbed to 16 Friday in a
string of attacks on women who were stripped and groped by gangs of
young men in Central Park last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the arrests took place on Friday. Police believe up to
60 men were responsible for the harassment, molestation and in some
cases robbery of 47 women, ranging in age from 14 to 40, including
four tourists.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, police released 17 more photos of suspects, taken
from amateur videotapes of the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 men arrested so far, four were found after tipsters
called a police hot line. Seven others surrendered after seeing
their photos either in newspapers or on television.
</P>
<P>
   All of the attacks occurred in daylight, most of them at the
southern end of the park, near the Central Park Zoo and the Plaza
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''This appears to be something that happened relatively
spontaneously, and apparently some of them did not really recognize
the seriousness of the matters they were involved in,'' Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   While more than 75 detectives have been assigned full-time to
catching the suspects, Internal Affairs investigators are focusing
on whether any officers failed to help victims, as some of the
women have complained.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without prejudging, my sense is we'll probably find four or
five police officers who acted inappropriately while the vast
majority of them acted appropriately,'' the police commissioner
said. ''Those police officers who acted inappropriately will be
subject to discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   During his weekly radio appearance, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
called the attacks a travesty but said the majority of officers did
their jobs. He ended his show by saying: ''Make sure you get out
into the park, enjoy yourself, have a great weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki said he will propose legislation making gang
sexual assault a crime punishable by three to five years in prison.

<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Chris Reitsma fired six shutout innings in
his Double-A debut, and Bryce Florie and Jeff Taglienti combined
for three innings of shutout relief, as the Trenton Thunder (26-36)
defeated the Norwich Navigators, 1-0, in Eastern League play.
</P>
<P>
   Reitsma (1-0) retired the final 18 batters he faced
consecutively, allowed one run, no walks, and four strikeouts, and
got the win. Randy Flores (4-8) went eight innings, allowing seven
hits, one run, four walks, and six strikeouts, and suffered the
loss. Jeff Taglienti earned the save.
</P>
<P>
   The lone run of the game was scored in the third inning as Angel
Santos doubled to left center. Aaron Capista followed up with a
double of his own, scoring Santos from second.
</P>
<P>
   The Navigators fell to 32-33 with the loss.

<HEADLINE> State Lotto game's jackpot, sales are lagging  </HEADLINE>
sfnhr
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - Connecticut's Classic Lotto game
hasn't had a grand prize winner for 47 straight drawings, the
second longest winner drought in its history.
</P>
<P>
   The last time there was a jackpot winner was Jan. 4, when Sandra
Welchans of Guilford and Norman Castner of Newington split the $3.7
million prize.
</P>
<P>
   Previously the Lotto game went without a winner for 51 drawings
between July 24, 1998, and Jan. 22, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer players and resulting smaller jackpots may be reasons for
the dry spell. Since Connecticut began participating in the
21-state Powerball lottery with its bigger jackpots, sales of its
own Lotto game have dropped off.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you have more products introduced into the market, things
change,'' Diane Patterson, marketing coordinator for the
Connecticut Lottery Corp. said Thursday. ''With the introduction of
Powerball, (some) people who played Classic Lotto went over to
Powerball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales for the state's Lotto game have dropped from $170 million
in November 1995 when Powerball was introduced in the state, to $51
million last year, when Powerball accounted for $124 million in
lottery sales.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the slower Classic Lotto sales, the jackpot grows
more slowly than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Martineck, Online-Product Manager at the Connecticut
Lottery Corp., said the game takes between three and four weeks to
increase by $1 million. By contrast, for a six-draw run in 1988,
the game increased by $1 million the first draw, and then $2
million for each of the remaining draws.
</P>
<P>
   The jackpot in next Tuesday's drawing will be $14.1 million.

<HEADLINE> Yanks Eye Deal for Twins 2B Walker  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees, worried about Chuck
Knoblauch's throwing problems, are trying to trade for Minnesota's
Todd Walker as a backup for their troubled second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Mariners also are talking to the Twins about Walker,
a baseball source who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, 27, hit well in his first two full seasons in the
majors, but got off to a slow start this year and was demoted to
the minors in early May.
</P>
<P>
   Once he joined Triple-A Salt Lake, he criticized Minnesota
manager Tom Kelly's handling of young players.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's evident I'm not going to be able to play under Kelly's
system,'' Walker said recently. ''It's time to move me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' interest in sluggers Sammy Sosa and Juan Gonzalez
has dominated trade talk in the Bronx. Walker, however, might find
a role on New York's bench.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hit .358 in his first 37 games at Salt Lake. His fielding
-- like Knoblauch's -- was a bit more shaky in that span as he made
eight errors in that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have mostly used Wilson Delgado and Clay Bellinger
as a backup to Knoblauch, another former Twin. Knoblauch has missed
several games because of soreness in his left forearm.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch's wild throws have been a constant source of concern
for the Yankees. He threw away three balls Thursday night and was
sent home early by manager Joe Torre, then returned to the lineup
Friday night and was flawless in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger's versatility, along with a few timely home runs, have
earned him a spot on Torre's bench.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees seemed perturbed last weekend when the
24-year-old Delgado did not hustle on the basepaths. Delgado,
batting .256, was acquired from San Francisco during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   The AL West-leading Mariners have Mark McLemore as their
starting second baseman, and also looking for bench help.
</P>
<P>
   Walker hit .316 with 41 doubles, 12 homers and 62 RBIs in 1998
in his first full season with the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   He batted .279 with 37 doubles, six home runs and 46 RBIs last
year. He also had a 47-game errorless streak.
</P>
<P>
   Walker was hitting .234 with two homers and eight RBIs when
Minnesota sent him to the minors in the first week in May.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 8, Royals 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Ben Grieve hit a tiebreaking, three-run
homer in the seventh inning and the Oakland Athletics beat the
Kansas City Royals 8-3 Friday night for their 12th win in 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez, Miguel Tejada and Ramon Hernandez added
back-to-back-to-back homers off Dan Murray in the eighth, helping
the A's win their third straight.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Jones (2-1) allowed four hits in 2 2-3 innings of shutout
relief and Jeff Tam pitched three innings for his second save,
allowing a seventh-inning homer to Johnny Damon. Tam had pitched 44
innings coming in, the most by a major league pitcher who hadn't
allowed a home run this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Reichert (3-4) relieved with a 2-1 lead in the seventh and
promptly blew the lead by allowing consecutive singles to Miguel
Tejada, pinch-hitter Jeremy Giambi and Terrence Long.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Velarde grounded into a double play, Jason Giambi was
intentionally walked and Grieve, in a 7-for-46 slide, hit his 10th
homer for a 5-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's Mac Suzuki walked his first three batters, then
retired Grieve on a double play as a run scored. Suzuki was helped
by Jermaine Dye, who reached over the right-field fence to rob Matt
Stairs of a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland also made a nice defensive play, when Joe Randa was
thrown out at the plate by Tejada's relay trying to score from
first on Todd Dunwoody's double.
</P>
<P>
   Suzuki allowed just the one run and one hit -- Sal Fasano's
leadoff single in the fifth -- in five innings. Oakland's Omar
Olivares faced one batter, then left the game after straining his
right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City took a 2-1 lead in the fourth after Tejada misplayed
Randa's grounder to shortstop for a two-base error. Jones relieved
with the bases loaded and gave up Rey Sanchez's two-out, two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dunwoody, in 1-for-16 slump coming in, went 4-for-4 to
raise his average from .063 to .250. .... Oakland's Jason Giambi
had three walks to take the major league lead (62).

<HEADLINE> Abe Hirschfeld convicted on criminal solicitation charge  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - Abe Hirschfeld, the real estate developer and
frequent political candidate, was convicted Friday after his second
trial on charges of trying to hire a hitman to kill his business
partner.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, 80, was found guilty of second-degree criminal
solicitation for offering to pay $150,000 to have Stanley Stahl,
his real estate mentor and partner of 40 years, killed in 1997
because of a business dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed contract killing never happened and Stahl, whose
76th birthday would have been Friday, died of natural causes in
August 1999.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Ira Beal allowed Hirschfeld, whose
first trial ended in a deadlocked jury, to remain free on $1
million bail.
</P>
<P>
   Recently released from Bellevue Hospital Center's jail ward
after doing 60 days for contempt of court, Hirschfeld faces up to
seven years in prison when Beal sentences him on Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld, a former New York Post owner who is running for the
U.S. Senate, did not comment as he left the Manhattan courthouse.
He still faces a second trial on tax evasion charges on July 31.
His first trial in the tax case also ended in a deadlocked jury.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Gilda Mariani said Hirschfeld's
murder scheme began when he gave Joseph Veltri, one of his building
contractors, $75,000 in fall 1996 as a down payment to a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   Veltri said he delivered an envelope containing the money to man
with a rough, raspy voice in the back seat of a chauffeured
limousine with tinted windows near Hirschfeld's office at 15 Penn
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   After Hirschfeld gave him a second envelope to deliver, Veltri
testified, he looked inside and found photographs of Stahl and a
note with Stahl's name, address, telephone number and license plate
number. He called the police.
</P>
<P>
   One difference in the second trial was that Mariani had an
investigator show the jury that $75,000 in cash can be carried in a
large envelope.
</P>
<P>
   Stahl, 73, was told of the alleged plot and was not harmed, but
he did start riding in a bulletproof car and wearing a bulletproof
coat.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference in the second trial was that Mariani talked
about Stahl's security measures after he heard that Hirschfeld
wanted him dead.
</P>
<P>
   The jury got the case Thursday and deliberated about five hours
over two days before convicting Hirschfeld.
