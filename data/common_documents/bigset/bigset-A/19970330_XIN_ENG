<HEADLINE> Little Headway Made in Second Day Indo-Pak Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Little headway was made when
the Indo-Pak foreign secretary-level talks entered its second day
here today as both sides stuck to their own stand on the Kashmir
issue.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the end of the three round of talks at
the Hyderabad House here, a senior Pakistan official said that
many substantive issues were discussed. The pace was as expected,
neither slow nor too fast.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan toughened its stand on Jammu and Kashmir, insisting
that some progress should be made on Kashmir before other
outstanding issues could be tackled.
</P>
<P>
Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider made it clear in the
talks that New Delhi was not prepared to consider anything that
would disturb the country's secular unity and jeopardize its
sovereignty, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad would under no circumstance agree to any proposal to
keep the Kashmir issue outside the agenda of the four-day talks, a
Pakistan official said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides, which got bogged down on the agenda today, would
resume their talks tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Peace Needed for Common Prosperity in Asia: Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asia's future depends on Asian countries, Stephen Leong,
assistant director-general of Malaysia's Institute of Strategic
and International Studies (ISIS), said in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
And he challenged Asian countries to prove to the world that
in spite of their differences, they could work together.
</P>
<P>
"Let us prove to them (western experts on Asia), let us prove
to ourselves that we can work together for common prosperity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Everyone wants to see long-lasting peace in the region. That
means "not just peace without conflict but peace that is related
to what I would call productive peace and productive peace is
development peace," Leong said.
</P>
<P>
He said Asian countries have a long way to go to become
developed countries and to do so they need peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Leong said the goal of seeing a united Southeast Asia was
slowly being realized through the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
As for China's role in the region, he said China's size meant
that any of its actions would have an impact on the region, as
well as the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Leong spoke highly of the reform and opening policy which China
adopted in 1978 and said he was optimistic about stability in China
following Deng Xiaoping's death.
</P>
<P>
On China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1,
Leong said this was a "major achievement" for China. He believed
the Chinese government would ensure Hong Kong remained a thriving
economic and financial center.

<HEADLINE> China Issues Regulation to Protect New Plant Strains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Signed by Premier Li Peng, a
Regulation on the Protection of New Plant Strains, which was
released today, will go into effect on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The regulation is aimed at encouraging the cultivation and use
of new plant strains, boosting the development of agriculture and
forestry, and protecting the strain developers' rights, the
regulation says.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, new plant strains refer to plants
cultivated artificially or developed from wild plants, which hold
new and stable properties.
</P>
<P>
The 46-article regulation states that relevant agricultural and
forestry departments under the State Council are held responsible
for examining and approving new strains, and individuals and work
units developing the strains have exclusive rights to them, which
can be sold to others.
</P>
<P>
The regulation has detailed articles on qualifications for
approving new plant strains, new strain application procedures,
the examination and final approval of new strain rights, and the
protection duration of new strains.
</P>
<P>
Those who make illegal profits from new strains developed by
others will be entitled to penalties, according to the
regulation.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Closes Border to Stem Wheat Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has sealed all its
frontiers to stem the cross-border smuggling of wheat, Agriculture
Minister Abida Hussain said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan government ordered the closure of borders on
Thursday last, Abida Hussain said during a press conference.
</P>
<P>
She said the Punjab government also had shut down some of the
flour mills in Punjab, which were found guilty of hoarding wheat,
and had confiscated some trucks involved in the smuggling.
</P>
<P>
These measures were taken to overcome the prevailing wheat
crisis, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Giving a detailed background of the present crisis, Abida
Hussain said that in September and October last year about 597,000
tons of wheat was released to the flour mills in excess of the
quantity released in the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
This excess release caused a shortfall of wheat for 25 days,
which was never met, she said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the minister said wheat consignments from abroad were
also delayed by ten days, aggravating the crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, she said the situation during the last 48 hours had
eased with the off-loading of wheat at Port Qasim and its
transportation to up-country.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said the larger ships were not booked
for wheat supply which involved misappropriation of about 10
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
She said wheat worth 500 million dollars was imported last
year.
</P>
<P>
She said the support price of wheat in the bordering countries
was two to four times more than that of Pakistan, resulting in the
smuggling of wheat to the neighboring country.
</P>
<P>
The pricing structure of wheat crop was faulty and it needed to
be rectified, said Abida Hussain.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, she feared a shortfall of 10,000 tons in
wheat supply next year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had to bear the food burden of Afghan refugees and the
donor countries had minimized their support following the
withdrawal of Soviet forces.

<HEADLINE> Accord Could Offset NATO Expansion Effects: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The planned charter defining
relations between Russia and NATO could offset the negative
effects of NATO's eastward expansion, Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said today after talks with German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel.
</P>
<P>
Although he repeated Moscow's opposition to NATO expansion,
Primakov said, "If we succeed in signing a document with NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization), we will be able to
neutralize possible negative consequences which could emerge from
its expansion."
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and U.S. President Bill Clinton
agreed at their summit in Helsinki last week to sign a charter to
define Russian-NATO relations.
</P>
<P>
Echoing a similar remark by Russian President Boris Yeltsin at
the summit, Primakov said Moscow still regarded NATO expansion as
"a mistake and perhaps the biggest mistake since the end of the
Cold War."
</P>
<P>
But he said Russia was ready to work to ensure that Cold
War-style divisions in Europe remained a thing of the past.
There should be no "new dividing lines" in Europe, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel told reporters that he hoped the document on
NATO-Russian ties, whether a charter or not, could be agreed at a
meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Portugal in May, before the
alliance's Madrid summit in July when it is due to choose the
first wave of new members from former Warsaw Pact countries.
</P>
<P>
Primakov warned though that the document was far from ready and
that there were still thorny issues to be negotiated between NATO
and Russia, such as the deployment of NATO conventional forces and
military infrastructure on the territory of new members.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are widely expected to
be the first east European countries to win NATO membership.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Slams Israel for Escalating Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today blasted Israel for escalating
the current tension by imposing conditions on resuming peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who returned from Cairo, Egypt, told reporters that
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu's "orders and
decisions" were the causes of the current tension. He rejected
Netanyahu's demand that he launch a sustained crackdown on
terrorism rather than only making verbal pledges before resuming
the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only Israel's "honest and accurate
implementation" of the signed peace accords could get the peace
process moving again.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his meeting in Rabat of Morocco Thursday with
U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross, Arafat said the
U.S. was also "against the violence of settlement and the
Judaization of Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
Ross returned home from here late Friday after holding two
meetings with Netanyahu. Ross reportedly put forward new ideas
on resuming the stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, but no
detail has been released. The U.S. State Department described
Ross' talks with Israeli and Palestinian leaders as
constructive, while acknowledging that much more work needed to
be done to resume the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is to convene the PNA cabinet meeting tonight to brief
the results of his meeting with Ross and the meeting of the
Jerusalem Committee which he attended last week in Rabat. Arab
leaders attending the meeting adopted a resolution calling on
Arab countries to reconsider their ties with Israel to protest
Israel's settlement policies in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry suspected that the relatively
moderate resolution contained secret clauses aimed at sabotaging
the normalization of ties between Israel and Arab
countries. Eitan Bentsur, director-general of the ministry, also
called on the upcoming meeting of Arab foreign ministers to end
the tension and verbal attacks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian
protesters continued for the ninth day on the West Bank. At
least five Palestinians were wounded by rubber bullets fired by
Israeli soldiers guarding the Jewish holy site of Rachel's Tomb
near the West Bank city of Bethlehem. In southern Ramallah,
north of Jerusalem, dozens of Palestinian youth also threw stones
at Israeli border policemen.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Heralds Film Revival with International Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The first Southeast Asian
Biennial Film Festival opened today at the new Inter-Continental
Hotel, marking another step in war-scarred Cambodia's return to
the world stage.
</P>
<P>
Billed as the largest international event Cambodia has hosted
in nearly 30 years, the week-long festival has attracted more than
70 Asian and French movie stars and filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
During the festival, 12 recent films from Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam will
compete for awards given by an international jury.
</P>
<P>
However, no Cambodian films are entered in the jury competition
partly because of the destruction of the once-thriving local
motion picture industry, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Before 1970, Cambodia had a prosperous film industry with more
than 43 cinemas in the capital and a host of prolific filmmakers
including then-Prince, now King, Norodom Sihanouk.
</P>
<P>
But the film industry was devastated in the following two
decades of civil war when cinemas were destroyed, old movies
lost and many film makers killed.
</P>
<P>
The organizers hope the festival will help the revival of
the Cambodian film industry.
</P>
<P>
The festival offers an opportunity for Southeast Asian
nations to understand each other's cultures and for the film
professionals to exchange viewpoints and improve film-making
skills, they say.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a "Fringe Festival" will be held to present 33
films that are not taking part in the competition, including two
produced by China and a dozen by Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Other events during the festival include a "Retrospective" of
French actor Alain Delon, debates and lectures and a photo
exhibition presenting the work of Southeast Asian photographers.
</P>
<P>
The festival is sponsored by the Cambodian Ministry of Culture
and Fine Arts, the Embassies of Southeast Asian countries in Phnom
Penh and the French Embassy in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
A grand official opening of the festival will be held Sunday at
Chaktomuk Hall attended by Queen Norodom Monineath who returned
from Beijing Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Russian President Meets with CIS Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met separately today with several leaders of former Soviet
Union countries in an effort to ease tension and enhance economic
cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The series of meetings followed Friday's one-day summit of the
12-nation Commonwealth of Independent States(CIS), which Yeltsin
was elected head of for the fourth time .
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma,
Yeltsin promised to visit Ukraine in late May or early June to
advance talks on the ownership of the disputed former Black Sea
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
He had previously refused to go to Kiev to sign a comprehensive
friendship treaty until the row is resolved.
</P>
<P>
"I will visit Ukraine no matter whether the treaty is signed or
not," the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also met with the presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan,
Levon Ter-Petrosian and Geidar Aliev and said Russia would do its
best to help the two countries solve their nine-year conflict over
the disputed enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
He also told Georgian President Eduard SHevardnadze that Russia
will play an active role in settling the current conflict in the
Georgian separatist province of Abkhazia.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president spoke with Kyrgyzstan President Askar
Akayev on deepening bilateral economic ties and said he was
pleased that the country plans to make Russian its official
language.
</P>
<P>
Friday's CIS summit was originally set for January, but was
postponed due to Yeltsin's health problems. The next summit is
expected to be held in June this year.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Abolish Tariffs on Non-Alcoholic Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government today
decided to abolish tariffs on all imports except alcohol, state
television reported.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at boosting production in the country,
according to an instruction President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat gave
the government Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ochirbat said that tariffs had become a barrier to
restoring production, and a factor in pushing prices upward, when
enterprises suffered from a shortage of raw materials and large
debts.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy began to decline late last year, and the
fall has yet to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
The resolution must be approved by the Great Hural (parliament)
in early April before it can come into force.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Japanese Foreign Ministers Hold Talks (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Friendship and cooperation are
the keystone of Sino-Japanese relationship, which should not be
affected by the existing problems in bilateral ties, Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen told his Japanese counterpart Ikeda Yukihiko
here today.
</P>
<P>
During a two and half hour talks between the two foreign
ministers at the Diaoyutai State Guest House, Qian said that as
the world polarizes at a growing pace, the growth of the friendly,
neighborly, cooperative, and mutually beneficial relations between
China and Japan is of great importance to both countries, Asia,
and the world.
</P>
<P>
Noting that since the resumption of diplomatic ties between the
two countries, friendship and cooperation have been the keystone
of bilateral relations, with remarkable achievements in political
dialogue, economic cooperation and people-to-people exchanges, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the hard-won growth of Sino-Japanese
relationship is the result of the painstaking efforts of several
generations of both countries and should be treasured by the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Though the bilateral relations still have some noticeable
problems, he said, the two sides should proceed from the overall
situation and have the farsight to handle and resolve these
problems properly, so as not to let them to affect the normal
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the principles of the Sino-Japanese joint
declaration and the treaty of peace and friendship between the two
countries are the political basis of the growth of Sino-Japanese
ties and the criteria for proper resolution of existing problems
and differences between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two countries should, in the first place,
have a clear awareness of this point and lead the two peoples to
work for the development of Sino-Japanese friendship, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for the positive posture that
Japanese Prime Minister Hashimoto Ryutaro and Ikeda have made on
this issue since the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that Ikeda visited China as foreign
minister. It was also a contact between high-ranking officials of
the two countries in the year that marks the 25th anniversary of
the normalization of the relations between China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Qian wishes that Ikeda's visit will achieve positive results
and advance the healthy, stable development of bilateral
relations.

<P>
Ikeda said that in the past 25 years since the resumption of
diplomatic ties, the two countries have continuously developed
relations in all fields such as politics and economy. The volume
of two-way trade has grown by 60 times, while personnel exchanges
increased by 120 times.
</P>
<P>
Despite some agitating issues in bilateral relations, he added,
maintenance of a sound Sino-Japanese relationship is the
responsibility of the two governments for the two peoples, the
Asia-Pacific region, and the world.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government will strictly adhere to the principles
of the Joint Declaration, and the Peace and Friendship Treaty, so
as to properly handle existing problems and promote the friendly
bilateral relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said Prime Minister Hashimoto wants to visit China at a
convenient time later this year. He also extend Hashimoto's
invitation to Premier Li Peng to visit Japan.
</P>
<P>
Qian reiterated the Chinese side's welcome to Hashimoto for his
future visit to China. The two foreign ministers agreed that the
two sides will further confer on exchanges of visit by their
leaders through diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that the issue of history is an important factor
hindering the relations between the two countries. He wishes that
Japan will deal with history correctly, draw useful lessons from
the past, keep alert against forces that try to revive militarism
and use the correct view of history to educate its younger
generations.
</P>
<P>
"We have noticed that recently, Japanese leaders have
repeatedly expressed the will to face squarely the history,
confess aggression against other countries and express deep
introspection and apology. The Chinese side expresses welcome on
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian also reiterated China's stand on the Diaoyu Islands issue,
saying that the Japanese government should restrain right-wing
groups in Japan from causing troubles on the issue again so as to
prevent them from hindering the general situation of Sino-Japanese
relations.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said the Japanese government holds the fundamental
view on the history issue that it will inherit the former
government's stand on confessing aggression and apologizing
sincerely for the deed. On this basis, the Japanese government
will face the future and develop friendly relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He agreed that territorial disputes should not affect the whole
situation of Sino-Japanese relations. The Japanese government will
deal with the issue with a somber mind and endeavor to prevent
another outbreak of troubles, he added. It will further study
possible measures to be taken in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Explaining China's stand on the Taiwan issue, Qian said the
Chinese government pays attention to the fact that Hashimoto
declared the position against "two Chinas" and "Taiwan
independence" during the meeting of the leaders of the two
countries in Manila, the Philippines last year. He said China
wishes Japan to handle its relations with Taiwan in a proper way.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said that the Japanese government will carefully handle
its relations with Taiwan in accordance to the joint declaration
of the two governments.

transport 18.1 kilogram of heroin to the Netherlands via Ho Chi
Minh City were sentenced to death in Vietnam on Friday, today's
Vietnam News quoted a court official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two, 34-years-old Sun Chi Kin and 24-years-old Chan
Chun Hung Sammy, holding British passports, were arrested in
March last year after customs officers seized the drug hidden in
their two suitcases upon their arrival at Ho Chi Minh city's
international airport from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
They held fake Portuguese passports under false names when they
were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The amount of heroin carried by the two Hong Kong men was
reportedly the biggest haul yet in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
They have 15 days to lodge an appeal against the sentence
before going a firing squad, said court officials in
Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, one is subject to death penalty to possess or
transport more than one kilogram of heroin.
</P>
<P>
Up to now four foreigners have received death sentences for
drug-related crimes in Vietnam including a Hong Kong man who was
executed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Vietnam discovered more than 3,800 cases of drug
trafficking and arrested 6,650 people for drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
However, official sources here said drug trafficking and abuse in
Vietnam is still on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that Vietnam is both a growing market and a transit
route for narcotics from the notorious Golden Triangle opium-poppy
growing area, which straddles the borders of Laos, Burma and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Young people seem to be the most susceptible to drug addiction. The
arrest of four heroin dealers and 94 young drug users earlier this month
in Ho Chi Minh City shocked the country.
</P>
<P>
A report made by the anti-narcotics program of the national committee
for ethnic minorities and the highlands said that there are about 140,000
drug addicts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
To deal with the problem, an all-out anti-drug campaign as of March 13
was waged by the Communist Youth League, the Women's Union and the
Environment Bureau in Ho Chi Minh City.

<HEADLINE> Privatization of Zambian Copper Conglomerate Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The pace of privatizing the
state-owned copper conglomerate, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM) will not be slackened because the value of the mines could
slump if the process was slowed down.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Zambian Finance Minister Ronald Penza in
an interview with local press here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It is like selling a second-hand car with a knock engine and
you delay so much that in the end all the buyers realize that
your car is finished," Penza was quoted by "Times of Zambia" as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"We have 39 bidders for the ZCCM. This is very encouraging. We
shall handle the sale of the ZCCM diligently and efficiently
because delaying may mean having nothing to sell in the end," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Penza added that it is not a question of how much the ZCCM
will be sold for but what the benefits of privatizing the
conglomerate will be to the nation.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM is the major support of the country's economy by earning
about 80 percent of the country's foreign exchange. In July last
year, the government publicized the program for its
privatization. The Zambia privatization agency opened bids for
the sale of a number of mines and assets on February 28 this
year.

"We believe that closer cooperation between Malaysia and
Singapore will benefit both countries. We will do our part to
restore and improve cooperation at a pace Malaysia is comfortable
with," Goh promised.

<HEADLINE> UK's Labor Party Urges IRA to Call Truce to Enter Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, the political wing of
the Irish Republican Army (IRA), could enter multi-party talks
under a Labor government this summer if the IRA calls a cease-fire
now, the UK's opposition Labor Party said today.
</P>
<P>
Labor's Northern Ireland spokeswoman Mo Mowlam urged Sinn Fein
to show commitment to peace by words and deeds.
</P>
<P>
She told BBC, "If they show by word and deed that they are
committed to the democratic process, then we think they ought to
safely move into the talks process."
</P>
<P>
She added that if the IRA called an immediate truce during
April and May, entry to talks, which will resume on June 3, was "a
high possibility."
</P>
<P>
Britain is due to hold its general election on May 1, and the
Labor Party, which leads the ruling Conservative Party by more
than 20 percentage points in opinion polls, could resume
responsibility for troubled Northern Ireland if it wins the
election.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam made the statement one day after the IRA claimed
responsibility Friday for Wednesday's two bomb attacks on railway
lines in Wilmslow in northwestern England, which severely
disrupted railway services but caused no injuries.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein welcomed Mowlam's remarks and described her comments
as "very encouraging," but gave no hint of the possibility of a
new IRA truce.
</P>
<P>
Pat Doherty, vice-president of Sinn Fein, told the BBC that the
British government must set a date for Sinn Fein's entry into
peace talks and must drop all preconditions for the talks before
they could call a new truce.
</P>
<P>
The IRA, fighting British rule in Northern Ireland, has carried
out a series of bomb attacks on mainland Britain since February
1996 when it ended a 17-month cease-fire in protest against the
lack of progress in talks aimed at bringing about peace in the
province.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Israel to Honor Commitments to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today called upon Israel to shelve its "arrogant" policy and
fulfill its commitments to the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the sixth annual conference of the National
Democratic Party Economic Committee, Mubarak said Israel had to
"understand the nature of the region and drop its arrogance."
</P>
<P>
"There should be sincere desire, flexibility and understanding
on the part of each party of the attitudes of all parties," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was keen to initiate
movement on the Syrian-Israeli and Lebanese-Israeli tracks side by
side with the Palestinian-Israeli track, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There was an undeclared Israeli readiness from Rabin to
restore the Golan in return for normal relations and negotiations
between Israel and Syria, (which) had reached the point of
discussing details of security arrangements," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
However, reviewing the recent peace developments, the president
said Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is "using an
language of haughtiness and imagining that (other) peoples can be
taught, which is totally unacceptable to the Arabs."
</P>
<P>
He urged Netanyahu to "address Arab society, with which he
lives, in its language and in accordance with its traditions and
to respect its culture."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader said he had warned at various meetings with
the Israeli premier that the issue of Jerusalem is sensitive
because it is related to religions and should be approached with
caution.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has denounced the Israeli decision on building a
6,500-unit Jewish neighborhood in Arab East Jerusalem, saying it
has led to an impasse and provoked Palestinian riots that
continued for the ninth day in the West Bank and culminated in
last week's suicide bombing attack in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Some Muslim countries, including Egypt, have threatened to
sever ties with the Jewish state as things have deteriorated since
late last month.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, Egypt is keen on the realization of
stability and peace for the people of the region, but Israel has
failed to make good on its commitment to the peace accords with
the Palestinians as well the 1979 peace treaty with Egypt, the
first between Israel and an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt honors its agreements and pledges and in the meantime
calls on the other party to fulfill its obligations and implement
its agreements as regards the Palestinian issue which is the core
of the Mideast conflict," Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt intervenes among the parties when her assistance is
requested, but it does not negotiate on behalf of the Palestinians,
who are their own decision-makers and who are responsible for the
fate of their own people, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak went to Washington early this month in a line of
several Middle East leaders to seek much-needed U.S. backing for
the peace promotion in the region as the peace process fell in
what he termed "its worst crisis since the 1970s."
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with other Arab countries, this month sponsored
a U.N. General Assembly resolution that condemns Israel's
settlement activities in occupied Arab lands. It said the
U.S. double veto of a similar move in the U.N. Security Council
has encouraged Israel to proceed in a wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the current relations between the two countries,
Mubarak said "Egypt and Israel maintain normal relations and Egypt
plays an effective role and gives advice."
</P>
<P>
Egypt advised against peace and stability for "only one party,"
he said, adding that the realization of Middle East peace requires
strong faith in the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
"It should be made clear that negotiations on the Palestinian
and Syrian tacks be based on restoration of land to their owners
as was the case of Egyptian lands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1979 peace treaty, Israel returned the Sinai
peninsula to Egypt in April 1982 after 26 years of occupation.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Warned of Possible Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lagos, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Ministry of Water and
Resources has raised an alarm of an impending drought in many parts of
the country, particularly those areas that are yet to experience
rainfall since mid-1996, the Saturday Champion reported today.
</P>
<P>
Water Minister Alhaji Jibrin Yelwa was quoted as saying on Friday that
unless safety measures were put in place, a major starvation would
befall the country.
</P>
<P>
"By the cycle of drought in the West African sub-region, we expect
a major drought in the next seven years with attendant negative
consequencies witnessed between 1973 and 1975," the minister told a
national seminar on irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Irrigation schemes in all parts of the country have become a
necessity, he said, urging both governments and individuals to assist
in the provisions, reservation and protection of water for the life of
future generations.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Workers' Unrest Embarrasses EU Ambition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- European workers have been
taking to the streets lately in protest against job losses,
spending cuts and increasing financial and social insecurity, but
most of them are unaware that by doing so, they were embarrassing
the ambitious European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
In order to meet the criteria set up in the Treaty of
Maastricht for a single currency membership, the governments of
most European countries are trying their best to slash social
benefits and public spending for reductions of their annual budget
deficits.
</P>
<P>
However, here came the protests at such a seemingly crucial
moment. The most conspicuous one might be the cross-border strikes
by Renault workers, who have been angered by plant closures by the
French automobile company in Belgium, Spain and France and the
ensuing job losses.
</P>
<P>
German coal miners worried about vanishing subsidies and French
medical interns upset by budget cutbacks also took to the streets.
And a total of 300,000 Italian workers demonstrated to demand that
the government create more jobs.
</P>
<P>
Another trouble is that there will be other calendars,
including the French and German elections calendars, to go
together with the EU's preparations for its most ambitious dream
-- economic and monetary union (EMU) by January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the essential message from the workers' unrest is that in a
paradise of welfare systems, you have to be extremely careful with
any kind of reform or change which might negatively influence the
job holders who have been protected by welfare for decades.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts say that the monetary union and the present mass
unemployment in Europe should not necessarily be connected with
each other. It is just unlucky for the EU to have trouble with
employment when it is struggling for the EMU, they say.
</P>
<P>
"That is most unfortunate because it is so easy to blame the
(Maastricht) treaty when it is really the structural reforms that
need to be tackled," said a Europe-watcher called Mr. Horne.
</P>
<P>
However, the economists still think that the Maastricht single
currency process should be blamed at least for the budget cutbacks
by the governments of EU member countries, which are slowing down
overall economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the contradicting thoughts regarding the connection
between European workers' strikes and the EMU, some other analysts
have reached the conclusion that Europe needs to undertake
structural reforms, but the EMU process and new restrictions on
public expenditure at a time of low growth are worsening the
problem.
</P>
<P>
The European workers seem to forget to blame another main cause
of their problem -- economic globalization, which has compelled
many European companies to transfer their manufacturing operations
from EU countries to Eastern Europe or Asia, where cheaper labor
can be easily found.
</P>
<P>
Another worrying factor which needs to be mentioned is that the
governments of some EU countries are continuing to coddle their
welfare-dependent citizens by giving in to the demands raised by
the striking workers.
</P>
<P>
But the EMU process, which has become in a way a scapegoat for
the prevalent unemployment in Western Europe, is in no way a good
solution to the workers' unsatisfaction, which some policymakers
in Europe are worried that some day could turn into more serious
forms of social unrest.

<HEADLINE> Economic Reforms Urged in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- African countries were today
urged to continue with their economic and financial reforms, with
a view to achieving sustainable development for their economies
and for their effective integration in the world economy.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a draft resolution "Growth and
Development Finance in Africa and Financial Sector Reforms"
prepared by a five-day experts meeting which closed here today,
for adoption by the forthcoming sixth session of the Conference
of African Ministers of Finance which will be held here from
March 31 to April 2, this year.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution welcomed the steps taken by a number of
African countries to improve the efficiency of their money and
capital markets and to create new ones where they do not exist.
</P>
<P>
It called upon African countries to implement appropriate
policies to reduce gradually their heavy dependency on external
financing and to improve mobilization of domestic savings and
non-debt creating flows.
</P>
<P>
It also appealed to the international community to step up
significantly their financial support to African countries in the
implementation of their economic and financial reforms.
</P>
<P>
In another draft resolution "the Debt Problem and Its Impact
on Africa's Development Process", the experts meeting appealed to
the multilateral financial institutions and international
community to continue to support African countries with
concessional financing necessary for them to develop and
rehabilitate their social sectors, especially education and
health, and improve and maintain their infrastructures. It called
upon African countries in collaboration with the international
community and multilateral institutions to intensify their
efforts to find a durable solution to the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the meeting also prepared a draft declaration "on
Growth and Development Finance in Africa at the Turn of the
Century, Financial Sector Reforms and the African Debt Problem"
proposed for adoption by the sixth session of the conference of
African Ministers of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the ministries of finance and central banks
from African countries, as well as delegates from international
organizations and united nations bodies attended the meeting. The
meeting discussed financial reforms in Africa, exchange rate
management, development of capital markets and the African debt
problem.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian University Student Killed by Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian university
student was killed by Israeli soldiers during an anti-Israeli
demonstration in the West Bank this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Khalil Abdullah, 20, a second-year engineering
student at Bir zeit University near Ramallah, was shot in the
back by live bullets during clashes on the road between
Jerusalem and Ramallah, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The clashes took place close to an Israeli military
checkpoint on the road. Dozens of university students were
protesting against Israeli construction of a new Jewish
settlement at Har Homa in East Jerusalem. The student was from
Beit Sahur, a Palestinian town close to Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
The fatal incident will apparently add fuel to the flames of
the anger of the Palestinians stemming from the settlement
building and the subsequent violent crackdown on the Palestinian
protesters. A wave of intifada-type Palestinian opposition has
surged in the West Bank for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
It also came one day after U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
failed to bridge the gap of differences between the Israelis and
Palestinins over revival of the peace process during his two-day
talks with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in Morocco and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in Israel
respectively.

<HEADLINE> UK Security Forces Find 500 Kg Bomb in Norther Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's security forces found a
1,000 pound (500 kilogram) bomb and detonating equipment today
near a British army base in County Down, south of Belfast,
Northern Ireland, according to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
The device was found on the road near the base in Ballykinler,
where a spokesman said army vehicles would have been forced to
slow down and the bomb only needed to be connected up to make it
lethal.
</P>
<P>
The homemade explosives were discovered in fertilizer bags, and
a Kalashnakov assault rifle was found nearby.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was thought to be planted by the Irish Republican Army
guerrillas to try to make headlines in the running-up to Britain's
general election due on May 1.
</P>
<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility for it, but police
said that the attempt bore the hallmarks of the IRA, which is
fighting British rule in Northern Ireland and has carried out a
series of bomb attacks in the country since February 1996 when it
ended a 17-month cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Tory Chairman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Britain's ruling
Conservative Party in Scotland Michael Hirst resigned today over
what he described as a "past indiscretion" in his private life,
dealing another heavy blow on the Tories.
</P>
<P>
Hirst wrote to Prime Minister John Major saying that he was
resigning rather than embarrass the party.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Major has accepted his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Hirst said in the letter, "I very deeply regret these
circumstances which have caused great distress to my family and
which may, I fear, cause embarrassment to the party in the current
climate."
</P>
<P>
He was the third high-ranking Conservative to resign in a week
over sexual and money scandals which dogged the party which,
facing a general election on May 1, is more than 20 percentage
points behind the opposition Labor Party in national opinion
polls.
</P>
<P>
However, Annabel Goldie, who has taken the place of Hirst as
the party's chairman in Scotland, dismissed suggestions that the
incident would worsen the Conservatives' election chances.
</P>
<P>
She said, "I think the public is beginning to feel it has had
enough, that it is beginning to resent the attempt by the media to
judge... to devastate and destroy the lives of people who in many
respects are good, upright and honorable people who have merely
done what many others have done -- made a mistake."
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Belgian telephone company
Belgacom has said recently that it would cut 6,500 jobs to slash
costs in preparation for the scheduled opening up of the European
Union's telecommunications market next year.
</P>
<P>
Belgacom, which employs some 26,000 people, said the unemployed
workers would be offered early retirement and another 6,000 would
be redeployed to try to "get prepared for increasing competition."
</P>
<P>
A spokesman said Belgacom was not forcing anyone to take early
retirement and it was impossible to say how much the program would
cost until the number of those accepting early retirement was
known. The program will run until December 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said that a one-time payment equivalent to six months'
salary, a monthly allowance equal to 75 percent of their monthly
salary till age 60 and a full pension after that would be offered
to the employees who were born before July 1, 1947 and had been
working for the company for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Belgacom is 49.5 percent-owned by Ameritech Corp., Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd. and Tele Danmark AS, with the rest held by
the state.

<P>
LAGOS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The high command of the West
African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, has reiterated the
force's determination to continuously enhance security at the
Liberian borders.
</P>
<P>
This is to boost confidence of returning refugees and
safeguard Liberia from any influx of arms, Brigadier-General Joe
Kwateng, deputy commander of ECOMOG, said in Tabou, a
southwestern town in Cote d'Ivoire.
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria today, the ECOMOG
officer was in the town on Wednesday representing ECOMOG Force
Commander Major-General Victor Malu at the presentation of six
patrol crafts by the United States government to Abidjan for
coastal border patrols.
</P>
<P>
Kwateng was quoted as saying that the security of the Liberian
borders was paramount to ECOMOG as one of the essential tasks
necessary for the achievement of lasting peace and encouraging
Liberian refugees to return home.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) has
re-launched its comprehensive voluntary reintegration program for
Liberia's estimated 768,000 refugees residing in neighboring West
African countries.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation of the refugees, following improvement in
security in Liberia, is expected to begin from April and will

<HEADLINE> 7th All African Trade Fair Opens in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KADUNA, Nigeria, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Seventh All African
Trade and Tourism Fair, jointly sponsored by the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) and African Economic Community (AEC), opened
today in Nigeria's northern industrial city of Kaduna.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Oladipo Diya, vice-chairman of the
Nigeria's Provisional Ruling Council, declared the fair open
representing Head of State General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, Nigerien President
Ibrahim Bare Mainassara and Chadian Prime Minister Djimasta
Koibla were among the dignitaries attending opening ceremony at
the newly-built Kaduna International Trade Complex, an impressive
building that has cost 12.5 billion Naira (15 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Also present are Nigerian government officials and business
leaders as well as foreign diplomats.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech today, Nigerian Minister of Commerce and
Tourism Rear Admiral Jibrila Ayinla warned that African countries
now face the danger of being left out of the globalization of the
world economy and urged them to strengthen regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to organizers, more than 30 countries will display
their various products at the fair that will last until April 6.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the delay in the completion of the
construction of the trade fair complex, most of the firms were
not able to bring in their goods before the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the fair is to "promote African development, buy
African goods and tour Africa."
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that tourism is promoted as a major theme
of All Africa Trade Fair, an event held once every four years.
</P>
<P>
The Kaduna fair will be the last regional comprehensive trade
fair in the African continent in this century.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Seek Better Coordination in Repatriating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said today that he and European Union commissioner Hans van den
Broek will visit Bosnia recently to seek a better coordination in
the repatriation of Bosnian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation can only be carried out in a standardized and
coordinative manner based on full data about the refugees,
including their places of origin and ethnic identities, Kinkel
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Defending a decision by interior ministers from Germany's 16
federal states to carry on a plan to send back Bosnian refugees
living in the country, Kinkel said Germany is humane with the
acceptance of refugees and will remain so during repatriations.
</P>
<P>
"No refugees should be forced to wrap up their baggage
overnight," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he also stated that the readiness of German citizens to
take in war refugees also in the future depends on their awareness
that those refugees will eventually return home.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel said he has been actively pressing for a speedy
contribution of EU assistance to help the rebuilding of Bosnia,
thus providing conditions for the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that those projects directly related to the
repatriation of refugees, including house building, job creating
and restoration of communal infrastructure, should take priority.

</P>
<P>
In East Jerusalem, Palestinian residents staged a commercial
strike. Four fire bombs were fired against the Israeli police
headquarters in Ras Al-Amoud, causing some damages in a
neighboring building.
</P>
<P>
Students of Al-Umeh College took to the streets and clashed
with Israeli soldiers in Al-Dahieh by hurling stones.
</P>
<P>
In Shu'fat Refugee Camp and Sur Baher Village, six Palestinians

Meanwhile, Palestinian protesters clashed with Israeli soldiers
guarding Rachel Tomb, a Jewish holy site in Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 Palestinian youths in Ramallah tried to reach the
Israeli military checkpoint near the Israeli Civil Administration
in Beil El, only to be prevented by Palestinian police. Later in
the afternoon, the Palestinian police banned the demonstrators
from approaching the Israeli military checkpoint in Al-Bireh. The
furious protesters stoned the policemen instead.
</P>
<P>
Clashes also took place in the main Haifa Road in Jenin. Seven
Palestinians were injured by rubber bullets fired by soldiers
while dozens of others suffered gas inhalation.
</P>
<P>
The National Islamic Committee to Confront Settlements
organized a mass rally outside the Jenin Municipality building
under the slogan of "no peace with settlements."

<P>
Another sit-in was organized by the National Islamic Committee
to Confront Settlements in Wadi Al-Teen, Tulkarm, where
Palestinian land is under threat of being confiscated by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian police in Nablus barred more than 3,000 protesters
from marching toward Joseph Tomb, a Jewish holy site in the
city. The Israeli army deployed tanks near the entrance of the
Palestinian self-rule city.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, dozens of Hebron University students marched from
the campus to the city center, hurling stones at Israeli
soldiers, who responded with rubber bullets, leaving a number of
students injured.
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, a number of Palestinian ministers and
Palestinian Council members participated in a massive procession
organized by various factions.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Al-Zahar, spokesman of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), told reporters that "Israel is pushing our people to an
option of Intifada (uprising)."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Council member Muhammad Abu-Najah condemned the
U.S. for its biased position regarding the peace process, adding
that "The U.S. is no longer interested in the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian youths attempted to approach the Israeli
checkpoint at Netzarim, but were pushed back by Palestinian
police.
</P>
<P>
The Land Day is marked annually in Israel and in the West Bank
and Gaza on the anniversary of an expropriation of Arab-owned land
in northern Israel in 1976.

Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will "actively explore the
possibility" of forming its own government following withdrawal of
the Congress party's support to the ruling United Front (UF), a
Senior BJP leader said today.
</P>
<P>
BJP Vice-President Madan Lal Khurana told reporters that his

wanted to go to polls at this stage.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, Khurana said there was no question of
BJP supporting the Deve Gowda government from the outside.
</P>
<P>
He said Deve Gowda had telephoned BJP president L.K. Advani
after Congress party withdrew its support to the UF.

Qiao Shi said that to build a strong, prosperous, democratic
and highly civilized socialist country is the objective of a
struggle for China.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deng Xiaoping had pointed out years ago that if
there was no democracy, there would be no socialism and socialist
modernization.
</P>
<P>
"In order to protect and guarantee the democracy of the people,
we must strengthen the construction of a legal system. We must
institutionalize our democracy and make it into law, so that the
democratic system and law will not be subjected to changes due to
changes of the country's leaders or their views and attention," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the country's reform and opening-up began
nearly 20 years ago, China has followed the thoughts of Deng
Xiaoping in this respect and regarded the building-up of socialist
democracy as a basic task for the country.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the NPC has since then taken a series of
important measures to achieve this end, including the making of
the 1982 Constitution, the reforms of electoral system, the making
and amending of the Criminal Code, the Criminal Procedural Law,
the Administrative Procedural Law, and the Law on State
Compensation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NPC has also strengthened the autonomy in the
running of rural villages and urban neighborhoods by inhabitants
of villages and cities with the adoption of the draft law on
election of village-level administrative bodies and that on
election of urban neighborhood administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
Those laws have helped improve the building-up of democracy at
the grass roots level of the Chinese society, he said.

SEOUL, March 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's major automakers have
more than 100,000 vehicles in stock due to poor car sales, Yonhap
News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Car sales of the country's three biggest automakers -- Hyundai,

month, only sixty to seventy percent of that projected.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the motor vehicle stock has reached

vehicles in stock last month, according to the International Trade
and Industry Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rising stock will increase the costs of storage and slow
the turnover of capital. It is estimated that the automakers

110,000 motor vehicles in stock.

<HEADLINE> India's Kesri Accuses Government of Marginalizing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- India's Congress party
President Sitaram Kesri said today that the United Front
government's bid to "marginalize" his party and allow urgent
national issues to take a back seat compelled Congress to withdraw
support to the 14-party minority coalition.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded three-page letter to President Shanker
Dayal Sharma, Kesri, also leader of the Congress Parliamentary
Party, said a "complete collapse" of law and order in the country,
failure to arrest communal and divisive forces and the overall
demoralizing effect on the civil services were among other factors
that led to the decision.
</P>
<P>
Accusing the government of ignoring the principle of collective
responsibility, Kesri said "lack of coordination, direction and
will to govern have created a situation of drift."
</P>
<P>
"In view of the changed situation, the Congress party is
compelled to withdraw its support to the United Front government
with immediate effect," Kesri said.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted at an emergency meeting this afternoon,
the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party's supreme
decision-making body, welcomed Kesri's decision to withdraw
support to the United Front government led by Prime Minister H.D.
Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
Praising Kesri's move to stake a claim to form a new
government, the CWC authorized the party president to take
appropriate steps in this regard.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) of China, today
hailed the Sino-French relations in spring, saying that he was
happy to visit France in this beautiful season full of hope and
life.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Alain Peyrefitte, chairman of the
editorial board of the French daily Le Figaro, Qiao said that both
China and France have an ancient history and boast a brilliant
civilization, and the people of the two countries enjoy a long
traditional friendship.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that late Chinese leaders Zhou Enlai and Deng
Xiaoping studied and worked in France in their youths, and that
period of life of theirs had exerted a great impact on their
revolutionary careers.
</P>
<P>
He said that through his meetings with President Jacques
Chirac, Prime Minister Alain Juppe, Senate President Rene Monory
and National Assembly President Philippe Seguin, China and France
have enhanced mutual understanding, strengthened friendship and
expanded cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao said that the NPC and its standing committee have a great
responsibility for the cause of reform and opening-up, the
building of a socialist market economy and the construction of a
socialist state with a sound legal system in China.
</P>
<P>
He said that China needs to learn from the successful
experience of all countries in the world while starting from its
own actual situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that to further strengthen the friendly relations
between the NPC and the French parliament will be helpful for the
NPC to understand and study the experience in law-making by the
French parliament.
</P>
<P>
Qiao stressed that Sino-French relations are very important,
and that it will not only benefit the development of China and
France, but also world peace and stability.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Beats Thailand in World Cup Asian Qualifiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong defeated Thailand 3-2
 after the two teams tied 1-1 at half-time in a World Cup soccer
Asian Zone Group Six qualifying match here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Although with the victory Hong Kong could revenged its 2-0 loss
 to Thailand earlier this month, it could hardly change the fact
that South Korea will eventually come out as the group
winners. Neither could it save Hong Kong from being at the bottom
of the group standings.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, with two straight wins in earlier competitions,
3-1 over Thailand and 2-0 over Hong Kong, led the group standings
with an almost unbeatable collection of six points.
</P>
<P>
With two games left, against Hong Kong and Thailand, both on
the home turf, South Korea need only a tie to win the three-team
group.
</P>
<P>
Both Hong Kong and Thailand now stand at three points, from one
 win and one loss each.
</P>
<P>
With little hope to go into the next round though, Hong Kong
played an surprisingly aggressive game today and, with a
short-passing coordination just 21 minutes into the match, opened
the score through a slam shot by forward Lee Kin Wo.
</P>
<P>
Thailand evened the score 23 minutes later when Natipong scored
 a goal in a goal mouth melee following a corner-kick.
</P>
<P>
The hosts scored two more goals in the second half while the
Thai side added just one.
</P>
<P>
But the match was marred by what Kwok Ka Ming called as an
"incident", followed by the expulsion of one player from each
side, in the closing minute of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Scorers:
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong: Lee Kin Wo (21st Minute), Cheng Siu Chung
(48th), Au Wai Lun (89th)
</P>
<P>
For Thailand: Natipong (44th), Dusit (69th)

<HEADLINE> Chinese Bank of Communications Donates for Charity, Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Shanghai-based Bank of
Communications has donated one million yuan to the Shanghai
Charity Foundation as a way to celebrate the bank's 10th
anniversary of reorganization on April 1.
</P>
<P>
BOC's Shanghai Branch also donated one million yuan to an
education foundation to mark the occasion. The branch has donated a
total of 8.5 million yuan in support of social welfare since it
opened 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The donations are meant to repay the city and the society at
large for their consistent support to the bank, said Wang
Mingquan, the bank's chairman.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1908, the Bank of Communications is one of the
oldest banks in China. In 1958, its mainland businesses were
merged into the People's Bank of China and the Construction Bank
of China, while its Hong Kong Branch remains open under the
original name.
</P>
<P>
The State Council decided in 1986 to reorganize the Bank of
Communications to cater to economic development and financial
system reforms. It restarted operation the next year.
</P>
<P>
The bank has been transformed into a shareholding commercial
bank, with a total capital worth nearly 400 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Foundation, set up in 1994, has received
more than 100 million yuan of charity donations from home and
abroad.

<HEADLINE> "Two Bamboo Sticks" Effective Way to Help The Poor (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years passed, during which time the villagers learned
techniques, step by step, for digging holes, fertilizing, and
trimming the trees, until each household had at least one expert
on apple tree planting.
</P>
<P>
And the County Association of Science and Technology made its
own changes: in addition to distributing to farmers the bamboo
sticks and a nylon rope -- another means of measuring by which
knots are tied at intervals in the rope to indicate the correct
spacing needed between plants -- to setting up a computerized
experience of agricultural experts for local farmers to consult.
</P>
<P>
Yujiaping Village celebrated its first apple harvest in
1994. Since then, financial returns from the apple trees have
become the village's major source of income.
</P>
<P>
New brick houses now are mushrooming throughout the village;
Zhe's six-member family moved from their single-room clay house
into four houses of a dozen rooms that are decorated with
paintings and carvings.
</P>
<P>
The family, which planted 300 apple trees, has also bought a
five-ton truck.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the entire village earned a total of more than
400,000 yuan from selling apples, suggesting an annual per capita
income of over 1,000 yuan, nearly 200 times the 1993 figure.
</P>
<P>
According to the state standard, people with an annual per
capita income of over 530 yuan can be considered over the poverty
line.
</P>
<P>
Some 192 million Chinese people escaped poverty in the
1978-1996 period, reducing the proportion of Chinese impoverished
people in the world's total from one fourth to one twentieth.
</P>
<P>
To reach the goal of eliminating poverty by the end of this
century, China has to ensure that some 12 million to 14 million
destitute people have enough to eat each year.
</P>
<P>
To show its determination, the country has decided to increase
state aid-the-poor funding from 10.8 billion to 15.3 billion per
year, starting from 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The largest part of the fund will continue to be allocated to
Yunnan, which has one-tenth of the country's impoverished people,"
says Liu, the department head of the State Council's leading group
for poverty-relief programs.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, most of the poor people in Yunnan live in
remote mountain areas that are not connected with highways.
</P>
<P>
"Some of them are still engaged in slash-and-burn cultivation,
which means that not only modern farming technology but also
simple ways for spreading technology, such as using the two bamboo
sticks, have to be popularized," he says.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Airliner Flies Abroad Defying UN Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- A Libyan airliner carried
Saturday 105 Libyan pilgrims, the first batch of Libyans for the
pilgrimage this year, to the Saudi port city of Jeddah, in
defiance of a U.N. air ban, the Libyan news agency (JANA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The rest of Libyan pilgrims this year will be transported to
Saudi Arabia during the period from April 10 to 17, the agency
added.
</P>
<P>
The JANA failed to give the time at which the plane landed at
the Jeddah Airport.
</P>
<P>
No word was available so far on how many pilgrims the airline
will fly later and the number of such flights will be made by the
Libyan national airline.
</P>
<P>
Libya has more than once broken the air ban imposed on it in
1992 because of its refusal to extradite two of its citizens being
suspected of having involved in the Pan AM airliner bombing in
Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, which caused the deaths of 279
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian National Carrier Egypt Air was supposed to
undertake the job this year, for the third time running, to carry
11,000 Libyan pilgrims to Saudi Arabia as of last Friday.

<HEADLINE> IWS to Help Upgrade Wool Processing Technology in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Wool
Secretariat (IWS) plans to aid China's nationwide program to
improve its wool processing technology in an effort to expand
China's export of wool products, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
Barry White, an official with the IWS, said his organization
expected to help raise interest in Australian wool among wool
processors by upgrading wool processing technology.
</P>
<P>
He said IWS has launched a joint research program with the
Chinese wool processing ventures.
</P>
<P>
With the help of the IWS, more than 1,000 researchers are
studying China's traditional wool-processing techniques and ways
to upgrade the processing technology of Australian wool.
</P>
<P>
The IWS also held discussions with directors from wool mills in
Xi'an, Zhangjiagang, Shanghai and Beijing on the specifications of
the wool processing contracts, technical system improvement,
quality guarantee and environment management, in hopes of helping
these mills obtain big economic returns.
</P>
<P>
White said it is one of the IWS' tasks is to encourage Chinese
ventures to adopt the new wool processing technology, and his
secretariat has decided to provide technical aid for a number of
Chinese factories in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The IWS is also to help wool processing mills collect funds for
purchasing wool.
</P>
<P>
The IWS is a global organization which helps its member states
market its wool products by spreading new technology, developing
new products, transferring technology and analyizing the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- South Koreans Chun Lee-Kyung and
Kim Dong-sung won the women's and men's individual titles
respectively at the world short track speed skating championships
in Nagano, Japan, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Yang Yang, from China's Heilongjiang Province, seemed to have a
sure grip on the women's title when she won the 1,000 meters to
snatch a three-point lead.
</P>
<P>
But Chun, 21, stormed home to win the last individual event,
the 3,000 meters, to share the top honor with Yang at 12 points
each.
</P>
<P>
It was the first world individual title for Yang but was the
third consecutive title for Chun.
</P>
<P>
Another South Korean Won Hye was third overall at nine points,
followed by Canadian Isabelle Charest and another Chinese Yang
Yang, who are from Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
In the 1,000 meters Yang narrowly beat Won and Chun with 0.05
of a second separating the three. In the 3,000 meters the
positions were reversed with Chun leading in Won and Yang with 0.3
seconds between first and third.
</P>
<P>
In the men's competition, Kim beat Canada's three-time world
champion Marc Gagnon to clinch the title, winning the 1,000 meters
and 3,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Gagnon, who was disqualified for cross tracking in the 1,000
meters final, had to be satisfied with the runner-up spot with
eight points overall, ahead of Japan's Satoru Terao and fellow
Canadian Derrick Campbell with five points.
</P>
<P>
Kim clocked 1:35.18 to beat his teammate Lee Jun-Hwan and
China's Feng Kai in the 1,000 meters, and took the 3,000 meters at
5:14.05, beating Terao and Gagnon to second and thrid.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 1,000 People Plant Commemorative Trees In Suburban Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The site of China's first
"Wedding and Happiness Memory Forest," located in suburban
Beijing's Huairou County, was filled with some 1,000
commemorative tree-planters today.
</P>
<P>
While couples planted trees to mark their wedding day, people
from the business, scientific, and music circles as well as
students and government employees planted trees to show their good
wishes for the future.
</P>
<P>
A female employee from the Beijing-based People's Bank of
China, who planted a "Return of Hong Kong Tree" today with her
family, said she was excited about the event.
</P>
<P>
"We planted the tree to show our pride and joy over the return
of Hong Kong later this year, hoping that Hong Kong will always be
full of vitality, just like the tree we planted," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the tree also symbolizes her feelings for late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, who advocated the nation's tree-planting
drive 16 years ago and initiated the "one country two systems"
policy which made the return of Hong Kong possible.
</P>
<P>
The "Wedding and Happiness Memory Forest," initiated by Chen
Muhua, Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress and president of the Green China Fund, was
officially opened last October when the first commemorative trees
were planted.
</P>
<P>
The forest covers an area of 178 hectares, space enough for
more than 50,000 trees.
</P>
<P>
Chen and officials from the Ministry of Forestry, the Green
China Fund, the All-China Women's Federation, and Beijing
municipal government, attended today's event.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction to Congress Withdrawal of Support to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Former chief minister and
Congress leader of India's Karnataka State M. Veerappa Moily today
described the party's move to withdraw support to the United Front
(UF) government headed by Deve Gowda as the "right decision."
</P>
<P>
Congress's rank and file was unhappy about the party's support
to the UF government and their wishes had now been fulfilled, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) Atal
Behari Vajpayee said withdrawal of the Congress's support to the
UF government would lead to a mid-term poll.
</P>
<P>
No party was in a position to form an alternative government
and a snap poll was inevitable, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India
(CPI) A.B. Bardhan said the Congress would be solely responsible
for sowing seeds of instability in the country by withdrawing
support to the United Front government.
</P>
<P>
The UF stood solidly together and its steering committee would
meet tomorrow to take stock of the situation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister V.P. Singh today described the Congress
decision as a "very short-sighted step" and appealed to leaders of
the Front constituents to unitedly face the challenge.
</P>
<P>
Jagannath Mishra, a senior Congress leader and former
government minister, said the decision to withdraw support to the
UF government was taken in "haste." "A consensus had emerged at
the March 17 meeting of the Congress parliamentary party in Delhi
that a decision on withdrawal of support should not be taken
without getting the nod of the parliamentary party," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Improve Technology Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Since 1991, Beijing has witnessed
speedy and stable development in its local technology market,
which is believed to be the largest of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese capital now has 56 technology trading
organizations, and signed nearly 4.6 billion yuan worth of
contracts last year, 80 percent of which were for technological
trade.
</P>
<P>
This is a big leap from the two billion yuan-worth of
technological contracts signed in 1991, when only 60 percent
involved technological trade.
</P>
<P>
In order to upgrade technology transfer, Beijing took the lead
in China to hold two terms of training courses for professional
technological agents.
</P>
<P>
Beijing set up a comprehensive and multi-functional
technological trading market last year, which is expected to
provide all-round services and have become an important site for
the exchange and trading of local technological information and
products.

<HEADLINE> Feature: "Two Bamboo Sticks" Effective Way to Help The Poor (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Zhe Libu, a farmer living on
Xiaoliangshan Mountain in southwest China's Yunnan Province,
clearly recalls when each family in his village received two
bamboo sticks from the county government ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
"The sticks represented the width and depth of a hole to be dug
for planting apple trees," he says. "Most of the people in my
village were illiterate, so it was useless to tell us the
measurements."
</P>
<P>
The two sticks are symbolic of the simplicity that can be found
in China's effective poverty-relief projects. As an official from
the leading group in charge of the work under the State Council
says, "What we lack is not agricultural technology, but a simple
way to spread the technology in backward areas."
</P>
<P>
China has succeeded in reducing its impoverished population
from 125 million to 58 million in the past decade, mostly as a
result of spreading technology to develop planting, breeding and
processing of local agricultural and sideline products,
</P>
<P>
"Planting, breeding and such processing can involve as many
impoverish households as possible, and will help them directly to
shake off poverty," says Liu Fuhe, head of the policy study arm of
the group.
</P>
<P>
Fruit trees are the crop of choice in the remote mountain
areas, where most of the poor people live.
</P>
<P>
A total of one million orchards were built from 1986 to 1996,
including one in Zhe's village in Ninglang County, also called
Xiaoliangshan, which is located 2,800 m above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, none of the 56 families in the village of
Yujiaping wanted to risk giving up planting corn, tomatoes and
buckwheat -- all crops that barely produced a living -- to plant
apple trees.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't believe that we would be able to live a comfortable
life in brick houses if we planted apple trees," Zhe says.
</P>
<P>
For a period of time, several county officials lived with the
villagers, helping them to plant apple trees in the evening and
teaching them to dig holes with the help of two bamboo sticks
during the day.

NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are the positions of
the three main political groups in India's current Lok Sabha (the

<HEADLINE> China, Japan to Safeguard Bilateral Ties: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
today that China and Japan, as friendly neighbors sharing similar
traditional culture, should work together to safeguard their
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Li told visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Ikeda Yukihiko
during a meeting that, according to Chinese philosophy, differences
will unavoidably surface during the process of development, and
that handling them properly is what matters most.
</P>
<P>
While sharing much in common, China and Japan still have some
diverging points of view, and statesmen of both countries should
take a farsighted view and lead a healthy and stable bilateral
relationship into the 21st century by proceeding from a regional
and global perceptive and the long-term interest of both
countries, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that China will see two important events this
year: Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the convening of
the 15th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
China will march straight ahead along the road of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, a theory initiated by
Deng Xiaoping, he reiterated.
</P>
<P>
As a developing country, China needs a peaceful international
environment, especially a good neighborly environment, to
guarantee its domestic economic construction, and the country will
continue its independent foreign policy of peace, the premier
noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that this year marks the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries,
and also a critical period for improving and developing
Sino-Japanese ties.
</P>
<P>
At present, the overall relationship is good and has brought about
important benefits to both countries, the Chinese leader said.
</P>
<P>
However, Li noted, bilateral ties have also met with
unnecessary interference, and this is not what China wants to see.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the smooth development of bilateral relations, both
China and Japan should stick to the principles set in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japan Peace and
Friendship Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said that over the past 25 years, bilateral ties have
maintained sound development. Japan is willing to further promote
the development of bilateral relations in various sectors with a
view toward the 21st century, and to maintain a more stable and
mature relationship between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda extended Prime Minister Hashimoto's invitation to Li for
a visit this year, which Li accepted with thanks. He in return,
reaffirmed his invitation to Hashimoto, saying the details of the
two visits would be discussed by the two foreign ministries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Information Ministry Statement Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) reiterated Palestinian basic rights including the
right of establishing an independent Palestinian state, according
to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement which was issued by the Palestinian
Ministry of Information in the West Bank city of Ramallah on
Saturday night, the eve of the Palestinian Land Day.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-one years ago, Israeli Arabs held demonstrations in the Galilee
area, north Israel, to protest Israeli government's confiscation
of Arab land. Many were killed and wounded by Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact of confirming these basic rights of the
Palestinians by the Oslo Accords, the new Israeli right-wing
coalition government started its term in office last year by
resuming the confiscation of the Palestinian lands for building or
expanding Jewish settlements throughout the West Bank, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, the statement asserted, "The constant insistence
expressed by the Israeli government to expand Jewish settlements,
will inevitably ruin the peace process in a way which will be
inconsistent with the will of the peoples of the region and with
legitimate international resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The document noted, the struggle is now taking on
"unprecedented tragic dimensions," as the Israeli leadership is
"determined to seize the land and deny the basic rights of the
Palestinian people."
</P>
<P>
The statement called, on the Land Day, on Arabs, Israeli peace
activists and international community to intervene in "the serious
development" so as to rescue the peace process from the "serious
and perilous danger" caused by the extremist policy of the
Netanyahu government.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Oil Export Up 21 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian oil export increased
21.87 percent over the previous year, earning the country 19.5
billion U.S. dollars in the last fiscal year which just ended 10
days ago, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh
in a report carried in the Persian-language daily Jumhuri Islami
here today.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer and the second oil
exporter in the world, is expected to generate 18.5 billion
dollars by exporting 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) during this
fiscal year starting from March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the combination of strong prices and
rising production was extremely beneficial to Iran last year.
</P>
<P>
Over the first half of last fiscal year, the Iranian crude
attracted an average price of 17.8 dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
During the fourth quarter of the year, contract prices for
the country's two main kinds of crude, Iranian light and Iranian
heavy, continued to rise, standing at 22.7 dollars per barrel and
21.5 dollars per barrel respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Iran expanded its daily oil production
from 3.6 million bpd to 3.81 million bpd despite the ceiling
limit set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
Japanese oil companies remain the largest foreign lifters
from the Iranian fields, a position they have held since
U.S. companies were forced out by a U.S. trade embargo on Iran.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the proportion of crude lifted by South
Korean firms has also grown. Ten Japanese companies lifted
562,000 bpd in September, up from the 497,000 bpd in August,
while three South Korean firms lifted 336,000 bpd in September,
compared with the August total of 189,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The increase of oil export revenue has greatly relieved the
economic crisis in the country, the foreign debt in particular.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities said that Iran paid 5.8 billion dollars
foreign debts in 1996. The figure is 3.6 times as much as the
target set in the 1996 budget.

JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of South African
tourists are plundering Mozambiques's marine life and turning its
beautiful beaches into filthy wastelands, local daily Sunday
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Durban-based Environmental Investigation and Protection
Agency, which has an office in Maputo, has launched a probe in
responsesntal to complaints by both Mozambicans and South African
visitors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists said since the end of the Mozambican
civil war in 1992, a flood of tourists has abused the lack of
enforcement of local regulations to overfish the tropical waters.
</P>
<P>
South African holiday makers are also accused of littering;
damaging wildlife at camp sites by dumping raw human sewage
directly into sensitive mangrove swamps or the sea.
</P>
<P>
Durban businessman Peter Foulis, 35, a keen diver and
fisherman who has visited the coastal town of Inhambane, north of
Maputo, for the past three years, is disgusted at the behavior of
his fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
"I was there in April last year and returned at the end of
December. The change was shocking," Foulis said, warning that "at
this rate of damage, the area will be a desert in two to three
years."

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Better Sino-Japanese Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan should draw on
historical experience in a bid to jointly create a brighter future
at this important moment for developing Sino-Japanese relations,
President Jiang Zemin said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is an important moment for both countries to inherit the
past and forge towards the future as they mark the 25th
anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic ties between them
this year and the 20th anniversary of the signing of the
Sino-Japanese Peace and Friendship Treaty next year, Jiang told
visiting Japanese Foreign Minister Ikeda Yukihiko during a meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang reviewed his meeting with Prime Minister Hashimoto in
Manila last November and described it as being "positive and
fruitful", saying that they reached some important common
understanding on how to develop bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"Recently I had the chance to converse with several visiting
Japanese statesmen, and they also expressed the strong desire to
further promote Sino-Japanese friendship, and I feel happy and
gratified with this," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda said he held in-depth talks with Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen yesterday, and both agreed to further
build a stable relationship between the two countries at a time
when they celebrate the 25th anniversary of the normalization of
Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese side will properly handle the problems cropping up
in bilateral ties by strictly adhering to the principles set forth
in the joint declaration and the treaty for peace and friendship,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Japan, well aware of the significance of its friendship with
China towards the peace and stability of Asia and the world, is
willing to make unremitting efforts in this regard, and continue
to support China's reform, opening up and modernization drive as
well as its bid for the entry to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
China has always put great emphasis on its relations with
Japan, a close neighbor of China, Jiang said, reiterating that it
is very important to adhere to the principles enshrined in the
joint declaration and the peace and friendship treaty, in order to
ensure the healthy and stable development of bilateral ties.

<TEXT>
<P>
Chinese and Japanese people had maintained friendly exchanges
for some 2,000 years, however, the aggression by Japanese
militarists against China brought grave disasters to the Chinese
people, and at the same time made Japanese people suffer.
</P>
<P>
"I often tell my Japanese friends the Chinese old sayings
that 'the past experience, if not forgotten, can serve as guide
for the future', and 'the overturned cart ahead is a warning to the
ones behind'," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The historical experience and lessons should be often learnt
from, and this is not only the oriental philosophical concept, but
also a responsibility, he noted, adding we should educate the
young generation to keep the past history in mind and to carry
forward the friendship from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of Taiwan, Jiang said, the crux of the
issue is that foreign countries should not interfere in China's
internal affairs by taking any actions which will harm the
reunification of China and hurt the feelings of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Ikeda reaffirmed the Japanese government's deep retrospection
and sincere apology over its history of aggression, pledging that
this position will never change.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, he noted that Japan will adhere to the
"One China" policy and hopes that the two sides across the straits
will settle the issue of reunification peacefully.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan are both countries of great influence in the
region and the world, Jiang said, and to develop the friendly
neighliness and promote their mutual beneficial co-operation not
only conform to the fundamental interests of the two countries
but also constitutes an important and positive factor to the peace,
stability and development of the region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"Especially at this historical juncture when we are greeting
the coming of the 21st century, how to substantially promote the
friendship between the two countries and contribute more to the
peace and progress of the mankind is not only a historical mission
of the two countries and the two peoples but also an important and
practical task we are facing," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he added, both countries, their state leaders in
particular, should treat and consider bilateral relations from a
far-sighted perspective and a strategic height, and to assure a
correct orientation for the development of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Over Half Nigerians Lack Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- About 66 percent of the households
in Nigeria have no electricity while only about a quarter of them
use pipe-borne water, according to a latest national survey.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the survey, undertaken by the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) between 1991 and 1995, shows that 90 percent of
the households in the northern states of Jigawa, Katsina, Kebbi
and Sokoto, as well as Taraba State in the east, have no access
to electricity supply.
</P>
<P>
Lagos State, the commercial center in the southwest, is the
only exception, where only three percent of the households do not
have electricity, the Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report did not mention the cause of the serious
electricity shortage. But the operation under capacity of the
country's power stations might be one of the factors for the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria now has eight major power stations with a total
installed capacity of 5,961.3 MW. However, the current peak load
of the stations is put at only 2,454 MW due to major breakdown
requiring substantial foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Power and Steel Alhaji Bashir Mohammed Dalhatu
said earlier this week that it will need some 30 million U.S.
dollars for the National Electric Power Authority to rehabilitate
all its power stations.
</P>
<P>
The FOS National Integrated Surveyu of Households also shows
that 49 percent of the population dispose refuse within their
residences, while 38 percent use other places like bush or
dunghill to dispose off their refuse.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, only 11 percent of Nigerian people use their own
bins while only two percent use government bins.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, about 87 percent of Nigerians use
unsatisfactory refuse disposal method which experts say is
responsible for the spread of most communicable diseases in the
country.
</P>
<P>
With 25 percent of the population using pipe-borne water and
only seven percent using bore-hole, the FOS said it is a better
record when compared with electricity usage and waste disposal.

JOHANNESBURG, March 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's biggest
church leader, His Grace Bishop Barnabas Lekganyane, has come out
in favor of the death penalty, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Lekganyane, whose Zion Christian Church has an estimated 7
million members in Southern Africa, said the death penalty was a
necessary evil in a society where "criminals brazenly shoot, rape
and maim innocent people".
</P>
<P>
South Africa abolished the death penalty in 1995 as the ruling
African National Congress described it as being unconstitutional
and against the Blacks.
</P>
<P>
Lekganyane said the democratically-elected government should
invest a large portion of the national budget in crime
prevention, and more attention needed to be put into the current
justice system to ensure that criminals would be met by full
strength of law.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke out against the legislation of abortion, saying
education, not the termination of pregnancies was what "our
children need".

<HEADLINE> PNA to Present Draft Resolution on Jerusalem to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) will present a draft resolution to the ongoing meeting of
the Arab League Council calling for the preservation of Jerusalem
from Israel's Judaization attempts, Xinhua learned today.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting, which drew 18 Arab foreign ministers and
opened at the Arab League headquarters here earlier today, is
expected to focus on Jerusalem, the core and crux of the
Palestinian cause, as an Israeli housing project in East Jerusalem
has sparked 10 days of Palestinian riots and put the peace process
in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians, who claim Jerusalem as a future capital, accused
Israel of aiming through Jewish settlement to cut Arab East
Jerusalem from the Palestinian territories in the West Bank and
preempt talks on a final peace accord that settles the
Palestinian-Israeli issue.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian draft resolution, which might be adopted by the
council, includes a denunciation of the Israeli government
decision to start building the new Jewish settlement in Jabal Abu
Ghneim (Har Homa), East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution calls for sustained Arab and Muslim
coordination in taking appropriate measures to thwart any Israeli
plans concerning East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution calls on the U.N. and other concerned
international quarters to pressure Israel into lifting the ban on
Palestinians to work inside Israel and allow Palestinians, whether
Muslims or Christians, to perform their religious rituals at the
holy site in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution supports the recommendations issued by the
Jerusalem Committee in Morocco last week on setting up a Jerusalem
fund at the disposal of the Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) and the PNA in order to confront the Judaization attempts.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian draft resolution also urges a wide-scale
propaganda campaign to confront and shatter Israeli policies,
which are aimed at stripping the Palestinians of their rights to
enjoy a peaceful life on their own soil.
</P>
<P>
It suggests that Jerusalem day be observed on June 28, the day
Israel announced the annexation of East Jerusalem in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution highlights and emphasizes the Arab
identity of Jerusalem and calls for enabling foreign delegations
to visit the holy city and call on Orient House, PLO's major
representative office in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The draft document welcomes the European Union's statement that
censures Israel's controversial Jewish housing project and eggs on
Russia and the U.S. to force Israel to abide by U.N. Security
Council resolutions 252 and 476 adopted respectively in 1968 and
1980, which considered all Israeli measures in East Jerusalem as
null and void.
</P>
<P>
It entrusts the Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid with contacting regional and international
organizations to "pore over the best means and measures through
which the civilizational, cultural, and religious legacy of the
holy city be preserved."

<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Indian Congress Party President
Sitaram Kesri today submitted a letter to President S.D. Sharma,
withdrawing the party's support to the 14-party coalition
government headed by Deve Gowda.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, the Congress president charged the United Front
government with failing to isolate the communal forces and
strengthening the secular forces.
</P>
<P>
The United Front had promised the Congress Party that it would
take all steps to ensure that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP),
the major opposition in the country, was contained but it failed
in its mission, said Tariq Anwar, political secretary to the party
president.
</P>
<P>
It is due to the United Front's failure, the BJP-Bahujan Samaj
Party had come to power in Uttar Pradesh state, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the last ten months, the Congress had been warning the
ruling United Front but it paid little heed to its demands, he
further said.
</P>
<P>
A crucial meeting of the Congress Working Committee, the
highest policy-making body of the party, is expected shortly to
chalk out the future course of action, Congress Party sources
indicated.

<HEADLINE> Report: Rafsanjani's Visit to S. Arabia Not </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 29 (Xinhua) -- There has been no confirmation on
the possibility of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani's official
visit to Saudi Arabia during the hajji season, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Today's Persian dailies Jomhuri Islami and Salam published the
news by the official news agency IRNA's Persian service, which
cited an official source close to the president's office.
</P>
<P>
The report contradicts what had been reported in the London-
based Saudi-owned paper Ash-Sharq-ul-Awsat, which quoted Iranian
Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Mohammad Reza Nouri Friday as saying
that Rafsanjani is expected to make his first official visit to
Saudi Arabia in April to perform the hajji pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
The source said that the Iranian president pledged his support
to examine all avenues on the improvement of ties with and trip
to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani's last visit to Saudi Arabia at the start of the
1979 Islamic revolution was a personal visit to perform the
hajji. His wife and daughter had recently visited Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said that Rafsanjani and Saudi Arabian
Crown Prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz had discussed the possibility
of a trip by the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Tehran is eagerly to improve
relations with Saudi Arabia but the latter seems reluctant to
extend invitation to the Iranian president.
</P>
<P>
Iranian hajji pilgrims Saturday vowed to stage demonstrations
in Macca despite a Saudi ban.
</P>
<P>
On March 15, Rafsanjani urged Saudi Arabia to lift the ban on
anti-U.S. and anti-Israel rally during a Muslim pilgrimage in
Mecca next month.
</P>
<P>
He said "Saudi officials in charge of the pilgrims' affairs
would understand the stands of the Islamic Republic of Iran
toward the Muslim world and would prepare the ground for Hajji
rituals to be held as recommended by the Holy Koran."
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said cooperation between Iran and Saudi Arabia will
serve to revive the great power of Islam and put it at the
disposal of Muslim nations.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the 64-year-old
Iranian president served as an official response to the customary
warning issued by the Saudi authorities that political activities
will not be tolerated during the Hajji, which is due to take place
in April this year.
</P>
<P>
Such demonstrations have previously led to tense situation and
even bloody confrontations with the Saudi security forces. In
1987, more than 400 people were killed in clashes between Iranian
demonstrators and Saudi forces. The two countries broke off
relations from 1988 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi authorities kept a close watch on Iranian pilgrims
in past years, trying to prevent them from holding any rallies in
public.

<HEADLINE> Arab Countries to Take Firm Stance on Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are expected to
take a firm stance to force Israel to back off from building a
Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem during a meeting of Arab
League's foreign ministers, which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and 18 foreign ministers from
the Arab League member states attended the meeting, which will
last for two days.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League Council meeting, though a routine gathering,
is aimed at formulating a common Arab response to Israel's
settlement construction in East Jerusalem, which the Arabs said
has severely challenged the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries have time and again appealed to the U.S. to
pressure Israel into abiding by relevant U.N. resolutions, but
the U.S. has failed to make it comply.
</P>
<P>
The limelight will be on the Israeli settlement practices in
East Jerusalem and other occupied Arab lands, an issue that has
sparked wide-spread Palestinian rioting and put the peace process
in jeopardy since late last month.
</P>
<P>
Also on agenda are the support of the Palestinian Intifada
(uprisings) against Israel, Palestinian refugees and other
developments on Palestinian lands. The league's Secretary
General, Esmat Abdel Meguid, has said earlier that Arab foreign
ministers will take up the support of Intifada as "a major prop
against the Israeli arrogance."
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers are expected to discuss altogether
45 hot topics, including the Arab-Israeli conflicts, the peace
process and other issues pertaining to the joint Arab action
during their two-day meeting at the league's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Several draft resolutions are expected to be reviewed. One of
the draft resolutions calls for freezing normalization procedures
with Israel and maintaining economic boycott against it until
just and comprehensive peace agreements on all tracks were
concluded.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian talks have broken down as Israel last
week sent bulldozers to Jabal Abu Ghneim, the site of a planned
6,500-unit Jewish neighborhood in East Jerusalem, where
Palestinians hope to establish their future capital.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and wants the
entire city to remain undivided under Israeli
sovereignty. Clashes between Palestinian stone-throwers and
Israeli soldiers plagued the West Bank and Gaza ever since,
including a suicide bombing attack that killed four people in a
Tel Aviv cafe last week.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab countries, such as Oman and Qatar, have suspended
their relations with Israel and while others like Egypt, Israel's
biggest Arab partner, has sent a similar signal, if it fails to
backtrack on the controversial housing decision.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from the Arab and Muslim world, at a flurry of
meetings for the past few days, have come up with several
resolutions calling on Arab and Muslim countries to review their
ties with Israel, a move aimed to pressure the Jewish state to
stop building the settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Saturday that Israel
would be playing with fire if it proceeds with the Jewish
building project in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Tensions and violence will not cease until the construction
stops... There is no other solution," he warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Arab Trade Unions (IFATU) denounced today Israel's persistence in
adopting the policy of confiscating Arab lands and setting up new
Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem in an attempt to Judaize the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
This came in a statement issued by the General Secretariat of
the IFATU on the occasion of the Palestinian Land Day, which falls
on March 30.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the IFATU general secretariat expressed its
support for the Palestinian people in their struggle for the
restoration of their just and legitimate rights of repatriation,
self-determination and the establishment of an independent
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
The statement also appealed to the Arab governments and popular
organizations as well as trade unions across the world to prop up
the Palestinian people in the just struggle to restore their
rights.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it called for all kinds of pressure on
Israel to force it to give up the Jewish settlement
construction. It also urged Israel to stop the practices of
confiscating Arab land and Judaizing Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Call for Closing Ranks Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Arab leaders, intensive on a
campaign to close ranks, have stressed the exigency of overcoming
differences among themselves and standing up against Israel's
challenge to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
President of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser
Arafat said the current stage is "the most delicate phase of the
peace process," as Israel has made a further move to change the
demographic and geographical features of East Jerusalem by
building a Jewish neighborhood there.
</P>
<P>
This came in a written speech by Arafat late Saturday before
the inaugural session of a seminar here under the title of "the
Arab visualization of peace."
</P>
<P>
In his speech, read out on his behalf, the Palestinian leader
said the real meaning of peace and Arab participation in the peace
process have become dubious as the Israeli buildings in East Jerusalem
have aggravated the apprehensions of the Palestinians far and wide.
</P>
<P>
"We have sustained continued sufferings since the very
beginning of the peace process in order to safeguard the
foundations of peace," he complained.
</P>
<P>
Arab League chief Esmat Abdul-Meguid, in his speech, said the
peace process is going through one of its most difficult stages
owing to the Israeli intransigence and attempts to circumvent
peace commitments and agreements as well as its insistence on
building Jewish settlements on Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Israeli leaders to realize that no peace can be
attained through imposing a state of fait accompli and urged the
U.S. to stop "supporting Israel."
</P>
<P>
In his speech that was read out on his behalf, Jordanian Crown
Prince Hassan Ibn Talal said Arab countries should set aside their
differences emanating from "the discrepancy of talks on the
various peace tracks with Israel" since the Camp David agreement
signed by Egypt and Israel in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Prince Hassan underscored the importance of reviewing causes
behind the "weakness of the Arab order" and called for
consolidating Arab relations with western, Asian and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have to prove to the world that no peace can be established
without Israel's abidance by all relevant international
resolutions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, in his speech, accused
Israel of neglecting the rights of the Palestinians and Arabs at
large to guarantee the Israeli security. He condemned the Israeli
policy that he described as based on "maltreatment and holding the
Arabs solely responsible for the current peace stalement."
</P>
<P>
The Arab foreign ministers are meeting here at the Arab League
headquarters today as part of their latest efforts to map out a
common strategy to cope with Israel's housing plan in East
Jerusalem, which has sparked Palestinian rioting and put the
Middle East peace process in jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> French Police Arrest 30 in Anti-FN Protest in Strasbourg </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- French police arrested about 30
people, some of them German anarchists, in a clash between police
and demonstrators protesting against the French extreme right
National Front party Saturday night in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
The clash took place following a gigantic demonstration against
the extreme-right National Front party earlier in the day, in
which at least 5,000 people took part.
</P>
<P>
The clash began in the evening when some demonstrators broke
several display windows of shops, the window of a bank and some
windows of houses, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also threw stones at police, wounding lightly
three of them, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Later at night, a small group of young men also burned a
vehicle of the security force near the central Kleber square of
Strasbourg, where a concert was taking place.
</P>
<P>
These young men also broke windows and looted shops, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The anti-riot police of Republican Company of Security called
in reinforcement and ordered the protesters to immediately leave
the square at 23:00 (2200 GMT). But around 500 people defied
police order and continued to stay on the square.
</P>
<P>
Police then used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the
demonstrators, and formed a cordon around the square to prevent
protesters from gathering again on the square.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: Unity Government Not Under </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu has dismissed speculations that he is
currently preoccupied with the idea of forming a national unity
government in order to tide over the difficulties in the peace
process, the state-run Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
A national unity government "is not a practical option right
now," said Netanyahu while addressing a gathering of Likud
activists in Tel Aviv Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
He did not, however, rule out the formation of a national
unity government in the future.
</P>
<P>
The rightwing premier disclosed that he had invited the major
opposition Labor Party to join his government several times
since the election. "I told them they could enter the government
on the basis of the existing coalition guidelines. Labor (Party)
was the side that declined (the offer)," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speculations have been rife about the idea of forming a
national unity government, in view of the fact that Netanyahu is
facing challenges not only from the left parties but also from his
coalition partners over the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Shimon Peres, Labor Party Chairman and former prime minister, is
believed to be interested in joining a projected unity
government in an effort to save the peace march from further
deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was reported to
have privately advised Israel to form a unity government so as
to extricate itself from the current crisis. But the Clinton
Administration has officially stated that it is simply an
internal affair of Israel.

LUSAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Nine foreign companies have come
to explore gold and another two to explore diamonds in Zambia's
Northwestern, Western, Central, Northern, Copperbelt and Lusaka
provinces.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed by Minister of Mines and Minerals
Development Christon Tembo at a function here last night.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said, ''numerous new companies have come in especially
in the field of mineral exploration. They are contributing to the
boom in the mining sector and are opening up new opportunities to
the Zambian geoscientists.''
</P>
<P>
At the same function, Publicity Secretary of the Geological
Society of Zambia Francis Tembo said that in the past Zambia had
steadily lost its position among the top mineral producers
because the country had neglected investment in the exploration
for new mineral deposits.
</P>
<P>
To attract investment, the Zambian government has adopted an
investment act to provide various incentives to investors. A new
mines and minerals act was passed recently to particularly
attract investment in the mining sector.

HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Electricity Supply
Authority (ZESA) has stopped exporting power to Botswana amid
allegations that some senior officials in the parastatal
benefited from the exercise, the Sunday Mail reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper reported it is reliably understood that ZESA was
exporting power to Botswana at lower rates than it was importing
from Zambia, Zaire and South Africa. It was then making up for
the export losses through increases in tariff charges such as the
increase of between 18 and 20 percent effected last year.
</P>
<P>
But ZESA Public Relations Manager Sam Mahlanza denied that
some officials were benefiting from the exercise.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''ZESA stopped exporting power to Botswana at
midnight on March 16 because it no longer has the surplus on its
system.''

HARARE, March 30 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has deported over

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR Es SALAAM, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Transitional Tobacco
Company Rothmans has acquired a 90 percent share-holding in the
Zanzibar Cigarette Company (ZCC) after negotiations between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
Rothmans Africa Managing Director, Peter Van Cauwelaert said
in a statement issued in the town of Zanzibar on Saturday that
Rothmans had previously been aiding ZCC with its investment in
the company through a management and technical expertise
contract.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 4.5 million U.S. Dollars had already
enabled ZCC to acquire modern technology and machinery and had
led to the successful relaunch of existing ZCC brands such as
Baridi, Challenge and Ascot King Size.
</P>
<P>
He said a further investment of 3 million US Dollars is
planned for construction of a completely new primary plant to
process local Tanzanian leaf tobacco into international quality
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
"As part of its commitment to production in Zanzibar, Rothmans
will manufacture a number of its world renowned trademarks," said
Cauwelaert in the statement.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that with a well-trained work force and rising
efficiency, the products would be equal to any factory in Africa
and would ensure growing employment and higher government
revenues to Treasury coffers.
</P>
<P>
The managing director also expressed hope that at some stage
the company would be able to export cigarettes internationally
from Zanzibar.

<P>
ROME, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini said today that Italy welcomed the U.N. Security Council's
approval for the dispatch of a multinational force to Albania for
at least three months to protect aid delivery and help recover
peace there.
</P>
<P>
The vote represented "the definitive endorsement of the
international community for the Italian and European commitment to
pacification in Albania," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council approved a proposal presented by the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) that a
military force should be sent to Albania to guard relief supplies
and facilitate the work of the OSCE and European Union in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the urgency of restoring the democratic process and
public order in Albania needs create conditions which would help
stem the flow of refugees to Italy across the Adriatic.
</P>
<P>
The approval would also reduce tragic accidents. Last night in
the Ottanto channel at least four Albanians died after their boat
was capsized and sank after a collision with an Italian naval
vessel.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 Albanians have crossed the Adriatic to Italy
since the crisis broke out in Albania earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The number of the multinational force is expected to be about
2,500 from Spain, Portugal, France, Greece and Austria in the
initial phase. Its main tasks would be to secure the ports and
airport in the small European country to guarantee the
humanitarian aid to transport there safely.
</P>
<P>
Italian troops have been waiting in the Brindisi area on a
24-hour alert for orders to cross to Albania since last week.

<HEADLINE> India to Grant Autonomy to Nationalized Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
considering a proposal to give total autonomy to four
profit-making nationalized banks regarding fixation of pay scales
and determination of service conditions, a Finance Ministry
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is implemented, then the banks will be able to
determine their own pay scales and act beyond the scope of
bipartite settlements at the industry level.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, these banks will also be at liberty to have their own
service conditions for the staff.
</P>
<P>
At present, the pay scales and the service conditions of the
bank staff are determined through the bipartite settlements.
</P>
<P>
The four nationalized banks, selected by the Finance Ministry
for being offered the autonomy, are the State Bank of India, the
Union Bank of India, the Corporation Bank and the Oriental Bank of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to grant total autonomy is on the grounds that
these banks have shown a net profit in the last three consecutive
years; Their amount of non-performing assets was below 10 percent;
And they have been able to maintain a capital adequacy ratio
higher than the stipulated level of eight percent.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Says Shipwreck Makes Albanian Mission Urgent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today that the sinking of an Albanian refugee boat had made
an international mission to help Albania more urgent.
</P>
<P>
An Albanian naval patrol boat carrying refugees went down on
Friday night after colliding with an Italian naval vessel
patrolling the Adriatic to try to stem the flow of Albanians to
southern Italy.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said the sinking of the ship, which killed at least four,
"demonstrates that the international operation to help Albania
must start as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
An Italy-led international force to guard aid deliveries have
been assembled near the southern port city of Brindisi for several
days, waiting for an order from the Italian Defense Ministry to
move to Albania.
</P>
<P>
The mission was authorized by the U.N. Security Council late on
Friday to help Albania recover from violence and anarchy.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,000 Albanians have reached Italy in the past two
weeks on a flotilla of ancient boats after rebels in the south
took control of towns in an armed insurrection.
</P>
<P>
The sinking was the first incident involving fatalities since
the exodus began on March 13.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said a navy operation to patrol
the southern Adriatic and stem a tide of refugees would continue
because it had Albanian government approval.
</P>
<P>
"That does not mean that we will stop welcoming people who need
help, aid or assistance, those who are among the weakest, such as
children, old people and women, who will be welcomed in Italy as

<HEADLINE> Chile Considers Separate Proposals on Trade Bloc in America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Chile said today it hopes to
make separate proposals on the proposed Free Trade Area of the
Americas (ALCA) at the Second Summit of the Americas, scheduled
for March next year in the Chilean capital of Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Juan Martabit, director of the Americas Section of the Chilean
Foreign Ministry, said Chile, as the host country of the
hemispheric gathering, wants to present an individual document on
the negotiation mechanisms and themes of the ALCA, over which the
United States and Brazil have different views.
</P>
<P>
"There is an opportunity to present a counterproposal in which
we are working, through coordination with other countries," said
Martabit.
</P>
<P>
The ALCA was proposed by 34 American countries at the First
Summit of the Americas held in December 1994 in Miami, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Ameircan trade bloc, which would bring together 750
million people in diverse countries as Haiti and the U.S., was
supposed to be established by 2005 as set by the Miami summit, but
participating countries have remained far divided over its
creation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has pledged to push forward the
establishment of the trade bloc but polls show Americans in the
U.S. oppose trade agreements that would send U.S. jobs abroad.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, which is a member of Mercosur consisting of Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay, insists that Mercosur should be
strenghthened first as a counterweight of the North American Free
Trade Area, which groups the U.S., Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Martabit said a major task of the Second Summit of the Americas
was to coordinate the stances on the ALCA.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the differences had been discussed at the ALCA
trade ministers' meeting in February in Recife, Brazil.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Second Summit of the Americas will also
discuss agreements to be signed at the Third Conference of Trade
Ministers of the ALCA, scheduled for May in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Martabit announced today the creation of working teams for the
Second Summit of the Americas.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's LTTE Seeks 3rd-Party Mediation for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan rebel group, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), has insisted on a
third-party mediation for resuming talks with the government,
according to Tamil sources here today.
</P>
<P>
However, The LTTE gave two preconditions for talks to end the
ethnic conflict, the sources quoted a LTTE's representative as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The first one is that government troops must withdraw from
current positions in the North and return to their original bases
held before the military operation in which the Jaffna peninsula
was recaptured by the troops in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
The second is that the government must accept the LTTE as the
sole representative of the Tamil people.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE representative did not indicate any country or
organization which would be acceptable as a third-party mediator.
</P>
<P>
However, the government said earlier the LTTE should lay down
arms and a specific time frame should be fixed for any
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting for a separate state in the
North and East of Sri Lanka since 1983. More than 55,000 people
have been reportedly killed in the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after coming to power in 1994, The People's Alliance
government opened talks with the LTTE, but in April 1995 the
rebels abruptly pulled out to resume their protracted campaign for
an independent homeland in the island country.

DHAKA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) has requested all party units in the
district and county level to organize public gatherings and

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 pieces of
religious art works have been stolen during the last five years in
Colombia, the Colcultura Mobile Patrimony Section said.
</P>
<P>
In Fontibon, several men armed with submachine guns entered the

On February 26, 1993, robbers stole the painting "Samson and

<HEADLINE> China to Restructure Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese power industry with 470
billion yuan of state capital will play a more important role in
international securities markets as its new management system
moves towards completion.
</P>
<P>
According to the Business Weekly of China Daily today, the
State Power Corporation Corp (SP), one of the world's largest
which will handle the capital, will support the new system and
help it raise money, increase the value of state capital and
foster competition.
</P>
<P>
The capital, representing 80 per cent of the industry's value,
will be used to raise funds at home and broad as well as guarantee
co-operation with foreign governments, enterprises and
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The corporation plans to sell bonds for the industry's
operation and development this year. It is considering selling
stock after packaging it in line with international conventions
and methods.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Datang Power Generation Co, which made its debut on
the London Stock Exchange last week, is representative of the
industry. Other Chinese power companies are expected to follow its
example, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China's power industry has been restructured several times
since the founding of the People's Republic in 1949. But the
change were considered outcomes of readjustments under the old
centrally planned regime until SP was established this year.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted SP president Shi Dazhen as saying that China
should no longer depend on government guarantees for overseas
securities listing, loans and negotiating major projects.

<HEADLINE> Glass Buildings Reflect Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Beijing shines with blue-mirrored
buildings that reflect a fortune for glass manufacturers and a
hazard for residents.
</P>
<P>
Since the first glass high-rise -- the Great Wall Sheraton
Hotel -- was erected in Beijing in 1985, similar buildings have
been blossoming in the capital, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and
other major cities, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
China builds four million to five million square meters of
glass walls a year. They are worth about 4.5 billion yuan (542
million US dollars). China has about 15 million square meters of
glass buildings.
</P>
<P>
The glass walls reflect the sun, cause temperatures to rise in
the neighborhood and blind passers-by, which might cause danger
for drivers.
</P>
<P>
Concerns about such "light pollution" are increasing, said Guo
Xiulan, a State Environmental Protection Agency official.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau received similar
complaints, and Shanghai media have received more than 100 letters
of complaint, according to a report in People's Daily last week.
</P>
<P>
The complaints have led to limits on new glass buildings.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Beijing urban planning committee vetoed a plan to
install glass walls for a complex in the eastern part of the
city. It demanded the developers not use blue glass to avoid
light pollution.
</P>
<P>
The committee has vetoed about 30 construction plans for
similar reasons.

<HEADLINE> Two HK Heroin Traffickers Sentenced to Death in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Two heroin traffickers from Hong
Kong were sentenced to death in Ho Chi Minh City Friday.
</P>
<P>
The two Hong Kong residents holding British passports,
34-years-old Sun Chi-Kin and 24-years-old Chan Chun-Hung Sam My
were arrested in March last year after customs officers found 18.1
kilograms of heroin hidden in their two suitcases. They arrived at
Ho Chi Minh City's international airport from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
A court official was quoted by today's Vietnam News as saying
that the two men who carried false Portugese passports issued in
Macao were transiting in Ho Chi Minh City in order to transport
the drugs to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said the trial lasted one day and the two men
have 15 days to appeal.
</P>
<P>
Possession or transporting more than one kilogram of heroin is
punishable by death in Vietnam. Up to now four foreigners have
previously received death sentences for drug-related crimes in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Vietnam uncovered more than 3,800 cases of drug
trafficking and arrested 6,650 people for drug-related offences.
</P>
<P>
However, official sources here said drug trafficking and abuse
in Vietnam is still on the rise.
</P>
<P>
Most of those susceptible to drug addiction are young
people. The arrest of four heroin dealers and 94 young drug users
earlier this month in Ho Chi Minh City shocked the country.
</P>
<P>
A report made by the anti-narcotics program of the national
committee for ethnic minorities and the highlands said that there
are about 140,000 drug addicts nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Government continues to crack down on drugs. An
all-out propaganda campaign was waged by the Communist Youth
League, the Women's Union and the Environment Bureau beginning on
March 13 in Ho Chi Minh City.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks Confident in RMB business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Foreign banks licensed to deal in
renminbi claim full confidence in their new business and China's
financial reforms, reported today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The move shows China's financial sector is more open and
improving, said Johnson Cheng, deputy general manager of the
International Bank of Paris and Shanghai (IBPS).
</P>
<P>
The bank, a joint venture between Banque National de Paris and
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, is the first Sino-foreign
bank to receive the yuan license.
</P>
<P>
Cheng said the bank would be able to offer more banking
services to its multinational clients and potential investors in
China.
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to kick off its new business in June after it
moves to an office in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
Some foreign banks said restrictions exist for the foreign
banks when handling yuan deposits and loans. Their clients must
be either foreign-funded firms or foreign individuals.
</P>
<P>
Eddie Wang, chief executive officer for the Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking Co Ltd (HSBC) in China, said the restrictions
were understandable at this stage because the success of China's
previous reforms has been achieved step by step.
</P>
<P>
HSBC initiated local currency business last Wednesday with the
Industrial Bank of Japan.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from Daiichi Kangyo Bank echoed Wang's view.
He said he was confident in the new business.
</P>
<P>
"We don't think there is any problem," he said. "It largely
depends on our service to attract clients."
</P>
<P>
Daiichi Kangyo Bank is expected to start renminbi business in
mid April. Other licensed to deal in renminbi are Citibank, the
Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd,
Standard Chartered Bank and Sanwa Bank, the paper said.

<P>
QUITO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A 40-kilogram silver bar, ceramics
fragments and some 150 pieces of ancient silver coins were found
when a team of divers were searching for treasures in a Spanish
ship sunken in Ecuadoran waters more than 300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Minting dates and the image of Felipe IV, then king of Spain,
are still recognizable on the coins, divers from the Sudamerica
Discoveries company said.
</P>
<P>
The findings are only part of between 3.7 billion and 7.5
billion dollars of treasures that went down with the Spanish ship
in 1654, said company president German Moro.
</P>
<P>
The rescue of the Spanish ship kicked off on March 19, when two
U.S. divers hired by the company made the first immersion in the
sea off the Cacerio Real town, Guayas province.
</P>
<P>
The ship was called "Jesus Maria de la Limpia Concepcion de

BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- the Chinese commercial banking
sector, which is moving to become market-oriented, will provide

In the planned-economy era, Chinese banks were tools for the
government to allocate funds to projects and used simple methods
to record their business activities.
</P>
<P>
The country's financial reforms launched in the 1980s are
commercializing most domestic banks.
</P>
<P>
To standardize operation, the banks have begun to strengthen
their international accounting while enlisting public auditing
institutions to accurately evaluate the quality of their assets.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with international practices, balance sheets
audited by public accounting firms gradually will be accepted as
the only language for commercial banks to communicate with
financial regulators and the public, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
Competition among the accounting firms for clients in the
banking sector is inevitable, Fu said.
</P>
<P>
This year, the China Minsheng Banking Co, the country's newest
and only non-state bank, hired international accounting firm Price
Waterhouse to write its 1996 annual report.
</P>
<P>
In competing for Chinese banking clients, international CPAs,
with more expertise and experiences, could win part of the market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Challenges from foreign firms will drive domestic CPAs to merge
and become strong enough to conduct bank auditing, which is one
of the most demanding jobs of an accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
However, domestic CPAs will have some advantages in the
competition, especially in serving banks transforming from their
former roles to commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> China Prospecting Resource Reserves in International Seabed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Li Desheng, a well-known Chinese petro-geologist, warned that
China's current proven oil reserves dry up within 20 years' time,
and the proven reserves of copper and manganese ores only account
for one fifth of the estimated volume.
</P>
<P>
Observers predict that by 2020, about 40 percent of China's oil
demands will be met by imports.
</P>
<P>
Plenty of oil, gas, biological resources, and polymetallic
nodules of economic value are hidden in the world's vast area of
seabed, including about 70 billion tons of polymetallic resources
which are of high industrial exploration value.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the United Nations, China was given the
right to explore resources in 150,000-sq-km sea areas in
northeastern Pacific Ocean in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China has sent four ships and rigs,
with some 400 workers, to carry out prospecting in several
hundreds of positions in the marine region.
</P>
<P>
Through prospecting experiments, experts have found
huge amount of dry nodules and manganese, copper, nickel and
cobalt in the marine mining areas reserved for China, which are
liable to commercial exploitation for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that China is expected to concentrate development
within 75,000 sq km seabed areas through further operations and
will make preparations for formal commercial exploitation as early
as possible.

<HEADLINE> China Prospecting Resource Reserves in International Seabed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Two scientific prospecting
vessels flying the Chinese national flag will soon leave for the
northeastern Pacific Ocean to conduct prospecting.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at finding strategic resource reserves for
China in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Jin Jiancai, Secretary-General of China Ocean Mineral Resources
Research and Development Association, said that as part of the
four scheduled large-scale ocean prospecting events this century,
the two vessels will spend half a year on prospecting over 100,000
sq km sea areas with the aid of advanced equipment and robots
capable of working at 6,000 m below the sea surface.
</P>
<P>
The mission will also be responsible for surveying distribution
of mineral resources and mining environment at the 5,000-m-deep
seabed, making preparations for developing the un-tapped marine
resources on a large-scale in the next century and hoping to wage
commercial exploitation in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Prospecting in the international seabed, which started in the
late 1950s, has been considered by the scientific community as the
"aerospace technology of the seabed" as such activities require
the use of a large number of sophisticated technologies.
</P>
<P>
However, the captivating commercial prospects in this field
have attracted a group of scientists from western countries and
the former Soviet Union, and some international consortia.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, some countries have launched
international events termed as "exploiting the common property of
mankind" in accordance with "United Nations Convention on the Law
of the Sea".
</P>
<P>
Up to now, scientists have verified oil and gas reserves in 50
percent of the seabed area of the earth, which is believed to
double the proven oil and gas reserves on land, and have also
discovered a large amount of minerals which might be able to be
used as substitute energy in the 21st century, as well as
biological resources capable of being used for human medical and
health care purposes.

<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland held Portugal to
a 0-0 draw in a World Cup European Group Nine qualifier in Belfast
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bryan Hamilton's team, needing a win to enhance their slim
hopes of reaching next year's finals in France, played with their
usual gusto and spirit, but could not break down the visitors'
defence.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, who also needed to win to stretch their lead over
Ukraine and Germany, rarely looked settled under the home side's
pressure.
</P>
<P>
The Irish could have led as early as the fifth minute when
Keith Gillespie fed captain Iain Dowie down the right and his
cross looked perfect for the unmarked James Quinn only for the
youngster to scuff his shot into the arms of Portugal keeper Vitor
Baia from close range.
</P>
<P>
Portugal, despite going into the game with a record of just
five goals in seven matches since Euro 96, soon showed their
attacking flair and Joao Pinto squandered a great chance when he
shot wide from 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
The contest threatened to boil over at times and Quinn and
Portugal's Fernando Couto were booked by Italian referee Graziano
Cesari in the 59th minute for a touchline flare-up.
</P>
<P>
Home keeper Tommy Wright was kept more and more busy as the
match wore on, tipping over a thundering volley from Barcelona
star Figo and later racing forward to block Joao Pinto with the
Irish defence ball-watching.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland have now gathered only five points from four
home qualifiers and only European champions Germany have still to
visit Belfast.

<HEADLINE> More Villages Have Telephone Access in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 percent of the
villages in Fujian Province now have access to telephone service
thanks to the helping hand of the local government.
</P>
<P>
With a government investment of 800 million yuan last year,
some 1,835 villages in the province have installed telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, telecommunications developed rapidly in
Fujian's rural areas; the majority of the villages and towns in
the province have been provided with program-controlled telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
But in the countryside, problems such as few subscribers and
poor economic returns have hindered the development of
communications.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 villages in the out-of-the-way or economically
undeveloped areas could not have telephone service at the end of
1995.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the provincial government decided to open telephone
service in 1,500 villages each year in a bid to form a complete
telephone network in the province by 1999.
</P>
<P>
The project needs a total investment of about 3.3 billion yuan,
mainly made by local telecommunication departments, and the
provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Optical fibers will be used as the main material of the rural
telephone lines, said an official in charge of the
telecommunications in the province.

BUCHAREST, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Romania crushed Liechtenstein
8-0 in a World Cup group eight qualifier on Saturday with
Barcelona midfielder Gheorghe Popescu leading the rout with four
goals.
</P>
<P>
Gheorghe Hagi, Viorel Moldovan, Dan Petrescu and Gheorghe
Craioveanu completed the scoring which maintained Romania's 100
per cent record in the group with four wins out of four matches
played and a goal difference of 18-0.
</P>
<P>
Romania could easily have had more goals, going close on at
least another eight occasions against their totally outclassed
opponents who have now lost all five of their qualifiers with a
goal tally of 2-29. At least this score was something of an
improvement on their last outing which ended in an 11-1 loss to
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
In the end they failed to hit double figures but still chalked
up their biggest win since beating Finland 9-0 in a World Cup
qualifier in Bucharest almost 24 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Liechtenstein's cause was not helped by heavy rain and a muddy
field. But Romania's team, comprising 11 overseas-based players,
totally domintated proceedings to stay on course for a place in
the finals in France next year.
</P>
<P>
Romania are unlikely to have things quite as much their own way
on Wednesday when they face Lithuania but whatever happens then,
the Romanians will stay top of the group as they go into that game
five points clear of second-placed Ireland.

After being held to a draw by Israel last time out, Russia had
hoped for a convincing win to regain control of the group.
</P>
<P>
They poured everything into attack for the opening half hour,

</P>
<P>
Russia hit back within a minute when Igor Simutenkov scored
following a free kick.
</P>

Russia had most of the game in the second half but failed to
break down the well-organised Cypriot defence.
</P>
<P>
However, with seconds to go Alexander Mostovoi found himself
unmarked three meters from goal but shot wide.
</P>
<P>
Russia tops the standings with eight points from four games but
could be overhauled on Sunday when Israel, currently on seven
points, visit Luxembourg. Bulgaria are third on six points and

FUZHOU, March 30 (Xinhua) -- Corporate bonds met with investor

</P>
<P>
The three-year bonds, at an annual interest rate of 11

pockets of urban and rural residents, and a lack of new stocks in
the local market.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the bonds carry a higher interest rate than the state
treasury bonds as well as a solid promise for repayment upon
maturity," said the analyst, pointing to a probable gain in the
bonds' value once listed in the SSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 29 (Xinhua) -- The dominant host Croatia was
held to a 1-1 draw by the visiting Denmark in a World Cup
qualifier in Split on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The home team held the initiative for much of the game but
failed to convert any of their chances, especially in the first
half, thanks mainly to Manchester United goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's top scorer Davor Suker did manage to tip the ball
over Schmeichel after a cross by Robert Jarni from the left five
minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
After going behind Denmark began to attack more and equalised
the score by a goal from Brian Laudrup on only minutes left.
</P>
<P>
Laudrup sent a high left-foot cross in from the right which was
carried by the wind into the top right-hand corner of the net.

<P>
PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Stephane Barthe of France claimed
the opening stage of the Criterium international cycling race
Saturday, a 188km run from Blaye-les-Mines to Rabastens:
</P>
<P>
Barthe, 24, won a sprint finish to edge out Mario Traversoni of
Italy and Frederic Moncassin of France as he completed the stage
in four hours 47 minutes 28 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The peloton was surprised some 15km from the finish when a
stray horse suddenly leapt into their midst around Isle-sur-Tarn
before disappearing from the fray as quickly as it had
materialised.
</P>
<P>
Barthe just pipped Traversoni on the line after the latter had
hit the front to hold off Moncassin's challenge.
</P>
<P>
Both the front two raised their arms aloft in the belief they
had won but a photo-finish gave the Frenchman the verdict for his
first stage win in a major event.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Wins WTA Lipton Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Swiss prodigy Martina Hingis
defeated Monica Seles 6-2, 6-1 to win the WTA Lipton Tennis
Championships in Key Biscayne, Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hingis needed only 44 minutes to defeat the American former
number one and register her 29th consecutive win this year,
collecting 215,000 U.S. dollars in prize money.
</P>
<P>
Hingis beat Seles 6-2, 6-0, last November in the final at
Oakland in their only prior meeting. But Seles was suffering with
a sore shoulder that forced her out of the WTA Championships two
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
Hingis will become the youngest world number one in tennis
history Monday when she replaces injured Steffi Graf atop the WTA
rankings.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss prodigy will be 16 years, six months and one day --
nine months and 18 days younger than the mark set by Seles in
1991. Hingis was ranked 399th three years ago when she joined the
tour.

<HEADLINE> Jansher Beats Martin in Squash Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- World champion Jansher Khan
regained the Super Series title when he beat Australian Brett
Martin in straight games at Hatfield's Galleria Shopping Center on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It refilled the only important gap in Jansher's trophy cabinet
after his shock defeat to England's Del Harris last year and
should have further boosted the great Pakistani's confidence
before next week's British Open.
</P>
<P>
He will be trying to win the famous tournament for a sixth
successive time, and the manner of Saturday's victory by 9-7, 9-5,
9-2 over the gifted Martin suggested Jansher is a stronger
favourite than he was a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
The crucial moment of the match came at 8-7 in the first game
when Jansher played a clinging little forehand volley drop that
lured Martin into a forehand drive which passed too close to
himself and gave the Pakistani a penalty point.
</P>
<P>
In the second game Jansher was more on top, with Martin
increasing his complaints about the refereeing, and in the third
game it was one way traffic as Jansher took the first eight points
without reply.
</P>
<P>
In the match for the third place, Simon Parke of England beat
Ahmed Barada of Egypt 9-7, 9-2, 5-9, 5-9 and 9-2.

BRASILIA, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Jacques Villeneuve took
pole position for Sunday's Brazilian Grand Prix after winning the
qualifying in Sao Paulo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Williams driver went fastest on his opening run

</P>
<P>
It was Villeneuve's second pole this season and the fifth of
his career.

His fastest lap of one minute 16.004 seconds left him half a
second clear of his nearest rival, double world champion Michael
Schumacher of Germany in a Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
Austrian Gerhard Berger in a Benetton was third-quickest ahead
of Finland's Mika Hakkinen in a McLaren. Frenchman Olivier Panis,
in a Prost, was fifth and Jean Alesi, also of France, sixth in the

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Demonstrate Against National Front in French City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- At least 50,000 people staged in
Strasbourg today a gigantic demonstration with what was described
by reports as "unprecedented mobilization" to protest against the
extreme-right National Front (FN) party of Jean-Marie Le Pen.
</P>
<P>
All the French leftwing parties, trade unions, and cultural
organizations joined in the demonstration, which took place also
today when 2,200 FN delegates began a three-day national congress
in the eastern French city.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators included people from all parts of France as
well as their supporters from Germany, Switzerland and Britain.
Some demonstrators wore the grey and white strip garments of Nazi
death camps to show their indignation at the fascist ideas of Le
Pen, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of the French Socialist Party Lionel Jospin,
National Secretary of the French Communist Party Robert Hue, and
Socialist Mayor of Strasbourg Catherine Trautmann took part in the
demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Also among the demonstrators were citizens of the four southern
French cities which are under the administrative control of the FN
-- Toulon, Orange, Marignane and Vitrolles.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FN President Le Pen defied the protest and claimed
that the FN would win 40 percent of the votes in the elections in
future.
</P>
<P>
The FN is trying to take advantage of the social problems of
the country, such as its high unemployment rate, to win supporters
for their extreme-right political ideas and seek to enter the
French parliament in the 1998 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
During the congress, the FN is expected to re-elect Le Pen as
its president and to recommend a "constitutional reform" to stress
"national preference" of France by putting "the supremacy of the
national laws and constitution above international and European
laws."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Racial Harmony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
in his weekly radio address today, called racism "America's
constant curse" in the pursuit of its ideals.
</P>
<P>
Clinton cited the most recent example in Chicago to show that
there is more work to be done to eliminate racism. In Chicago only
days ago, a 13-year-old African-American teen was severely beaten
by three white youths.
</P>
<P>
Lenard Clark suffered severe head injuries but doctors say he
is slowly coming out of a coma at Children's Memorial Hospital in
Chicago, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "This kind of savage, senseless assault, driven
by nothing but hate, strikes at the very heart of America's ideals
and threatens the promise of our future."
</P>
<P>
"We must stand together as a nation against all crimes of hate
and say they are wrong," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We must condemn hate crimes whenever they happen. We must
commit ourselves to prevent them from happening again. And we must
sow the seeds of harmony and respect among our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the three suspects in the attack, aged
respectively 19, 18 and 17, are charged with attempted murder and
committing a hate crime and are free on bond.
</P>
<P>
Clark and two friends were bicycling home from playing
basketball Friday when they were attacked near Armor Square Park
on the edge of the predominately white ethnic neighborhood of
Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
Clark lives in the all-black Stateway Gardens public housing
development a few blocks away.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Official Slams Serb-Yugoslav Customs Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, March 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Bosnian Muslim official
warned today that a customs agreement between Serbs and Yugoslavia
would block the progress of the central government work in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the Serb republic, one of
the two entities of Bosnia, reached an agreement Friday with
Yugoslavia on unitary customs and tariffs which would go into
effect on June 10.
</P>
<P>
Responding to the news on BiH TV, Bosnian Foreign Trade
Minister Hasan Muratovic, a Muslim, said, "If this is true, it
will completely block the process of passing laws of the quick
start package."
</P>
<P>
The referred package consists of bills which should be passed
before the start of an international conference on assistance to
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The conference has already been postponed several times because
Bosnian Serbs and Muslims cannot settle their differences on such
economic issues as unitary currency, customs and budget.
</P>
<P>
Muratovic accused Serbs of delaying the adoption of customs
laws in the joint body of Council of Ministers, while unilaterally
reaching such agreement with Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Discuss Zairean Refugees Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania will now have
direct contacts with the rebels of the Democratic Alliance for
the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (AFDL) aimed at discussing the
plight of Zairean refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Jakaya Kikwete, Tanzanian minister for foreign affairs and
international cooperation, told a press conference here today
that the decision was reached at the just-ended Lome meeting, in
Togo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Central Organ of the Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution also mandated the OAU Secretary General to have direct
contacts with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
"The idea here is to facilitate a quicker and mutual solution
between the Zairean government and the rebels led by Laurent
Desire Kabila," explained Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister further said that the decision to allow
direct contacts with the rebels fighting against President Mobutu
Sese Seko in Eastern Zaire was also applicable to all African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is not to imply that Tanzania and other African
countries are supporting the rebels against the Zairean
government but it's just a strategy to hasten peace and stability
in the country," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Kikwete told the reporters that Tanzania will capitalize on
the chance to discuss with the rebels on the fate of Zairean
refugees in the country who include Zairean troops in Kigoma
region, Western Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to Kikwete, the OAU central organ, which was
preceded by a summit of heads of state for the Great Lakes region
chaired by Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, was satisfied with
mediation effort by Moi on Zairean crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Central organ, under the chairmanship of president Paul
Biya of Cameroon, condemned all types of foreign military
intervention and the use of mercenaries. But no specific
countries were cited.
</P>
<P>
It also called on all the conflicting parties to create safe
and secure conditions to facilitate the channeling of adequate
and timely humanitarian and relief assistance to refugees and
internally displaced persons.
</P>
<P>
The central organ, also in their resolutions, appealed to all
conflicting sides to cooperate with the appropriate international
agencies to encourage and accelerate the voluntary repatriation
of refugees in eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
It further recommended to the United Nations Security Council
the establishment, in cooperation with OAU, of a mechanism for
monitoring the implementation of the U.N. and OAU peace plan on
Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The central organ called for immediate negotiations between
the Zairean government and AFDL, leading to a ceasefire and
complete end of hostilities to pave way for the said plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, March 29 (Xinhua) -- Albanian Prime Minister Bashkim
Fino will pay an official visit to Greece Wednesday, a dispatch
by the semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) from Tirana said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with ANA, Fino said he would hold talks with
the Greek government on the latest developments in Albania during
his visit to Athens and his government was ready to cooperate
openly with Greece.
</P>
<P>
He also reportedly said the Albanian people were grateful for
the help offered by Greece and Italy at this difficult time of
their country.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been in the grip of unrest since January after the
collapse of pyramid investment schemes in which thousands of
Albanians lost their life savings.
</P>
<P>
Greece is very much concerned about the safety of lives and
property of the ethnic Greek minority living in Albania, estimated
by the Greek side at some 300,000, and fears tens of thousands of
Albanians might try to flee over the border.
</P>
<P>
Greece has tried to push for a peaceful settlement to the
crisis and the Albanian prime minister is expected to discuss what
kind of help the Greek side can offer to defuse the crisis in the
country.
