<HEADLINE> Iranian Diplomats Recalled From Pakistan for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi said here Saturday that the number of Iranian diplomats
in Pakistan was reduced due to the insecure state in that country.
</P>
<P>
According to the evening daily Kayhan, Kharrazi termed the
recall of a group of Iranian diplomats as "a security issue."
</P>
<P>
"There have been many terrorist acts in Pakistan during recent
months and a number of Iranians serving in Pakistan were
martyred," he said after returning from a session of the United
Nations General Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that it is normal for a country to recall its
diplomats who were not in safe, but under danger.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian diplomats will return to Pakistan after the
improvement of security in that country, Kharrazi added.
</P>
<P>
Iran recalled some 60 diplomats and their families from
Islamabad following a series of terrorist assassination in
Pakistan and the killing of nine Iranian diplomats and reporter
in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Tehran-Islamabad ties were challenged by
the killing of Iranian diplomats by the Pakistan-supported Afghan
Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi said on Thursday that the return of Iranian diplomats
from Pakistan does not mean any change in the level of diplomatic
relations between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> NBA's latest Proposal Has Several Significant Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The NBA's latest proposal to
its lockedout players would put greater restrictions on free
agency, impose an inflexible ceiling on team salaries and require
each player to undergo two random drug tests per year.
</P>
<P>
The 17-page document, dated September 24, was mailed to all
players and agents early this week. It contained no change in the
league's position on the core issue of the labor stalemate: the
league's insistence on imposing an inflexible ceiling on team
payrolls, or a hard salary cap.
</P>
<P>
The offer also, for the first time, gave details of the
financial terms for other parts of a new collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
In this offer, the NBA proposed increasing minimum salaries
and guaranteeing the players' share will increase 50 million
dollars annually in the first four years of the agreement from
the one billion dollars they received in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
But the NBA wants to reduce the portion of television revenue
that goes to players, eliminate the 25 million guaranteed
licensing payment to the union, limit performance bonuses to five
percent of salary and count all bonuses against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
The increases in the salary cap based on guaranteed television
rights' fees would exceed 50 million per year.
</P>
<P>
NBA spokesman Chris Brienza said the league will not comment
on collective bargaining proposals.
</P>
<P>
"On the core issue of the bargaining, the NBA has not moved
one bit" National Basketball Players Association chief Billy
Hunter said through a spokesman last night.
</P>
<P>
"The owners still insist on a hard cap. To make matters worse,
they now have raised for the first time dozens of new issues,
many of which are extremely sensitive, and they are asking the
players to make concessions on each one.
</P>
<P>
Everything the players have gained through decades of
bargaining and arbitration, the owners want back with interest.
Clearly, the owners are not interested in bringing this
bargaining to a swift and fair conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The sides will resume bargaining on Thursday in New York, only
the second formal session since the lockout began on July 1 and
virtually all basketball-related activities ceased.
</P>
<P>
Training camps were supposed to open Monday, but they have
been postponed indefinitely and the first 24 preseason games
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Under the NBA's proposal, players would have to be in the
league for six seasons before they could be unrestricted free
agents. The rookie wage scale would be extended to five seasons,
but only the first three seasons would be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The players' team would have the option to renew the contract
for the fourth and fifth season.
</P>
<P>
As for the salary cap, the prior agreement allowed teams to
re-sign their own players for any amount, even if it exceeded the
cap. That caused some owners to view it as a soft salary cap. The
NBA proposed two formats in its latest offer.
</P>
<P>
In one format, the hard salary cap eventually would eliminate
exceptions. The change would be phased in over four years, with
teams allowed to be 20 percent over the cap for the 1998-99
season, dropping to 10 percent, Five percent and zero.
</P>
<P>
That 20 percent cushion is expected to translate to six
million dollars, which teams could use to re-sign their players
who have at least three years' experience. However, a team loses
that cushion if it signs another team's free agent.
</P>
<P>
In the other salary cap proposal, nearly all of the exceptions
would remain in effect, but if a team exceeded the cap, players
on that team could be forced to give up a portion of their
salaries.
</P>
<P>
The NBA proposed that the union could determine the formula
for deciding which players had money deducted from their
paychecks.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Court Overturns Damages to Ticket Sellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A federal appeals court in
San Francisco overturned 5.2 million U.S. dollars in damages to
six former SuperSonics ticket sellers who said they were fired
for complaining about the illegal cutoff of overtime.
</P>
<P>
If upheld, the ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
would permanently bar most of the damages on the grounds' that
the employees complained only to their supervisors and never
filed a formal overtime complaint with the government.
</P>
<P>
The court also said damages of 75,000 dollars per employee for
emotional distress were excessive, and told a federal judge to
reconsider a request by the team's management company to dismiss
the entire suit.
</P>
<P>
Spencer Hall, lawyer for the employees, said he probably would
appeal to the Supreme Court. He noted that the ruling conflicted
with the view of most other appeals courts that employees who are
victims of retaliation after complaining to supervisors can sue
under federal labor law.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Declares Election Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard claimed Saturday night that his coalition would have a
working majority in the new parliament although the final result
in terms of seats has not been declared.
</P>
<P>
"Although the final result in terms of seats will not be
determined for some days yet, it is clear the coalition will have
a working majority in the new parliament," Howard told his
jubilant supporters in Sydney Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the coalition has won 71 seats, four short of the
minimum 75 majority to win the election while the opposition Labor
Party got 64 seats, with 12 undecided, the Australian Broadcasting
Corporation TV said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The counting of the votes by the Australian Electoral
Commission closed at 24:00 Saturday local time (14:00 GMT), but
analysts believe the coalition is certain to gain at least four
seats from the 12 undecided ones.
</P>
<P>
"I want, first and foremost, to thank the Australian people for
the returning of the government," Howard said in a televised
speech on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation program.
</P>
<P>
"I regard it as a privilege beyond belief to have been twice
elected as prime minister of Australia," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
About half an hour before Howard's speech, the opposition Labor
Party's leader, Kim Beazley, publicly admitted that it was
difficult for his party to win the election, but he refused to
formally concede defeat before the final result comes out.
</P>
<P>
It would normally take 13 days before the final result is
available as the Australian Electoral Commission is waiting for
the postal votes from remote areas and overseas.
</P>
<P>
"While I don't want to formally concede defeat tonight I do
have to tell you it would be difficult for us to reach a majority
position from that position (the number of seats the party has won
so far)," Beazley told his applauding supporters in western
Australia's port city of Perth.
</P>
<P>
Beazley has become the Labor Party's hero by winning back more
seats than expected and being close to ousting Howard's government
in this federal election.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest (number of) seats won by the first term
opposition party in this country ever. This is the biggest swing
to the first time opposition party since World War II," he added,
referring to the large number of seats the Labor Party won back.
</P>
<P>
History has been on the coalition's side since no government in
Australia was defeated in an election after only one term during
the past 68 years.
</P>
<P>
Before the election, few people expected the Labor Party to
win, simply because the party had to get an additional 27 lower
house seats to oust the government, a hurdle too high to overcome.
</P>
<P>
In a conciliatory gesture to the nation's 300,000 Aborigines,
Howard recommitted himself to reconciliation with Australia's
Aboriginal people by the centenary of federation, January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
"We may differ in debate about the best way of achieving
reconciliation but I think all Australians are united today in a
determination to achieve it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard has been criticized for his handling of issues
concerning the Aboriginal people before and during the election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Before Saturday's election, the coalition held 91 lower house
seats while the number of low house seats held by the Opposition
Labor Party was 49.
</P>
<P>
With a reduced majority in the House of Representatives, the
prime minister will face a tough three-year second term under
pressure from not only the stronger Labor Party in the lower house
but also from within his own party.
</P>
<P>
About 12 million Australian voters, who are 18 years old or
older, voted Saturday.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian national team has been
offered a bonus of 5,000 U.S. dollars per man if they beat World
Cup holders France in a qualifier for the 2000 European
Championships here later this month.
</P>
<P>
The bonus match has been scheduled next Saturday and a
similar bonus was set if they beat Ukraine and Iceland, said
Alexander Tukmanov, the deputy president of the Russian Football
Union (RFU).
</P>
<P>
The victory over Armenia will be worth 3,000 U.S.dollars and a
win over Andorra 2,000 U.S. dollars, added Tukmanov.
</P>
<P>
Tukmanov said the bonus payments were being offered despite
the RFU experiencing a cash shortage because of the Russian
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the government provided the sport with no support but
that the Federation had signed sponsorship deals with companies
including Coca-Cola, Volkswagen and Nike from next year that
should bring in 1.8 million dollars in income.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iranian-Afghan Tension Mounts Amid U.N. Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- As U.N. special envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi resumed peace efforts in the region,
tension heightened between Iran and Afghanistan following the
alleged violation of Afghan airspace by Iranian jet fighters
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban have accused Iran of violating Afghan
airspace and gave Iran a strong-worded warning not to repeat such
act.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban also appealed to the international community to
force Iran to refrain from provoking the Afghan nation.
</P>
<P>
Chief Taliban representative in Islamabad Saeed Ul Rehman
Haqqani said, "Iranian military aircraft and helicopters violated
Afghan territory when they flew over Herat, Farah and Nimruz
provinces bordering Iran."
</P>
<P>
However, a statement issued Saturday by the Iranian Embassy in
Islamabad categorically denied the report regarding the violation
of Afghan airspace. The embassy termed it as "the baseless claim."
</P>
<P>
There are also reports that the Iranian military aircraft which
flew over Afghan territory were on a reconnaissance mission aimed
at checking the position of Taliban chief commander Mullah Umar in
Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
Tension mounted between Iran and Afghanistan when Iran charged
the Taliban with having killed its nine diplomats based in the
northern Afghan town of Mazar-i-Sharif when the Taliban captured
the town on August 8.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian authorities also announced that they would avenge
the assassination of its diplomats in Mazar-i-Sharif, the
stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance led by deposed
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran amassed its troops last month along the Afghan borders
apparently for undertaking military exercises. The move offended
the Taliban who carried out an offensive against the central
Afghan province of Bamyan and captured it from the Shiite
Hezb-e-Wahdat forces allegedly supported by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Serious allegations were traded between the two countries and
Iran even accused Pakistan of supporting and equipping the
Taliban, a charge which has been repeatedly denied by Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
While the Taliban alleged that Iran, Russia and Tajikistan are
supporting and providing military assistance to their rivals,
leaders of the Northern Alliance, these countries have denied the
charge as well.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi has been given the task by U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan of helping ease the tension between the two Muslim countries
and prevail upon the warring Afghan factions to resume talks for
the establishment of a broad-based multi-ethnic government in the
war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there are reports that chief anti-Taliban commander
Ahmed Shah Masood is prepared to launch a large-scale offensive
against the capital of Kabul before the winter sets in and snow
falls.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that there is little chance that the
peace initiative by Brahimi will bear any fruit in view of the
tense situation between Iran and Afghanistan and among the warring
Afghan factions.

<HEADLINE> Last Group of U.S. Embassy Staffers Leave Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The last group of U.S. diplomats
led by Charge d'Affaires Patricia Francis Calppeper left Dushanbe,
the Tajik capital, Saturday, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomats headed to an unspecified neighboring country
in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
</P>
<P>
On September 25, the U.S. State Department ordered the
suspension of U.S. embassy operations in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman James Rubin cited the local political turmoil in
Tajikistan, the limited ability to ensure the safety of its
personnel and the general concern about threats to U.S. facilities
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Tajikistan is adjacent to Afghanistan, which Washington has
accused of harboring Osama bin Ladin, the suspected mastermind in
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania August 7, in
which 259 people, including 12 Americans, died.
</P>
<P>
Washington told the Tajiks that the withdrawal of diplomats was
only a temporary measure, and it would not affect bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Dushanbe, however, expressed "deep regret" at the U.S.
decision, saying that "the government of the country has taken all
measures to ensure proper security of the embassy staff," Tass
reported.

<HEADLINE> 2 Palestinians Injured in Clashes in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinians were injured
in clashes with Israeli soldiers Saturday in the West Bank town
of Hebron as Israel briefly lifted a curfew imposed in the
Israel-controlled part of the town, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In the clashes, Palestinians threw stones at the soldiers, who
fired rubber-coated bullets and tear gas in return, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The curfew, imposed Wednesday after more than a dozen of
Israeli soldiers patrolling outside the Jewish settlement in the
city were injured by a grenade attack, was lifted for three hours
to allow Palestinian residents to buy food.
</P>
<P>
Hebron, home to about 450 Jewish settlers surrounded by more
than 130,000 Palestinian residents, has been one of the flash
points of conflicts after being divided into two parts
respectively controlled by the Palestinians and Israel under an
agreement signed early last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, other areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip are
still under full closure Saturday. The Israeli army sealed off the
areas Friday following security information that Hamas, the
Islamic Resistance Movement, was planning to carry out suicide
attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has repeated the pledge to avenge the killing of two of
its military leaders since they were shot dead by Israeli soldiers
last month.
</P>
<P>
Also Saturday, Israel Radio quoted Palestinian police as
saying that they have foiled an attempt by Hamas last week to
commit suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Two Palestinians with about 60 kilograms of explosive were
arrested while trying to cross the border to the Israeli side from
Gaza, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian security has discovered a bomb factory with
hundreds of kilograms of explosive in Hebron earlier this
week. And Hamas said the cooperation between Palestinian and
Israeli security forces has made it more difficult for the
military organization to attack Israel.

<HEADLINE> Cow Sparks Row Between India, Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A controversy has broken out
between India and Britain over the patent of a nearly extinct
Indian cattle breed called "Vechur cow," an Indian daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India said the Roslin Institute of Scotland, which
produced the world's first cloned sheep "Dolly," has applied for
the patent right to the genetic material of this rare cow, which
India said draws its name from Vechur, a village in India's
southwestern state of Kerala.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalist Vandana Shiva said that of the 14 applications
filed by Roslin Institute and its associate, PPL Therapeutics
Ltd., in the European patent office, one is for the Vechur cow.
</P>
<P>
However, in a letter to the Kerala Agricultural University
where research on the Vechur cow has been conducted, the Roslin
Institute denied that they applied for patent rights to the Indian
cattle breed which the Times of India said is associated with
Hindu mythology since time immemorial.
</P>
<P>
Kerala Agricultural University authorities reportedly said the
Roslin director wrote to the university saying the institute does
not possess any genetic material of the Indian cattle breed.
</P>
<P>
But Shiva said investigation carried out by her institute,
Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology, had found
Roslin's application for the patent right to the Indian cattle
breed (Bos indicus).
</P>
<P>
"All Indian breeds, in spite of their diversity, are called Bos
indicus," she said, adding that this confirmed that an Indian
breed was named in the patent claim.
</P>
<P>
They are mainly interested in the Vechur breed because it eats
less fodder and gives more milk and it can bring more profits, she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Indian environmentalist, the basic research
which was done on the Vechur cow in India might have been smuggled
out of the country.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Vechur cow is the smallest variety of cattle in
the world, with its average height of 87 centimeters and length of
124 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The cattle is said to give more milk in relation to the meager
amount of fodder it eats and its milk has a high fat content of
between 6.02 and 7.86 percent while Europe's high-yielding
varieties have 3.5 to 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Kerala Agricultural University has a research center for
the Vechur. Local people say the milk from the cattle has
medicinal value.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: General Debate Mirrors Picture of Current World  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The two-week general
debate of the 53rd General Assembly session, which concluded on
Friday, mirrored a general picture of the current world -- how 179
U.N. members and one observer interpret the opportunities and
challenges in the final years of the century from their own
perspectives.
</P>
<P>
At the general debate, which kicked off on September 21, 26
heads of state, 15 prime ministers and 105 foreign ministers,
together with other speakers, took the floor to air their views on
a wide range of matters of international concern.
</P>
<P>
Yasir Arafat, Palestinian leader, also delivered his speech at
the U.N. rostrum. It is the first time for a Palestinian
representative to address the general debate since the July
adoption of a Security Council resolution to upgrade the
Palestine's status at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The general debate was held this year after nearly all corners
of the world at large have been affected by the spreading Asian
financial crisis, so that's why almost all statements have
expressed, explicitly or implicitly, the governmental concerns
over the pros and cons of globalization process.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, speakers, those from the developing
world in particular, have voiced their concerns over the profound
economic inequalities between the vast sectors of humanity
floundering in poverty or an inefficiency of resources, and the
minority living in prosperity and abundance.
</P>
<P>
Many of the statements have devoted to the anxieties prompted
by the rapid and inexorable process of globalization which is
reaching into all aspects of international relations.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, there is mounting interest in securing a deeper
understanding of the nature of the process in order that the
international community may prepare itself to manage the effects.
Many developing countries, such as Brazil, Ghana and Sri Lanka,
revealed a striking fact that the economic globalization not only
simply benefits a few, but also harms the weakest and the most
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to arrest the tendency of marginalizing the poorer
countries, various countries have cried out calls for a balanced
development in the world, and a fair South-North ties.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the world also heard calls for a redefinition of
the rules to regulate current economic phenomena and to review or
readjust the existing multilateral financial structures, which,
dating back to the Bretton Woods agreements reached some five
decades ago, simply failed to meet the present needs.
</P>
<P>
It is the universal consensus, clearly and urgently reached
among U.N. member states, that since no country can stand alone
outside the whole world, "global problems calls for global
solution."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, speakers also touched upon the threats to the world
peace and security in such areas as Afghanistan, the Balkans and
the Great Lakes region. A number of statements constituted to a
feeling of frustration at the constraint which the 185-member
world body's lack of resources in taking necessary preventive
actions when the world is facing unfortunate deaths and
destruction.
</P>
<P>
What was most impressive was that most of the speakers have not
lost their confidence in the United Nations, calling upon the
organization to make headway in its reform drive and play a
central role in ending conflicts and creating opportunities for
development.
</P>
<P>
More effective efforts have been urged to better
conflict-preventive mechanism, which many developing members
believe will allow the United Nations to play its preventive role
more efficiently through its cooperation with regional groups,
such as the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
However, what was also impressive was that President Bill
Clinton of the United States, the leading economic power which can
not remain immune to the global financial crisis, devoted almost
his all statement to an anti-terrorism war, rather than discussing
how to solve the pressing financial problem in the world.
</P>
<P>
Of course, the problem of terrorism, seen as a global menace,
was one of the topics singled out with greatest frequency by the
speakers. But observers here said that terrorism is not the only
major challenge facing the world after the August 7 twin bombings
of U.S. embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
On disarmament, numerous references were made to the May
nuclear tests conducted by India, which was followed by
neighboring Pakistan. New Delhi's outrageous move, which has led
to arms race in South Asia, prompted a large number of
representatives to be more peremptory in calling on countries
which have not yet done so to join non-proliferation regimes and
the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. reform, including streamlining institutions, improving
efficiency and expanding the 15-member Security Council, has also
been a constant and recurring theme discussed throughout the
general debate. It is clearly and widely agreed that the United
Nations, considered the most appropriate but not the only tool for
grappling with all sorts of problems and challenges, must be
adapted to new times.
</P>
<P>
They all recognize that reform will be the outcome of a
undertaking that requires deep thought, careful analysis, a spirit
of cooperation and time.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the general debate have borne in mind that
this year marks the 50th anniversary of the adoption of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights. South African President
Nelson Mandela said that the eradication of poverty and a balanced
development remain a top priority in safeguarding human rights.
Such a statement was echoed by representatives of the most
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Didier Opertti, the newly-elected president of the 53rd General
Assembly session, delivered a speech at the closing meeting of the
general debate.
</P>
<P>
He said that "this debate has provided us with a unique and
invaluable opportunity to see how the Governments of Member States
view the world in these final years of the century, what problems
-- in the view of their leaders -- have an impact on the peace,
security and prosperity of nations and what direction the
international community should take in order to resolve these."

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Six Asian countries on
Saturday agreed with Japan to take measures to stimulate their
economies, and welcomed Tokyo's offer of 30 billion U.S. dollars
aid to these countries to rebuild their economies.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministers and central bank governors from Indonesia,
South Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand met
with Japanese officials in Washington before Group of Seven most
industrialized nations meeting later the same day to discuss ways
to overcome the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"To overcome the current difficulties, while avoiding the risk
of falling into a deflationary spiral, they agreed that it is
imperative for the Asian countries to take stimulative measures to
put their economy on the path of recovery and sustainable growth,"
the six countries and Japan said in a joint statement.
</P>
<P>
"The countries concerned intend to immediately engage in
bilateral discussions on how to implement the initiative," the

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Officials Hike Salaries Amid Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe and top government officials have raised their salaries by
up to 20 percent despite a budget crisis afflicting the country,
a report reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's state-owned newspaper The Herald Saturday quoted a
government gazette as saying that Mugabe's salary, last raised in
1996, would go up by 20 percent to 307,200 Zimbabwean Dollars
(about 9525.6 U.S. Dollars). Therefore, his total annual pay
and benefit package would climb to 507,000 Zim Dollars from
456,000 Zim Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa said
that the government might miss its budget target to the end of
this year due to unexpected three billion Zim Dollars in
expenditures, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The expenditures included Zimbabwe's military intervention in
the on-going conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and
civil service salary hikes, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
In June, Mugabe, rocked by a series of protests over wages and
prices, awarded civil servants pay rises by up to 21 percent
although public service unions had demanded 30 percent wage
increment.
</P>
<P>
Over 18 years in power, Mugabe has repeated calls from local
industry and international donors to cut back his government,
which has 55 ministers, deputy ministers and provincial
governors.
</P>
<P>
Critics say that some ministries duplicate their functions and
could be merged to save costs.
</P>
<P>
Local economists in Zimbabwe also want Mugabe to trim by up to
15 percent the country's bloated civil service, currently
numbering over 180,000 and causing government overspending which
are largely responsible for high inflation rate now at 29.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Dollar has depreciated by more than 40 percent
under import and speculative pressure since last January.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan VIPs Raise Women's Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- About 100 members of the
Ugandan paliament and other officials Saturday raised some 20
million Uganda Shillings (16,000 U.S. Dollars) for women in the
district of Masindi, 250 kms northwest of Kampala.
</P>
<P>
At the function organized by the Association of Women
Empowerment Through Community Action (AWETCA), James Wapakhabulo,
the national political commissar of the ruling National
Resistance Movement, praised the move and donated to AWETCA
first.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Internal Affairs, Tom Butime, and State Minister
of Defense, Steven Kivuma, are also among the VIPs who donated to
the program.
</P>
<P>
Chris Bakesiima, who used to work as a police commander in the
district and is now the police commander of the central region,
donated 150,000 shillings (120 Dollars). He expressed the hope
that the money raised can be used to empower women in the
district both economically and socially.
</P>
<P>
Many things are auctioned at the function which lasted more
than four hours. They include a bull, some goats, cocks and some
fruits.
</P>
<P>
The AWETCA was founded in 1996 by mainly women of Masindi
District. It is now a registed non-governmental, non-profit
making organization based in the district.
</P>
<P>
The bottle-necks to be tackled by AWETCA include low
productivity, rampant poverty, ill-health, illiteracy and lack of
modern production skills and knowledge among others.
</P>
<P>
Its key aims are to strengthen interaction and unity among
members for development, to provide opportunities for capacity
building and vocational training, and to improve the
socio-economic and political status of women.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over 1,400 Tonnes of Drugs in 19 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Interior Minister
Gholamhussein Bolandian stated here on Saturday that Iran seized
over 1,400 tonnes of various narcotics during the past 19 years.
</P>
<P>
Bolandian made the statement at a joint press conference with
head of the delegation of the U.N. Drug Control Program (UNDCP)
which arrived here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that some 2,600 international drug trafficking bands
have been smashed by Iranian armed forces since the Islamic
Revolution in 1979 and during the past one year some 200 tonnes of
drugs were confiscated in Iran.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that the seized drugs by Iran were only 10
percent of the amount produced in the region, mainly in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Bolandian said that Iran has strengthened its military buildup
along the eastern border with Afghanistan following the political
development in that country, particularly the control on the
country by the Islamic fundamentalist group Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Head of the UNDCP delegation and Vice Speaker of the European
Parliament Renzo Imbeni expressed satisfaction with Iran's
efforts to fight against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
So far the international community has little knowledge about
Iran's campaign against drugs and the member states of the UNDCP
should have more knowledge about what Iran has done in this
connection, he said.
</P>
<P>
Imbeni voiced UNDCP's readiness to cooperate with Iran, saying
that the UNDCP will open its office in Tehran in the near future
to speed up its coordination with Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
He said that UNDCP will co-sponsor an international conference
on "Narcotics and Civilization" slated to be held in Tehran in
April, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Imbeni said that he held separate talks with Iranian
officials, including Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari, and
inspected Iran's eastern border.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Initiative for Reviving Global Economy Endorsed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The initiative that the
United States put up on Friday to head off global recession got
endorsement from other major industrialized nations Saturday.
</P>
<P>
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown and Canadian
Finance Minister Paul Martin said they would use the Group of
Seven (G-7) meeting on Saturday to push various reform ideas.
</P>
<P>
Both Martin and Brown gave preliminary endorsements to the U.S.
idea to allow the International Monetary Fund to provide emergency
loans more quickly for countries embattled with financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"As we meet here in Washington, we are conscious that more than
a quarter of the world is in recession, that the second largest
economy in the world, Japan, is in recession and that the social
casualties of the Asian crisis are rising in numbers," Brown told
reporters before the start of the Group of Seven meetings.
</P>
<P>
"There is a growing consensus on what needs to be done," Martin
said, calling the idea a "crisis prevention fund."
</P>
<P>
He said it had merit as did ideas being put forth by his
country, Britain and other nations to reform IMF operating
procedures and strengthen regulatory supervision.
</P>
<P>
The meeting by finance ministers from the United States, Japan,
Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Italy were setting the stage
for wider discussions at the annual meetings of the 182-nation IMF
and World Bank which get under way Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In advance of the G-7 discussions, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin met separately with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa. Rubin told reporters on Friday that the United States
still believed that aggressive actions on the part of Japanese
authorities to deal with weak banks and jump-start its economy
were key to resolving the crisis that began in Thailand 15 months
ago.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, U.S. President Bill Clinton suggested that the IMF
provide emergency loans more quickly to countries threatened by
the economic meltdowns that sent investors fleeing from three
Asian nations last year and from Russia this summer.
</P>
<P>
"This country has got to lead," Clinton said. "We've got to be
aggressive. We've got to stay on the balls of our feet."
</P>
<P>
Rubin told reporters that the United States would be pushing a
number of proposals to the finance ministers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hails Fishing Cooperation With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry said
Saturday that it hopes that the successful start of fishing
cooperation with Japan in the South Kuril area will help the two
countries find new forms of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The history of Russian-Japanese ties indicates that relations
in the field of fishing have traditionally served as an indicator
of trust between the two countries," the ministry said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is the result of new favorable tendencies aimed
at strengthening good neighborliness and partnership between
Russia and Japan," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The accord was signed in Moscow on February 21, 1998, after
three years of hard negotiations, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It entered into force May 21, 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in the 50-year history of territorial
disputes between Russia and Japan, the agreement has determined
the rules of fishing for Japan in the South Kuril area and the
procedure for exercising control by Russia, Tass said.
</P>
<P>
After the end of the Second World War, both the Soviet Union
and subsequently Russia had banned Japanese boats from fishing in
waters off the disputed Kuril islands.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Japanese fishers can catch up to 1,600
tons of catfish and 130 tons of squid this year.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, as far as the Russian side knows, the immediate
participants in the implementation of the agreement on both sides
are satisfied with the organization and the results of fishing,"
the Foreign Ministry statement said.

<HEADLINE> Better Fertilizers Supply Urged in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Action should be taken to
ensure timely and adequate supply of fertilizers to Ethiopian
farmers at affordable prices, the Ethiopian Vice-Minister of
Agriculture has said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Agriculture Getachew Teklemedhin made the
call here Friday when he was closing the three-day third Annual
National Fertilizer meeting, reported the Ethiopian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Getachew said that the importers should play important roles
in widening the fertilizers distribution network.
</P>
<P>
Offering credit to farmers for the purchase of fertilizers is
one of the most effective ways of increasing their use, he added.
</P>
<P>
The third Annual National Fertilizer Meeting forecast that
419,000 tons of fertilizers are needed for the coming 1999 farm
season.
</P>
<P>
According to the participants of the meeting, Afar,
Benshangul, Gambella, Somali, Harari and Dire dawa are the six
low fertilizer consuming regions in the country.
</P>
<P>
The average fertilizer consumption is only six kilograms per
hectare in these regions, they said.
</P>
<P>
Inadequate extension services, poor infrastructure and farming
systems, credit problems, lack of distribution network and weak
farmer organization are the main reasons for low fertilizer
consumption, they added.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia imported 470,000 tons of fertilizers in 1998 and
about 300,000 tons were used during the year, according to the
Ethiopian National Fertilizer Industry Agency.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has said it accepts any
decision by Jordan to handle the Egyptians working in the kingdom
in its drive to curb employment of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is also convicted that any measure by the Jordanian
government on foreign workers will be aimed at protecting them and
maintaining their rights, Egyptian Ambassador to Amman Jamo Riyad
said Saturday after a meeting with Jordanian Minister of Labor
Mohammad Mehdi Farhan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Farhan discussed with Riyad various issues
related to the ongoing campaign to strictly regulate the foreign
labor market and create jobs for locals.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Asian workers have been detained during the
campaign since Wednesday. Those without work permits will be
prosecuted or expelled. The government has begun preparations to
deal with the Arab workers in the same way.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300,000 to 500,000 guest workers now live in
Jordan, of whom only 40 percent hold valid work permits, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 percent out of the total guest workers in Jordan are
Egyptians. Last year, the government ordered the illegal Egyptian
workers either to leave the kingdom or to apply for work
permits. The deadline for such a decision was extended for three
times, but most of the Egyptians refused to cooperate and the
problem still remained unsolved.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Saturday called on the
Turkish government to exercise self-restraint in its war of words
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Any tension between the Islamic states will only serve to
strengthen the aggressive stand of the Zionist regime (Israel)
and will have negative impact on the security of the Middle East
and the Palestinian nation," Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud
Mohammadi Mohammadi said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Turkish and Syrian officials would
not hesitate to remove the ambiguity between the two states to
foster Islamic solidarity and good neighborly relations.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi made the remark after Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel warned on Thursday that Turkey reserves the right to
respond against Syria.
</P>
<P>
Some top Turkish military officials stated that an "undeclared
state of war" existed between Ankara and Damascus as Turkey blamed
Syria for helping outlawed Kurdish groups to fight against the
Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
Syria rejected Turkey's accusation, but criticized Ankara for
provoking problems with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria are required to settle their dispute
through peaceful negotiations, Mohammadi said, adding that Israel
has embarked on aggressive policies, attempting to create division
between the Muslim and Arab states.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Turkey to revise its close relations with Israel
in a bid to reinforce Islamic solidarity and cooperation between
the Islamic states.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army's New Chief of Staff Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The newly-appointed commander of
the Iranian army Major General Ali Shahbazi has appointed Mostafa
Torabipour to replace him as the army's chief of staff, the
evening daily Kayhan reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The appointment was announced at the ceremony to introduce
Shahbazi as the army's commander. Shahbazi was appointed on
Wednesday by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader and
command-in-chief of the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
During the ceremony, Major General Naser Arasteh was also
introduced as the first deputy commander of the army and Major
General Mehdi Montazeri as head of the army's information
protection body.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the Iranian army to have a commander
since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian army is a part of the armed forces, which also
include the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the
security forces (or armed police). Both the army and the IRGC
have their own naval, ground and air forces.
</P>
<P>
The IRGC has been commanded by its commander since its
establishment in 1979, but the army was headed only by the chief
of staff during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of Iranian Armed Forces Major General Hassan
Firuzabadi said at the ceremony that the forthcoming Zoulfaqar-2
maneuvers necessitated the formation of the new post of the army
commander.
</P>
<P>
He said that Shahbazi would be in charge of the operations of
the army's naval, ground and air forces.
</P>
<P>
Following the tension between Iran and the Afghan Taliban
forces, the Iranian army announced to launch its biggest maneuvers
along the eastern border with Afghanistan with the participation
of 200,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The army started the preliminary military exercises on
Wednesday, but the date for the main stage of the maneuver has not
been announced so far.

BEIRUT, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Singers from seven Arab
countries got together here Saturday night to sing a common song
urging Arab unity in the fight against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-three leading singers in these countries accompanied by
Lebanon's celebrities performed different verses of the song "The
Arab Dream" in the open-air show held at Martyrs' Square in
Beirut's central district.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 Lebanese, including the country's politicians,
writers, poets, composers and actors, attended the show entitled
"Voice of One million Arabs."
</P>
<P>
"Arab nations suffer from similar hardships to other countries
but Israel is one evil we don't share with the rest of the world,"
said the show's producer Ahmad Aryan.
</P>
<P>
"The song will bring 1 million Arabs together, whether they
attend the show or watch it on television," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
A video of the song, which depicts distressing scenes of death
and destruction caused by Israel's assaults on several Arab
countries, was also shown at the event which was sponsored by
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
"I want to show the world how Israel has been and still is a
major source of misery for Arabs by using motion pictures, a
language everyone understands," said Aryan, also the director and
mastermind behind the video version.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of August, the video has been broadcast
regularly on Arab satellite and local television stations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Head of State Seeks Support for Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Saturday met with former military leaders in
Abuja in a bid to secure their support for his ongoing transition
to civil rule program, a source in the capital said.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar's closed-door meeting with former leaders Yakubu
Gowon (ruling from 1966 to 1975) and Ibrahim Babangida (ruling
from 1985 to 1993) lasted about five hours, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after their meeting, Abubakar said that it was
convened to share ideas and views on the way forward, adding that
members of the armed forces and the police would be briefed of
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Former head of state Gowon said that the meeting was held in
an excellent atmosphere and views were shared between the former
leaders and Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
Gowon said the former leaders has assured Abubakar that the
military will support him to hand over power to a civilian regime
next year.
</P>
<P>
He said that Abubakar's recent visits to the United
Kingdom, the United States, France and South Africa have done a
lot to give Nigeria a better image.
</P>
<P>
Former service chiefs and inspector-generals of police were
also at the meeting, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Two other former military leaders, General Olusegun Obasanjo
(ruling 1976 to 1979) and Major-General Mohammadu Buhari (ruling
from 1983 to 1985), however, did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, the only military leader who kept his promise to
hand over to a civilian government by giving up power to elected
president Alhaji Sheshu Shagari in 1979, is now under pressure to
contest for presidency under the current democratization program.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar, Nigeria's eighth military leader who took office in
June this year after the sudden death of late military leader
Sani Abacha, has promised to hand over power to an elected
civilian government on May 29, 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Saturday called on
Turkey and Syria to conduct constructive dialog to contain the
crisis between them and settle their disputes.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful settlement is in the interests of the two countries
and will contribute to the stability and security of the Middle
East, Jordanian Minister of Information Nasir Judeh told reporters
after a regular cabinet session.
</P>
<P>
"The region's higher interests do not afford new escalation
(of tension) that leads to new crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will employ its relations with all the concerned parties
to mediate between Syria and Turkey, he added, noting Jordan
maintains good relations with both countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's top military officials have said their country is in a
state of undeclared war with Syria due to Damascus' alleged
support for Kurdish rebels against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting Turkey's accusation, Syria said a Turkish-Israeli
military alliance is behind the rise of tension between the two
neighboring countries.

</P>
<P>
He made the stance clear at a meeting here with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat's deputy Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu
Mazen.
</P>
<P>
Progress was reported for the recent Washington meeting between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Israel's
second redeployment in the West Bank. A breakthrough is hoped for
later this month.
</P>
<P>
Hassan reaffirmed the kingdom's consistent and firm stand to

state with its capital in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Abbas briefed the regent on the outcome of the Arafat-Netanyahu

It was conducted in the framework of the continuous
consultation and coordination between Jordan and the Palestinian

<HEADLINE> Egypt not to Accept Unbalanced Palestinian-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday reasserted his country's position on any deal
between the Palestinians and Israel, saying that "no deal would be
acceptable unless it is fair and balanced."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks during the Strategic Military Symposium
which is being held here to mark the 25th victory of the October
War in 1973 against Israel in the Sinai Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative could bring about a progress but there are
some disputable details, he said.
</P>
<P>
The progress lies in the possibility of a general acceptance of
the 13 percent withdrawal of the Israeli troops from the West
Bank, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"All what we hope and work for is a fair and balanced agreement
that ensures equal commitments on both sides without pressures on
one side," the Egyptian minister added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that dialog and talks are the best way of
dealing with problems between the Arabs and Israel under the
previous agreements and the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to visit
the region later this month for further consultations with the
Palestinian and Israeli leaders following the Washington summit
recently among U.S. President Bill Clinton, Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to see how far the coming accord will be viable,
objective and balanced," Moussa said. "The extent of the proposed
deal being balanced will determine the reaction of the regional
public opinion," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the Turkish-Syrian stand-off, Moussa said if the situation
develops, it will be very dangerous, noting that there is a real
problem between the two neighbors but its solution must be brought
about through diplomatic and political means.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accused Syria of supporting the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party which has been fighting for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian diplomacy will do its utmost to contain the
situation," he said. It is totally wrong to resort to force to
settle such disputes that could be solved, or at least pacified,
through other ways, he added.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Non-oil Exports Down by 17 percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's non-oil exports for the
first six months of the current Iranian year starting on March 21
fell by 17 percent from those of the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The figure stood at 1.27 billion U.S. dollars, Head of the
Iranian Customs Mehdi Karbasian told the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
But the exports were up 40 percent in terms of weight, he
said, attributing the decline of the value to the drop in the
price of petrochemical products in the international markets.
</P>
<P>
Iran, a country that heavily relies on its oil industry and
tries hard to vary its income sources, fetched some 3 billion
dollars from non-oil exports during the past Iranian year though
the government had hoped to earn 5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said the export of non-oil products was
experiencing an upward trend in last Iranian month (August
23-September 22).
</P>
<P>
During the month, the non-oil exports registered a growth of 9
percent in terms of value and 117 percent in terms of weight
compared to the figures for the same period last year, he said.

U.S. dollars), 44 million pounds (13 million dollars) less than
that of the same period last year.
</P>

According to Saturday's Al-Ahram, Gowaili attributed this to

ATHENS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Greece on Sunday urged leaders of

Kosovo to begin talks immediately.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the talks, as stated by Defense Minister Akis

avert a possible military intervention by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova should discuss expanding Kosovo's autonomy

<P>
The logic of dialogue between the two parties would prevail and
there would be a political solution, the Greek defense chief said.
</P>

The Greek government believes, he said, that there could be no
positive results with military intervention before all
possibilities for a political solution have been exhausted.

According to the official news agency Kuna, the statement

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Navy to Conduct Live Ammunition Drills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti navy will conduct
exercises with live ammunition near Jazirat Kubbar Island in the
Gulf on October 10-13, the Kuwaiti Army said in a statement Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency Kuna, the statement
warned against approaching the sea block, about 50 kilometers
southeast of the capital, between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. (0500-1200
GMT) during the days of maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
But Kuna failed to give any details as to the scale and purpose
of the drills. Kuwait used to hold joint military exercises over
the past years with the U.S., aiming at improving its soldiers'
combat skills and readiness.
</P>
<P>
The small Gulf country entered a defense cooperation agreement
with the U.S. in 1991 after invading Iraqi troops were driven out
of its territory by the U.S.-led allied forces in the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Since then, dozens of various joint military exercises have
been carried out by the two sides in the Kuwaiti territory as well
as in the Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Renewing Government Land Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Almost three-quarters of China's
nearly 900 million farmers have so far signed new contracts with
local governments to continue land use for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
China introduced a household contract responsibility system and
the land contract system in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with
most farmers signing 15-year contracts with local governments.
</P>
<P>
As these contracts began expiring, the central government
adopted a land contract policy to extend the contract for another
30 years and local governments have formed groups to help extend
the contracts and to help keep farmers happy, and more important,
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
One farmer in Henan Province, Chen Jinsheng, explains it
simply, "Land means life to farmers. I slept so well after signing
the new contract and I'll work harder on my land to get better
harvests."
</P>
<P>
In the city of Pingdingshan in Henan, where the extension of
land contracts is almost complete after two years' work,
agricultural output grew 17.3 percent in 1996, which is much
higher than the average annual growth of 5 percent before 1995.
</P>
<P>
In some economically well-developed areas, peasants are also
being encouraged to engage in large scale agricultural
production. So, as a certain number of peasants have moved to
industry and service trade in their localities, the land they used
to till need to be taken care of by other peasants on a voluntary
basis.

<P>
MOGADISHU, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Two more people died Sunday
in a hospital in Mogadishu after sustaining wounds when the heavy
duty truck they were in overturned near Warmahan Village, 60 km
south of the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses, four were dead on the spot, and 13
others were wounded Saturday night when the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the tragic accident is not known. However,
survivors of the accident told reporters that the truck was
traveling at a high speed on the dark road between Ballidogle
airport and Mogadishu when the front tires of the vehicle fell in
a small hole in the middle of the road.
</P>
<P>
One of the front tires subsequently exploded making the
vehicle loose control and direction before turning over.
</P>
<P>
The trouble did not end there as three battle wagons and more
than 35 armed militiamen escorting the overturned vehicle and
another truck transporting goods from Ballidogle to Mogadishu
engaged in a serious armed confrontation with militiamen manning
a roadblock at the former custodian police headquarters near K-7
strong point Sunday at about 14:00 hours local time.
</P>
<P>
Militiamen escorting the trucks blamed the militiamen of Osman
Ali Atto for starting the shooting in their attempt to obtain the
extortion money by force.
</P>
<P>
The ensued clashes have left at least three people dead and
more than five others wounded although the three battle wagons
have managed to go through the checkpoint forcefully.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70 illegal roadblocks are set up along the road between
Mogadishu and Ballidogle airport demanding the drivers to pay
extortion money.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Urges Syria, Turkey for Self-restraint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Sunday urged
Syria and Turkey to exercise self-restraint and hold
negotiations in order to end their disputes, the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Kuwait followed with grave concern the developments of the
recent escalation of tension between Syria and Turkey ... and
it urges both countries for self-restraint and seek to resolve
differences through dialogues," said a statement by the Kuwaiti
Cabinet issued after its weekly session.
</P>
<P>
Tension has drastically mounted between the two neighboring
countries after Ankara launched a rhetoric campaign against
Damascus recently and reportedly massed up troops along its
borders with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Turkey have been at loggerheads over issues of
separatist Kurds, water-sharing and the Turkish-Israeli
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing the Turkish Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy of the
Kurds in southeastern Turkey and often launched across-border
attacks from their bases in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
And Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliance with
Israel, saying that it threatens Arab security and undermines
Syria's bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait called on Damascus and Ankara "to respond to efforts
aimed at defusing and containing the dispute and spare the
peoples of both countries as well as peoples in the region
more agony and instability."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak flew in Syria earlier Sunday
for talks with his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad on Syria's
dispute with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who discussed Saturday the Turkish-Syrian tension with
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz during his surprise short visit to
Riyadh, will go to Ankara after his Syrian trip in a bit to ease
the tension.

DAMASCUS, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Egyptian President
Hossni Mubarak said Sunday that Egypt favors diplomatic efforts in
solving the Syrian-Turkish dispute.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak voiced the stand in talks with Syria President Hafez
Assad right after he arrived here in the morning on a one-day
visit, according to the Syrian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said the disputes between Syria and Turkey should be
solved through diplomatic methods instead of force.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak will also travel on to Turkey Monday to try to head off
the potential military confrontation between the two countries.

<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of backing the Turkish Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy of the

</P>
<P>
And Syria accused Turkey of forming military alliances with

Potential military confrontation loomed up after Turkey massed
troops along borders with Syria to conduct military exercises,
with an apparent aim to show strength.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the Arab world's largest country with 60 million people,
frequently tries to mediate Arab and Muslim disputes.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has close military relations with Israel while Syria is
one of the Arab countries that have territorial disputes with the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Many of the Arab countries favor to unite Turkey, a
predominantly Muslim state governed by secular laws, and not to
alienate it.

<HEADLINE> China Looking For More Donations for Flood Victims (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China is trying to raise more
donations for the victims of its worst flooding in decades this
summer by staging another benefit performance at Beijing's Great
Hall of the People this evening.
</P>
<P>
The program, "Love the motherland and help build new homes", is
being hosted by the China Charity Federation (CCF) and a number of
groups, with backing by the Civil Affairs Ministry, which is
responsible for the country's disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,200 singers and dancers from across the nation and a
dozen well-known pop singers and movie stars from Hong Kong and
Taiwan are taking part in the program.
</P>
<P>
The flooding in July and August on the Yangtze River and
Nenjiang and Songhua rivers in the Northeast killed 3,004 people,
affected more than 200 million people, and caused some 20.3
billion U.S. dollars worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
In late August, CCF, the Red Cross Society of China, and China
Central Television held a TV program that raised over 600 million
yuan (about 75 million U.S. dollars) in donations for flood
victims and another 2 billion yuan over the following weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng Lei, a CCF official, the funds raised in the
past two months have mainly been used for emergency assistance and
basic needs of flood victims.

<HEADLINE> Supplies of Consumer Market Up in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China's economic restructuring
has affected consumer goods supplies and sales, which amounted to
16.6 trillion yuan in the 1978-1997 period, or an average annual
growth of 9.6 percent when adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
Sales in rural areas came to 1 trillion yuan last year, 13
times the 1978 figure, and in urban districts, 1.6 trillion yuan,
or 22 times the 1978 figure.
</P>
<P>
A buyers' market has been taking shape, replacing the decades
of shortages of a number of products. One recent study showed that
supplies of almost all major commodities meet market demand and
that some even exceed demand. The retail price index in 1997 was
0.8 percent higher than that of the previous year, and showed
negative growth this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices of many goods are now regulated by the market, except
for the fewer than 5 percent of goods that are still under
government control.
</P>
<P>
More than 90,000 new markets have sprung up along with new
forms of marketing like warehouse selling and chain stores. Urban
and rural sales combined were 1.7 trillion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
A national survey showed an average annual disposable income of
5,160 yuan for each urban resident last year, 16 times the 1978
figure, while that of each rural resident was 2,090 yuan, or 15.6
times the 1978 figure.

products, and exercise or body-building facilities.

CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said Sunday that Egypt is helping Syria and Turkey overcome
their differences.
</P>
<P>
Moussa termed as temporary the Turkish-Syrian difference and
urged both countries to work on solving it, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Officials in both countries are keen on launching a dialog
between them," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak arrived in Syria Sunday and
will go on to visit Turkey Monday to try to head off potential
military confrontation between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of sheltering Turkish Kurdish
rebels, who have been fighting since 1984 for more autonomy for
the Kurds in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
And Syria has accused Turkey of forming military alliances with
Israel that threaten Arab security and undermine Syria's
bargaining position in peace talks with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Potential military confrontation loomed after Turkey massed
massive forces along the border with Syria to conduct military
exercises, with an apparent aim to show its force.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Turkey is a friendly country and the Arabs must
maintain this friendship, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt together with a number of other Arab countries are ready
to help settle Turkish-Syrian differences because we care about
the interests of Syria and Turkey," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Israeli reports on the existence of an
Israeli-Turkish alliance, Moussa said "Turkish officials have
belied the reports and said what was linking the two countries
were normal ties. If Israeli reports would turn to be true, we
will be having our misgivings regarding the Turkish tendency."
</P>
<P>
Turkey, a predominantly Mulism state governed by secular laws,
has close relations with Israel by carrying out a number of
agreements on military training and defense while Syria is one of
the Arab states that have territorial disputes with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Russia Blasts NATO Plan to Use Force Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Sunday expressed "deep
anxiety" over NATO's plans to strike targets in Yugoslavia over
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the government said the use of force without
United Nations authorization would be "a crude violation of the
U.N. Charter, undermining the entire system of present day
international relations."
</P>
<P>
In Belgrade, Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev met Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
to discuss the growing threat of NATO force.
</P>
<P>
The Western alliance is gearing up for action in the Serbian
province of Kosovo although it acknowledges that the Yugoslav side
has moved towards compliance with U.N. demands on ending the
conflicts in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that air
strikes against Yugoslavia could take place within two weeks if
Milosevic did not comply.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Russia called on the Belgrade government to
comply with the agreements to end the crisis, which were struck
between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Milosevic in June.
</P>
<P>
It said that both the Yugoslav government and the ethnic
Albanian separatists should comply with U.N. Security Council
Resolution 1199, passed on September 23, to stop hostile actions,
take urgent measures to prevent a humanitarian disaster and begin
talks on the political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Military interference in the internal Yugoslav conflict would
not only fail to solve its reasons but on the contrary would only
deepen the confrontation and scuttle diplomatic efforts of the
world community to establish a Serbian-Albanian dialogue," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, a traditional ally of Serbia, has repeatedly noted that
it sees no solution to the Kosovo conflict through the use of
force.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper Dnevni Telegraph quoted sources close to the
talks as saying the Belgrade government was ready to offer
unspecified concessions to ward off the NATO threat.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu 'Ready' to Pay Political Price for Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that there is a good chance for
reaching an agreement with the Palestinians and he is ready to
pay the necessary political price for it, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made the remarks after meeting with Hanan Porat,
head of the Knesset (Parliament) law committee, who briefed him
on the debate in the committee over a bill calling for
dissolution of the Knesset and early elections.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset has passed the bill in its preliminary reading
in late July, a day before the Knesset began its summer
recess. Three more readings are needed before the bill could
become law.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's remarks also came amid reports that Israel and
the Palestinians are expected to reach an agreement over the
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank during a four-day Middle
East summit in Washington in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
In talks held last week in the U.S., however, American
officials expressed their skepticism over Netanyahu's ability to
push through a decision on a pullback without putting his
coalition government at deep risk.
</P>
<P>
Some extremist right-wing parties in his coalition including
the National Religious Party have threatened to topple the
government if Netanyahu agrees to a 13.1 percent withdrawal from
the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli daily Haaretz reported Sunday that U.S. officials
have contacted with ranking members of the Labor Party, the
main Israeli opposition party, in the past few days to discuss
the possibility of forming a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators resumed
their open talks for the first time in more than one month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh met with senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat in Jerusalem while the joint
committee resumed the talks on interim issues such as the
Palestinian airport in Gaza and the safe passage between Gaza
and the West Bank, Israel Radio reported.

XICHANG, Oct. 4 (Xinhua) -- Duan Ruchang moved his restaurant
from the banks of Qionghai Lake to a spot 80 meters away to comply
with new regulations protecting the lake environment.
</P>
<P>
Because of comprehensive measures and support from people like
Duan, the once seriously polluted Qionghai Lake in Sichuan
Province, has become pure again.
</P>
<P>
"We live on the lake. Only when it has a good environment can
we have a booming business," said Duan, 53, whose restaurant stood
on the bank for seven years.
</P>
<P>
The second largest fresh water lake in Sichuan, Qionghai Lake
not only is a source of drinking water to two-thirds of the
population of Xichang where it is located, but also a major
tourist attraction in the province.
</P>
<P>
Fast development around the lake in recent years not only
brought unprecedented wealth to local residents but also gravely
polluted the lake environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the city government decided to carry out systematic
measures to improve this environment. In May of that year, 24
gas-fueled pleasure boats were banned, and the following May, 628
fish raising net-boxes were removed.
</P>
<P>
In early 1997, "Regulations Governing the Protection of
Qionghai Lake" were promulgated, strictly prohibiting the
discharge of untreated waste water into the lake. As a result,
eight waste water treatment facilities are now in operation.
</P>
<P>
The regulations also prohibit the construction of temporary or
permanent buildings within 80 meters of the lake banks. Two
resorts have been built to absorb businesses moved away from the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The measures have paid off, as a recent survey shows that the
lake water has reached the directly drinkable standards set by the
State.
</P>
<P>
At present, wooden and electricity-powered boats can be seen
shuttling on the lake, while restaurants do a booming business in
the new resorts not far from the lake.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Finance ministers of the world's largest industrial nations
said Saturday night that they would explore President Clinton's
proposal to alter the strategy of the International Monetary Fund,
so that it can intervene earlier in propping up economies at risk
of being swept into the global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
-- It is said that the United States had obtained new evidence
to link the owner of a Sudanese factory destroyed in an American
cruise missile strike last month to a terrorist group backed by
Osama bin Laden, the suspected mastermind of the bombings of two
United States embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- As Congress and the White House enter their final, critical
week of spending negotiations before Congress's scheduled
adjournment October 9, federal agencies are quietly dusting off
plans to deal with a potential government shutdown should talks
collapse.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton Saturday dismissed as inadequate a 4.2
billion U.S. dollar emergency farm aid package that congressional
Republicans pushed through the House on Friday and urged Congress
to stay in session until it adopts his plan for 7.5 billion
dollars of assistance.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times
</P>
<P>
-- The Chairman of the House Budget Committee says he has told
top Clinton administration officials he has "very deep
reservations" about any U.S.-led military intervention in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
-- Months of frustration boiled over last week as usually
pro-defense Republican lawmakers attacked the nation's top
military officers for belatedly conceding that the Pentagon's
projected budget falls far short of its needs over the next five
years.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China expects to reduce the
number of workers in its rolling stock plants by 50,000, or almost
a fifth of the workforce, over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Taiwen, general manger of the China Locomotive Rolling
Stock Corporation, says that the move is meant to make the
employment system more competitive by phasing out redundant
workers, increasing efficiency, and bringing the sector out of the
red.
</P>
<P>
China's locomotive industry has 34 rolling stock plants and
maintenance centers, with 230,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
To help laid-off workers find new jobs, the corporation plans
to set up re-employment centers, open training courses, and help
develop services and trades.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Lodge Protests Over Alleged Airspace Violation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Taliban said
Sunday that they had formally lodged a complaint with U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan alleging a violation of Afghan
airspace by Iranian jet fighters and helicopters.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia said in a statement that they had sent a
letter to the U.N. chief, saying Iranian planes violated
Afghanistan's airspace three times during 24 hours on October 2 in
the western provinces of Nimroz, Farah and Herat.
</P>
<P>
"If the Iranian armed forces continued such provocative
activities, the Afghan Islamic Emirate will not be responsible for
the dire consequences of its provocative acts," Abdul Jalil, a
senior Taliban official responsible for foreign affairs, said in
the letter.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban claimed that 15 Iranian planes and 15 helicopters
intruded Afghanistan's western provinces of Nimroz and Herat, next
to which the Iranian forces were carrying out unprecedented
military maneuvers involving more than 200,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian embassy in Islamabad, however, has rejected the
Taliban's allegations, saying it was an attempt to divert world
attention from "the student militia crimes" in the northern Afghan
town of Mazar-i-Sharif and the central province of Bamyan.
</P>
<P>
Jalil said the Taliban government is prepared to solve all
disputes with Iran through peaceful dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A recently held grand mood of Ulema (religious scholars) in
Kabul had decided not to initiate war with Iran but vowed to
respond if attacked by that country.
</P>
<P>
"We are showing restraint but will not remain the silent
spectator if war was imposed on Afghanistan," Chief Taliban
representative in Islamabad Saeedur Rehman has said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Not to Be Part of Turkey-Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu declared Sunday that Israel is not to be involved in the
dispute between Turkey and Syria, saying Israel will "take steps"
to reassure Damascus about it, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement as tensions are mounting along the
Turkish-Syrian borders over Ankara's accusation that Damascus is
aiding Kurdish rebels in Turkey, an allegation which Syria
denies.
</P>
<P>
The radio did not say what steps Netanyahu will take to
reassure that Israel will not be part of the dispute, but Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has ordered the Israeli army
to scale down its routine activities along the frontier with
Syria to signal Damascus of Israel's intention.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian press was reportedly blaming Israel for the tension
on the Turkish-Syrian border. But in a statement issued Saturday
night, Mordechai said "Israel is not interested in any conflict
with Syria, but rather in finding ways to renew talks."
</P>
<P>
Turkey is said to be building up military forces along its
border with Syria. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was
quoted as saying the army was planning an exercise along the
border.
</P>
<P>
In another dispute area, Syria has accused Turkey of its
increasing military ties with Israel, but Turkey and Israel deny
that their military cooperation aims against any third country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria also have disputes over water resources.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Growth Ensured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- China is expecting to ensure the
sustained development of agriculture, which is seen as the
prerequisite for the country's overall economic growth, social
stability and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
The central government will soon implement a policy that
requires every unit area of farmland used for non-agricultural
purposes be compensated for by one unit area of land of the same
size to be reclaimed by the user.
</P>
<P>
Protection of farmland is a key measure taken by the Chinese
government to ensure the future of agriculture, said Long Bing, an
official with the State Land Administration.
</P>
<P>
China is the third largest country in the world, but its
per-capita share of cultivated land stands at merely 0.1 hectare,
one-third of the world average. And for years, large area of
cultivated land have been used for industrial and urban
development.
</P>
<P>
Starting form the mid-1980s, the Chinese government began to
strengthen ways of protecting farmland, 70 percent of which is now
under protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Land and Natural Resources, the
government set a one-year ban in April 1997 on the use of
cultivated land for non-agricultural use. The ban has been
extended and will be effective "until a revised Land
Administration Law now being drafted comes into effect."
</P>
<P>
Funeral and interment practices are being changed to save
land. Farmers traditionally bury their dead in graves close to
their homes, but now this can only be done if the land is
non-agricultural.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are encouraging public cemeteries to be built
in hilly areas.
</P>
<P>
Apart from sustaining the area where crops are grown,
agriculture development also demands improvement of the
yields. Application of science and technology is believed to play
a key role in this regard.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the technique of the use of plastic film to cover
newly-sown crops boosted national grain production by 220 million
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Plastic film will cover a total of 530,000 hectares of farmland
this year, 2.8 times the 1997 figure, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Another agrotechnique that has achieved success is Chinese
hybrid rice developed by Yuan Longping and his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the high-yielding hybrid rice had been
grown on 200 million hectares of land. Its introduction has
boosted rice output by 300 billion kilograms.

<HEADLINE> China Ready for Information Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Large-scale construction of a
national information infrastructure and the explosion of
Internet-using population in China have elevated the country's
accessibility to information, which, to a significant extend,
determines a nation's growth potential.
</P>
<P>
By introducing program-controlled switching systems and
fiber-optic technology, China has constructed the world's second
largest telephone network and third largest mobile-phone network.
</P>
<P>
China has earmarked 160 billion yuan (19.3 billion
U.S. dollars) for information infrastructure development in 1998,
of which 145 billion yuan is being invested to expand the
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
The largest information network of China, China Public
Multimedia Information Network (CNINFO) is expected to become the
largest Intranet in the world. It was constructed in 1995, when it
was known as Chinanet, and was expanded in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It is currently serving 600,000 users. A recent net-promotion
in Beijing announced its ambitious goal of netting 10,000 users in
Beijing every week.
</P>
<P>
According to the Office of the information Leading Group under
the State Council, China's Internet population had reached 1.175
million by the end of June, double the number eight months before.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the affordability of personal computers is a
major reason why an increasing number of Chinese are entering the
digital world. Today, there are an estimated 15 million computers
in the country, most bought in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
Widespread computer education is another propellant. Most
middle schools and some primary schools in largest cities in China
now offer computer courses for their students.
</P>
<P>
However, an inadequacy of applications and Chinese language
information sources are the bottleneck to the information industry.
</P>
<P>
This has become one of the top priorities of the new Ministry
of Information Industry, the merged two former ministries -- posts
and telecommunications and electronics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations
formally opened its official Website as a cyberport of foreign
trade. "It's an ideal tool for opening new markets and collecting
feedback to improve the competitiveness of local enterprises on
the international market," said Vice-Minister Liu Shan.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- At least six Tamil rebels were
killed when Sri Lankan government troops advanced further
northwards Saturday from the newly recaptured Mankulam areas,
according to a military spokesman Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ink Dewage said rebels of the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE) fired mortars at the advancing troops, who then
retaliated "effectively," causing heavy casualties among the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The troops cleared the rebels' trench line north west of
Mankulam town, and killed several rebels and recovered some
weapons, he said.
</P>
<P>
Early on Sunday at Thandikulam in Vavuniya district, LTTE
rebels exploded three claymore mines against army vehicles,

said Dewage.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels have been fighting a war against the Sri Lankan
government since 1983 for a separate state in the north and east

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Visit Syria, Turkey to Ease Tensions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
will begin a visit to Syria and Turkey Sunday to rein in tensions,
which have been on rise recently.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak phoned Syrian President Hafez al-Assad and sent a
message to Turkish President Suleyman Demirel Saturday about his
intentions.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said his goals of the upcoming tour are to bring the
two estranged neighbors closer and spare the region fresh tensions.
</P>
<P>
The visit came amid escalating tensions between the two
neighbors in the past week.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Turkey of massing military forces along its
border and Ankara's close military ties with Israel, while Turkey
lashed out at Syria for supporting Turkish Kurdish rebels, who
have been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish forces are preparing to carry out military exercises
along the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
Turkish press said the exercises will go ahead or not depend on
whether Damascus continues its hostile attitude toward Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"The issue now is assuming crucial dimensions. There are
warnings hurled. This escalations must be contained," Mubarak told
reporters on his way to Saudi Arabia for a whirlwind visit
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The strained Syrian-Turkish ties is the focus of Mubarak's
talks with Saudi King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
"We have to curb and contain tension. Military threats must be
stopped. I am ready to do my best to this end in Damascus and
Ankara. Turkey is a sisterly country for all of us, and any
military action involving it and Syria is unacceptable," Mubarak
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the Middle East as a whole can not afford further
tensions or a new war.

<HEADLINE> "Mislabeled" Vaccines Samples Sent to Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Samples of the Hungarian-made
vaccines that caused side effects on hundreds of Jordanian
students have been sent to Switzerland for further laboratory
test, the semi-official Jordan Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The further test of the vaccines labeled by the manufacturer as
"D&AMP;T" (anti-diphtheria and -tetanus vaccines) will take some time
but reasons behind the incident will be given upon completion of
the test, President of the Jordan Medical Association Bassem
Dajani told the paper late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dajani did not elaborate on the name of the Swiss laboratory
and that of the Hungarian pharmaceutic manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
An immunization campaign started on September 16 in Jordan and
a total of 25,744 students were inoculated with the vaccines
across the country. But over 500 primary and high school students
hospitalized for suffering dizziness, nausea and headache after
the vaccination. Incidents began to surface on Thursday and most
of the students referred to hospitals have been discharged.
</P>
<P>
All the vaccines used on the students were manufactured in
Hungary and donated by the United Nations Children's Fund to the
Jordanian Ministry of Health and Health Care last year.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation International Children's Emergency Fund's
representative to Jordan Mislak Elias earlier this week said that
the vaccines met all the required international and national
standards at the time of their delivery to the Jordanian ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, local papers reported that a special Jordanian
investigation team, which was formed right after the incidents
earlier this week, thought that mislabeling of some vials
containing the vaccines might be a possible reason behind the
incidents.
</P>
<P>
It was very possible that the Hungarian manufacturers had
mislabeled some of these vaccines as "D&AMP;T" when they were actually
vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus as well as a third disease,
the investigators told local papers.
</P>
<P>
Vaccines against three diseases, instead of only against
diphtheria and tetanus, were too powerful for those at school ages
and side effects will follow, they added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Emphasizes Comprehensive Rural Reform (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
recently called on Party committees and governments at all levels
to place priority on agricultural development and continue efforts
to promote rural reform in accordance with the socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and chairman of the Central
Military Commission, issued the call during his fact-finding tour
of east China's Anhui Province September 25.
</P>
<P>
The most difficult task in accomplishing goals set at the 15th
Party Congress centers on sustaining stable agricultural and rural
economic development, said Jiang, noting that doing a good job in
rural areas will help to ensure overall smooth economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
China reform efforts in rural areas have achieved major
breakthrough and notable success which have helped to promote
comprehensive urban and economic reform. The reform in rural
areas came at a time when over 250 million rural Chinese were
suffering from starvation, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recounted China's experience in rural reform over the
past two decades, and noted that a new framework based on the
socialist market economy has basically come into being in rural
areas. The reform has been characterized by the household contract
responsibility system which has helped end the highly centralized
commune system and led to the introduction of an economy based on
multiple ownership systems.
</P>
<P>
Improved agricultural production has ended the long history of
shortages of farm products and has basically solved food problems
for 1.2 billion Chinese people, according to Jiang. He noted that
mushrooming village and township enterprises have also helped to
relieve the pressure of 130 million redundant rural laborers and
have at the same time greatly improved the living standards of
farmers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Emphasizes Comprehensive Rural Reform (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that the success of China's rural reform
represents a great victory for Deng Xiaoping Theory. He said that
the course of rural reform readily demonstrates that Deng Xiaoping
Theory is the sole means for freeing the country from the
constraints of old concepts and a rigid system, and will greatly
enhance efforts to build socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that the absence of Deng Xiaoping Theory
would have prevented China from developing a complete set of basic
policies on the Party's rural work, and would sidetracked today's
notable achievements.
</P>
<P>
He said the enthusiasm of farmers is the primary consideration
in formulating rural policies, and added that steps must be
introduced to ensure the economic interests and democratic rights
of farmers. It is necessary to respect the creativity of farmers
as they exhibited in creating the household contract
responsibility system, said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels must audaciously explore effective
ways of realizing public ownership in rural areas and improve the
structure of the rural ownership system. They must also adhere to
market-oriented rural reform, said Jiang, noting that this
represents the basic experience of rural reform and must
therefore be firmly pursued.
</P>
<P>
Jiang affirmed that the existing basic economic system and
management mechanisms based on the household contract and land
contract systems in rural areas have proven effective and must be
maintained. He stressed that market orientation is the key to
rural reform, and reaffirmed that China will not introduce land
privatization
</P>
<P>
The central government has adopted a clearly defined land
contract policy which will prolong contract periods for another 30
years, said Jiang, adding that the policy will remain unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The general goal of future rural economic reform will center on
an economic system based on the household contract responsibility
system supported by agricultural socialization services, the
marketing system for farm produce, the protection system for
agriculture and government funding.
</P>
<P>
The reform of the economic and political systems should be
carried out simultaneously, said Jiang, noting that strengthening
grass roots level democracy in rural areas and guaranteeing the
democratic rights of farmers are the primary aspects of socialist
democracy in the countryside.

<P>
The government must promote the direct election of village
committees, and democratic decision-making, management and
supervision, said Jiang. He stressed that the expansion of democracy
in rural areas must adhere to the leadership of the Party and must
be carried out in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Jiang addressed the issue of long-term agricultural
development and cited water conservancy and science and technology
as two most important areas. He urged local governments to
prioritize the development of rural infrastructure such as water
conservancy and flood control facilities, as well as afforestation
and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
He said measures must be introduced to ensure adherence to the
guidelines of using science and technology to invigorate
agriculture in order to ensure continuing progress and
growth. Jiang said that more attention should be placed on
raising the income levels of farmers.
</P>
<P>
China's success in rural areas maily relies on two factors --
seeking truth from facts and the mass line. The two factors
represent fundamental experience gained under the guidance of
Deng Xiaoping Theory in rural reform over the past two decades
and constitute the principle for promoting rural reform in the
future, according to Jiang.
</P>
<P>
New circumstances and problems continue to arise in the realm
of rural reform and development, said Jiang, adding that officials
at all levels should go deep into the realities of reform to learn
from the people, rely on the inventiveness and creativity of
farmers and learn to operate under the conditions of the market
economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on all officials to gain a better awareness of both
China and worldwide economic development. He said great importance
should be attached to ongoing economic globalization and a
knowledge-based economy in order to blaze a new trail for the
nation's agricultural and rural development.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Sell More Shares of National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government has
revised its privatization plan of the Jordan Telecommunication
Corporation (JTC) to market another 9 percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
This move will increase the total shares available for
non-governmental sector to 49 percent, the semi-official Jordan
Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the latest amendment to the privatization plan, the
government said that the 9 percent shares can be sold either
to the JTC's employees on preferential terms or to provident
funds of other state-owned enterprises, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The amendment did not give the reason for revising the
previous plan, which stipulates that 40 percent of the JTC's
shares will be sold to a foreign investor and the rest will be
kept in the hands of the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a local analyst, who asked not be named, told Xinhua
that the revision might be made in response to the JTC's new
Chairman of the Board of Directors Ali Shukri's demand that any
reform of the corporation should put the interests of the local
employees first.
</P>
<P>
When Shukri was appointed in July to head the JTC, he
immediately began to criticize the government's plan, saying that
if 40 percent of the shares will be sold, then priority should be
given to the Jordanians, especially the JTC's employees instead of
a foreign investor.
</P>
<P>
The employees at the JTC should get shares whose quantity
corresponds to their years of service at the corporation, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The privatization plan of the JTC was unveiled in 1997 in
order to draw private investment, update its technology, establish
incentive management mechanism and finally increase the company's

The British Cable and Wireless Company and the United States
Southern Bell Company have made their offers to buy 40 percent of
the shares of the national telecommunication giant, whose total
assets stand at 1.2 billion U.S. dollars. The government has asked
the two companies to submit their final bids by mid-October.

The government is now facing opposition from the parliament
in pushing through the plan. The plan has not been legalized

<HEADLINE> Israel Cautiously Stay Away From Turkey-Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- As tensions are mounting
between Turkey and Syria, Israel has ordered its armed forces to
scale down their routine activities along its borders with Syria,
cautiously avoiding to be accused of involvement in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Israeli newspapers reported Sunday that Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai has issued a statement saying that Israel is
not interested in any conflict with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"In order to make it clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that
Israel is not a party in this matter, I have given instructions to
decrease some of the routine activities along the border between
Israel and Syria," said the statement, which was issue Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the tensions between Turkey and Syria
were flaring up over Ankara's accusation that Damascus is aiding
Kurdish rebels in Turkey, an allegation which Syria denies.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is reportedly building up military forces along its
border with Syria. Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz was
quoted as saying the army was planning an exercise along the
border.
</P>
<P>
In another dispute area, Syria is blaming Turkey for its
increasing military ties with Israel, but Turkey and Israel deny
that their military cooperation aims against any third country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Syria also have disputes over water resources.

NEW DELHI -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has written a
"thoughtful and positive" letter to Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee, according to the Indian Express daily here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Clinton explained the deferment of his trip to
India which had been planned for November this year and welcomed
the progress made in the Indo-U.S. talks following India's nuclear
tests in May. The communication would keep the two leaders in more
frequent contact directly in the weeks ahead as they work more
closely to bring the dialogue between the two countries to
fruition, said the newspaper. (India-US President-Vajpayee)

ROME -- Italian Communist Refoundation leader Fausto
Bertinotti, ignoring a last-ditch appeal from Premier Romano
Prodi, reiterated Saturday his opposition to the government's 1999
budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day meeting of his party's policy-making
committee, the secretary of the Refoundation proposed "giving the
parliamentary groups a mandate to vote against this budget and
withdraw confidence from the Prodi government." Prodi's
center-left coalition relies on the hard-left parties' 34 deputies
in the Lower House to pass legislations, including the budget
bill. (Italy-Budget-Opposition)

BELGRADE -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry Saturday strongly
condemned the recent attacks on Yugoslav frontier troops by
terrorists who entered Yugoslavia from Albania.
</P>
<P>
In a protest note to the Albanian Embassy in Yugoslavia, the
foreign ministry said a group of terrorists assaulted Yugoslav
frontier guards with guns and antitank grenades last Wednesday,
killing five soldiers and injuring two. Noting that the invasions
had resulted from connivance of the Albanian authorities, the
ministry urged them to strictly carry out international duties and
take measures to stop invasions on Yugoslav territory.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Government Fails to Mend Fence With Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's Ministry of Social
Affairs and Labor failed to mend its fence with Kuwait Labor Union
because the minister wanted to discuss their disputes with the
union's head instead of its executive council.
</P>
<P>
Head of the union Thabet Al-Haroun rejected Saturday the
request of Social Affairs and Labor Minister Jassem Al-Oun to
discuss the union's complaints submitted to the International
Labor Organization (ILO), Kuwaiti press reports said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Al-Salman, the union's deputy chairman, said, "we went
to meet with minister Al-Oun in his office upon his request, but
we were surprised by the minister's request to meet alone with
chairman Al-Haroun."
</P>
<P>
Al-Haroun rejected the request and "it prompted us to leave
the minister's office because the union is represented by its
executive council, not by the chairman alone," Al-Salman said.
</P>
<P>
The union has complained to the ILO that Kuwaiti government
banned the establishment of unions in some sectors, privatized
factories and companies without consulting with the union and
refused to take into account the union's request to amend the
country's labor law, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government deliberately ignored the union's views,
which speaks on behalf of the Kuwaiti workers.
</P>
<P>
The union has urged the ILO to "intervene in the issue if the
government failed to find an amicable solution to the dispute,"
Al-Salman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the compliants do not harm the
interests of Kuwait and "we are always strong defendants against
anyone who attempts to harm Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
ILO Director Abu Baker Badawi has said that the ILO does not
aim to "penalize" the Kuwaiti government. But he underlined that
the organization may "resort to some pressure like publishing
reports and discussing the issue at the ILO annual conference."
</P>
<P>
Although some local observers expect an intensified rift
between the union and the government pending any agreement, few
believe such drastic decision as dissolving the labor union will
be taken by the government.

<HEADLINE> 60 Kilograms of Heroin Seized in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 60 kilograms of pure
heroin has been seized in an operation against drug trafficking in
eastern Turkey, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that acting on tip off, the Turkish police
stopped a tanker on the Van-Ercis highway in eastern province of
Van linking neighboring Iran and found the heroin in packets
planted in the vehicle. However, the agency did not report when
the heroin was confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The driver of the tanker was detained in connection with
the drug incident in the area, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is on a transit route of drugs to Europe from the border
areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 1996, Turkish police seized
4.4 tonnes of heroin, which accounted for 40 percent of the
world's total haul.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Raise Funds for FESPIC Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Public Welfare
Department will organize a Buddha amulet contest to raise funds
for athletes participating in the 7th Far East and South Pacific
Games for the Disabled (FESPIC) in January.
</P>
<P>
Phusak Thamongkol, the department spokesman, said his
department, as a fund-raising body for the welfare of disabled
athletes, was running well short of the required budget,
according to Sunday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
The FESPIC games, to be staged from January 10-16 next year, is
 expected to draw some 400 athletes from 42 countries and
regions. They will compete in 15 sporting events in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
Phusak said government funds were insufficient to absorb the
costs of training, catering as well as rewarding the winning
athletes.
</P>
<P>
The department, therefore, decided to hold a Buddha amulet
contest on October 11 in the hope of generating at least one
million baht (25,600 U.S. dollars) to foot the bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the fund is expected to come from registration
fees and the sale of amulets.
</P>
<P>
But Phusak is not optimistic on the fund-raising target as he
sees the event generating no more than 200,000 baht (5,130
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department is also seeking a 920,000-baht (23,600-dollar)
subsidy from the government Lottery Office. But so far, it has
not heard from the agency.

JERUSALEM, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian cabinet said on Friday that it would
call on its negotiators to work with all their ability to
reach an accord with Israel during the visit of U.S. Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright. And Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat and Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh are due to
meet on Sunday for discussions over the second redeployment of
Israeli troops in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli National Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon, tipped
 as a possible foreign minister after an agreement is signed on
the second West Bank redeployment, has said that "under certain
conditions" he would be ready to accept the post. Sharon told
Haaretz that he could see himself as foreign minister if he is
allowed "to act to strengthen the country" and to contribute to
achieving peace "with a minimum of danger to Israel."
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- With tensions rising between Turkey and Syria, Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai indicated on Saturday that

Syria, but rather in finding ways to renew talks," said Mordechai,

<HEADLINE> Mubarak to Mediate between Turkey, Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
is to pay a surprise visit Monday to Turkey to mediate between the
strained neighboring Turkey and Syria, local Milliyet newspaper
reported here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Mubarak will first visit Syria on Sunday and
later fly to Turkey in a bid to find ways to ease the mounting
tensions between Turkey and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkish forces are preparing to carrying out a military
exercise along the Syrian border as tension is mounting between
Ankara and Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that preparations had been completed for
such an extensive exercise but the date has not been fixed,
adding that whether the exercise would go ahead or not would
depend on whether the Syrian administration continued its hostile
attitude against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey accuses Syria of harboring militants of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been waging a 14-year-old
armed fight on Turkish territory. But Syria denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin said Saturday that "We
have warned Syria not to allow terrorism to become state
policy. It is unacceptable within the framework of friendly
relations and principles of democracy".
</P>
<P>
Milliyet reported Sunday that Turkish fighter planes from air
bases in southeastern provinces of Malatya and Diyarbakir were
carrying out low-altitude flights along the Syrian border.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish reliable source, who asked not to be named, confirmed
Saturday that Turkey has massed troops backed by tanks and heavy
artillery in the border areas with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Turkish President Suleymand Demirel said on Thursday that
despite Turkey's repeated warnings and peaceful initiatives, Syria
is trying to provoke the Arab world against Ankara by using
Turkey's close ties with Israel as a pretext.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a friendly attitude. I declare to the world
that our patience is running out and we retain the right to
retaliate against Syria", said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Turkey enjoys close relations with Israel by carrying out a
number of agreements on military training and defense.
</P>
<P>
Syria said that the Turkish-Israeli alliance is targeted
against the Arab world, especially itself, accusing Turkey of
betraying the interests of the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Syria has disputes with Israel over the future of the Golan
Heights captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War.

<HEADLINE> Thai Private Airline Asks for Permission to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Udom told reporters that he had met with Mahidol Chantarangkun,
permanent secretary of the Transport and Communications Ministry,
to discuss the request.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, Udom said, would meet Orient Thai Airline's
request because the government has a policy to promote the roles
of privately-owned airlines.
</P>
<P>
Orient Thai Airline received its five-year aviation license
from the ministry on May 1, 1995 after its overseas operation,
under the old name of Cambodian International Airline, was
terminated by the Cambodian government in late 1994.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued the license on condition that Orient Thai
Airline would have to cease operation when Thailand's second
national flag carrier, Angel Airline, was formed and started
operation. The term was aimed at protecting the operation of Angel
Airline.
</P>
<P>
After Angel Airline started its flight service on September 20
this year, Orient Thai Airline asked the government to waive the
condition for it to cease operation and to let it continue service
until April 30, 2000, which is the normal expiry date of its
five-year aviation license.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Orient Thai Airline, Thailand currently has four
other privately-owned airlines -- Bangkok Airways, Thai Flying
Service, PB Air and Siam Land Flying. All these airlines are
expected to join forces in line with a government call to
streamline domestic flight service.

<HEADLINE> Reid Wins Hawaiian Triathlon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Peter Reid clocked
eight hours, 24 minutes and 20 seconds to win the Hawaiian
Ironman Triathlon on Saturday in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
Reid, 29, who placed fourth in the past two years in the
annual event, took the lead from Germany's Jurgen Zack about two
miles into the marathon run, the last of the three sections of
the competition.
</P>
<P>
Belgium's Luc Van Lierde, who set the course record of 8:04.08
in 1996, wound up second in 8:31.57 ahead of another German Lot
har Leder, in 8:32.57.
</P>
<P>
Reid placed 54th in the 2.4-mile swim in the ocean, but jumped
to the third after the 112-mile cycling race.
</P>
<P>
During the marathon, Reid, the winner of the Australian
Ironman last April, moved past Zack and defending champion Thomas
Hellriegel of Germany. He beat his closest chaser by eight
minutes after 18 miles.
</P>
<P>
"The last mile was really tough," said Reid, who withdrew from
the race in his first two attmepts. "But then I thought I can do
it. I think I can do it. I did it."
</P>
<P>
Hellriegel, who finished second in the bike race, and was
running in third place in the marathon, began to walk after 11
miles and fell back several places. Zack also faltered
considerably in the waning miles.
</P>
<P>
Natascha Badmann of Switzerland won the women's title.
Defending champion Heather Fuhr of Canada was out of the top five.
</P>
<P>
A record field of 1,486 professional and age-group amateurs,
seven more than the previous mark set last year, began the
140.6-mile event under clear skies and with strong swim
currents.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Psychiatric Reports Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Nevada Athletic Commission
will have to wait for a couple of days to see Tyson's psychiatric
reports from doctors.
</P>
<P>
Reports from a five-day evaluation of the former heavyweight
champion closed on Friday, four days after they were due, but
now, the Nevada boxing authorities still hadn't seen them.
</P>
<P>
Tyson attorney Jim Jimmerson said he expected to have the
documents sent to the commission by Monday at the latest. Under a
judge's ruling, they will also be made public at that time.
</P>
<P>
"There's going to be some embarrassing things in the report,
I'm sure," Jimmerson said.
</P>
<P>
Jimmerson said he expected the report to be some 30 to 50
pages and summarize a battery of tests and interviews that Tyson
submitted to last week at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Boxing commissioners hoped to see the reports last week and
had set a hearing for Saturday to decide whether to license
Tyson. Now the hearing is expected to be held on October 19.
</P>
<P>
"I can't schedule a hearing until we have a documents," said
Marc Ratner, executive director of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Jimmerson went to court Thursday to try and stop the documents
from becoming public information. But a judge said he could find
no state statute that would prevent their release as public
records.
</P>
<P>
Tyson's attorneys have been negotiating with attorneys for the
two men beaten by Tyson in an August 31 traffic accident in hopes
of reaching a settlement before the commission hearing, Tyson is
still scheduled to stand trial on October 19 for the incident.
</P>
<P>
No negotiations are underway to drop the second-degree assault
charges, and prosecutors say they plan to go ahead with the case.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM on Providing Home for the Homeless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina has directed the concerned authorities to provide shelters
to those who were rendered homeless in the devastating floods, an
English newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We shall provide shelters in phases to all who became homeless
in the floods, river erosion or other calamities and by
deprivation through various projects," the prime minister said at
two separate public rallies held in southeast district during her
visit Saturday, The Independent newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
She assured the flood-affected people that her government had
taken all-out measures for post-flood rehabilitation and
reconstruction to recoup the massive loss caused by the
catastrophic floods.
</P>
<P>
She also asked concerned members of parliament and districts to
take necessary measures for providing shelters to the homeless
people.
</P>
<P>
"Our government is totally committed to managing two square
meals, two pieces of coarse clothes and shelter for the
downtrodden," she said.
</P>
<P>
While outlining the various measures of the government to cope
with the post-flood situation, she told the rallies that all
flood-affected people would be provided with necessary succor and
medicare facilities so that none was deprived of getting necessary
facilities from the government.
</P>
<P>
The government would provide food until the next harvest by
issuing four million vulnerable group feeding (VGF) cards among
the people who were most seriously hit by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Apart from giving VGF cards, the government would start
large-scale food-for-work, test relief and vulnerable group
development works so that the food victims could get job
opportunities for their survival, she disclosed.
</P>
<P>
With the disbursement of a 32.7 billion taka (695.6 million
U.S. dollars) agri-loan, the implementation of the 21.6 billion
taka (459.6 million dollars) agri-rehabilitation program and
post-flood reconstruction program, the government would enable the
nation to recover the losses (preliminarily estimated at 3.4
billion dollars) caused by the floods, the prime minister stated.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Writes to Indian Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- United States President Bill
Clinton has written a "thoughtful and positive" letter to Indian
Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, according to the Indian
Express daily here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton explained the deferment of his trip to India which had
been planned for November this year and welcomed the progress made
in Indo-U.S. talks following India's nuclear tests in May.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said senior U.S. administration officials told
its correspondent in Washington that the communication would keep
the two leaders in more frequent contact directly in the weeks
ahead as they work more closely to bring the dialogue between the
two countries to fruition.
</P>
<P>
Indian diplomats confirmed that a letter had been sent but
withheld comment pending its receipt in New Delhi where a clutch
of holidays was expected to delay an official reaction.
</P>
<P>
The letter, which was sent Wednesday, is Clinton's first formal
communication to the Indian prime minister after the nuclear
tests.
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not respond to Vajpayee's letter soon after the
tests which excused himself for the blasts.
</P>
<P>
The India Express said that Washington wanted to convey its
appreciation of India's changing stand on the Comprehensive Test
Ban Treaty (CTBT), although it now said more across the board
progress needs to be made on a range of proliferation and
security-related issues.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the nuclear tests, the Indian government declared
a moratorium on further tests while refusing to sign the CTBT on
the ground that it was discriminative to countries like India.
</P>
<P>
However, under pressure both at home and abroad on the nuclear
issue, Vajpayee said last month that his government accepted the
spirit underlying the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Following his visits to New York and France towards the end of
last month, the Indian leader said last Thursday India's decision
on signing the CTBT would depend on the outcome of the ongoing
talks between his country and key interlocutors, mainly the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a senior U.S. official, the Indian Express said Clinton
paid close attention to what the Indian leader said to both the
United Nations General Assembly and the Asia Society in New York.
</P>
<P>
Washington did not want the speed of the dialogue between the
two countries exceed the pace of domestic consensus in India, the
official reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister (Vajpayee) has to deal with his coalition,
with the opposition, with public opinion. We do not want to push
the debate faster than it can be absorbed," he said.

<HEADLINE> 2,500 Baby Sea Turtles Released into the Pacific in Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACAPULCO, MEXICO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's Guerrero State
Autonomous University (UAG) said Saturday that 2,500 baby sea
turtles were released to the Pacific Ocean on Friday after being
hatched in a turtle nursery in the port city of Acapulco.
</P>
<P>
UAG's Marine Ecology School Director Juan Vivantes Gonzalez
said so far this year a total of 22,115 turtle eggs have been
processed in the protection camp.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, they have released altogether 4,647 baby sea turtles
to the Pacific Ocean, Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
The director expected that after a few years the baby turtles
would return to the point where they were released to lay eggs.
</P>
<P>
As every year many turtles come to this Pacific resort,
biologists have proposed that the Barra Vieja area in Acapulco be
decreed a zone of protection.

Bangladesh Observer daily reported Sunday.
</P>

<P>
Besides, the government was also encouraging the local private
sector entrepreneurs to boost the economy, he said, adding that
the government was extending all sorts of cooperation to the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that there was now no ethnic problem in Bangladesh,
referring to the prevailing conducive environment for foreign
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
The minister reiterated his government's all-out cooperation to
 foreign investors, saying that the government would try its best
to help in case of any problem.
</P>
<P>

foreign investors, including tax holiday from 5-10 years, 15
years' tax holiday for private power generation companies,
exemption of tax on interest on foreign loans, avoidance of double
taxation, six months' multiple entry visa for the investors,
facilities for repatriation of invested capital, profit and
dividend, and working capital loans and term loans from local
commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
By April 15, 1998, Bangladesh had absorbed 73.1 billion taka
(1.56 billion U.S. dollars) in local and foreign investment in
various sectors, according to the latest figures issued by the
Board of Investment.

<HEADLINE> G7 Ministers Vow Joint Efforts to Halt Global Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The top financial officials
of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialized countries said Saturday
that they would make joint efforts to end the world's financial
crisis and avoid a global recession.
</P>
<P>
In a day-long meeting in Washington, finance ministers and
central bank governors from the seven countries -- Canada,
Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States --
focused their discussions on the current economic crisis and
committed cooperative efforts in dealing with the problems.
</P>
<P>
"There clearly was a very intense focus on the issue with
respect to the current crisis, and a deep sense of commitment to
do everything sensible to deal with it," U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin told reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the meeting said the ministers
reaffirmed the key importance of "each country in the global
economy doing its part to promote recovery and financial
stability."
</P>
<P>
The G-7 officials focused their discussions on Japan's economic
situation and Russia's financial problems as well as the group's
internal development.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Japan's economic challenges have
intensified significantly in recent months and urged Japan to
quickly put in place programs to jump-start an economy that is
mired in its worst recession in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
"Strong sustainable recovery in the economy is of critical
importance to Japan, the Asia region and the rest of the world,"
the statement noted.
</P>
<P>
The group also warned of the serious dangers of inflation in
Russia if the country follows its announced plan of printing more
rubles.
</P>
<P>
They called for monetary restraint and fiscal adjustment in the
nation to avoid serious risk of inflation and further exchange
rate weakening, and urged Russia to take comprehensive financial
sector restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and governors welcomed the "impressive efforts by
a number of emerging market economies to strengthen their domestic
policies in light of the financial market pressures" that have
spread over the past year.
</P>
<P>
They also committed themselves to creating and sustaining
conditions for strong domestic demand-led growth and financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
The meeting stressed the role the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has been playing in leading global financial stability. The
officials said that it was important to adapt the IMF to ongoing
changes in the world economy and called for increased
transparency, program reform and effective use of IMF resources.
</P>
<P>
But no action was taken on a set of proposals put forward by
U.S. President Bill Clinton on Friday or on ideas for overhauling
the global financial architecture advanced by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Saturday, Clinton made phone calls to British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and French President Jacques Chirac for
support to his proposals and received positive responses from the
two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. plan is centered on a proposal to allow the
International Monetary Fund to provide more, faster money to
countries threatened with a flight of panicked investors.
</P>
<P>
After the G7 discussions ended Saturday night, Rubin told
reporters that decisions on specific proposals were left until
later.
</P>
<P>
The group's communique said that Hans Tietmeyer, head of the
German central bank, had been made to head a working level group
and would report back expeditiously on any ideas where consensus
is reached.

<HEADLINE> Bertinotti Calls for Voting Against Budget Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian Communist Refoundation
leader Fausto Bertinotti, ignoring a last-ditch appeal from
Premier Romano Prodi, reiterated Saturday his opposition to the
government's 1999 budget bill.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day meeting of his party's policy-making
committee, the secretary of the Refoundation proposed "giving the
parliamentary groups a mandate to vote against this budget and
withdraw confidence from the Prodi government."
</P>

Bertinotti has been demanding for months that the 1999 budget

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Growth Sustained Amid Asian Financial Crisis(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Considering its enormous size, China is not entirely dependent
on exports for economic growth, according to Li Shantong of the
Development Research Center under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
In Li's opinion, China, with its 1.2-billion population, is
itself a huge market. "It is clear that China can achieve
sustained economic growth by stimulating domestic demand," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has been quick to react to the Asian
financial crisis to ensure 8 percent economic growth for this
year. Spending has increased dramatically on infrastructure
projects, such as railways, highways, power plants and
agricultural facilities.
</P>
<P>
The latest measure to stimulate consumer demand has been taken
by the People's Bank of China, the central bank, which announced a
cut in interest rates for bank deposits and loans recently. It was
the fourth such cut in the past year.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu Guoguang, vice-president of the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, measures designed to stimulate the
economy are beginning to play their roles in the second half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has elevated the status and role of
China, said an annual outlook report by the Singapore-based
Pacific Economic Cooperation Council. If China should devalue its
currency, it would likely start another round of competitive
depreciations in the Asian region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of China's central bank also noted that
devaluing the yuan would not only be disastrous for Asia, but
would hinder the development of China's own economy in the long
run.
</P>
<P>
"China is a responsible country. It will keep its currency
stable for the sake of China's own benefits, the Asian economies
and the world economy as a whole," said Li Shantong of the
Development Research Center.

<HEADLINE> China's Economic Growth Sustained Amid Asian Financial Crisis(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Amid the financial turmoil in
Asia, China seems to be the last bulwark against a further
collapse of economies. The Chinese government has vowed time and
again that it will not devalue the Chinese yuan and that the
country has the capability to achieve an econmic growth rate of
eight percent for 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis, according to Chinese economists, is
not having much of a direct impact on the Chinese economy. One
reason is that the Chinese yuan at present is convertible only
under the current account but not the capital account, and the
country has enjoyed a favorable foreign exchange balance with an
adequate foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
However, the indirect effects of the Asian financial crisis on
China's economy should not be overlooked, according to Chinese
economists.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has forced some Asian countries to devalue their
currencies, making their export goods cheaper and thus affected
Chinese exports negatively. Chinese exports to Southeast
Asian countries so far this year have decreased in volume by
varying degrees owing to currency devaluation in these countries.
</P>
<P>
In spite of this, China is capable of tackling the tough
situation by adopting various measures, said liu Xiangdong,
vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chinese exports to Europe and the United States have
picked up. In the first five months of 1998, Chinese exports to
the United States reached US$ 13.34 billion, up 18.1 percent over
the same period last year, and its exports to the European Union
were worth US$ 10.68 billion, up 25.5 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Fresh berries can
significantly reduce the building of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)
cholesterol, a culprit contributing to heart disease, stroke and
atherosclerosis, according to a research report.
</P>
<P>
The report, published in Saturday's Journal of Agricultural and
Food Chemistry, was written by a team of scientists from the
University of California at Davis, the University of Helsinki of
Finland and the Technical University of Denmark.
</P>
<P>
They wrote that blackberries have the highest LDL inhibitory
effect, followed by red raspberries, sweet cherries, blueberries
and strawberries.
</P>
<P>
During their vitro studies, they found that naturally occurring
phenolic compounds in fresh berries exhibited antioxidant
activities, comparable to those previously found in fresh grapes
and wines.
</P>
<P>
They said they need further study to determine the amount of
berries a person would need to consume in order to reap the
antioxidant benefits.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM on Possible NATO Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 3 (Xinhua) -- NATO's preparation for a possible
military intervention in Kosovo is meant to persuade warring
factions there to opt for a cease-fire and open peace talks,
Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"There are still signs the conflict may be resolved, but it is
too early to say," Dini told reporters on the sidelines of a
conference on the euro which was held in Lodi, a town to the
southeast of Milan.
</P>
<P>
He added that so far "almost all diplomatic attempts have not
brought results and now we are at the ultimatum phase."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a NATO military intervention in the troubled
Serbian province has been growing considerably in the past weeks,
especially in the wake of last Saturday's massacre of 16 ethnic
Albanian civilians, mostly women and children, by Serbian security
forces there.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of next week United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan is due to report on whether Serbia has sufficiently
complied with the September 23 U.N. resolution demanding an
immediate cease-fire in Kosovo and the opening of peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
If it is found that this is not the case, Dini said, "foreign
intervention and even military action is inevitable."
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that a U.N. mandate is required for that military
intervention, Dini recalled Russia's opposition to military
intervention in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council with
a power to veto any council's mandate for military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the two
million population, plunged into chaos since February this year as
ethnic Albanian separatists intensified their campaign for
independence of the province.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Upgrade Skills of Gem Instructors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka will upgrade the
skills of instructors in the gem and jewelry sectors to enhance
the training capacity of craftsmen engaged in these two
specialized areas.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Ministry of Vocational Training
Sunday, planning activities undertaken and extensive dialogue
established with the industry had identified new training needs
for these sectors.
</P>
<P>
There was also an urgent need for more stone setters, casters,
mass polishers and designers for the export oriented jewelry
manufacturing trade, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Immediate steps will be taken to change the traditional
training courses to suit the highest demands of the gem and
jewelry sectors.
</P>
<P>
In order to fill these shortages, steps are being taken to use
the services of skilled laborers who are presently engaged in the
industrial sector as short-term trainers.
</P>
<P>
The jewelry school in Colombo will be provided with additional
equipment including modularized short-term training in stone
setting, casting and polishing.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements have been made to set up jewelry training units in
other parts of the country as well.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka was referred to as an "island of gem", and historical
evidence showed the gems were an important product of trade during
early times.
</P>
<P>
The export earnings of gems in the country last year reached
207.6 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Albanian New Cabinet Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Albania's new cabinet, led by
Prime Minister Pandeli Majko, was sworn in Friday by President
Rexhep Mejdani.
</P>
<P>
The 19-member new cabinet was formed after former Prime
Minister Fatos Nano was forced to resign Monday after failing to
win approval for cabinet changes following riots triggered by the
assassination of a popular opposition leader two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the lineup, Majko had two days' intensive discussions
with the ruling five-party coalition and two non-party
representatives on the cabinet team.
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party reportedly drove a hard bargain
over some ministers' nomination, which nearly spoiled the cabinet
formation. However, consensus was reached eventually.
</P>
<P>
A notable feature of the new cabinet is that the ministers are
comparatively young. Majko, 30, is Europe's youngest head of
government. Several other ministers are also in their thirties.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts say young ministers taking office marks a
beginning of a political juveniling of Albania, and the young
ministers-dominated government is likely to be bold and decisive
in adopting its own lines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the members of the new government are believed to
have no connection with corruption and smuggling, which will make
them much less vulnerable to attacks from opposition parties,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
"The main priorities of the new government will be a return to
stability, drafting a new constitution and the Kosovo problem,"
Majko told reporters shortly after the lineup of the government.
</P>
<P>
Those priorities will be the core of Majko's administrative
program to be presented to the parliament for approval on
October 5.
</P>
<P>
One day after being named prime minister, Majko inspected the
police department and said that it is time not only to attack
crimes but also to eliminate them, which shows restoring social
order will be one of the new government's overriding tasks.
</P>
<P>
Majko stressed the importance of cooperation between the new
government and international community, especially in economy,
saying it is necessary to enable the country to a normal life.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will support the financial policies made
in line with the International Monetary Fund's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Dismissing reports that the new government is only an interim
one, Majko said some long-term goals in his administrative program
will be workable till the year 2000.

BELGRADE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav Foreign Ministry
Saturday strongly condemned the recent attacks on Yugoslav

Another two groups of terrorists from Albania also stole

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Improve Rice Milling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is seeking ways to
improve the existing rice milling by modernizing both the
state-owned and private-run rice mills so that Myanmar rice will
be more competitive in foreign market.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 60 state-owned rice mills and over 1,500
private ones in operation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Official The New Light of Myanmar newspaper Sunday quoted
Lieutenant-General Tin Oo, second secretary of the Myanmar State
Peace and Development Council, as saying that although private
rice mills are in the majority, they are old and outdated,
believing that the State Myanmar Agricultural Produce Trading's
rice mills will play a leading role to be emulated by private
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
At the opening of a new 250-ton rice mill in Letpadan township
Saturday, Tin Oo admitted that there is difficulty in the
production of quality rice because of lacking of modern technique,
calling for the use of quality strains and scientific cultivation
methods in agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He also said the government purchases for government employees
between 1.6 and 1.8 million tons of paddy out of the more than 16
million tons produced annually, adding that the government
purchases about 20 percent of the marketable paddy and 80 percent
is traded by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's paddy production in
1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March was 17.3 million tons, of
which 28,300 tons of rice were exported.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, the country exported
17,600 tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture, accounting for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the export in value, grew by
2.9 percent in output value in the fiscal year.

In a communique issued in the wake of their 60th ministerial
meeting, the Intergovernmental Group of 24 On International
Monetary Affairs, which represents 128 developing nations, showed
their grave concern for the worsening global financial and
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
The group proposed to set up regional stabilization funds that
would intervene rapidly to head off financial crises such as those
which occurred in Southeast Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
They proposed the creation of a task force to review the
ability of international institutions to deal with the world's

</P>
<P>
They also called for faster actions on debt relief for heavily

</P>
<P>

<P>
The G-24 meeting is part of the on-going IMF-World Bank joint
annual meeting. China is not a member of the G-24, but attended
their discussions as an invitee. The meeting focused on proposals
under discussion by the world's financial leaders on how to

<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Amid reports of deteriorating
ecological environment in a number of regions in China and under
the pressure of population and economic growth, a growing part of
the Chinese public is taking action on their own to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
When Green Earth Volunteers, an informal group of environmental
enthusiasts based in Beijing, organized a trip to plant trees in a
desert in Inner Mongolia last April, more than 200 people aged
from three to 75 signed up to join, doubling the organizers'
original plan of 100.
</P>
<P>
"Desertification is a grave problem in China now," said Wang,
Yongchen, one of the founders of Green Earth and an organizer of
the trip. According to the National Administration of Foresty,
every year China loses 2,600 square kilometers of farmland to
desertification. Overall, desertification affects 400 million
people in the country and causes 54 billion yuan (6.7 billion US
dollars) of economic damages a year.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot wait and see our homeland devastated by deserts,"
Wang said. "We believe that so long as we take action, the desert
can be held at bay."
</P>
<P>
Wang and several other environmentalists founded Green Earth
Volunteers in 1994 in the belief that environmental protection
should become "every citizen's care and share."
</P>
<P>
Since the launch of Green Earth Volunteers in 1994, nearly
5,000 people have participated in their diverse activities of
bird-watching, tree planting and adopting, campaigning to rescue
the Yangtze Dolphin, the most endangered dolphin in the world that
is unique and indigenous to China.
</P>
<P>
Green Earth Volunteers is only one example of people's
spontaneous environmental protection activities across China in
the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Drug Traffickers Quicken Business in Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Albanian drug traffickers have
stepped up their dealings in Bulgaria in the wake of the crisis in
Kosovo, an official of the National Service for Organized Crime
Control (NSOCC) said.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking rings are mainly controlled by Turkish, Arab
and Albanian organizations. The NSOCC Drugs Control Department
said that all Albanians, Turks and Arabs living in Bulgaria will
be extradited from the country within 24 hours when they are found
trafficking drugs.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, well-armed groups became involved in the
narcotics business and in corrupting customs officials and civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
NSOCC data show that most of the drug enters Western Europe
through Iran, Turkey, the former Soviet republics in Central Asia
and Poland, while some other is trafficked through Afghanistan,
Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey before it reaches the Balkan route.
</P>
<P>
This year 322 kilograms of heroin has been seized in Bulgaria,
three times as much as that in Romania and Greece. Thirty-five
Bulgarians and three Macedonians have been arrested in attempts to
smuggle heroin and 49 Bulgarians caught for illegally carrying
marijuana.

Another environmentally-conscious non-government organization in
Beijing -- Friends of Nature -- has held lectures, organized summer
camps and published books on environmental protection since its
establishment in 1994. It also conducts a media survey on
environment reporting every year.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of more than 500 people in Hebei Province
in 1997, nearly 68 percent of respondents were unsatisfied with the
environment surrounding them, reported the newspaper Hebei
Daily. "But only four percent of them thought of taking some
action on their own to improve their environment," said Zhao Bing,
an editor of the paper.
</P>
<P>
This means that there is a huge amount of work to do to alert
and motivate the public to be concerned about and take action on
environmental issues, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
That is why many legislators and officials welcome environment
volunteers. Qu Geping, chairman of the Environmental and Resources
Protection Committee (ERPC) of the National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, said the emergence of
environment-conscious NGOs and volunteers "is a good thing for
China."
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, China's environmental protection undertaking
has started and developed thanks to popular participation,
pressure and supervision. "We should encourage more participation
and supervision."
</P>
<P>
Helping prompt awareness, participation and supervision, 37
cities including Beijing and Shanghai have started announcing
local air pollution indexes (APIs) on a weekly basis in the
press. Almost all urbanites are talking about pollution and
environment. "That will hopefully be a prelude to action," said
Wang of Green Earth Volunteers.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Police to Be Separated From Armed Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI)
Commander Gen. Wiranto has confirmed that the National Police
would soon be separated from the ABRI, the Jakarta Post reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto who is also minister of defense and security told
reporters here Saturday that the Armed Forces headquarters had
agreed to let the National Police become an independent force.
</P>
<P>
Under the current system, the police are incorporated into ABRI
along with the Army, Navy and Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto, however, insisted that the police's separation from
ABRI would not happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
"There are stages that will provide the time frame for the
National Police to adapt to a new environment and system," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the police's supervision would be transferred from
the Armed Forces headquarters to the Ministry of Defense and
Security.
</P>
<P>
"After six months supervision by the defense ministry, there
will be an evaluation as to whom the National Police should be
subordinate to. Either still under the supervision of the Ministry
of Defense and Security, or the Ministry of Home Affairs. It could
also be put directly under the president's supervision," he added.
</P>
<P>
National Police chief Lt. Gen. Roesmanhadi said the National
Police headquarters had prepared everything to comply with the
Armed Forces headquarters' plan to structurally separate the
National Police from ABRI.
</P>
<P>
"New concepts on the police's tasks and responsibilities must
be established prior to the police's separation from ABRI. There
must be changes in the police's social approach, from being
military-oriented officers to public-oriented ones," he added.

<HEADLINE> Trimming China's Government Establishment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- The number and size of
China's central government's ministries and commissions, formerly
40 in number, have been reduced to 29.
</P>
<P>
"The goals of the government restructuring are to establish an
administrative system that works with high efficiency, that
functions in a coordinated way and follows standard procedures;
that improves the country's civil service system and nurtures
administrative personnels that are highly competent," said State
Councillor Luo Gan at the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Of the original 40 central government departments, 15 were
axed, while four new ministries and commissions were
established. Three were renamed.
</P>
<P>
Among the abolished ministries were those of the electric
power, coal and the metallurgical industries.
</P>
<P>
Under the old system, the government took charge of everything
relating to state-owned enterprises, from production to management
to marketing. Government controls more often than not led to
non-accountability and poor decision-making in the economic field.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the central government spent 1.35 billion
yuan in 1996 supporting 42,600 employees in government
institutions with iron-rice bowl lives. Nationwide, the
livelihoods of some eight million civil servants and over 28
million employees in government institutions and offices at
various levels lived off state funds. The burden became so huge
that the fundamental operations of government in various areas
such as education and research were themselves in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
In describing the situation at a press conference to outline
the government's restructuring plans, Premier Zhu Rongji told
journalists: "The government now lacks money for education, science
and technology. Where has all the money gone? It's been eaten up."

BONN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- American Andre Agassi saved four
match points to beat Slovakia's Karol Kucera in the semifinals of
the Grand Slam Cup tennis tournament in Munich on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The former world number one came from 5-2 down in the fourth se
t and saved four match points before clinching a 7-6, 6-7, 2-6,
7-5, 6-0 victory.
</P>
<P>
Agassi will take on world number three Marcelo Rios of Chile
in Sunday's final. Rios advanced with a 7-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over
Australian Mark Philippoussis.
</P>
<P>
"It was a very physical match," said Agassi who received a
wild card for the lucrative tournament. "I was tired, too, but
not as much as him (Kucera)."
</P>
<P>
Agassi, who blanked Frenchman Cedric Pioline before beating
Australian Open champion Petr Korda in earlier rounds, will now

<P>
All remaining 29 ministries and commissions, and other
departments under the State Council, have worked out programs to
determine their function, structure and size.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 ministerial and commission responsibilities have
been delegated to enterprises, organizations, and local
governments, while more than 100 other such functions have been
divided among State Council departments. More than 200 lower-level
departments have been cut. In all, China's government workforce
has been downsized by 47.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other great changes have occurred throughout the civil
service. The government structural reform has involved the
establishment and adjustment of leadership lineups in 82
ministries, commissions, institutions and offices under the State
Council, as well as state bureaus and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
A total of 515 ranked officials have been involved. Among them,
36.1 percent have been asked to remain in their original posts,
48.2 percent have been newly-appointed and 15.7 percent have been
transferred to other posts or retired.
</P>
<P>
Some high-ranking officials were among those
affected. Seventeen ministerial-level officials are now taking
vice-ministerial-level posts, and 28 vice-ministerial-level
officials are taking vice-bureau-level posts.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of these adjustments, job assignment and provision
of proper arrangements for redundant personnel should not be
forgotten, as Premier Zhu outlined. He has targeted a three year
period for redundant personnel to find new posts after receiving
professional training.

<HEADLINE> Office Rental Costs Fall in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- Increasing supply of office
space in Beijing have brought down the city's office rental costs
by as much as 50 percent since the market peak in 1995, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate for grade-A office stock is 36 percent, and it
is projected to reach 40 percent before the market turns.
</P>
<P>
"While the city's office supply looks set to continue growing
for 1999 and 2000, it must be remembered that Beijing is a
emerging market," said Rober Walker of international property
consultant Jones Lang Wootton.
</P>
<P>
Walker, who is the managing director of the company's Beijing
Office, said the market is heading toward equilibrium from acute
shortage of quality office stock in the early and mid-1990 when
office rentals were historically high.
</P>
<P>
As construction projects are deferred and property market
schedules are put off, the supply in 1998 is likely to be only
600,000-650,000 square meters in stead of the forecast figure at
the beginning of the year, 950,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
The steady supply serves to stabilize market conditions
allowing appropriate time for the establishment of market rentals,
Walker said.

<HEADLINE> More Forest Fires Occur in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 4 (Xinhua) -- As many as 1,542 forest fires
occurred in Vietnam in the first nine months of this year,
official Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The fires, a six-fold increase over that of the same period
last year, destroyed 19,214 hectares of forest, including 6,300
hectares of natural forests and 7,400 hectares of planted forests,
VNA quoted the Forestry Department under the Ministry of
Agriculture and Rural Development as saying.
</P>
<P>
Total loss was estimated at 33 billion VN dong (roughly 2.5
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Increases in forest fires were attributed to the El Nino
phenomenon which caused prolonged droughts, consequently water
shortage in many areas for a long time and flammable forests.
</P>
<P>
The practice of slash-and-burn farming by inhabitants, mostly
ethnic minority people, in remote areas was another cause while
fire fighting facilities were degenerated.
</P>
<P>

JAKARTA, October 4 (Xinhua) -- A total of 27 kilograms of
ecstasy materials and several thousand pieces of ecstasy were
confiscated by the Jakarta police during a pre-dawn raid Saturday,
Antara News Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The police detained three people for allegedly producing and
trafficking in the drug, head of the police detective unit Col.
Gories Mere said.
</P>
<P>
The security officers also arrested two girls for allegedly
molding the drug.

"The success is inseparable from the hard work of our men who
continued spying on suspected places for a whole month," said
Gories who led the raid.
</P>

drug.

BEIJING, October 4 (Xinhua) -- An ever increasing number of
Chinese couples are opting to exchange wedding vows on October 1,
China's National Day.
</P>
<P>
Photo shops in downtown Beijing opened for business early on
National Day, with brides arriving early for photo sessions and
then scurrying home to meet their bridegrooms.
</P>
<P>
Car rental agencies and taxi companies enjoyed brisk business,
and the Shuxin Wedding Consultants arranged five weddings on
October 1, or the National Day.
</P>
<P>
Sun Tao, a bridegroom from south Beijing, decorated a rented
Lincoln Continental with three giant flower baskets containing
16 dozen roses which he purchased at 10 times the normal price.
</P>
<P>
Fancy limousines are far cry from the bridal sedan chairs used
throughout China in ancient times. Young Beijingers prefer
Cadillac, Lincoln or Mercedes-Benz sedans which rent for as much
as 5,000 yuan (600 U.S. dollars) for half a day. Some even opt
for a Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
High rental fees for limousines fail to deter young people from
having a stylish wedding.

<HEADLINE> G-24 Developing Countries Urge G-7 Powers to Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) - The G-24 developing countries
Saturday urged the world's industrial powers to ease monetary
policy to restore tranquility to the world financial markets.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued in the wake of their 60th ministerial
meeting, the Intergovernmental Group of 24 On International
Monetary Affairs, which represents 128 developing nations noted,
the financial crises witnessed in the Asian region and Russia have
seriously damaged their development efforts and the severe
consequences of these crises on the world economy have been
compounded by the sharp recession in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the direct contagion effects and spillovers from
market to market and from country to country, a generalized loss
of confidence has resulted in unsustainable pressure on the
exchange rate and the capital and current accounts in many parts
of the world, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
Contemporaneously, financial markets have exhibited volatility
which has resulted in higher interest rate spreads and the sharp
slowing down of private capital flows to developing countries,
leading to significant slowdown in economic activity. The
substantial fall in commodity prices is adding to the
difficulties faced by many countries and to deflationary
pressures on the global economy. Many developing countries have
suffered the loss of income, production and export opportunities,
while industrial countries have begun to feel the effects of the
crises through large decline in stock markets, pressures on their
financial institutions, and lower exports, the document noted.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 ministers called for an easing of monetary conditions
in major industrial nations and urged Japan to adopt a more
expansionary fiscal policy and to take effective action to address
the problems in its troubled banking system.
</P>
<P>
They said easing of monetary policy by major industrial nations
would help restore confidence in international financial markets,
stem outflows of capital from emerging markets and relieve heavy
debt-servicing costs.
</P>
<P>
The participants also expressed their concern that debt
workouts for heavily indebted poor countries (HIPCs) were slow and
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela, threatened by
contagion from the Asian and Russian crises, are members of the
group, which is asking for greater representation in world talks
on reshaping the world financial system.
</P>
<P>
The communique called for a more cautious freeing up capital
movements prescribed by the IMF, saying the pace should depend on
the situation of each country.
</P>
<P>
The Group said developing countries should be able to take
steps to "oversee cross-border exposure of private sector
entities, and to curb excessive speculative activity in their
foreign exchange and equity markets."
</P>
<P>
The developing countries also complained about the recent
increase in interest rates the World Bank charges them, saying the
move was not helpful at a time of financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank decided on July 31 to increase to 75 basis
points from 50 the spread it charges borrowers above funding
costs. It also decided to add a front end fee of 100 basis points.
</P>
<P>
The G-24 meeting is part of the on-going IMF-World Bank joint
annual meeting. China is not member of the G-24, but attended
their discussions as an invitee. The meeting focused on proposals
under discussion by the world's financial leaders on how to
contain financial turmoil and rescue countries in trouble.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Finance Leaders Meet to Head Off Global Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Group of Seven financial
leaders met here on Saturday to find ways to put an end to
mounting global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The high-level meetings of finance ministers and central bank
governors from the G-7 -- the United States, Japan, Germany,
Britain, France, Italy and Canada -- focuses on Japan's economic
revival, regional financial crisis and discuss rescuing proposals,
including a "new mechanism" launched by U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Advance to the G-7 meeting Saturday, financial leaders from
Japan and six other Asian countries -- South Korea, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand -- held a meeting
and agreed take measures to stimulate their economies and welcomed
a 30 billion U.S. dollars aid offer from Tokyo to help the six
nations to overcome the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The White House, which has proposed its own set of ideas to
halt the global crisis, welcomed the Japanese plan but quickly
reiterated its long-standing demands that Tokyo act swiftly and
boldly to put its own economic house in order.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin met his Japanese
counterpart Kiichi Miyazawa just before the G-7 meeting and a U.S.
Treasury official said Rubin welcomed the Japanese plan which
supports the objectives of President Clinton's recent call to
explore ways to promote growth and recovery in crisis countries in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Rubin also said Japan must quickly reform its debt-ridden
banking system. Both ministers reiterated their concern over the
weakness of the Japanese yen currency.
</P>
<P>
The crisis that started in Asia last year has spread to Russia
and is now threatening to engulf Latin America, as frightened
investors stampede out of emerging economies across the globe -- a
phenomenon known as contagion.
</P>
<P>
The G7 is looking at possible remedies ahead of next week's
meetings of the 182-nation International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the World Bank, which will also focus on the deepening crisis.
</P>
<P>
Saying the world financial system was facing its worst crisis
in half a century, Clinton vowed on Friday that Washington would
work with its G-7 and IMF partners to give cash-strapped nations
easier and faster access to fresh capital in times of crisis.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Blair, Chirac on World Financial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday called leaders of Britain and France on the proposal he
put forward Friday on the overhaul of the world's financial
system.
</P>
<P>
Clinton telephoned British Prime Minister Tony Blair and French
President Jacques Chirac, and they favored the U.S. approach, said
White House Spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
Central to the U.S. idea is to use the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to provide more money, faster, to countries threatened
with a flight of panicked investors.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, who helped develop the proposals, sought the
endorsements of finance ministers and central bank governors from
the world's seven richest countries.
</P>
<P>
Top financial officials of the G-7 nations gathered at the
Blair House located near the White House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced on Friday his nation would work with its
partners to forge a "new mechanism" to provide fresh money for
cash-strapped nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
The aim of such a new facility, anchored in the IMF, would be
"to provide contingent finance to help countries ward off global
financial contagion."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Rubin and Greenspan would explore the possibility
with their counterparts from the major industrial Group of Seven
(G-7) nations.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was asking international financial leaders "to
lend quickly so as to help other countries reform their financial
sectors while also helping the most vulnerable citizens."
</P>
<P>
He called on multilateral lenders "to use loan guarantees and
other innovative means to leverage private-sector lending to
emerging markets, and to expand their own lending as much as
possible within their guidelines to countries effected by the
crisis who desperately need an infusion of new cash."
</P>
<P>
The president said Washington had held "constructive" early
discussions with its G-7 partners about the proposal and the G-7
financial leaders will discuss over the weekend about exactly how
that would work.
