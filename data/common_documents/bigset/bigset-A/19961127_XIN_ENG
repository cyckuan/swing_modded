<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Govt Urged to Resolve Civil Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions Secretary General Morgan Tsvangirai today appealed to the
government to come up with a framework which will give a lasting
solution to the problems in the civil service.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai said that by adopting an ''arrogant and
intransigent'' attitude, the government was merely dealing with
symptoms rather than problems facing civil servants.
</P>
<P>
On the current strike by the dismissed junior doctors and
nurses, he said the health delivery system is essential to the
population and, therefore, the government cannot afford to be
arrogant or ignore the needs of this sector.
</P>
<P>
''You cannot treat them (doctors and nurses) like ordinary
laborers,'' he said, ''because you cannot dispense with them. The
strong arm tactics which the government is employing will not
provide us with a lasting solution.''
</P>
<P>
He said he was disappointed by the attitude of the government
which has invited Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions to try to
resolve the impasse between junior doctors and nurses and
negotiation parties.
</P>
<P>
''After it had been agreed that the strikers would return to
work while negotiations continued,'' he said, ''we were surprised
to hear the following day that letters of dismissal had been sent
out.''
</P>
<P>
The government has fired some of the strikers who had been
demanding better working conditions, leaving them with the option
to re-apply if they still wanted their jobs back.

<HEADLINE> Too Little Respect for Law in S. Africa: De Klerk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (xinhua) -- There is too little
respect for authority and for the law in the new South Africa,
the official opposition National Party leader F. W. De Klerk said
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Association of South Africa in Cape
Town, De Klerk said the general lack of discipline and
lawlessness displayed in South African society is "perhaps the
unavoidable result" of earlier policies of the alliance between
the African National Congress, the South African Communist Party
and the Congress of South African Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Examples of these were rent and taxes boycotts and rolling
mass action to realize political objectives, said the opposition
leader.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk also called on all South Africans to join hands in
fighting corruption and increased examples of mismanagement,
misappropriation of funds and, even worse, "cover-ups" popping up
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
"A corrupt society can only head for the abyss," said De
Klerk, adding the rampant crime cost the country 31.1 billion
Rand (about 6.76 billion U.S. Dollars) last year and 20 percent
of businesses no longer invested in the economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Employment
Council for the Transport Operating Industry (Nectoi) is this
year's recipient of the International Conference on AIDS Award
for its outstanding AIDS awareness program in transport sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day seminar for organizations dealing with
AIDS patients today, an advisor with Family Health International,
Evelyn Serima, said Nectoi had been chosen among AIDS control
agencies from three continents for its success in raising
awareness about the deadly disease in Zimbabwe and the southern
African region.
</P>
<P>
''Nectoi has excelled in networking AIDS awareness beyond
Zimbabwe's borders against the background of the vulnerability of
the transport industry to the deadly disease and they have
reached a large number of people,'' said Serima.
</P>
<P>
Organizations that participanted in this year's competition
were drawn from Africa, Asia and Latin America and the Carribean.
</P>
<P>
Nectoi AIDS awareness activities included information
dissemination, educational programs, networking, counseling and
an outreach program which involved training of peer educators who
operated along Zimbabwe's highways at specified points and at
border posts.

<HEADLINE> European Commission Launches Citizen First Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brussels, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Using the theme "Your right
to know and to be heard," the European Commission (EC) today
launched an information campaign to make the single market more
comprehensible and user-friendly for its 370 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
A special ceremony for launching the "Citizen First" campaign
was held at the European Parliament here today. Participating were
EC President Jacques Santer, Single Market Commissioner Mario
Monti, and a host of ministers and parliamentarians.
</P>
<P>
The EC statement said that for the first time, the Commission
was trying to reach everyone living in the EU, so that a maximum
number of people became aware of the rights and opportunities they
enjoyed as a result of the Single Market and other EU policies.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that they could obtain factual information
about how to put these rights into practice.
</P>
<P>
President Santer tackled the criticism that the single market
-- where goods, people, services and capital should have been able
to move freely since January 1, 1999 -- was business-oriented and
ignored the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
It was the Union's top priority to make clear that "the EU is
of direct relevance to the individual citizen," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has argued that ordinary EU citizens do not make
use of the single market because they do not know what it can do
for them..... because it has been badly explained.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will operate through brochures, television spots,
telephone lines and a web site on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It will try to explain to people exactly how they can live,
work and study within the Union, and how they can benefit from
its rules on equal opportunities.

<HEADLINE> Two US Gas, Electricity Giants  Plan Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Duke Power Company, one
of the largest electric utilities in the United States, and the
Panenergy Corporation, one of the biggest natural gas companies
announced Monday that they would merge to create a huge network to
market natural gas and electricity.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which is said to be valued at 7.7 billion u.s.
dollars stock swap, would combine fast-growing marketing
subsidiaries from the two companies with the goal of providing
customers with one-stop shopping for all their power needs.
</P>
<P>
The merger is possible as states open their utility markets to
competition.
</P>
<P>
Customers' ability to bypass their local utilities and buy
directly from a marketer has grown rapidly in natural gas, but is
only beginning with electricity, according to a report of the New
York Times today.
</P>
<P>
"The model that has been developed in the gas industry in the
last decade will be the model for the electric industry," the
report said, quoting Richard B. Priority, President and chief
operating chief of Duke.

<HEADLINE> French Supreme Court Declares Complaint by Carlos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Criminal Chamber of the
Supreme Court of Appeal of France today declared as definitely
closed a complaint by international terrorist Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, or Carlos, against the French government for "kidnapping"
and "illegal confinement."
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the court presided by Judge Christian Le
Gunehec, annulled an earlier decision on June 10 by the Paris
Court of Appeal ordering an investigation judge, Jean-Paul Valat,
to examine the complaint.
</P>
<P>
Valat refused the order on the ground that all procedures taken
by the government from the arrest of Carlos to his confinement
were legal.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of Appeal confirmed the conclusion by Valat
and said that there was no room for examining the complaint by
Carlos, arrested by French agents in Sudan in August 1994.
</P>
<P>
Carlos said that he was arrested in a hotel in Khartoum by
Sudanese police, and was brought to France on a French military
aircraft on August 16, 1994. Only when he arrived in the
Villacoublay military airport in Paris was he shown an
international arrest mandate signed on June 7, 1994, said Carlos
in his complaint.
</P>
<P>
Carlos, active in urban guerrilla movements in Latin America
and Europe in 1960s and 1970s, was accused of launching several
terrorist attacks in France.

JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Cardoso arrived in South Africa today for a four-day
state visit to promote ties with the host country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after their brief talks in Pretoria,
President Nelson Mandela said South Africa has much to learn from
Brazil, which is the world's fifth largest country with the
eighth largest economy.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also endorsed a declaration in which the
two countries undertook to explore opportunities for cooperation
in economic and commercial matters.
</P>
<P>
South Africa and Brazil are both countries with strong
economies, situated in regions where cooperation between
themselves and the rest of the world is essential, said the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Mandela and Cardoso were culminated in the
signing of three agreements between the two countries with regard
to cultural matters, air services and the curtailment of narcotic
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
During earlier bilateral talks, Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo
said the agreements between the two countries will be enhanced by

<HEADLINE> EU Exports to South America up 18.4% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union exports to
South America soared by 18.4 percent last year while imports rose
by only 5.6 percent, says Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.
</P>
<P>
The report did not include figures for Sweden, Austria and
Finland, the EU's three new member states.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the huge EU trade deficit with South
Africa of 11.1 billion ECUs (one ECU equals about 1.3 U.S.dollars)
in 1990 had diminished to 300 million ECUs by last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said that since 1990, EU imports had grown by an
annual average of 2.4 percent, strongly outpaced by a 19 percent
yearly growth of exports.
</P>
<P>
This compared with the annual growth of total external EU trade
of 4.4 percent for imports and seven percent for exports.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat pointed out that the improvement was due almost
entirely to trade with the Mercosur countries - Brazil, Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay. In 1995 the EU had a trade balance of 1.2
billion ECUs with this group.
</P>
<P>
But deficits of 0.74 billion ECUs and 0.81 billion ECUs were
recorded with the Andean group (Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru
and Bolivia) and Chile respectively.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that largest surplus with the region as
a whole was 3.2 billion ECUs earned with road vehicles. This
compared with only 0.22 billion ECUs in 1990. the largest deficit
was the 2.3 billion ECUs spent on animal feed.
</P>
<P>
Trade with South America in 1995 accounted for about four
percent of the Union's external trade: 23.4 billion ECUs in imports
and 23.1 billion ECUs in exports.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Accuses SADC of Feet Dragging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) today rapped the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) for "persistently" frustrating
attempts to hold a joint summit on the future of the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency, COMESA
Secretary-General Gingu Wa Mutharika said the SADC secretariat,
headed by Executive Secretary Kaire Mbuende, is using delaying
tactics for the meeting to discuss whether the two organizations
should merge or that their functions be rationalized to avoid
duplication.
</P>
<P>
A SADC/COMESA ministerial meeting held in Harare in August
had, however, agreed that the two should co-exist, but said a
joint summit of heads of state and government should be held to
ratify the decision.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika was particularly scathing of Mbuende, saying he
wondered "whose interests he is serving when he persistently
refuses to meet with us to discuss the future role of the two
organizations".
</P>
<P>
He said what worried the COMESA was the decision by the SADC
to ask for further studies before a summit could be held, and the
SADC's insistence that further consultations at ministerial level
be held.
</P>
<P>
At present, 10 of the 12 SADC member states belong to the
COMESA, which groups 23 countries in eastern, central and
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and South Africa, the region's two most powerful
economies, have refused to ratify the COMESA treaty until the
dual membership of countries to both economic blocs has been
solved.
</P>
<P>
The COMESA wants to create a free trade area which it says
will benefit over 300 million people, while the SADC is pursuing
its own agenda to forge regional integration among the 12 member
states.

JOHANNESBURG, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The first group of South
African farmers to resettle in neighboring Mozambique's northern
Niassa province have arrived in the area, the South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The 14 white farmers will settle on a government farm near the
provincial capital of Lichinga to produce seed for other South
African farmers due to be in Mozambique next May.
</P>
<P>
The move follows an agreement signed in mid-1996 by Mozambican
President Joaquim Chissano and South African head of state Nelson
Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, land used by the South Africans will remain
the property of the Mozambican government, while its control will
be vested in a joint company, MOSAGRUIS.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Agricultural Development of South Africa,
sponsors of the project, said the farmers have been promised
getting support from the Mozambican people.
</P>
<P>
The scheme aims to improve Mozambique's agricultural
development potential after 17 years of civil war.

<HEADLINE> Greece Braces for A Wave of Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Greek government is facing
this week a series of strikes over its tough economic policies,
culminating in a 24-hour general strike on Thursday by both
private and public sector unions.
</P>
<P>
"There is will for an escalation of labour action", the
president of the General Confederation of Greek workers (GSEE)
warned today.
</P>
<P>
Due to the planned general strike action, public utilities such
as the public power corporation, the Hellenic Telecommunications
Organization (OTE), the Athens and Piraeus Water Company (EYDAP)
and the Greek Postal Service (ELTA) will be operating with
skeleton staffs on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The strike is expected to hit public transport in particular,
with the national carrier Olympic airways aircraft being grounded
and considerable disruption to ferry-boat, train and bus services.
</P>
<P>
The country's ships' pilots went on strike Monday to press
their demand for an additional pay allowance based on length of
service to be paid out of the seamen's pension fund.
</P>
<P>
Secondary school and kindergarten teachers will hold a 24-hour
strike Wednesday to protest a new salary scale and propose
government spending on education.
</P>
<P>
The administrative board of the union of public secondary
school teachers also warned of the possibility of a two or
three days strike in December and an indefinite work stoppage in
January.
</P>
<P>
One of the main demands of the unions is that the government
index-link tax brackets to inflation.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Develop New Method to Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
discovered a new method to test hormonal activity, according to a
report of the upcoming issue of Endocrine published by Israel's
Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The report said that from pregnancy to potency, hormones are
involved in regulating basic body functions and it is,
therefore, often crucial to know whether these essential
substances, which may be present in extremely low concentration,
are performing properly.
</P>
<P>
Commonly used diagnostic tests measure only hormone levels,
not activity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To evaluate hormonal function, it is necessary to determine
whether the hormone can bind to specific receptors on target
cells, and whether this binding causes the cells to produce
certain substances.
</P>
<P>
Such testing is complicated because the natural target cells
are usually short-lived and have relatively few appropriate
receptors.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Abraham Amsterdam and his colleagues in the Molecular
Cell Biology Department have overcome this difficulty by
genetically engineering "immortal" ovarian cells, which reproduce
endlessly in laboratory conditions, and equipping them with large
numbers of suitable receptors. These cells were used to test the
biological activity of gonadotropin hormones which were involved
in regulating ovulation, sperm maturation and sexual development.
</P>
<P>
Three major indicators were successfully assessed: binding to
cells, production of a vital chemical messenger called cyclic
AMP, and the resultant release of progesterone, a product of
ovarian cells that is essential for maintaining uninterrupted
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have also adapted their new method for testing
the activity of catecholamines, a group of hormones that
includes adrenalin, which regulates heart beat and blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Medical diagnosis is not the only potential application of
the new test, which also holds promise for use in a variety of
fields, including the hormonal testing required for animal
breeding.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Celebrates Water Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Penh, November 26 (Xinhua)-- As Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk and Queen Monineath Sihanouk granted gifts this afternoon
at the closing ceremony of the three-day boat races, Cambodia's
traditional Water Festival, Bon Om Tuk in Khmers, reached its
climax.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 teams of oarsmen and oarswomen have competed in
the races on the Tonle Sap river to celebrate the grand Water
Festival.
</P>
<P>
Boat racing and a procession of illuminated floats, very
popular to Cambodians, were the major features of the Water
Festival, which falls in the 12th month of lunar calendar or late
October and early November.
</P>
<P>
The over 300 teams, from government departments and municipal
establishments in Phnom Penh or selected by provinces from local
competitions, raced in pairs over a 1,700-meter stretch of the
river from November 24 - 26.
</P>
<P>
The Water Festival is believed to be an indicator for the end
of the rainy season of the year and the beginning of the fishing
season.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodians believe that the ceremonies of the Water
Festival are expressions of thanks to the water and land for their
favors toward human beings.

ATHENS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 120 sheep have been
destroyed after an outbreak of variola was discovered in several
areas near the banks of the river Nestos in northern Greece.
</P>
<P>
According to the veterinary department in the area, the most
likely cause of the outbreak was the transmission of the disease
from flocks at Dasochori, Xanthi on the other side of the Nestos,
where variola was reported last week.
</P>
<P>
A disinfection operation is already under way while all animals
in the area have been isolated and their transportation

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Develop New Method to Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists have
discovered a new method to test hormonal activity, according to a
report of the upcoming issue of Endocrine published by Israel's
Weizmann Institute of Science.
</P>
<P>
The report said that from pregnancy to potency, hormones are
involved in regulating basic body functions and it is,
therefore, often crucial to know whether these essential
substances, which may be present in extremely low concentration,
are performing properly.
</P>
<P>
Commonly used diagnostic tests measure only hormone levels,
not activity, the report said.
</P>
<P>
To evaluate hormonal function, it is necessary to determine
whether the hormone can bind to specific receptors on target
cells, and whether this binding causes the cells to produce
certain substances.
</P>
<P>
Such testing is complicated because the natural target cells
are usually short-lived and have relatively few appropriate
receptors.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Abraham Amsterdam and his colleagues in the Molecular
Cell Biology Department have overcome this difficulty by
genetically engineering "immortal" ovarian cells, which reproduce
endlessly in laboratory conditions, and equipping them with large
numbers of suitable receptors. These cells were used to test the
biological activity of gonadotropin hormones which were involved
in regulating ovulation, sperm maturation and sexual development.
</P>
<P>
Three major indicators were successfully assessed: binding to
cells, production of a vital chemical messenger called cyclic
AMP, and the resultant release of progesterone, a product of
ovarian cells that is essential for maintaining uninterrupted
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have also adapted their new method for testing
the activity of catecholamines, a group of hormones that
includes adrenalin, which regulates heart beat and blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Medical diagnosis is not the only potential application of
the new test, which also holds promise for use in a variety of
fields, including the hormonal testing required for animal
breeding.

<HEADLINE> Studies: Gulf War Veterans More to Suffer from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Two new government studies
show for the first time that veterans of the 1991 Gulf War are far
more likely to suffer from health problems than troops who did not
serve in the war.
</P>
<P>
The studies, one conducted by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, the other by the Navy, show that Gulf War veterans
are having health problems in unusual numbers and that their
illnesses can be disabling, even though they do not necessarily
result in hospital admissions or death, The New York Times said
today.
</P>
<P>
The study by the centers on the health of some 4,000 military
personnel found that troops deployed to the Gulf were more than
three times as likely as troops who were elsewhere to suffer from
chronic diarrhea, joint pain, skin rashes, fatigue, depression and
memory loss.
</P>
<P>
Also it found that that the Gulf War veterans have far higher
rates of headaches, sinus problems and sleep disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Navy study of about 1,500 sailors found that there
is a similar difference in the health complaints of those who had
served in the Gulf War, compared with those who had not, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The studies, which are expected to be published early next
year, said that whatever the specific cause of the mysterious
ailments, the troops deployment to the Gulf was somehow
responsible for their health complaints.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon requested 80,000 of the war veterans to have
special government medical examinations to determine if they are
suffering from health problems related to their service.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Pentagon revealed that thousands of U.S. troops
might be exposed to nerve gas and other chemical weapons when the
U.S. troops exploded some Iraqi weapons dumps soon after the Gulf
War in March 1991.
</P>
<P>
As some scientists suggest that chemicals may explain some of
the illnesses, other researchers suspect that the ailments may be
the result of immunizations given to American troops during the
war or that they were made ill by the smoke from oil well fires in
Kuwait. Also some suspect that the soldiers are suffering from an
infectious agent present in the Gulf region, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department and the Department of Veterans Affairs
published their studies earlier November, which showed that the
Gulf War veterans were not dying or being hospitalized at unusual
rates, at least through September 1993.

<HEADLINE> Low Jobless Rate Won't Fuel Inflation, US Economists Say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Many U.S. corporate
economists have decided that low unemployment rate would not
necessarily result in higher inflation, according to The Wall
Street Journal today.
</P>
<P>
In a recent survey by the U.S. National Association of Business
Economists, more 80 percent of forecasters said that the so-called
nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment had fallen in the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
Until recently, most analysts had estimated that a sustained
jobless rate between 6 percent and 7 percent would lead to sharp
price increases, thus resulting in higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
But most of U.S. business economists now believe that the
unemployment rate can rest between 4.5 percent and 5.5 percent
without fueling inflation, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
To support their view, they cited it as example that the
current unemployment rate in the U.S. is at 5.2 percent, near a
seven-year low, while the inflation rate in the nation is also at
the low level.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the apparent easing of the old trade-off between
between the full employment and inflation, the business economists
maintained a rosy economic outlook for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In a report released on Monday by the National Association of
Business Economists, the consensus of 44 economists showed that
the U.S. economy will grow at a pace of 2.3 percent in 1997 and
average 2.5 percent growth over the next five years.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Signs Lost in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Many traffic signs are either
damaged or stolen in Turkey, a country where traffic accidents
leave many dead or injured every year, local newspaper Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The traffic signs were damaged extensively in eastern and
southeastern Turkey, costing the authority over 2 million
U.S. dollars every year, the paper quoted Turkey's Highway
Authority as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cevdet Daglar, director of the 11th region of highways, said
that they were responsible for a total of 2,691 kilometers of
highways in the provinces of Van, Hakkari, Mus, Bitlis, Agri and
Sirnak. He added that 2,633 traffic signs in the region
"mysteriously" disappeared and 4,633 were damaged last year.
</P>
<P>
"The stolen traffic signs are used for decoration on tractors
and trucks as well as construction materials in some villages and
hamlets. Some of them are also used as trays in village
coffeehouses or as a pan for cooking bread," the director said.
</P>
<P>
The Highway Authority was expected to organize training
courses in order to prevent people from damaging or stealing
traffic signs.

<HEADLINE> WHO: About Six Million Blinded by Trachoma Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- About six million people have
been blinded by trachoma worldwide, said the World Health
Organization (WHO) in its press release here today.
</P>
<P>
Besides the six million people who are largely irreversibly
blinded, WHO said, there are an estimated 146 million cases of
active disease in need of treatment if blindness is to be
prevented.
</P>
<P>
To work for the global elimination of trachoma which is
responsible for at least 15 percent of the world's blindness, WHO
and a number of international nongovernmental development
organizations had a meeting in Geneva from November 25 to 26.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, trachoma is one of the oldest infectious
diseases. It is associated with poor socioeconomic conditions in
general: with overcrowding, poor personal and environmental
hygiene and, in particular, with very limited access to water and
sanitation. Trachoma has been eliminated as a blinding disease
from several previously hyperendemic countries and regions, both
through significant improvements in the socioeconomic status of
populations and through specific control efforts.
</P>
<P>
WHO said that the disease is at present found mainly in poor
rural areas, including parts of central and south America, most
African countries and some countries in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Trachoma is still endemic in several Asian countries, it said, but
there is no updated information from some major countries.

<HEADLINE> Spy Cases Affect Egyptian-Israeli Ties: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The recent spy cases between
Egypt and Israel can negatively affect the bid to build trust
between the two countries, which signed a peace treaty in 1979,
Egyptian diplomatic sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the spies operating under a cloak of
trade and investment cooperation shake the credibility of
regional cooperation between the Jewish state and Arab countries,
the Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, brushing aside Israeli protests, has remanded in
custody for 45 days Azam Azam, a 35-year-old Israeli Arab who was
arrested on November 6 on charges of spying for Israeli Mossad
intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
Emad Abdel-Hamid, an Egyptian who allegedly provided Azam with
information, was ordered to be held for an equal period on
similar charges.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the natural development of peaceful relations
is supposed to lead to expansive transparency and openness, which
reduce any need for espionage.
</P>
<P>
Communication can be done through official channels to trade
information about issues of mutual interest, they noted,
referring to the possible swap of data during military
manoeuvres.
</P>
<P>
Azam's arrest has added to the tension in Egyptian-Israeli
relations.
</P>
<P>
The two suspects were arrested shortly before the opening of
the Middle East and North America economic conference here on
November 12, prompting Israeli commentators to suggest that the
arrests were designed to undermine Israel's position at the
gathering.
</P>
<P>
The allegation was strongly denied by Egypt.

<HEADLINE> China to Support Comprehensive Strengthening of BWC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Chinese delegation
Sha Zukang expounded China's stand on the Biological Weapons
Convention at the fourth review conference here today.
</P>
<P>
After reviewing what had been done since the last review
conference of the Convention in 1991, Sha said that China is in
favor of a comprehensive strengthening of the effectiveness of the
Convention, including the setting up of an appropriate and
feasible verification mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"By comprehensive strengthening we mean that all aspects of the
Convention must be taken into consideration, rather than over
emphasizing certain aspects to the neglect of the others. This is
the only approach to facilitate the comprehensive compliance with
the Convention," he explained.
</P>
<P>
"As for the verification regime for the Convention, we hold
that it can only be set up in light of the specific features of
biological weapons," he pointed out, adding "bio-technology has an
extremely wide application in the civil fields of industry,
agriculture, health and medicine and food processing, which
differs drastically from technologies for nuclear and chemical
weapons."
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, certain existing verification mechanisms, for
instance those from the CWC (Chemical Weapons Convention) or CTBT
(Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty), are not quite suited or hardly
applicable for the verification of biological weapons," Sha
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said, "if the BW (Biological Weapons) verification is too
wide, it would not only generate an excessive burden for the
states parties, but also inevitably interfere with the peaceful
uses of bio-technologies and even harm the legitimate commercial
confidentiality." On the other hand, he added, "if the scope is
too narrow, the effectiveness of the verification regime would be
compromised."
</P>
<P>
Sha suggested that the first step the ad hoc group established
at the 1994 Special Conference should take is "to formulate a set
of definitions and objective criterion for the purpose of
verification and then proceed to setting up in a scientific manner
verification measures that are fair, reasonable and feasible, so
as to serve the objective of truly strengthening the Convention".
</P>
<P>
Sha said that the 138 states parties to the Convention accounts
for just more than two thirds of the UN member states and those
submit relevant materials and reports in accordance with the
requirement of the last review conferences and relevant
resolutions of the UN General Assembly make up less than half of
the states parties. Thus China called for more countries to accede
to the Convention and participate in the relevant activities. He
hoped that this conference can come up with some effective
measures following extensive discussions on this matter so as to
enhanced the universality of the convention.
</P>
<P>
Sha reaffirmed, "the Chinese government has, proceeding from
its independent foreign policy of peace, all along stood against
arms race and for genuine disarmament, for the complete
prohibition and thorough destruction of all weapons of mass
destruction such as nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. The
Chinese government gives full confirmation to the active role of
the Convention, always supports the purposes and objectives of the
Convention, and faithfully fulfills its obligations assumed as a
state party."
</P>
<P>
Sha said, "China does not develop, produce, stockpile or
otherwise acquire or retain biological agents, toxins, weapons,
equipment or means of delivery prohibited under Article I of the
Convention." He told the conference, "China has always been
against the proliferation of biological weapons and related
technology. China has never in any way encouraged, assisted or
induced any state, group of states or international organization
to conduct activities prohibited under the Convention."
</P>
<P>
"Peace and development are the two major themes in the present
world, and they supplement each other," said Sha, "we are of the
view that the prohibition of biological weapons should not run
counter to the promotion of the development of peaceful biological
technology and the normal international exchange in this field."
</P>
<P>
Sha said, "China is in favor of the opinion voiced by a large
number of developing countries for enhancing the technological
cooperation and international exchange in the field of biology. We
maintain that any mechanism that runs counter to the purposes and
objectives of the Convention should be dismantled, and call on
relevant countries, while emphasizing non-proliferation of
biological weapons, to adopt the same positive attitude towards
exchanges and cooperation for peaceful purposes in the biological
field, so as to encourage and attract more countries to accede to
the Convention, thereby enhancing its universality."

<HEADLINE> UK Farmers Urge Immediate Cull of Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British farming leaders put
strong pressure on the government Monday by demanding an immediate
start to a cull of up to 147,000 cattle to persuade the European
Union (EU) to lift its export ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of the major UK farming unions issued a
statement at the Royal Smithfield farming show in London, saying
that they considered it essential that the selective cull went
ahead forthwith to restore the export trade in beef and beef
products.
</P>
<P>
They criticized lack of action by the government to implement
an agreement made by Prime Minister John Major at June's EU summit
in Florence to cull cattle deemed most at risk of harboring mad
cow disease as a precondition for any easing of the worldwide ban.
</P>
<P>
"We made an agreement as a nation and we know Europe will not
lift the ban unless we implement all of that agreement," said
David Naish, president of the National Farmers' Union of England
and Wales, the biggest UK farmers' union.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Naish admitted that the National Farmers' Union had
performed a U-turn over the cull, which it strongly opposed in the
spring. "I'm not a bit ashamed of it," he said, adding that a cull
was the only way of persuading EU member states to ease the
eight-months ban.
</P>
<P>
Meeting a farmers' delegation in private at the show, Douglas
Hogg, the Agriculture Minister, defended the government's
performance over the mad cow problem.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Hogg said that he recognized the need to make
a decision on a selective cull "soon", hinting that there might be
an announcement before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Hopes to Increase Oil Quota If OPEC Raises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait wanted to increase
its oil production quota if the Organization of Oil Exporting
Countries (OPEC) raises its current production ceiling, Kuwaiti
Oil Minister Eisa Al-Mazidi said here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks before flying to Vienna to attend
Wednesday's Ministerial meeting of the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is a fair demand considering Kuwait's
present production capacity, which stands at 2.5 million barrels
per day (bpd).
</P>
<P>
Kuwait currently produces 2 million bpd, the limit set by the
OPEC.
</P>
<P>
With a proven crude oil reserves of 100 billion barrels,
Kuwait plans to raise its oil production capacity to around 3
million bpd by the year 2000 from the current 2.5 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
The OPEC member countries currently produce an estimated
25.033 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Kuwaiti government has been unsuccessful in its
calls for a higher quota.

</P>
<P>
Canadian investors poured a net 950 million U.S. dollars into
foreign stocks in September, bring the 1996 tally to 7.3 billion

</P>
<P>
At current rate, Canadians will have invested 3.7 billion

Canada.
</P>
<P>
Canadians aren't abandoning their own stock markets, which have

their portfolios, economists said.
</P>
<P>
Yet, foreigners aren't showing the same enthusiasm for Canadian
markets, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
In September, foreign investors sold a net 90 million dollars

"Actually, it's good news" that Canadians are investing a lot
more abroad than foreigners are investing in Canada, some

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Implementation of Iraq-UN Oil Deal In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A festive mood prevailed the
capital of Baghdad Tuesday as Iraqis learnt their government has
cleared the way for the long-waited implementation of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced Monday its acceptance of all conditions set by
the U.N. to the deal which was signed between the two sides last
May, saying it is fully prepared for the implementation of the
deal.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy because we have been waiting for more than six
years for our oil to flow to the world market again," said a
delighted oil man. "Although we will not get much from the oil
export but it's better than nothing," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning the Iraqi dinar surged sharply to 950
against the U.S. dollar which traded 1,650 to the dollar the
previous day.
</P>
<P>
The oil price in the world market also slumped which will see a
further drop when Iraq's limited oil export is expected to start
next month.
</P>
<P>
The optimism over an imminent return of Iraqi oil to the world
market since the U.N. imposed sweeping sanctions on the country
after its August 1990 invasion of Kuwait dominated today's local
media. The local press gives prominence on the encouraging news in
banner headlines.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Al-Jumhuriyah daily said that the oil-for-food deal is
on its way toward a quick implementation as Washington has
expressed its satisfaction with the issue.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Madeleine Albright
as saying that Washington is pleased with the development in the
implementation of the oil deal and the U.S. will react positively
concerning the issue of oil pricing mechanism.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a U.N. team will arrive in Iraq soon to
review the preparation of the limited oil export under the oil
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Facing the deteriorating internal situation, the Iraqi
government agreed in February to enter dialog with the United
Nations on the U.S.-pioneered U.N. resolution 986 adopted nearly
one year before.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution allows Iraq to sell 2 billion dollars of
oil every six months in exchange of badly needed foodstuff,
medicine and other humanitarian items for its suffering population.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has exerted enormous efforts in preparation for the oil
export since the signing with the U.N. of the oil-for-food deal in
May after four-months of hard negotiations between the two side.
</P>
<P>
The deal had been expected to start in mid September but was
postponed after Iraq sent its troops in late August to the
Kurdish-inhabited northern area to help one of the two rival
Kurdish factions fight against the other.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the postponement of the deal was that Iraq
insisted on restricting the number of observers to monitor the
program.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad paid a heavy price for its military action which
sparked two waves of U.S. missile attacks against its southern air
defense systems in early September.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the signing of the agreement Iraq has repeatedly
accused Washington of hindering the implementation of the
oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
But Washington's stiff stance toward Baghdad's strong desire
for a swift implementation of the oil deal seems to have softened
and the only obstacle of oil pricing issue in the way is easier
to be removed, observers here noted.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Warns Arafat Against Resorting to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today sternly warned Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat against resorting to violence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before a tour to the Ariel and Eli
settlements in the West Bank, Netanyahu once again indirectly
placed blame on Arafat for delaying a deal on Israeli troop
redeployment in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The hardline leader also accused Arafat of threatening Israel
with violence, in an apparent reference to the incident two days
ago, in which Palestinian drivers blocked the road leading to the
Netzarim Jewish settlement in Gaza. Israel claimed that the
incident was a provocation organized by Arafat in order to exert
pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I think that they (Palestinians) should reconsider it very
carefully because if we want to build the climate of trust in
the movement toward peace, threats and threats of violence is
(are) not the way to go," Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Because of the protracted deadlock in Hebron talks, Israeli
officials fear that Arafat could resort to violence again in
order to press Israel to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu vowed that Israel would not tolerate the September
bloodshed between Israelis and Palestinians to happen again.
Fifteen Israeli soldiers were killed in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
On the inconclusive talks on Hebron redeployment, Netanyahu
said Israel had offered a number of ways to conclude the
negotiations but failed because the Palestinian side resorted to
the tactics of delaying and threatening.
</P>
<P>
"We are not impressed by the threats, but we are impressed by
the fact that they don't want to conclude the negotiations. It's
up to them. We are prepared to do if they are prepared to do,"
Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of settlement expansion, Netanyahu promised that
the growth of settlements would continue. He defended his
position by saying that the Jewish communities had the same right
to thrive as the Arab communities.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Palestinians and "some Israelis" to learn the
idea of how to live together in peace. "The sooner the
Palestinians will (understand this), the sooner we will have
peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
The settlement issue is one of the explosive disputes between
the two sides. The Netanyahu government lifted in August a
freeze imposed by the previous Labor government on expanding the
settlements, and has already approved plans for building
thousands of new houses in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian residents have been strongly denouncing the
settlement expansion at the expense of their lands, warning it
could lead to violence which would torpedo the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Has No Confidence in International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Minister for
Rehabilitation and Social Integration of Rwanda, Parick Mazimhaka
today said Rwanda has no confidence in the Internatinal Criminal
Tribunal for that country in Arusha, northern Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka noted that the world should also not expect justice
from it.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandese minister, who is also a specil envoy of Rwandese
President Pasteur Bizimungu in Tanzania, handed a special message
to President Benjamin Mkapa from the Rwandese president in Dar es
Salaam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here today, Mazimhaka said, "the
tribunal on the genocide suspects for Rwanda is just meaningless.
This is basically a trick to wash the conscience of the
international community." "Don't expect justice from it," he told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandese minister explained that the best justice would
have been lining up the suspects of the 1994 Rwanda genocide in
his country and not elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
"That is what we insisted on from the beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that even the tribunal for Bosnia based in the Hague,
the Netherlands, was not efficient.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka argued that the slow pace of execution of cases in
the Hague tribuanal served to expalain that genocide tribunals
could only be successful in the affected country.
</P>
<P>
On resettling Rwandese refugees, the minister said that the
Rwandese government planned to spend about 500 million U.S.
Dollars to rehabilitate its refugees from neighbouring countries.
</P>
<P>
"That is the estimated amount for putting up temporary and
permanent structures for the returnees," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mazimhaka said that the majority of refugees were still
adamant to return home because of physical and psychological
intimidation by some leaders of the refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
"Actually it would be more proper to call these Rwandese
hostages than refugees because they are held against their will,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandese minister also explained that some refugees were
still reluctant to return home because they were known criminals.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes Iraq's Acceptance of Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The British government welcomed
today Iraq's acceptance of the oil-for-food deal with the United
Nations but expressed regret over the unnecessary suffering to the
Iraqi people by caused Baghdad's delay.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement today
that the British government was "pleased that Iraq has finally
agreed to the implementation of (the U.N.) Security Council
Resolution 986, as we long urged."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Iraq's U.N. ambassador announced on Monday
that the Iraqi government officially accepted the terms of the
oil-for-food deal, which would allow Iraq to sell oil in
international markets for the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
The delay by the Iraqi government in accepting the deal "has
caused much unnecessary suffering to the Iraqi people, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation will bring them some relief, but they will
sadly not enjoy a normal life until Iraq fulfills its obligations
under the relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions," he added.

<HEADLINE> Greek, Turkish Cypriots Hold Military Dialog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official confirmed
here today that the U.N.-proposed military dialog between the
Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus is underway and an
agreement is expected soon.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with President Glafcos Clerides,
U.N. resident representative Gustave Feissel said "the two
sides have now agreed to deal with the entire package of
measures which the U.N. suggested."
</P>
<P>
He said this package includes establishment of unmanning areas,
no loaded weapons along the cease-fire lines and the code of
conduct for the military along the cease-fire lines.
</P>
<P>
"All these three things are now being discussed and we are
getting into the technical nitty gritty and hopefully we will be
able to move things along rather quickly," Feissel said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether results could be expected by the end of the
year, the U.N. official said he could not give a specific date
but stressed that "it should not drag on."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. proposed the military dialog between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriots in an effort to reduce tension along the
180-kilometer-long buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Since last June, four unarmed Greek Cypriots have been killed
and a Turkish soldier was mysteriously murdered in the buffer
zone.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on his meeting with President Clerides, Feissel
said "we had a good opportunity to review the situation before
December."
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place before a visit to Nicosia by Han Sung
Joo, U.N. Secretary General Botrous Botrous-Ghali's special
representative for Cyprus, on December 10-11.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and seized the northern third of the island following an
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece. A self-claimed
republic was set up in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Disarms 1,500 Liberian Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- About 1,500 of Liberia's
estimated 60,000 factional fighters have turned in their weapons
since a massive disarmamemt program began in the war-torn country
four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the "successful commencement of the disarmament
exercise throughout Liberia, particularly in Monrovia,"
Major-General Victor Malu of the West African Peacekeeping Force,
known as ECOMOG, has decided to ease the curfew by three hours in
the capital, according to a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The change in the curfew, which now runs from 10:00 p.m. to
6:00 a.m. (22:00 to 6:00 gmt) was "particularly aimed at
providing opportunities for fighters in Monrovia and its
environs, who might be feeling reluctant to hand over their
weapons in daytime for fear of intimidation or reaction by
members of the public, to do so during the night hours," Malu
said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered disarmament sites in and around
Monrovia to stay open till later in the evening to accomodate
fighters wishing to hand in weapons after dark, which falls
around evening.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Liberians are cautiously optimistic
about the latest disarmament operation, falteringly launched
across much of the country last Friday as part of a peace plan to
end the more than 6-year-old civil war in the country, which
killed at least 150,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement, signed by Liberia's warlords last
August in Nigeria, disarmament and demobilization of the 60,000
combatants and repatriation of the displaced and refugees will be
carried out between November 22 this year to January 31, 1997.
Election is scheduled for May next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel today described its
acts of violations against the Oslo agreements as "isolated and
unintentional," reported Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Major General Oren Shahor, Israeli government coordinator in
charge of the affairs in the Palestinian territories, made the
argument when he was presenting a Palestinian document before the
Knesset (parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
The document, handed over by the Palestinian chief negotiator,
 Saeb Erekat, in the joint Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee
 in September, listed 34 violations by Israel of the interim
agreements signed by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
These violations include the failure of redeployment from
Hebron, refusal to release Palestinian women prisoners, continued
closure on Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
Shahor explained that security considerations had prevented
implementation of the agreements. He also placed blames on what
he called threats of Palestinian violence.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian charges of Israel's deliberately delayed
troop withdrawal from Hebron, Shahor said Israel also holds that
the redeployment is overdue, implying that it is the fault of the
Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has repeatedly declared
Israel's commitment to the peace process with the Palestinians,
while, at the same time, accusing the Palestinian Authority of
violating the agreements.

<P>
KAMPALA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, in a press release here today, dismissed as "
erroneous and incorrect" a latest "East African " report which
says ''Uganda backs Burundi on lifting of blockade.''
</P>
<P>
The press release said the "East African" story has
mispresented the view of Uganda's First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs eriya kategaya. The story said that
at the meeting between Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya last Friday, it was decided
that President Museveni would advise other regional leaders to
suspend sanctions against Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It is true that Buyoya complained that contrary to what the
regional leaders had recommended at their last Arusha meeting,
humanitarian items like medicine and fertilisers are still not
being allowed into Burundi and this had caused a lot of suffering
to innocent people in Burundi, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The press release said, President Museveni's response at the
meeting was that humanitarian items like medicines and
fertilisers are not subject to the sanctions and he would again
recommend that they be allowed to enter Burundi.
</P>
<P>
It is absolutely not true to say as the story put it, that
Museveni made an undertaking at the meeting to press for the
suspension of sanctions against Burundi, it added.
</P>
<P>
The press release said that such an undertaking remains the
prerogative of all the regional leaders in accordance with
decisions taken on this matter at the Arusha summit.

<P>
Johannesburg, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The widow of slain Swedish
Prime Minister Olof Palme today expressed her satisfaction with South
Africa's role in unearthing the truth about her husband's
assassination in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting Safety and Security Minister
Sydney Mufamadi in Pretoria, Lisbet Palme said she was very satisfied
that Swedish investigators were receiving good support from South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Olof Palme, an active anti-apartheid campaigner, was gunned down in
a Stockholm street in 1986. His assassin was never captured.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mufamadi said South Africa had done much to expedite
investigations after claims that the country's former security
services had been involved in Palme's murder.
</P>
<P>
In October, South Africa's former intelligence officer Eugene De
Kock claimed that former security police spy Craig Williamson had been
involved in Palme's assassination.
</P>
<P>
A Swedish investigation team arrived in South Africa last month to
investigate allegations that its former security forces were behind
Palme's murder.
</P>
<P>
The team met Mufamadi, Justice Minister Dullah Omar and other
interested parties during its investigations, but found there was no
" South African connection" to the murder.
</P>
<P>
Lisbet met Mufamadi to deliver a report on a recent international
congress on commercial sexual exploitation of children. She was
scheduled to leave for Namibia on Wednesday. enditem

In a statement upon his arrival here on a visit to Syria, Farsi

On the prospects of an Israeli aggression against Syria, the

service. So far, he said, Israel is denying such intention.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Stresses Need for Sending Force to Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- France today reiterated the need
for the deployment of a multinational force in eastern Zaire until
international humanitarian groups can operate freely in the region.
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jacques Rummelhardt,
refused to comment on a Canadian proposal for air dropping aid
materials to Rwandan refugees stuck in eastern Zaire, saying only
that Paris "has taken note of the new proposals."
</P>
<P>
"It is self-evident that the views of the humanitarian
organizations should be respected. The absolute priority for
France is that the aid reaches, as well and as rapidly as
possible, all the people who need it, and the sending of food be
done in the best way," said Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
He said although some humanitarian groups had begun to return
to the Kivu region in eastern Zaire, the United Nations Security
Council Resolution 1080 should be applied as long as the
humanitarian operations could not be carried out freely there.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution calls for the sending of a multinational
force to Zaire.
</P>
<P>
However, the massive return of Rwandan refugees over the past
week has put the necessity for the dispatch of such a force into
question.

<HEADLINE> Jiangsu Beat Beijing in Chinese Basketball League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Hu Weidong scored a game-high
25 points and grabbed eight rebounds when Jiangsu Nangang surged
from a halftime deficit to beat hosts Beijing Shougang 75-70 in
the opening round of the Chinese basketball league on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a national forward who was named the MVP last season,
hit 12 points before lifting Jiangsu to a 23-16 lead 10 minutes
into action.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, who finished third place last season, fought back to
make it 29-25 with 5:25 left on a 13-2 run, in which center Bateer
scored seven of his 23 points.
</P>
<P>
The two sides then exchanged lead for several times before
Bateer tied the game at 38-38.
</P>
<P>
The 2.13-meter center then made a freethrow and Ren Jie sunk a
jumper to give Beijing a haltime 41-38 lead.
</P>
<P>
Beijing extended the margin to 55-46 seven minutes after the
break, but the hosts, with Bateer frozen by American John Spencer,
finally squandered the lead, traling 71-70 with 2:31 left.
</P>
<P>
Ding Tie made it 73-70 for Jiangsu with a fast break basket 52
seconds before the final whistle, before Spencer anchored the win
with two free throws on the buzz.
</P>
<P>
"The players were somewhat cautious at the start since this
is the first match of the season," Jiangsu's coach Xia Hongfa
said. "Anyway, we have been fully prepared both mentally and
physically before the game."
</P>
<P>
Beijing's coach Yuan Chao said the loss may be coincidence. "We
have lost all the first games against Jiangsu in the last three
seasons," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Yuan admitted the absence of their pivotal center Shan Tao
has affected their overall strength.
</P>
<P>
"The player to replace Shan suffered a sprained ankle in a
training session," Yuan said.
</P>
<P>
Shan, a national player who stands 2.15 meters, was reportedly
to have moved to Beijing Jingshi Club in hopes to play the
Chinese Professional Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Guangdong Hongyuan ousted Sichuan
81-76; Zhejiang Zhongxin beat Jinan Army 77-63; Liaoning Hunters
trounced China Airforce 97-76; Shandong Baoyuan outplayed Shenyang

<HEADLINE> Belarus Unveils New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Belarus today unveiled a new
constitution with amendments proposed by president Alexander
Lukashenko and passed by a nationwide referendum on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new constitution published today, Lukashenko's term
in office will be extended for another two years with greatly
expanded powers, and his opposition parliament will be changed
into a two-chamber legislature.
</P>
<P>
The results of the November 24 referendum on the new
constitution, opposed by the parliament, showed that Lukashenko
won a big victory in his long-running feud with the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko's draft constitution was backed by 70.5 percent of
the voters, while the parliament-proposed version got only 7.9
percent of the votes, according to reports from Minsk.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, 112 pro-Lukashenko deputies of the 199-seat
parliament voted resoundingly to make the results of the
referendum binding.
</P>
<P>
With the parliament split, the Constitutional Court has not
opened hearings on impeachment of Lukashenko scheduled for
Tuesday. The impeachment was demanded by opposition lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Court spokesman Oleg Moskalyov said today that a number of
parliament deputies called off their signatures from the appeal
for impeachment, and as a result the appeal signed earlier by over
70 deputies became invalid.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's law, 70 signatures are required to start
the proceedings of an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"This is an historic moment. By passing this law, we have
emerged from the constitutional crisis. This is the end of the
tensions we have lived through over the past period," Lukashenko
told the deputies loyal to him on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
While the 112 pro-Lukashenko deputies headed by deputy speaker,
Yury Malumov, met for a session at the Palace of Youth in Minsk,
around 70 anti-Lukashenko lawmakers including speaker Semyon
Sharetsky gathered in the parliament building, criticizing the
referendum and pondering their next move.
</P>
<P>
"I have a feeling that some of my colleagues and I will soon be
out of job," said Mikhail Zamkovenko, one of the anti-Lukashenko
deputies.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution said that the parliament would consist of
a 110-member lower house and a 64-member upper house, up to
one-third of the deputies to be appointed by the president.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko promised on Tuesday that the deputies loyal to him
would enter the House of Representatives, the lower house of the
new parliament, reports said.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Win Concessions From Employers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The striking French truckers
scored a major victory today by winning concessions from their
bosses over early retirement, higher pensions and no weekend jobs.
</P>
<P>
After intervening during several nights of marathon
negotiations between the truckers and their bosses, the French
government promised to cut tax charges on trucking companies and
help finance extra pensions, which would rise to 75 percent of
their annual pay.
</P>
<P>
The employers agreed to a union demand allowing retirement of
truckers at age 55, or after working for 25 years driving trucks
of above 3.5 tons. Formerly, the minimum age was 60.
</P>
<P>
Blockades of roads across France worsened today, the sixth
consecutive day of the "Snail Operation" protest by the truckers,
who are described by some local newspapers as having worked under
"medieval working conditions of extended hours, long weeks and
low pay."
</P>
<P>
Small scale clashes took place between French truckers and
their British and German colleagues over the past few days as the
latter tried to force their way through the barriers set up by the
French.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Alain Juppe today apparently yielded to an
ultimatum by his mediator on the conflict, Robert Cros, who
threatened to resign if the prime minister did not, today, give
him a specific amount of government aid for the trucking companies.
</P>
<P>
Juppe recognized today that the "social relations within this
(trucking) branch are difficult" and called on the conflicting
sides to arrive at a final agreement "with the shortest delay."
</P>
<P>
The French government is becoming increasingly worried about
the possibility of a domino-affect of the truckers' movement on
other fields of transportation, such as passenger coaches, trains,
and planes.
</P>
<P>
The Air France and Air Inter air companies are also seeing a
partial strike by their staff and have had to cut more than half
the domestic and international flights scheduled for today and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The union delegates and the bosses are expected to sign the a
package of agreements this afternoon.

BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today adopted a document aimed at creating jobs in the service
sector, saying it offered "the brightest prospect for tackling the
scourge of unemployment in Europe."
</P>
<P>
Under the document, the EC would stimulate the development of
electronic commerce and improve training in new technologies.
</P>
<P>
"We live in a service-based economy and the service sector
accounts for more jobs than industry and agriculture combined,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) Single Market Commissioner, Mario
Monti, said more effort was needed to integrate service markets
which provided about 70 percent of employment in the EU.
</P>
<P>
He said the EC would examine additional measures to break down
barriers to cross-border provisions of services.
</P>
<P>
Commission President Jacques Santer also said the EC would
present a White Paper on Services by May next year, in preparation
for a debate at the Amsterdam European Council in June. It would
serve as the basis of a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
EC statistics showed that a total of 18 million new jobs had
been created in services in the EU over the past 15 years,
compared with a reduction of some 13 million jobs in industry and
agriculture.

<HEADLINE> State to Ban Commercial Bribery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Commercial bribery, in the
form of money and gifts, free tours or travel in China or abroad,
has been banned, according to provisions released by the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The Temporary Provisions on the Prohibition of Commercial
Bribery is a supplementary document for the Law Against Unfair
Competition, in which commercial bribery is listed.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more and more businessmen have extended
bribes, disguised as promotional fees, advertisement or research
subsidies, to seek various benefits from their customers in
state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The provisions are expected to prevent unfair competition and
help wipe out corruption among state employees.

<HEADLINE> Forum Stresses Role of Special Supervisors in Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A national forum that ended
today in Beijing has placed great emphasis on the role of "special
supervisors" in the country's current battle against corruption.
</P>
<P>
Special supervisors are citizens engaged by disciplinary or
supervisory departments at all levels to monitor the misconduct of
government officials.
</P>
<P>
They come from China's non-communist parties, social
organizations, enterprises, and social institutions, and carry out
their duties in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
The two-day forum, which is on the work of special supervisors
across the country, was co-sponsored by the Central Commission for
Discipline Inspection of the Communist Party of China, and the
Ministry of Supervision under the State Council, China's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
It is the first of its kind since China established the special
supervision system in 1989.
</P>
<P>
After exchanging their experiences with the system, forum
participants agreed that the practice is an effective channel of
communication between the Party, the government and the general
public, and is an important step towards enhancing supervision of
the government by the whole society.
</P>
<P>
To date, 281 prefectures and cities across the country, as well
as more than half of the disciplinary and supervisory departments
above the county level, have engaged over 20,000 special
supervisors to aid their anti-corruption efforts.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President
Jiang Zemin today reassured the Filipino Chinese that Hong Kong's
return will be an important landmark in China's great cause of
reunification.
</P>
<P>
The reunification, Jiang added, is a sacred aspiration of the
Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
A reunified China accords with the general trend of history as
well as the popular will and thus no force can stop it, the
Chinese president noted at a get-together held in honor of him by
the Filipino Chinese communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
On July 1 next year, China will resume exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully capable of achieving a smooth transfer of
government and transition in Hong Kong," Jiang said. "Preparation
for the return of Hong Kong are being made in an effective
manner."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said the Chinese communities in the
Philippines have long lived in amity with the local people,
contributing to the social and economic prosperity of the host
country.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government hopes that Chinese nationals in the
Philippines observe the local laws and regulations and respect
local customs and traditions," said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also encouraged overseas Chinese to become on a voluntary
basis citizens of the host countries of their domicile and to
integrate into the local societies.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president also said at the gathering: "We will
continue to handle the Taiwan question in accordance with the
policy of 'peaceful reunification, and one country, two systems'."
</P>
<P>
Jiang is winding up his visit, the first by a Chinese head of
state to the Philippines. He is scheduled to head for India on
Thursday to start his three-country South Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and Nepal will be the other two countries he is to
visit.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day international
conference to advance development of the edible fungus industry
opened today in Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by more than 40 delegates from seven
countries and some international organizations, including Ajimal
Qureshi, permanent representative of the Office of the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in China, and Romulo
Garcia, deputy representative of the UN Development Program in

</P>
<P>
The current session is themed "Developing the Edible Fungus
Industry to Benefit Mankind."
</P>
<P>
Cultivation of edible fungus in China dates back 1,800
years. China's national output of the edible fungus made up 60
percent of the world's total in 1994. Its annual output of
mushrooms ranks second in the world, only after the United States,
said a Chinese participant.
</P>
<P>
In recent year, scientists in Fujian developed 38 kinds of new
edible fungus.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 papers are expected to be presented to the seminar,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian FM on ASEAN Membership, Informal Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas said here today that ASEAN does not consider internal
political affairs as a deciding factor in granting membership to a
certain country.
</P>
<P>
"The association does not consider that aspect, which also
means that it refrains from interfering with the internal affairs
of other countries," Alatas told newsmen after meeting with
President Soeharto to report the preparations for the ASEAN
informal summit that will be held here on November 30.
</P>
<P>
On the informal summit which immediately follows the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leadership meeting in Manila
which concluded last Monday, Alatas said that it will divided into
two parts.
</P>
<P>
The first part of the summit will be attended only by the seven
heads of state and government of ASEAN, while the second part will
be attended along with Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar, he said.
</P>
<P>
The three countries have applied to join ASEAN (the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations), which groups Brunei, Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
All the seven ASEAN member countries have agreed to accept Laos
and Cambodia as members in July next year.
</P>
<P>
On Myanmar, Alatas said the seven members have reached an
agreement also to accept Myanmar in the association, "only the
timing is not decided yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN informal summit which will be the first to be
held, will not be preceded by a senior officials meeting or any
ministerial level meeting.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN foreign ministers in Manila last week prepared the
list of "indicative topics" that will be discussed in the informal
summit, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But it's up to the ASEAN leaders whether they will discuss all
the topics outlined or only some of them," he added.
</P>
<P>
The topics drawn up in the list include ASEAN's internal,
regional and international problems and issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the most probable ASEAN issues that will be
discussed are the treaty on nuclear weapons free zone and the
treaty on amity.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN's regional problems that will be discussed include
ASEAN's cooperation in the Mekong basin development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the informal summit will discuss ASEAN's preparation
for the upcoming World Trade Organization (WTO) conference in
Singapore on December 6-9.
</P>
<P>
The informal meeting will be held between two formal ASEAN
summit which is held every three years.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is necessary as the ASEAN leaders believe that
many important regional and international issues would not be
addressed on time if they only meet once every three years," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hospitals Urged to Improve Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Hospitals and physicians in
China have been charged with ensuring satisfaction for their
patients.
</P>
<P>
A circular published today by the Ministry of Public Health
states that hospitals are forbidden to overcharge patients, and
must not allow an excessive amount of time for patient
registration, and that doctors are prohibited from prescribing
poor-quality or outdated medicine for patients.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest step by China's highest health department to
upgrade hospital services, which have worsened in some hospitals
in recent years, prompting numerous complaints.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, medical workers should speak civilly to patients,
and improve service to meet patients' demands, according to the
circular.
</P>
<P>
And doctors should prescribe reasonably-priced medicine to help
reduce the financial burdens of patients, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals should appoint their best doctors to take charge of
emergency treatment," it said. "Emergency patients in hospitals
should receive treatment in five minutes."
</P>
<P>
"We should always give priority to patients," said Health
Minister Chen Minzhang. "That's the basic aim and guideline for
the work of hospitals and physicians."
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also urged government health departments of
all levels to strengthen supervision over hospitals and clinics.
</P>
<P>
Special complaint hotline numbers will be published, and
hospitals and medical workers involved in complaint cases will be
punished, according to the circular.

<HEADLINE> Muzenda Calls for Indigenization in Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Vice President
Simon Muzenda predicted today that the continued marginalization
of majority black Zimbabweans will no longer be sustainable 16
years after independence.
</P>
<P>
Opening the first national conference on indigenization in
Harare, Muzenda said the indigenization program should be viewed
not only from the point of addressing the imbalances created by
previous colonial regimes but as a means of creating more wealth
to reduce poverty and expand the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
He noted that to address the social imbalances caused by the
country's colonial past, indigenization must be looked at in the
broad sense of being part of the process of socio-economic
transformation of the country.
</P>
<P>
''Indigenization should be a long-term socio-economic
development strategy for laying a strong foundation for the
development of a fully-fledged democratic society in which all
Zimbabweans equally enjoy political, economic and social
justice,'' said Muzenda.
</P>
<P>
Pledging the government support for the program, the vice
president called for speeding up the development of a
comprehensive policy on indigenization to enable indigenous
Zimbabweans to ''claim their meaningful role as stake-holders and
owners of the means of production in this country.''
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the World Bank, United States
Agency for International Development and Trust Merchant Bank,
aimed to chart the way forward for the indigenization program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program the Zimbabwe government intends to transfer
wealth into the hands of the once disadvantaged black people who
constitute the majority of the country's over 10.5 million
people.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by more than 100 delegates drawn from the
private and public sectors, non-governmental organizations, the
donor community and trade unions.

<HEADLINE> Kyrgyzstan to Privatize or Lease All Farmland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President Askar Akayev
signed a decree on Monday on land-use rights and an agriculture
loan system, in a bid to privatize half of the country's farmland
and lease the remaining half on one-year terms by March 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the presidential decree, the government will register the
sales, exchanges, mortgaging, leasing and inheritance of land-use
rights starting on January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The move was designed to ensure the goal of privatization and
leasing, said the decree.
</P>
<P>
The decree stipulated that agriculture financial companies
would be fully responsible for loan granted to farmers. It would
deprive the Ministry of Agriculture and local governments of the
power of allocating agriculture loans.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Prime Minister Bekbolot Talgarvekov explained that it was
very important for the government to permit the sales of land-use
rights of farmland, which would help create big private farms.
</P>
<P>
About 1.5 million farmers have become owners of land, and
30,000 private farms and 800 collectively-owned farms have been
set up, thanks to land reforms in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production has been rising during the period.

HAIKOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost island
province of Hainan is planning to build two express highways to
ease the increasingly heavy road traffic that has resulted from
the area's growing economy.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities said today that the only express highway

parts of the island.
</P>

HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Japanese businessmen
participating in a meeting in Tokyo today expressed their
confidence in Hong Kong's business prospects after its handover

</P>
<P>
Members of the Japan/Hong Kong Business Cooperation Committee

<P>
A joint communique issued at the end of the 19th Plenary
Session said that Hong Kong's advantages as a business hub and a
channel for investments in the mainland (of China) would become
ever more significant after 1997 as China's economy in general and
services sector in particular, continued to modernize and look for
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
"Members felt there would be even more opportunities for
Japanese companies to invest in the mainland both directly and
through Hong Kong," it said.

The high-level bilateral committees, which will hold their next
plenary session in Hong Kong at the end of 1997, were established

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today adopted a proposal for action by the Council of Ministers
and the European Parliament in an effort to step up the fight
against child sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
The EC proposal is aimed at dissuading and penalizing
individuals who sexually exploit children. It aims to intervene in
both demand and the offer of child sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, member states of the European Union (EU)
would establish a concerted approach at national and international
levels by making surveys and monitoring measures adopted by member
countries.
</P>
<P>
The EC said that tourists who sexually exploited children came
mainly from industrialized countries. The organization and
coordination of information campaigns in the EU were needed to
sensitize the public and discourage child sex tourism.
</P>
<P>
It urged EU members to draw up and reinforce codes of conduct
and self-regulatory mechanisms in the tourism industry to combat
the problem.
</P>
<P>
The EC also suggested that EU member states show their
determination to combat child sex tourism by creating a common
front against it.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the
Palestinian Authority (PA) said today that the is not against the
Jews, but the Israeli government's settlement policy, according to
a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Sha'ath, Palestinian Minister of Planning and
International Cooperation said that the meeting between President
Yasser Arafat and a number of Jewish settlers in Bethlehem Tuesday
night served as a proof in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The PA minister made the comment after signing a donation
agreement with Mr. Shibuya, Japanese Ambassador to Israel, in
his office in Dahyet Al-Barid near Jerusalem this morning. Under
the agreement, Japan will grant the PA 5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace talks between Israel and Palestine,
Sha'ath said that no progress had been achieved thus far.
</P>
<P>
The JMCC report quoted Palestinian sources as saying that the
settlers told Arafat that they agree to live in peaceful
coexistence with the Palestinians in the territories under the PA
administration.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also met with Yehuda Wachsman, whose son, Nachshon,
was abducted and killed by the Islamic extremist Hamas members
in 1994. Wachsman urged Arafat to continue the peace process
despite all the obstacles. Israeli extremists are a minority, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met a delegation of 10 Jewish settlers at a
Greek Orthodox church compound in Bethlehem Tuesday night to
discuss mutual cooperation. The meeting, which was not made
public in advance and did not invite journalists, was reportedly
described as friendly and free of rancor.

ALMA-ATA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Speaker of Kazakhstan's
Lower Houses of Parliament, Marat Ospanov, called here on
Wednesday for the promotion of Kazak as the country's national
language.
</P>
<P>
The Speaker said the draft language law, which was now under
deliberation in the house, urged people throughout the country to
master the national language while respect other languages in use.
</P>
<P>
Ospanov said the current language law was passed during the
Soviet era, and ran contrary to the country's constitution adopted
in August, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The constitution stipulated Kazak as the national language and
Russian as official one, but Kazak is seldom used on formal
occasions.
</P>
<P>
The government of Kazakhstan urged all government staff members
of Kazak origin to master the native language by 2001, and public
servants of other ethnic groups by 2006.
</P>
<P>
Russian has long been the tool of communication for about 100
ethnic groups in Kazakhstan, including the Kazak, many of whom do

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government
departments have formulated a strategy to invigorate the marine
industry through the use of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the output of China's marine
industry will be 30 billion yuan (3.7 billion US dollars),
accounting for three to five percent of the GDP, according to a
new plan.
</P>
<P>
The project, co-developed by the State Science and Technology
Commission and the State Oceanic Administration, was announced at
the second national meeting for exchanging experiences in
invigorating the marine industry by means of science and
technology, held last week in Hangzhou, capital of east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
During the first phase as scheduled in the two-part plan, or
from 1996 to 2010, the main focus will be on the development of
polder, shallow sea, and island areas, and key research areas will
cover marine farming and stockbreeding, deep processing of marine
resources, utilization of marine chemical resources, and direct
use and desalination of sea water.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase of the program, from 2001 to 2010, the
country will seek comprehensive development of the marine
industry, placing emphasis on the offshore areas, as well as the
special economic zones and high seas.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, more than 50 percent of the increase in
the marine industry's output, which will account for 10 percent of
the GDP, can be attributed to the direct application of science
and technology -- by the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Urged to Invest More in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today expressed
the hope that South Korea will increase its investments in the
country as its present investment is small compared to that from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
The hope was expressed by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad during his talks with visiting South Korean President Kim
Young Sam here, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said when
briefing the press on the talks.
</P>
<P>
He said Mahathir was disappointed over the cold response from
South Korea in the area of investment in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask them to do more because they are not showing
their investment interest although South Korea has the capacity to
invest," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia also asked South Korean investors not to
bring in projects which were labor intensive in view of the
shortage of labor in this country.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean President said his government would give
positive consideration to Malaysia's requests and views, according
to Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
"Mahathir was also dissatisfied with the balance of trade
between the two countries and asked South Korea to buy more
Malaysian raw materials directly instead of through third
countries," Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
"Both leaders hoped the problems in the area of business will
be resolved amicably in the spirit of goodwill," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir also hoped South Korean builders who had won many
Malaysian contracts would transfer technology to the locals and
provide sub-contracts to Malaysians, he said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that Malaysia Airlines and Korean
Airlines increase their respective flights beyond Seoul and Kuala
Lumpur, he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Mahathir also expressed the hope that South
Korea would support Malaysia's bid for a seat in the UN Security
Council next year.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed that dialogue with Europe,
particularly the European Union, should continue for their mutual
benefit, Abdullah said.
</P>
<P>
President Kim, who arrived here yesterday for a three-day
official visit, invited Mahathir to visit South Korea next year
and, if possible, in January, Abdullah said.

<HEADLINE> Briton Fined Over Child Porn From Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A former university staff who
downloaded pornographic pictures from the Internet was fined 1,000
pounds and lost his job, according local news reports here today.
</P>
<P>
Graham Warren, 34, downloaded the images onto floppy disks at
Newcastle University before feeding them into his laptop computer.
</P>
<P>
His activities were exposed by a resident systems programmer
and investigations revealed a collection of 100 pornographic
images, including scenes of pornography showing full and oral sex
between children and adults and boys involved in homosexual acts.
</P>
<P>
Warren, a married father of two, of Blyth, Northumberland,
admitted 10 charges of possessing indecent photographs of children.
</P>
<P>
Warren was allowed access once a week to the university's
computers through his job as a statistician.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, the university's systems programmer
noticed some unusual files had been transferred from the Internet,
all of which could be traced back to Warren's computer.
</P>
<P>
The programmer contacted the police and Warren lost his job and
suffered great embarrassment.

<HEADLINE> Four-Wing Birds discovered in Changbai Mountains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Teachers on a journey to a
scenic mountain in northeast China thought they were seeing double
as they spotted a group of colorful birds.
</P>
<P>
As they watched the butterfly-like birds sweeping through an
alpine forest, the teachers observed that each had four wings.
</P>
<P>
Two-winged birds are the norm, but these teachers were
convinced they had got their sums correct.
</P>
<P>
And their glimpse at the feathered wonders confirms a sighting
made as long ago as 1908.
</P>
<P>
The four-wing birds were spotted in the Changbai Mountains
Nature Reserve in northeast China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
Two women teachers at Jilin Opera School saw the four four-wing
birds, two big and two smaller ones as their bus passed an alpine
birch forest on the western side of the Changbai Mountains, where
wild sika deers could also be spotted.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying the teachers on the summer outing were 30 other
school teachers, heading for a tour to the Changbai Mountains.
</P>
<P>
The birds, a light yellow color and bigger than magpies, a kind
of very popular bird in China, were flying low in the dense
forest. One of the four-winged bird had an inverted trapezoidal
shape tail and pointed mouth.
</P>
<P>
The strange birds had been spotted as early as 1908 when a Liu
Jianfeng, a local official, made a large-scale investigation of
the Changbai Mountains, and he described the bird in his book
about the mountains.
</P>
<P>
He wrote in his book that the bird was "round-headed and
slender winged, first two wings are longer, and the other two
wings are shorter. The bird, in light yellow color, looks like a
butterfly and sounds like an oriole.
</P>
<P>
So far, it is not known if the four-wing bird is a new specie
of bird, or a variant in the evolution process of birds.
</P>
<P>
The Changbai Mountains Nature Reserve has nearly 500 kinds of
vertebrate animals, and over 1,000 kinds of non-vertebrate
animals.

sodium metal production.
</P>
<P>
The region's annual output of ferrosilicon has surpassed
200,000 tons, ranking first in China.
</P>
<P>
The Yinchuan-based sodium plant turns out 4,000 tons of sodium
metal a year, beating the output of all other Chinese provinces.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Disease Predicted Over in Two Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Mad cow disease has been
virtually eliminated from younger British cattle and the epidemic
could be over within two years, a national newspaper reported here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Between 150 and 200 cattle aged under 30 months now have
Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and culling targets set by
the European Union have probably been met," The Daily Telegraph
quoted Prof Roy Anderson as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that it is possible to take the epidemic out by
mid-1998," said Anderson, who has been using mathematical models
to predict the course of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Anderson has been working at the Wellcome Trust Center for the
Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases at the University of Oxford.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking after a meeting held at the Wellcome Trust,
London, where leading European scientists participated in a review
of the current knowledge of BSE and scrapie, the sheep spongiform
disease.
</P>
<P>
The rate of new BSE infections has been low since 1994. But he
said that to reduce the disease to a trickle of cases by mid-1998
would require at least half of the current rate of slaughter -
60,000 head of cattle aged over 30 months per week - to continue.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Count in Developing Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The first province in China to
introduce compulsory nine-year education for children has drawn up
an education blueprint for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The plan describes the quality of teaching staff as the
foundation of education development, citing a report which says
"He who wins over teachers will win talents of the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
The report has been released by the Teachers Conference of east
China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Education in Jiangsu took a leap forward between 1991 and
1995. It was the first province in China to make nine-year
compulsory education universal among children and youngsters aged
from 7 to 16. It was also the first to have nearly all the
illiterate people between 20 to 50 educated, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the provincial expenditure on education
rose annually by around 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, an economic powerhouse in the country, points out that
priority should be given to education development if consistent
and steady economic development is wanted, and that improving the
competence of the teachers is the foundation of education
development.
</P>
<P>
The blueprint for the province says that by 2000, it will have
one-fifth of the total elementary and secondary school teachers
with college diplomas.
</P>
<P>
The backbone of the provincial key secondary schools,
vocational schools, will have master degrees.
</P>
<P>
Key universities will have over three-fifths of their teaching
staff with master degrees, and ordinary universities will have
nearly half.
</P>
<P>
From 1996 to 2000, Jiangsu will train 50 world-famous
teachers, with about 20 of them being influential in their
respective fields, and 500 nationally-renowned teachers.
</P>
<P>
During that period, the government will add three million yuan
every year to the training of teachers. The subsidy funds to
normal schools and normal universities will reach one million yuan.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, 85 percent of the elementary teachers will have
received higher education, 15 percent of the backbone of higher
middle schools will have post-graduate education, and 40 percent
of the teachers in universities will have doctorates.
</P>
<P>
Cities and counties are asked to take up the responsibility of
the training of teachers. Special funds should be established for
it.

<HEADLINE> Macao Encourages IDD Calls With Lucky Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- People who make longer period of
 international direct dialing (IDD) telephone calls on holidays
next month in Macao may have a higher chance of winning such
prizes of gold, electric appliances.
</P>
<P>
That is the latest measure the Macao Telecommunications Company
 (CTM) adopted to encourage the use of IDD phone calls.
</P>
<P>
The CTM said that people who make such phone calls of over four
 minutes once on Sundays, Christmas holidays and New Year's day
may have a chance of lucky draw, provided the caller makes
registration with the CTM. But the lucky excludes public phones
and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
The prizes include one-ounce gold ornaments, electric
appliances, tickets for sightseeing and buffet, among others.
</P>
<P>
The latest move was among complaints that the cost of Macao's
IDD calls is one of the highest in the Asian-Pacific region. Macao
residents have urged the CTM to lower its price of IDD for quite a
long time.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, many Macao residents who make phone calls
to China's mainland would prefer to do it in neighboring Zhuhai
City, where the cost of long distance phone calls to destinations
other than Guangdong province is about one-tenth of that in Macao.
</P>
<P>
In October, the CTM offered a 15-percent-off price on holidays
and Sundays to encourage more IDD phone calls in Macao.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Joint Sino-Philippine Efforts Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- In China there is a saying that
 "Today is better than yesterday while tomorrow will be better
than today."
</P>
<P>
Visiting Chinese President Jiang Zemin quoted the old Chinese
saying and a Philippine proverb that "One won't miss tomorrow when
he seizes the opportunity of today" to point out the way for the
development of the relations between China and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
As the first ever Chinese head of state to visit the
Philippines, Jiang urged better cooperation so as to bring into
the next century tighter ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Fidel Ramos hailed his country's ties with
China as a vital contribution to regional stability and security
and a vital element in the sense of community which is the
ultimate goal of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum which
just concluded this year's meetings in this country.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting on Tuesday, Jiang and Ramos agreed that
their two countries should strive for a 21st-century-oriented good
neighborliness based on trust and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
A consensus of special significance was reached during the
meeting when the two presidents agreed that their countries have
achieved, through concerted efforts, "positive results" in finding
an appropriate way to solve the dispute concerning the South China
Sea.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that both sides should set aside differences,
negotiate peacefully and join hands in planning the development of
the disputed area.
</P>
<P>
"It is in the shared interests of our two peoples that China
and the Philippines maintain long-term, steady good neighborliness
and all-round cooperation," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
China needs stable and peaceful surroundings for development
while a developed China will only be conducive to peace and
development in the region and the world as a whole, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, the Chinese president also met
Philippine House of Representatives Speaker Jose de Venecia and
Senate President Ernesto Maceda.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told de Venecia that China is prepared to join efforts
with the Philippines to promote cooperation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The speaker hailed the direct contact between Jiang and his
Philippine counterpart, Ramos, as conducive to furthering
relations between China and the Philippines and those between
China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as
well.
</P>
<P>
While meeting the Philippine Senate chief, President Jiang said
China and the Philippines can make the most of the complementarity
of their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
"Though their national strengths are different," Jiang noted,
"China and the Philippines have their own forte in their
respective economic development.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides can make the most of the economic
complementarity and tap their potentials to venture into new
domains so as to achieve a new round of development in trade and

<HEADLINE> Please Return Our City Wall, Beijing Residents Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Families in Beijing have
received an unusual request from officials: Please return our
city wall!
</P>
<P>
They want local residents who have kept chunks of the city's
famous stone wall to return the keepsakes for a wall renovation
scheme.
</P>
<P>
It is part of an ambitious plan to reinstate part of the
historic wall which encircled the Chinese capital until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
One young girl from Beijing took out a long-kept and precious
ancient wall brick in response to the appeal for the rebuilding of
a section of the ancient wall.
</P>
<P>
The brick weighed 25 kilograms, so the girl, Song Dan, pleaded
with her parents to send it to the building site in southeastern
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The girl was among throngs of people who rushed to donate their
privately kept bricks.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's municipal government has called on residents to
donate original bricks from the ancient walls which used to
enclose the city, but was dismantled in the 1950s and 1960s in the
city's reconstruction program.
</P>
<P>
Li Qingsheng, a retired worker, made his way on a tricycle to
the donation site kilometers away from his home to offer the
bricks he had preserved for years.
</P>
<P>
"The ancient wall is a rare heritage from our ancestors. As a
Beijing resident, I feel very proud that I can do something for
the city," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this way I can live up to the ancestors and leave something
to our children."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Beijing residents have become more aware of
the protection of antiques.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are more than 30,000 antique
collectors, who help protect antiques and give the government
valuable suggestions on antique protection.
</P>
<P>
Some villagers in suburban Beijing have made voluntary efforts
to protect and revamp antiques, and young children even warn
tourists against scribbling on antiques.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, the Palace Museum in Beijing has received from
529 people more than 20,000 antiques and 5,000 ancient documents,
including paintings, calligraphy works, bronzeware, porcelain,
jade articles, tapestry satin, royal seals and seal cuttings.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Minister of Social Affairs Jacques Barrot has asked the
two conflicting sides of the trucking industry to reach an agreement
and end their clash within 24 hours. The bosses of trucking
companies said that 85 percent of France's trucking companies have
fewer than 10 workers, so it was extremely difficult to meet all the
demands of the truckers. The bosses called on the government to
provide financial aid to their businesses to keep them competitive.
</P>
<P>
-- Some 46 percent of French people support the maintenance of a
strong franc, and 32 percent think that to attach the franc with
the Deutsche mark brings about negative results to the French
economy, according to a latest poll by IPSOS polling group.
</P>
<P>
La Tribune Desfosse:
</P>
<P>
-- The offer by Moscow to compensate Russia's tarist-era debts to
France will put an end to a dispute which harmed relations between
the two countries over the past 80 years. However, the families of
the then purchasers of the Russian bonds are disappointed by the
amount of compensation (400 million U.S. dollars) to be paid in four
years by Russia, which does not take into account either the
interest arrears nor the drastic change of financial values over the
past 80 years.
</P>
<P>
La Republique des Pyrenees:
</P>
<P>
-- In the past few days, France discovered at the end of the
20th century a medieval world of working conditions of its truck
drivers -- over-extended working hours, long work weeks, and low
salaries.

<HEADLINE> Peter K C Woo: Hong Kong Progresses under Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Peter K. C. Woo, one of the
three candidates for the chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here today that he believes
Hong Kong will be dominated by law in the future.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his policy platform at the Second Plenary Session of
the Selection Committee, Woo said the most important task for the
HKSAR executive chief is to steadfastly uphold the principles of
"one country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong
Kong," and "a high degree of autonomy" and to implement the Basic
Law.
</P>
<P>
He said the future HKSAR should have a clear blueprint which is
based on his concepts of "three stabilities," "three
constructions" and "two relationships." And they mean keeping
social and financial stability and the stability of the ranks of
civil servants and the executive-led situation; enhancing
economic, housing and educational construction; and fostering a
sound relationship with the Chinese mainland and the international
community.
</P>
<P>
Woo, born in Shanghai on September 5, 1946, is the former
chairman of the Wharf (Holding) Ltd. and Wheellock and Co. Ltd. He
is a member of the Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR and was
nominated a candidate for the chief executive at the first plenary
session of the Selection Committee for the First Government of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
Woo's platform distributed to the meeting consists of the
Forward, "Ensuring the Rule of Law and Effective Governance,"
"Climbing New Heights on the Economic Front," "Building a Modern
and Civil Society" and "Conclusion."
</P>
<P>
There is no precedent anywhere in history for the
implementation of two social systems within a single country. For
the "one country, two systems" concept to work would require great
wisdom from the HKSAR government in mapping out the right strategy
and in handling its internal affairs and external relationships
in an appropriate manner, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
To lead Hong Kong into the new post-97 era, the chief executive
needs support from the central government and must himself be
able to unite Hong Kong's six million people, he said.
</P>
<P>
A prerequisite for long-term prosperity in Hong Kong is
political and social stability. There can be no prosperity without
stability. So, in the interest of social stability, the HKSAR
government must therefore act firmly, resolving internal and
social conflicts within the community, bringing together internal
resources, promoting unity, maintaining the rule of law and
upholding social justice, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
The primary stabilizing force comes from an efficient and
effective public administration, an executive-led government, a
steadfast corps of talented civil servants and a reliable civil
service system for effective rule, Woo continued.
</P>
<P>
Among his proposals for ways to tackle political issues are to
maintain the present executive-led government structure, preserve
the tradition of the rule of law, uphold the spirit of fair
competition and judicial independence, consolidate the present
civil service system and foster effective communication between
Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
With regard to economic issues, Woo held that as China
continues on its path of economic reform and opening to the
outside, Hong Kong's role as China's bridge to the outside world
must be played to the full and it is through Hong Kong that the
West can best penetrate China's vast markets.
</P>
<P>
The main task of the future HKSAR government will be to
preserve Hong Kong's capitalist economic system, protect its free
port status and traditionally free economy and make the most of
the bridging role of its economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
In an open and international economic society like Hong Kong,
the overall goal is to expand and enhance its ability to generate
foreign exchange earnings through competitiveness and
productivity, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
He summarized his proposals for tackling economic issues into
11 points. They include maintaining the principles of a free
economy and free competition, keeping the linked exchange rate
system for the Hong Kong dollar, pursuing a sound and conservative
budgetary policy and maintaining the low tax regime and the
existing tax base, further developing Hong Kong's advantage as a
financial center, mapping out an industrial policy which takes
advantage of the respective strengths of Hong Kong and China,
encouraging the development of science- and technology-based
industries, furthering Hong Kong's infrastructure development and
enhancing Hong Kong's competitiveness in the next century.
</P>
<P>
The social priorities of the future HKSAR government must be to
improve the quality of life for the grassroots, provide adequate
job opportunities and ensure adequate housing provision, Woo said.
</P>
<P>
His proposals on the social issues are strengthening the
development of the disciplinary forces and ensuring the
maintenance of law and order, reviewing and improving the present
housing policy, further improving the health care system, raising
the quality and standard of education, reviewing the present
education system and developing recreational and cultural
activities.

Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his policy platform to the Selection Committee, Yang
stressed that the essence of his policy platform is "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong" and "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident in Hong Kong's future and his
confidence is based on the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He outlined his policy platform with the terms of prosperity,
stability, freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Yang, born in Shanghai and 67 years old, is former chief
justice of Hong Kong. He was nominated as a candidate for the
HKSAR's first chief executive at the first plenary session of the
Selection Committee for the First Government of the HKSAR on
November 15.
</P>
<P>
In his policy platform distributed at the meeting, he noted
that the future of Hong Kong is bright and there is no doubt that
Hong Kong will progress steadily into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will become a place where its legal system is more
healthy, society more stable, economy more robust, distribution of
wealth and resources more equal, education system more
satisfactory, environment more appealing, social welfare more
comprehensive and political structure more democratic.
</P>
<P>
Yang's policy platform consists of eight parts -- preamble, to

standard of living, to protect human rights, to develop a
democratic political structure and conclusion.
</P>
<P>

"family" member of China under the central government's

</P>
<P>
"I will strive for the greatest possible success of 'one

process of legislation and trial in Chinese.
</P>

He suggested that the HKSAR government adopt policies to

comprehensive framework must be established to enable the

<HEADLINE> Tung Chee Hwa Urges HK Citizens to Join Hands for 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, one of the
three candidates for the first chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here today that Hong
Kong citizens have the unique opportunity to shape its future as
Hong Kong will become an SAR of China on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Explaining his policy platform to the Selection Committee here
this morning, Tung said that in the 21st century, the HKSAR will
become a stable, equitable, compassionate and democratic society
with clarity of direction and unity of purpose and based on equal
opportunities and fair competition.
</P>
<P>
Tung, born in Shanghai on May 29, 1937, and former chairman of
Orient Overseas (International) Limited, is a vice-chairman of the
Preparatory Committee for the HKSAR of China's National People's
Congress (NPC). He was nominated a candidate for HKSAR chief
executive at the first plenary session of the Selection Committee
for the First Government of the HKSAR on November 15.
</P>
<P>
He said his participation in the chief executive campaign was
stimulated by a sense of historical mission.
</P>
<P>
At the historic moment when Hong Kong is returning to China, he
said, he should stand up to do something for Hong Kong and his
country.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated on his policies toward problems in housing,
education, the pension scheme and creation of wealth.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will be the most important financial, trade,
transportation, communication, education and entertainment center
in Asia as it increasingly becomes the center of industrial
activities in China and Southeast Asia, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung held that Hong Kong has achieved great success. The first
of the factors for the success lies in its external environment,
especially in the Chinese mainland which has served as Hong Kong's
most important trade and industrial partner in addition to being
its main support base.
</P>
<P>
The second factor is that Hong Kong has enjoyed a free and
competitive economic environment, and the third is the commitment
of Hong Kong people who are the most entrepreneurial in the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the very successes have brought upon Hong Kong a new
set of challenges, Tung said. Hong Kong's future prosperity cannot
be secured by simply maintaining the status quo and it needs to
face up to those challenges in order to remain ahead in an
increasingly complex economic environment.
</P>
<P>
He said, "As we look ahead, two distinct challenges face us.
First, we need to manage the transition. Second, we need to
address the issues that shape our long-term future."
</P>
<P>
To ensure a successful transition, he listed such tasks as
appointing members of the HKSAR Executive Council, nominating
principal officials for the HKSAR government, commencing working
with the Provisional Legislature and beginning the preparation
work for the election of the first HKSAR Legislature in accordance
with the Basic Law, establishing the Court of Final Appeal and
appointing the chief justice and other judges and magistrates.
</P>
<P>
Other issues of importance he mentioned include working with
the Chinese government to establish the Committee for the Basic
Law of the HKSAR under the NPC Standing Committee, maintaining the
current legal and administrative structure, working closely with
the present Hong Kong government to ensure a smooth transition,
establishing from the very beginning the authority of a strong
executive-led government which stands up for the interests of Hong
Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to increase public confidence in Hong Kong
by resolutely upholding the principles of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a "high
degree of autonomy" as provided in the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He said he stands for promoting actively a keen sense of
togetherness, common objectives and a sense of belonging to Hong
Kong and encouraging participation by all sectors of society and
all political parties in a free and objective manner.
</P>
<P>
He called for continuing commitment to a conservative fiscal
policy and linked exchange rate and assuring local and overseas
businesses that the free, fair, enabling and encouraging economic
environment will be maintained and that social, political and
economic stability will prevail.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to promote greater communication between Hong
Kong and the mainland at all levels in order to create a
multi-layer relationship characterized by mutual trust, shared
economic benefits, close cultural ties, respect for each other's
way of life and a commitment to the principle of "one country, two
systems."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the continued creation of wealth and improvement
in the quality of life enjoyed by all Hong Kong people must be the
priority of the HKSAR government, adding that these can only be
achieved through sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Tung also said Hong Kong people need to continue to preserve
the virtues of Chinese culture while at the same time assimilating
the knowledge and experiences of the West.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Police Detain More Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- In its further effort to
crack down on illegal foreign workers, the Singapore police
detained a total of 248 in a raid at a construction site on
Tuesday, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said, of those detained, 81 were arrested for being illegal
immigrants and nine were referred to the Ministry of Labor for
overstaying and violating their social visit passes.
</P>
<P>
The report said that police also planned to charge a further 35
workers while 30 others are still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Labor officials were questioning the contractor
responsible for hiring the illegal workers. The nationalities of
the detained workers were not made known.
</P>
<P>
There are about 350,000 foreign workers now working in
Singapore, an island country with a population of three million.
And the government has expressed its concern that it would not be
in the interest of the country's economic growth to rely too
heavily on foreign workers.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers, Employers Agree on Early Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 27 (Xinhua) -- French truckers and their
employers reached an agreement Wednesday morning on early
retirement at age 55 for the truckers, but failed to compromise on
two other requests by the truckers -- higher pay and shorter work
time.
</P>
<P>
The union was continuing to push for a compromise with the
employers on salary raises and shorter working hours, a union
representative told the Agence France Presse (AFP) during a break
of the night-time marathon talks.
</P>
<P>
They had earlier denounced a proposal by the employers for a
one-percent salary increase as a "real provocation."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, government mediator Robert Cros presented a series
of government recommendations, including lower tax charges on
trucking companies to make for shorter working time.
</P>
<P>
Truckers continued to block roads across the country this
morning and set up new blockades on roads including that of
Val-de-Marne southeast of Paris and at a tunnel in Frejus between
France and Italy.
</P>
<P>
About 15 trucks this morning blocked the access to the state
railway company in charge of transporting food to the Paris
region, which completely paralyzed the activities of the company,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The employers and the government were working on a draft
agreement on early retirement age, which would be submitted to the
union representatives for signing.
</P>
<P>
About 200 blockades were counted on the roads across France by
Tuesday evening.

<HEADLINE> Lead-Free Benzine to Prevail on Egyptian Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's benzine production will
be lead-free as of next June in a bid to protect the environment
from pollution.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Oil Hamdy el-Banbi said Egypt is among the
first of the developing countries to take such a move. The
minister made the remarks at a meeting Tuesday night with the
general assemblies of the Egypt Oil and the Oil Cooperative
companies.
</P>
<P>
"About 82 percent of car fuel marketed at service stations
nation-wide is lead free," said the minister, adding that Cairo,
Giza and Qalyubia, areas popularly known as the Greater Cairo, is
now consuming 100 percent of the lead-free benzine distributed
through its benzine filling stations in line with the government's
efforts to protect environment.
</P>
<P>
He asked oil sector officials to put up signs in
benzine-filling stations to enhance the public anti-air pollution
awareness.
</P>
<P>
He added that the oil products marketing companies are also
working to upgrade their performance in order to protect the
environment.
</P>
<P>
Egypt Oil Company Chief Farouk Abdul Aziz said the company has
set up 37 benzine-filling stations in new urban communities and
tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
Oil Cooperative Company Chief Hamdi Abdel Ghani said seven
natural gas filling stations have been set up in the Greater Cairo
and Alexandria.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Construction Boom Pushes Up Economy in Southwest China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Listed as key state projects, the 898-kilometer-long
Nanning-Kunming Railway, and the Litang-Zhanjiang Railway, are
designed to link major mineral producers with sea ports, such as
Zhanjiang, Fangcheng, Beihai, and Qinzhou.
</P>
<P>
Priority has also been given to highway construction. As part
of the efforts, mountainous and mineral-abundant Guizhou plans to
pour three billion yuan (361.44 billion US dollars) into the
building of expressways totalling 1,300 kilometers in the coming
five years. High-grade highways linking Chengdu, Kunming, Guiyang,
and Nanning will also get underway.
</P>
<P>
"The construction boom expects to push up the economy
remarkably, which fits in with the country's 15-year national
economic development plan, designed to shift the focus from
coastal to central and west regions," commented an official.
</P>
<P>
"This shift is partly based on the fact that labor costs have
been rising fast, and resources dwindling in coastal cities," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Attracted by a bright prospect, overseas investment is
constantly increasing in the region.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has used a total of 3.33 billion US dollars in overseas
investment in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for greater development, regional cooperation is
being enhanced. Many inland cities have set up enterprises and
offices in port cities, such as Beihai and Zhanjiang. And an
economic-coordination meeting held by seven southwest China
provinces and cities have already been convened for 12 consecutive
years.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Exporters to Gain as Country Joins GPA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Singapore exporters will be
able to gain easier access to more than 64 billion US dollars
worth of government procurement market in the world as Singapore
joins the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA), the Singapore
Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
Singapore was accepted on September 20, 1996 by the World Trade
Organization's Committee on Government Procurement to be a member
of the GPA and Singapore is currently reviewing and establishing
its internal procedures in preparation for its formal accession to
the GPA, the TDB said.
</P>
<P>
The GPA is designed to ensure that government procurement
procedures are open, transparent and that they do not protect
domestic products and suppliers nor discriminate against foreign
ones. The scope of the GPA covers goods, services and construction
services.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are nine GPA members. They are Aruba, Canada,
Israel, Japan, South Korea, Norway, Switzerland, the United States
and the European Community, which includes Austria, Belgium,
Denmark, Germany, Finland, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy,
Luxembourg. The Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the
United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The TDB said that each year, substantial expenditures are
committed by governments for procurement of goods and services,
especially for the upgrading of their economies' infrastructural
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
With Singapore's accession to the GPA, Singaporean suppliers
would be able to enjoy greater access into the lucrative
government procurement markets of GPA members, it noted.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the transparency requirement of the GPA would
enable Singaporean suppliers better access to the information
provided by GPA members regarding their government procurement
contracts, it said.

<HEADLINE> Promising Private Museums in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Four private museums have been
opened in Beijing, bringing the number of such museums to 200 in
the country.
</P>
<P>
China's private museums began to emerge at the beginning of the
1980s when collections of all sorts of articles as a hobby became
popular in a country which boasts 5,000 years of civilization, and
tremendous reserves of collectible cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1990, China only had 80
private museums, but the number had shot to 200 by last June.
</P>
<P>
The museums cover a wide range of articles, from coins and
grain coupons to butterflies and keys. They reflect Chinese
culture from different periods of history, and from a variety of
angles.
</P>
<P>
Some private museums have astonishing collections, citing the
example of Li Zhiguang, who boasts of 1.8 million match box labels
of 150,000 kinds.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the appearance of large numbers of private
museums make up for the shortcomings of state-owned museums, which
focus on collections of objects and documents.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Opposition Calls for Nation-Wide Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese opposition has
called for nation-wide strike against the government, the third
headed by Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, who is to face the first
challenge Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition and labor unions called for staging the strike
and demonstrations Thursday despite the government's warning of
enforcing a three-year-old demonstration ban. The Committee for
the Defense of Freedom and Daily Bread, a loose opposition
coalition, insisted on the right of demonstrations stipulated in
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Labor unions, opposition parties and opposition personalities
said the strike and demonstrations would be staged Thursday in
order to protest against deteriorating socio-economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
They said they also wanted to pressure the government to annul
a broadcast media law which would have shut down scores of private
radio and television stations by the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources said that the supreme defense
committee comprising the country's senior security officials is
to hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss measures to preempt
the protests.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Tuesday night, the authorities ordered
the "suspension of all personal weapons permits" as of this
morning, saying that violators will be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr said the ban on unauthorized
public demonstrations remains in force and "the government will
show no leniency" in stopping the protests.
</P>
<P>
"The army will not allow demonstrators to get to their meeting
point. The decision is clear and must be implemented," Al-Murr
told reporters Tuesday in the parliament building where he was
attending a parliamentary general session.
</P>
<P>
The deputies, since the beginning of this week, have been
debating the government's policy statement, on the basis of which
the newly-formed government will win a vote of confidence from the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Public demonstrations were outlawed in 1993, after a political
march organized by the fundamentalist guerrilla organization of
Hezbollah to protest against Arab-Israeli peace-making efforts
triggered off a bloody confrontation in which nine members of the
Iranian-backed Party of God were shot by police.
</P>
<P>
The government has since decreed that street protests may be
held if an interior ministry permission is obtained in advance.
</P>
<P>
Al-Murr said the government will not consider issuing a permit
for Thursday's protests because it has not yet been officially
installed and won't be until it gets the vote of confidence from
the parliament, which is planned no earlier than late this evening.
</P>
<P>
"Setting November 28 as the date for demonstrations is
something illogical since the government will not have time to
meet and study a request," said the interior minister, who is
also deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The powerful Confederation of Trade Unions (CTU) last week
informed the Interior Ministry of the protest plan.
</P>
<P>
The CTU, which groups various labor unions with an estimated
membership of about 400,000, asked the government to "take
necessary measures to protect the demonstrators and their right
to express their demands freely and peacefully."
</P>
<P>
The committee organizing the protests met at the CTU's Beirut
headquarters Tuesday and announced it was not intimidated by the
government warnings.
</P>
<P>
"We will go down to the streets and they do not have the right
to stop us," said Elias Abu Rizk, head of the CTU.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he expected a confrontation with the
authorities, Abu Rizk said, "I don't know. But if such things
happen the authorities must take the responsibility."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that such confrontations will not happen," he added.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Construction Boom Pushes Up Economy in Southwest China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The economies of vast inland
regions in southwest China are expected to greatly benefit from a
construction boom.
</P>
<P>
New railways, roads and ports are not only bringing the region
closer to the rest of the country, but also providing shortcuts
for the regions to reach the sea.
</P>
<P>
The regions, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, and
part of Guangdong, are extremely rich in natural resources. But
regional economies and opening-up have been slower than in coastal
cities, partly because of poor transportation.
</P>
<P>
Though cheap labor is abundant, the potential of many minerals
has never been tapped to the full, since production output has to
be tailored to the transportation capacities available.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the importance of economic take-off in the region in
the overall national economic development plan, the Central
Government, as early as in 1992, decided to accelerate the
construction of ports in Beibu Bay in Guangxi. It was seen as the
first step in building a passage to the sea for inland regions.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the annual handling capacity of major ports, such
as Zhanjiang, Beihai, Fangcheng, Qinzhou, of the Beibu Bay, will
be raised to 25 million tons in 2000, from the present 10 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
Another major move is the building of a rail trunk linking
Nanning, capital of Guangxi, with Kunming, capital of neighboring
Yunnan, and the double-tracking of a rail line linking Litang in
Guangxi, with the port city of Zhanjiang in Guangdong.

of Siemens AG, provides information technology, including PCs,
UNIX systems and ATM machines, to the Chinese government, as well
as to the banking, transportation and manufacturing sectors in the
country.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Full Use of Rainwater </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese farmer Zhang Shigui,
of Dingxi county in northwest China's Gansu province, has no
worries about water supplies for his family and for his crops.
</P>
<P>
With eight pits collecting rainwater, Zhang and the other five
members of the family, now have enough water for drinking and for
irrigating their 0.7 hectares of farmland.
</P>
<P>
This year the household harvested 5,000 kilograms of grain and
bred nine animals. With income for the household reaching 4,800
yuan, the family has finally shown poverty the door.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is only one of the first to reap the benefits of a
rainwater-collecting project in Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Dingxi, located on the Loess Plateau, is famous for its poverty
because of hostile weather and a tough environment. With hardly
any rainfall the farmers have been forced to organise their farm
production based on the weather.
</P>
<P>
To pull residents out of poverty, the local government carried
out rainwater collecting projects after probing the experience of
farmers, and with suggestions by experts.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, living problem can be easily solved for
households of five members when they build a cement collecting
space, and two pits for collecting rainwater in their backyards
and develop backyard economies.
</P>
<P>
Gansu has invested 300 million yuan in the project, solving
drinking water problems for six million people.
</P>
<P>
Rainwater collected has also been used for agriculture, with
statistics showing that the per-unit output of a piece of farmland
irrigated with rainwater is 30 percent higher than with usual
methods.
</P>
<P>
Around 4,000 hectares of farmland are being irrigated with
rainwater collected through the project.
</P>
<P>
International farming experts have highly praised the
initiative.

valuable experience for the world.
</P>
<P>
According to the local government, the province plans to spread
the use of rainwater irrigation to 5,000 ha of farmland in 12
counties next year.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Witnesses Lowest Gold Output in 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gold
production this year is expected to drop by 30 tons to around
493.5 tons, compared with the 522.4 tons produced last year, the
lowest level in 40 years, said a source obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Roger Baxter, senior economist of the Chamber of
Mines, the gold industry was projecting production at between 492
and 495 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's gold output last fell to below 500 tons in 1956 when
494.4 tons were produced. As recently as 1993 South Africa was still
producing more than 600 tons per year, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Baxter attributed the decline in production over the past
three years to a range of factors, including mines opting for
quality mining at the expense of tonnage, lack of flexibility
about public holidays and declining labour productivity.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chamber, costs per unit ton of ore mined this
year have risen by about 34 percent over the year 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, Baxter said gold output would rebounce to the 500 ton
mark next year, where it would stabilize for the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
"The industry is going through a renaissance, and change is coming
through," said Baxter.
</P>
<P>
Work practices are being reorganized to this effect and there is
a more flexible investment in labour. Mines are also working smarter
with human capital, he promised.

MACAO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Macao is planning to hold joint
car races with neighboring Zhuhai City in Guangdong province, and
discussion of the cooperation is under way, according to a Macao
government official.
</P>
<P>
Joao Manuel Antunes, director of the Macao Tourism Office, told
reporters on Monday that Macao plans to hold joint car races with
Zhuhai, and the two sides are discussing the issue of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Although he kept his mouth shut on the details of the

"The Zhuhai side has the final say of the joint race," he said.
</P>

The director added that the car race in Zhuhai has no negative
effect on Macao's annual grand prix.

"Those watching the race in Zhuhai may come by the way to Macao
 for sightseeing or even stay in Macao," he said. "That will be a

<HEADLINE> Arafat Holds First Meeting with Jewish Settlers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 27 (Xinhua) -- In the first such
encounter, Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat met
Tuesday night with a delegation of Jewish settlers to discuss
mutual cooperation.
</P>
<P>
English daily the Jerusalem Post reported today that there were
10 Jewish settlers in the delegation which met Arafat at a Greek
Orthodox church compound in Bethlehem, 12 kilometers south of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Issues discussed at the meeting ranged from joint economic
projects to security in the disputed West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was not announced in advance and did
not invite journalists, was described as friendly and free of
rancor. The settlers stressed that they did not represent
anybody.
</P>
<P>
The settlers, some of whom came from Hebron and Gush
Etzion, reiterated that they would remain in the Palestinian
territories, and hoped they could live in peace with their
Palestinian neighbors, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Several settlers urged Arafat to open Hebron to Jews, saying
that maintaining the city as an armed camp with thousands of
Israeli troops and Palestinian police would result in an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly agreed to the view, saying he would study
the proposals presented by some settlers on expanding Jewish
businesses in Hebron to help alleviate Arab unemployment. Arafat
added he would support projects to promote dialogue and
reconciliation between Arabs and Jews.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also assured the settlers that the
PLO has removed all of the clauses of the Palestinian
Covenant that called for destruction of Israel, but he said
he has yet to decide whether to present a new covenant.
</P>
<P>
Israeli government has so far remained unconvinced of
Arafat's promise on changing the covenant as long as he
fails to produce a new one that conforms to Israel's
demands.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Arafat and the Jewish settlers came at a
time when tension between the settlers and Palestinians
increased. On Sunday, dozens of Palestinian drivers blocked a
main road to the Netzarim settlement in Gaza, a face-to-face
confrontation with Israeli soldiers ensued.
</P>
<P>
Israel blamed Arafat for organizing the incident in order
to pressure it in the absence of an agreement on Israeli
troop redeployment in Hebron. Last week, the PA and PLO
declared a new campaign to combat the expansion of Jewish
settlements by setting up an anti-settlement committee.
</P>
<P>
However, hardline Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu
vowed Tuesday that he would continue expanding the settlements
regardless of the Palestinian outcry.

<HEADLINE> WB Expected to Lend China 2.7 Billion US Dollars by Next June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank is expected to
approve 2.7 billion US dollars in loans for another 14 projects in
China before the 1997 fiscal year ends next June, according to the
Bank's resident mission in China.
</P>
<P>
A new three-year rolling lending program, updated last June

</P>
<P>
The Bank has approved loans of over 300 million US dollars for
two Chinese projects since July this year, indicating that it will
lend another 2.7 billion US dollars for 14 more China projects
before the end of next June.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has committed a total of 25.488 billion US dollars in

China's use of World Bank funds entered a peak period at the
start of the 1990s, with borrowings hitting an all-time high of
3.17 billion US dollars in the fiscal year between July 1992 and
June 1993. Since then, China has been the Bank's largest borrower
for four consecutive years.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Import 250,000 Tons of Fertilizer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh would have to import
250,000 tons of fertilizer this year due to a production shortfall
of 50,000 tons from its 2.1 million ton target, official sources
said here today.
</P>
<P>
According to previous estimates, the import stood at 200,000
tons with the estimated production and consumption at 2.1 million
and 2.3 million tons respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the new situation, production this year would be about 2.05
million tons, thus creating additional supply shortfall of 50,000
tons.
</P>
<P>
The additional supply shortfall was a result from reduced gas
supply to fertilizer plants while the government had diverted gas
supply to power plants to augment electricity production, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
To face supply requirement in the ensuing peak plantation
season from January to March, the government had already placed an
order for 17,000 tons from abroad, the sources added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Eastern Germany will suffer
from deteriorating economic depression in 1997, predicted a survey
by leading economic institutes.
</P>
<P>
Construction industry, the pillar sector in the area, will
undergo a contraction next year with nearly half of the
businesses considering layoffs in the next months under
the pressure of declining orders.
</P>
<P>
The study by the Halei Research Institute and other top think
tanks also said the manufacturing sector will also suffer from the
similar sores.
</P>
<P>
Analysts blamed the depression to improper economic structure
and low productivity that lingers at 54 percent of that in the
west.
</P>
<P>
Germany has been troubled by economic doldrums since 1995, and
the eastern part the hardest hit with unemployment there close to
20 percent, twice the national rate.
</P>
<P>
Though seeing several boom years following unification in 1990,
the east is now dragging behind, with ever increasing bankruptcies
and scarce new private investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has worked out a
major power generation plan in a bid to meet the country's ever
growing demand and prevent the recurrence of frequent blackouts,
official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The plan, estimated at 75 billion rupees (1.32 billion U.S.
dollars), will be implemented by the Ceylon Electricity Board with
the cooperation of the private sector, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The plan puts special emphasis on both hydro and thermal power
generation.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's present power generation capacity is 1,387
megawatts, of which 1,137 megawatts come from hydro-electricity
scheme and the balance from thermal stations.
</P>
<P>
The country's demand for electricity is about 5,000 megawatt
hours this year and is expected to rise to 5,200 megawatt hours
next year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A severe drought earlier this year caused a seven-month
electricity crisis in Sri Lanka, which resulted in heavy damages
to the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Outstanding Staff Members of Complaint Office Awarded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Awards have been presented to
staff who handle complaints from the public and their offices
affiliated to the country's people's congresses at various levels.
</P>
<P>
The awards for remarkable work were presented to staff and a
number of offices Tuesday at a conference in Yantai, east China's
Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
attached significant importance to the conference, sponsored by
the General Office of the Standing Committee of the NPC, saying
that "the meeting is the first of such kind since the founding of
the people's republic in 1949."
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that the Chinese Communist Party has always
paid great attention to complaint letters and calls from the
people, and the practice has become part of the country's
socialist democracy since the establishment of China's people's
congress system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the complaint offices, serving as bridges between
governmental organizations and the masses, could relieve
officials' worries and solve problems for common citizens.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that staff at complaint offices explain laws and
regulations to ordinary citizens by handling complaint calls and
letters, greatly improving the image and position of people's
congresses in the minds of the people.
</P>
<P>
Wang Songda, deputy secretary-general of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress, said that the Standing
Committee of the NPC is scheduled to map out a supervisory law,
which will provide legal protection for the work of complaint
offices.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that complaint offices affiliated to people's
congresses are certain to face more complicated problems as the
country deepens its reform and opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
As many as 38 advanced units and 67 outstanding individuals
received awards at the conference.

<HEADLINE> Canada Proposes Airdrops to Zaire via Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Canada has proposed setting up
a military base at Entebbe, Uganda, to launch airdrops of food to
starving refugees in Zaire, Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The base would be used for, among other things, reconnaissance
flights for the airdrops, Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
But he insisted that Canada needs to have clear agreement from
its international partners to make the proposal work.
</P>
<P>
"We can't do this alone," he was quoted as saying by the
media here. "We need to have the cooperation of other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the countries are willing to work with us. Others
still have questions."
</P>
<P>
Canada's efforts at organizing a relief mission to Rwandan
refugees in Zaire has been frustrated mainly by the ever changing
situation in the African country.
</P>
<P>
Recent changes in Zaire and Rwanda have thrown doubt on the
need for a Canadian-led multinational military force to deliver
humanitarian aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
Canada estimates that 200,000 refugees still remain in Zaire
after hundreds of thousands have returned to Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Reports Deficit for 1996/97 Fiscal Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia suffered a deficit
of more than 200 million U.S. dollars in its balance of payment in
the first six months of the 1996/97 fiscal year beginning April,
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad told parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's current account deficit widened by 20.6
percent to 4.521 billion U.S. dollars in the April-September
period from 3.749 billion U.S. dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Parliamentary Budget Commission, the finance
minister said exports in the first half of the fiscal year
amounted to 25.203 billion U.S. dollars while imports reached
23.069 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia's economic growth of 8.1 percent in 1995
signaled overheating.
</P>
<P>
"This situation is reflected by high inflation and the pressure
of the current account deficit," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country's current account deficit of the fiscal 1996/97 is
estimated to widen to 8.7 billion U.S. dollars, or about four
percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), from 7 billion U.S.
dollars, or about 3.2 percent of the GDP, in 1995/96.
</P>
<P>
The government is working to reduce the current account deficit
with programs to boost non-oil exports and empower local service
industries, the finance minister said.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Exports to Chile Rises Significantly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Mexican exports to Chile
increased a third while Chilean exports to Mexico remained at the
same level in the first three quarters this year over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Mexican exports to Chile rose to 709.4 million U.S. dollars
during these nine months, a 69-percent increase over the same
period last year, when they totaled 420.6 million dollars,
according to Chile's Foreign Ministry Export Promotion Department.
</P>
<P>
Mexican exports to Chile could reach close to 1 billion dollars
for 1996, as compared with 600.6 million dollars for last year,
the department predicted.
</P>
<P>
The drastic increase in Mexican exports to Chile was due to
Chile's economic and financial stability, reasonable prices,
better quality, and especially to the bilateral free trade
agreement effected this year.
</P>
<P>
In September, 1991, the two countries signed an agreement which
guaranteed 97 percent of their bilateral trade duty free starting
from 1996.
</P>
<P>
Automobiles accounted for around 30 percent of Mexican exports,
followed by television sets, steel products and chemicals.

MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The last two Russian military
units in Chechnya will be pulled out by the beginning of next
year, Russia's military chief in Chechnya said today in Grozny,
capital of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
The 205th brigade of the defence ministry and the 101st brigade
of the interior ministry will leave Chechnya before January 25,
said Vladimir Sukhoruchenko, commander of the Russian Joint Forces
in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Sukhoruchenko made the announcement during his talks with
Mumadi Saidayev, the rebel Chechen chief of staff, about the issue
of Russian troops withdrawal from Chechnya, Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops will leave simultaneously by planes, trains
and buses, Sukhoruchenko said, adding they are to move with them
all the weapons, ammunitions and military installations.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree last weekend,
ordering withdrawal of all Russian troops from Chechnya by the

are scheduled to start.
</P>
<P>
Following the decree, a deal was signed by Prime Minister
Victor Chernomyrdin and the head of the rebel Chechen government,
Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
A great number of deputies in the State Duma, the lower house
of the Russian parliament, insist that both Yeltsin's decree and
the Chernomyrdin-Maskhadov deal are unconstitutional and will lead
to Chechnya's secession from the Russian Federation.

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up Network of Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese women may soon be
making contact with their sisters from the rest of the world
through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A network that will connect Chinese women with the world, via
the worldwide web, is under preparation.
</P>
<P>
The information center of the Chinese Women's College (CWC) is
now busy collecting as much information as possible to feed into
the network.
</P>
<P>
The network is designed to promote China's study on women's
issues, and strengthen exchanges and communication between Chinese
women, and women from other countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
By linking relevant research institutes with grassroot women's
federations, the network will also enable women across the country
to be better and more effectively informed.
</P>
<P>
"For example," said Sun, "when the World Bank announced a plan
to help poor women with small loans, we could have sent the
information through the network immediately, so that women in poor
areas could learn how to apply for the funds."
</P>
<P>
Sun Xiaomei, director of the CWC information center, said that
it is very important to set up the network for the study of
women's issues, and methods of information communications must
keep up with the pace of time.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 yuan (about 36,000 U.S. dollars) is required to
cover the cost of the network construction. The CWC is negotiating
for cooperation with some network companies and international
foundations.
</P>
<P>
Sun and her colleagues are now trying to establish an
information data bank specializing in women's issues. The data
bank will include books, newspapers, periodicals published in
Chinese, languages of ethnical minorities, and foreign languages,
papers and audio-video material.
</P>
<P>
CWC has collected periodicals about women published in
China. Sun and her colleagues are also checking major newspapers,
such as People's Daily, Guangming Daily, for more information
about women.
</P>
<P>
Information exchanges are expected to be carried out in printed
form before the network is set up in grassroots units. Sun plans
to mail the first information letter in December to local women
research institutes and women's federations.

<HEADLINE> Cuba to Revoke Approval to Spanish Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said today that it intends
to revoke its approval to the Spanish ambassador for his
interference in its internal affairs, saying that Spain has become
a spearhead for the U.S. interests against the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
The decision to withdraw the approval to Ambassador Jose
Cordech Planas, who "made statements not appropriate for a
diplomat" on October 30 in the Spanish ABC daily, is inevitable,
said the Foreign Ministry in a statement published by the official
Granma newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Cordech declared a special preference for developing other ties
than his relations with the Cuban government and felt it was his
obligation to leave the door of his embassy open to "dissidents"
whom he would help in every possible way.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry said Cordech's statements can only be
interpreted as open and unacceptable interference in Cuba's
internal affairs and an unequivocal breach of the 1961 Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
</P>
<P>
Spain has become a spearhead for U.S.interests within the
European Union, the ministry pointed out, saying "this kind of
behavior from Spain towards the island is unacceptable and
extremely worrisome."
</P>
<P>
In March, the United States tightened its blockade against Cuba
by imposing sanctions against any foreign firms that buy or sell
the properties of U.S. citizens seized by the Cuban government
after the 1959 Cuba Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Abel Matutes, the Spanish foreign minister, said his
ambassador's statements are "extremely prudent and open to
dialogue" as well as congruent with the Spanish government's
policy towards Cuba.
</P>
<P>
On November 7, Matutes said on Spanish television that the
Spanish government's policy is to lend support to what it
classified as a "peaceful transition to democracy in Cuba."
</P>
<P>
During the recent VI Ibero-American Summit in Chile, several
Spanish officials declared their intention to seek what they
called "democratic transition" in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government said it has lodged a formal protest with
Spain against the "clumsy political interference."
</P>
<P>
Cuba is willing to maintain and develop relations with Spain
and hopes that the Spanish government will reconsider its behavior
towards Cuba, said the Foreign Ministry statement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Asia's Economy Slows Down But Remains Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 27 (Xinhua) -- After years of rapid
expansion, Asia's economic growth is slowing down this year, but
the growth will remain healthy and normal, according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
The region's growth for 1996 is estimated at 7.3 percent in
terms of gross domestic product, down from 8 percent in 1995 and
8.3 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown, Asia remains far ahead of other regions
of the world in economic growth. According to the International
Monetary Fund, the global economy is predicted to grow 3.8 percent
this year.
</P>
<P>
Economists attribute Asia's slowdown largely to a sharp decline
in exports and the deliberate efforts made by China, Indonesia and
Malaysia to check overheating.
</P>
<P>
Combined with falling inflation rates and a likely rebound of
export growth next year, most Asian economies will show healthy
growth through the end of the decade, they say.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, China has further improved
its macro-economic conditions by continuing its economic
adjustments, and has effectively held inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
Having maintained a double-digit growth annually over the last
few years, China's GNP (gross national product) is expected to
grow 9.5 percent this year, and the rise in prices will be held to
around 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at "China Summit 1996" held in Beijing on November 13,
Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji said that China's economy will
"develop continuously, rapidly, and healthily with an annual
increase in the GNP of eight to nine percent" in the next 15
years.
</P>
<P>
Japan is embarking on a road to gradual economic recovery after
a period of sluggishness.
</P>
<P>
In a November report on the state of the economy, Japan's
Economic Planning Agency reiterated that the country's private
consumption is continuing to recover gradually, and housing starts
are increasing at a rapid pace, fueling a rise in output. It also
noted that the pace of decline in exports is slowing down.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that Japan will achieve an annual growth rate
of 3 percent in 1996, compared with 0.9 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Specialists with the Asian Development Bank predict that the
four tigers -- Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan --
will suffer a big slide in economic growth from 7.4 percent in
1995 to 6.2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown is mainly due to weak exports and poor performance
in a wide range of activities, according to a study by Crosby
Research, an international research institution.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which averaged nearly 13 percent annual growth in
the 1980s, has fluctuated in single digit in subsequent years.
Some South Korean economists believe the economy will average less
than 7 percent in annual expansion for the rest of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The slowdown is generally blamed on weak exports since the
economy is heavily dependent on exports of a handful of items,
namely, semiconductors, automobiles, steel and petrochemicals, and
all of these are currently experiencing weak prices in the
international markets.
</P>
<P>
Southeast Asia is predicted to grow slower at 7.3 percent this
year, as against the 8.1 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is keeping its promise of slowing business activity
and GDP growth has slowed quite sharply this year to an estimated
8.3 percent from 9.5 percent last year. To some extent this is due
to the slowdown in the electronics sector but more significantly
is the result of policy action over the last year.
</P>
<P>
Since October 1995, the country's lending rates have risen,
various administrative measures have been imposed on consumption
and the housing market, and more conservative fiscal position has
been adopted.
</P>
<P>
As a result of policy action to tackle overheating pressures,
Thailand's economic growth slowed this year but to more
sustainable levels. And the Central Bank of Thailand recently
lowered its forecast for this year's growth to 7 percent, down
from the mid-year prediction of 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Most economists believe that the current economic slowdown is a
cyclical phenomenon, affecting other countries in the region as
well. But the export slowdown has given new impetus to fears that
Thailand is not as well-positioned as it should be to compete in
world markets.
</P>
<P>
However, the Philippines deviated from the region's growth
slowdown. The Philippines' GDP grew 5.5 percent in the first half
of 1996, up from 4.8 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is one of the few economies in Asia that are
enjoying stronger export growth this year, with exports rising a
healthy 17.6 percent in September from a year earlier to 1.87
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate for October inched up slightly to 4.7 percent
from 4.4 percent in September, but well below the 5.1 percent
target level set with the International Monetary Fund, according
to official figures.
</P>
<P>
In South Asia, Economists generally think a strong economic
growth should be maintained, probably at 6 percent. India's GDP
expanded by nearly 7 percent in the first half of 1996, compared
with the 6.3 percent a year earlier. As for its neighbor,
Pakistan, a growth rate of 5.7 percent is predicted for 1996.
</P>
<P>
Many economists believe that Asia's booming economies are on
course for healthy growth well into the 21st century although the
road ahead may not be smooth.

<HEADLINE> Czech President to Have Lung Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Czech President Vaclav Havel
will undergo an exploratory surgery on his lungs next week,
according to his spokesman here today.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Ladislav Spacek said the president would have "a
necessary operative procedure" because doctors could not make an
exact diagnosis on the basis of X-ray.
</P>
<P>
Havel, 60, was hospitalized on Monday, more than a week after
his office said he was suffering from pneumonia. The spokesman's
statement did not mention any specific illness except "lung
ailment".
</P>
<P>
The Czech news agency CTK quoted the chief of staff at the
Third Surgical Clinic in central Prague where Havel will be
treated as saying the procedure was considered to be a
"medium-serious operation as would be any lung surgery".
</P>
<P>
Havel cancelled a planned two-day state visit to Ukraine last
week and on Monday called off plans for a summit of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe on December 2
and 3 in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the president was in "good physical and
psychological condition" and is in constant contact with his
office, monitoring events in the country.
</P>
<P>
Havel has had various ailments, none considered serious,
during his nearly seven years as president of Czechoslovakia and
later of the independent Czech Republic, after a peaceful split
with Slovakia at the beginning of 1993.

the past few days:
</P>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES -- The index of industrial output for October in
Argentina rose 4.6 percent over the previous month and was 11.7
percent higher than the same month last year, the Latin American
Economic Research Foundation (FIEL) said.
</P>
<P>
Since industrial output fell nearly 3 percent in September, the

</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- Venezuela's international reserves reached a record
14.9 billion U.S. dollars this month and are expected to exceed 15
billion dollars by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly due to higher petroleum revenues
resulting from higher crude oil prices, currently 20.8 dollars
per barrel.
</P>
<P>
SANTIAGO -- Chile saw 7 percent economic growth in the first
nine months of this year, leading Latin America for the second
year running, Chile's central bank said.

</P>
<P>
In 1995, Chile's 8.5 percent growth ranked first among the
Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
MANAGUA -- Nicaragua will issue coffee bonds next year to
finance its coffee production, a producers' organization said.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of these bonds, backed by an estimated yearly
production worth 100 million U.S. dollars, will raise fresh
finance for coffee producers, the Nicaraguan Coffee Growers Union
(UNICAFE) said.
</P>
<P>
Coffee represents nearly 5 percent of Nicaragua's gross
domestic product (GDP) and 27-30 percent of farm exports.
</P>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO -- Uruguay's Central Bank will issue 70 million
U.S. dollars worth of bonds on November 27.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A Cuban American who pressured
Cuban athletes to defect to the United States has been sentenced
to 15 years in prison by the Havana provincial court.
</P>
<P>
Juan Ignacio Hernandez Nodar, who lives in Venezuela, was
arrested on August 12 during the World Youth Baseball
Championships in Cuba's central Sancti Spiritus province.
</P>
<P>
During the trial, evidence was given that Hernandez Nodar took
part in five felonies of helping athletes to get visas to go to
the United States and illegally leave Cuba, today's official
Granma newspaper quoted judicial officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hernandez Nodar bribed, pressured and blackmailed Cuban
athletes to defect. He and another man Joe Cubas, who was
allegedly the mastermind behind an organization helping athletes
to defect, systematically attended sports events in which Cuban
teams competed, mainly overseas, to get them to defect.

<HEADLINE> China to Revitalize Traditional Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- China is planning a national
strategy that will revitalize traditional Chinese medicine and
make its practice acceptable as a world science within the next
decade, "China Daily" said today.
</P>
<P>
The goal will be achieved through the applications of modern
science and technology and by fostering qualified practitioners of
traditional Chinese medicine, the newspaper quoted She Jing,
Vice-Administrator of the State Administration of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The vast rural areas will serve as centers for the development
of traditional Chinese medicine, which will help the country to
achieve the target of "health for all" by the year 2000, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Discussions on the unique qualities and advantages of
traditional Chinese medicine will be held early next month when a
national health conference opens in Beijing, She told the
newspaper,
</P>
<P>
Traditional Chinese medicine is one of the important components
of Chinese culture, and it has made great contributions to
improving the health of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the administration indicate that by the end of
last year, the State had set up some 2,500 medical units
specializing in traditional Chinese medicine, including 123
hospitals using ethnic medicines.
</P>
<P>
Staffed with 530,000 medical practitioners, the hospitals and
clinics serve more than 200 million people each year.
</P>
<P>
With over 57 percent of the hospitals located in rural areas,
they are able to provide medical treatment for farmers and other
rural residents.
</P>
<P>
The quality of service has also improved. New developments have
been reported in treating common and complex illnesses such as
malignant tumors, and heart and brain vascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
There are currently over 30 higher-learning institutions for
the study of traditional Chinese medicine and ethnic medicines.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the five international training centers for
traditional Chinese medicine in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Nanjing and Xiamen, the World Health Organization has also set up
seven collaboration centers with the State Administration of
Traditional Chinese Medicine to promote international exchanges
and conduct research.

<P>
WARSAW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Polish currency issued before
January 1, 1995 will cease to be legal tender after the end of the
year, the media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Anyone with the old zloty will have to change them for the new
legal currency between 1997-2010 at the National Bank of Poland or
other designated banks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank started issuing new zloty on January 1, 1995
with a currency value 10,000 times higher than the old which had
become devalued by inflation.
</P>
<P>
The old zloty enjoyed a two-year transition period until the
end of 1996 when both currencies could be used. During that time
all goods and services had to be labeled with prices in the old
and new zloty.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Cites Outstanding Young Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- Party General Secretary Jiang
Zemin has urged 20 outstanding young farmers in China to work
harder and make greater contributions to social development and
economic construction in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The young farmers, who were honored as "the nation's
outstanding young farmers" last month, wrote a letter to President
Jiang, reporting their work in rural areas, and expressing their
determination to get more farmers to join them in achieving a
common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In a letter responding to the 20 award-winning farmers, Jiang
praised them as "examples for young farmers and other young people
in the whole country", saying they have made outstanding
achievements in invigorating China's agriculture and rural economy.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is vital to the survival and development of the
Chinese nation," Jiang said, adding that issues of agriculture,
rural areas and farmers have a great bearing on China's
revolution, construction and reform, and on its economic
prosperity, social stability, national strength and the happiness
of people.
</P>
<P>
"At no time should we neglect agriculture," Jiang said, adding,
"Only when rural areas become rich can the whole country be rich
and only when life of farmers becomes better-off can the whole
nation be prosperous."
</P>
<P>
He called on officials at all levels to pay close attention to
agriculture, stressing that efforts must be made to push forward
China's agricultural development to a new stage by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
To achieve the goal of agricultural modernization, and to build
socialist new rural areas with Chinese characteristics, young
people shoulder heavier responsibilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that more and more young farmers will
devote themselves to the country's agricultural development and
promotion of material progress and cultural and ethical
advancement in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Keeps Open Possibility of Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine does not rule out the
possibility to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO),
a spokesman of the Ukrainian foreign ministry said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Igor Harchenko told a press conference that Ukraine hopes to
sign a special partnership agreement with the NATO next summer at
a NATO summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
A reason for the consideration is Russia's territorial claims
to Sevastopol -- the base of the disputed Black Sea Fleet,
Ukraine's First Vice Foreign Minister Anton Buteiko echoed, who
visited several NATO members last week.
</P>
<P>
Buteiko said that the development of the European security
structure and the evolution of Europe's political and military
organizations also caused the former Soviet republic to keep open
the possibility of joining the NATO.
</P>
<P>
Another important factor for the move was that some Central and
Eastern European countries had applied to join the NATO, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week Buteiko visited Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Harchenko, also director of the policy analysis and planning
department of the foreign ministry, said Buteiko's visit had made
great achievement, adding NATO had accepted Ukraine's proposal to
set up a special partnership between them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Death rate stemming from drug
overdose in Berlin grew rapidly to 135 in the first nine months
this year, a notable rise over last year's total of 93, the city's
police chief said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the city council, Hagen Saberschinsky said Berlin
has become the nation's biggest camp for drug users, where drugs
are cheaper and more easily available to addicts than other
places. He added the serious thing is that the Berliners have not
yet realized the harms drug taking could do to people and society.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city council, still divided over whether to
regulate drug taking, is far from taking any effective measures
soon to fight against the rampant drug dealing and drug taking.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown Finds Illegal Producer of Video Discs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A large illegal VCD-production
center has been closed down by the Guangzhou City Administration
for Industry and Commerce (GCAIC), according to "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
A report yesterday by the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce said local law-enforcement officers with the GCAIC
tracked down the production center early last month.
</P>
<P>
They found equipment worth an estimated 20.45 million yuan
($2.46 million) -- including an air compressor, a freezer, 60,000
pirated VCDs and a German-made 120mm LD producer valued at 17
million yuan ($2.048 million), according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It said one suspect was arrested on the spot and another five
people ran away.
</P>
<P>
Initial investigation identified the suspected group as
Dongshan District, Guangzhou, a firm that had allegedly signed an
agreement with a Hong Kong-based engineering company to purchase
VCD equipment for secret production purposes.
</P>
<P>
The production reportedly began in April in a farmer's house in
the township of zhongcun, Panyun, near Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown, now under further investigation, is considered a
strong step to protect intellectual property rights and fight
against piracy in VCD production in China, noted the report.

BRASILIA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will invest four
billion U.S. dollars in mining operations before the year 2010 to
boost the production and export of minerals, newspaper reports

dollar trade surplus, reports quoted the National Department of
Mining Production as saying.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Medics Urged to Combat HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A local health official has
urged medics to carry out a fight against HIV and AIDS, saying the
deadly disease has become a potential threat to the country.
</P>
<P>
"We must act immediately to carry out HIV/AIDS prevention and
control work," Zhang Chenglie, director of the Department of
Public Health of Zhejiang Province, said in a public letter to
medics, which has widely carried by newspapers across the country.
</P>
<P>
He asked medical workers to not only avoid any behavior which
may lead to HIV infection, but also spread knowledge about
HIV/AIDS prevention among ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
The medics were urged to fulfill HIV/AIDS monitoring tasks,
while reporting every HIV infection or AIDS case in time to health
departments.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said hospitals and medics should provide safe blood
products and injections to prevent HIV virus from spreading
through contaminated blood and needles.
</P>
<P>
"Every city and county in Zhejiang should set up at least one
hospital responsible for diagnosing and treating AIDS related
diseases," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also urged medics to provide a better service to HIV
carriers and AIDS patients, as well as to protect their privacy.
</P>
<P>
East China's Zhejiang Province has reported 42 HIV-positive
people and five AIDS patients. By the end of August, China had
discovered 4,305 HIV infection cases, including 131 cases of
full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned of an uncontrolled AIDS explosion across
the country if strong steps are not taken to curb the frantic
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Ministry of Public Health said that
serious HIV/AIDS epidemics in neighboring countries may have
an impact on an HIV epidemic in China.
</P>
<P>
A large number of migrant population in the country, a general
unawareness of HIV/AIDS, drug abuse, prostitution, illegal blood
supplies, and the drastic increase of sexually transmitted disease
cases may also contribute to the epidemic, they warned.

BEIJING, November 27 (Xinhua) -- A three-story building and a
workshop built in a protected area close to an emperor's mausoleum
in northwest China's Shaanxi Province are to be demolished.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the provincial department of cultural relics say
that the buildings, built last year without permission from
authorized departments, violate the national law on protection of
cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
The buildings were erected in the protection area of the
mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang, the first emperor of the Qin Dynasty
(221-206 BC) who unified China. The mausoleum, located in Qinling
township in Lintong County, is under state protection.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, any construction project in the
protection area of historical site under state protection should
have permission from provincial government and state cultural
administrations.
</P>
<P>
The three-story building was built with permission of the
county cultural department, which had no right to make such
decision.
</P>
<P>
The workshop, an acetylene-making township enterprise which
became operational early this year, was also built without
permission.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian Supreme Court
said this evening it had denied the request of the opposition
coalition Zajedno (Together) to overrule the decision of
Belgrade's first district court to recast ballots in some of
Belgrade's constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia has also
denied the opposition's request to ban the holding of a third
round of municipal elections, the Tanjug news agency quoted a
court statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
In view of this ruling and the city electoral commission's
decision, the third round of voting to elect members of the city
council from the disputed constituencies will be held on
Wednesday, November 27, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The third-round elections for the Belgrade assembly deputies
will be held in 232 out of 1,010 election precincts in 55 election
polls in 14 Belgrade municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the opposition coalition, which comprises the
Serbian Renewal Movement, the Democratic Party, and the Serbian
Civic Alliance, have said they would boycott the third round of
elections and did not recognize the official court decisions.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno claimed they had won the majority in some key cities in
the local elections on November 17, including Belgrade, and had
organized a number of large-scale rallies over the past few days
in Belgrade and some other major cities in Serbia to protest
against the alleged government fraud and unjust court ruling.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Confidence Unchanged in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence of the
U.S. in the economy held steady in November, with most Americans
remaining optimistic about current business conditions as the
all-important holiday sales season approached, a private research
group reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index was 107.3 this
month, the same as the revised October figure. The index jumped
6.9 points in July and five points in August, hitting a six-year
high before weakening slightly in September and October.
</P>
<P>
The Board's Present Situation Index, a separate measure of
sentiment on current business conditions, rose to a seven-year
high of 131 in November, up six points from October.
</P>
<P>
The index, calculated from a base of 100, is derived from
responses to questions sent to 5,000 households nationwide,
polling people on matters ranging from job availability to
home-buying plans.
</P>
<P>
Today's report shows consumers are quiet confident about the
present economic situation, with only 13 percent of those surveyed
saying current business conditions are bad.
</P>
<P>
But only 14 percent of those surveyed are expecting better
business conditions for the next six months.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Presidential Meeting Called Off Over Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A rally of Muslims angry at
the slow pace of implementing peace accords forced the
postponement of a session of Bosnia's three-man presidency today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting among the three presidents, Muslim Alija
Izetbegovic, Serb Momcilo Krajisnik and Croat Kresimir Zubak, was
scheduled at the downtown National Museum, but was called off
because of the rally just outside the venue.
</P>
<P>
The rally were attended by hundreds of Muslim people, mostly
refugees or relatives of those missing in the war, who demanded
full implementation of the Dayton peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the crowd gathered outside the building of
High Representative Carl Bildt and smashed the car of his deputy
Michael Steiner as he was to step in. Steiner managed to escape
from the mob by taking an armored car.
</P>
<P>
Although NATO peacekeeping soldiers kept the crowd from the
National Museum, the presidency members accepted the proposal of
Bildt to postpone the meeting for safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was rescheduled for Wednesday, Bildt's office said.

<HEADLINE> Clarke Unveils Pre-Poll Budget to Win Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke unveiled today the 1997/98 budget with
a modest cut in basic income tax and more spending on schools,
hospitals and the police designed to woo voters in the run-up to
the general election next May.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his last pre-election budget at the House of
Commons, Clarke said that he would lower the basic rate of income
tax from 24 percent to 23 percent, the lowest level for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
This would cut overall taxes by 2 billion pounds (3.34 billion
U.S. dollars), and would make the average family 370 pounds (618
dollars) better off next year after inflation, he added.
</P>
<P>
To pay for the tax-cutting, he would reduce public spending,
raise a number of indirect taxes on items such as cars, petrol,
cigarettes and alcoholic soft drinks, and crack down on corporate
tax avoidance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in order to improve the state of Britain's major
public services, the government would spend an extra 1.6 billion
pounds (2.7 billion dollars) on health, 830 million pounds (1.39
billion dollars) on schools and 450 million pounds (751.5 million
dollars) on the police.
</P>
<P>
Clarke described the budget as "responsible" and "virtuous,"
saying that "this budget secures a prosperous future for all
sections of our people and their families. It is a budget not just
for today but for tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
The chancellor of the exchequer was optimistic about the
prospect of the economy, expecting the growth of the economy to
accelerate to 3.5 percent next year from 2.5 percent this year,
maintaining Britain's position as Europe's fast-growing major
economy.
</P>
<P>
"The British economy is in its fifth successive year of steady,
healthy economic growth, with falling unemployment and low
inflation. These are the best circumstances we have faced for a
generation," Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
Although Conservative politicians openly welcomed the budget,
privately some of them believed the overall net "giveaway" was not
big enough.
</P>
<P>
Describing the budget as "big on boasts" and "the last gasp
budget of a government whose time is up," main opposition Labor
Party leader Tony Blair said, "One thing we now know for certain
is that taxes will be higher at the next election than the last."

<HEADLINE> China on How to Improve Security Council Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat said today that the Security Council should continue to
improve its work so as to play a proper role in maintaining
international peace and security.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the General Assembly, Chinese Deputy
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Ambassador Wang
Xuexian outlined four areas where the council should try to
improve its work.
</P>
<P>
The council, before making major decisions, should fully hear
the views of the general membership, particularly those of the
countries in the region concerned and increase their participation
in the work of the council so as to enhance the accuracy and
authority of its decision-making, he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, it should be very prudent and take into full
consideration the humanitarian implications before adopting such
mandatory measures as sanctions and military intervention so as
to avoid any damage to innocent groups and further complication
of problems.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the council should particularly respect the views of
the countries and parties concerned and those of the countries
in the region concerned and encourage regional organizations to
play a proper role in the light of different circumstances.
</P>
<P>
And fourthly, it should refrain from exceeding its mandate to
trespass on the affairs of other bodies and should particularly
respect the authority of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly is hearing views from member states on
the annual report of the Security Council. Ambassador Wang said
that though less resolutions and presidential statements were
adopted as compared with the preceding 12-month, the council
remained very busy.
</P>
<P>
"It did a lot of work and made fresh contributions in
maintaining international peace and security," he said. "It also
made some decisions to improve its working methods and enhance its
transparency."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Official: Commercial Diplomacy Crucial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia believes that
commercial diplomacy could play a key role in the Balkans because
the interests of the countries in the region coincide in trade,
Yugoslav Deputy Foreign Minister Radoslav Bulajic said today.
</P>
<P>
At a round-table session on regional cooperation, Bulajic said
commercial diplomacy would in the next few years be central in the
international community's efforts to rebuild Bosnia and the rest
of former Yugoslavia, devastated by civil war and by the
international sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was organized by the Belgrade Institute of
International Politics and Economics as part of the international
scientific forum "Danube -- the River of Cooperation" and attended
by experts from Yugoslavia and about 20 economists from foreign
embassies in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Bulajic said the trade embargo against Yugoslavia, a crossroads
of European routes, had hit all the countries in the region,
hindering their development and mutual economic cooperation and
threatening world peace.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government said the four-year sanctions, which
were formally ended last month, have brought 50 billion U.S.
dollar losses to Yugoslavia alone.
</P>
<P>
Bulajic said new initiatives for cooperation in southeastern
Europe confirmed the strong determination of all countries in the
region to resolve problems together and actively take part in
European integration processes.
</P>
<P>
This includes the restoration of disrupted economic and other
ties with the former Yugoslavia, which had begun successfully, he
added.
</P>
<P>
This year has witnessed normalization of relations between
Yugoslavia and three former Yugoslav republics -- Macedonia,
Croatia and Bosnia, thus paving the way for resumption of economic
cooperation between the countries in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 59.5
million U.S. dollar loan to Jamaica to improve a section of the
Northern Coastal Highway.
</P>
<P>
The 92-kilometer section of the road, between Montego Bay and
Ocho Rios, will undergo enhancements that include resurfacing,
reconstruction alignment, curve flattening and realignment.
</P>
<P>
A pilot project to improve maintenance and to serve as a
nationwide model will also be financed.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at reducing cost and assisting business
expansion as well as promoting tourism. The other sections of the
Northern Coastal Highway with a total length of 270 kilometers
will also be improved with loan assistance from other bilateral
and multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the IDB-financed project is some 85 million
dollars. Local counterpart funds total 25.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: UN Assembly Should Play Greater Role, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- An overwhelming
majority of speakers called for strengthening of the role and
improvement of the functions of the United Nations General
Assembly, the most universal, democratic and transparent organ and
the forum offering equal opportunity for all the 185 member
states.
</P>
<P>
At meetings Monday and today, representatives of 23 countries
delivered statements on the strengthening of the U.N. system.
Among them, 19 speakers stressed the importance of strengthening
the role and authority of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Ambassador Nugroho Wisnumurti said that reforms in
the United Nations system must be undertaken with the full
concurrence and participation of the developing countries, which
constituted a majority of the membership. It was of pivotal
importance that the General Assembly, the highest deliberative and
decision-making organ, should function effectively, focusing
especially on major issues of political significance.
</P>
<P>
The strengthening of the role of the Assembly was a basic
premise of the process of the revitalization of the U.N. system,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Cassar of Malta said that if the United Nations was to
improve its credibility and authority in the coming years, it must
improve its structure, administration and competence. It must be a
United Nations which could adapt itself to changing realities and
ensure more democracy in the decision-making. Malta had been at
the forefront of efforts to revitalize the General Assembly and
supported enhancement of the office of its president, which had
great potential for structured consultations with the presidents
of the Security Council and the Economic and Social Council.
</P>
<P>
Clara Ines Vagras De Losada, representative of Colombia, said
that Colombia and Costa Rica had focused on the need to
re-establish the political authority of the General Assembly in
different areas, including peacekeeping operations, the need for
adequate resources, and the need to reformulate its relations with
other organs, in particular the Security Council. On the
Secretariat, it should develop its activities based on mandates
and directives from the General Assembly, she said.
</P>
<P>
Felipe Mabilangan of the Philippines said that the General
Assembly should be enabled to conduct a detailed consideration of
the secretary-general's report. There should be a more transparent
process in formulating the speakers' list for the plenary debate
in the Assembly and a more transparent process of selecting the
secretary-general that would include more meaningful participation
by the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
On selecting secretary-general, Fouad Hosny of Egypt said that
since democracy must apply, the Assembly must be given greater
power in that process.
</P>
<P>
Machivenyika Mapuranga of Zimbabwe said that any reform which
did not strengthen the role of the General Assembly was bound to
fail.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamal of Pakistan expressed worries about the gradual
erosion of the central role of the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Hasmy Bin Agam of Malaysia said that the strengthening and
modernization fo the United Nations should address inequities in
the decision-making process and promote efficiency to better the
complex demands of its members. The General Assembly was the only
universal organ in the United Nations system.

<HEADLINE> British PM Rejects IRA Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 26 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major today rejected proposals for a new Irish Republican Army
(IRA) cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
In their proposals put forward last week, Northern Ireland
Catholic politician John Hume and the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, said they would persuade the IRA to end its guerrilla
campaign for a united Ireland if accepted.
</P>
<P>
Major's office said that the prime minister had written to John
Hume, saying the government was not prepared to relax its
conditions for Sinn Fein to join talks on the future of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a question of acceptance or rejection.... We have
reasserted the existing policy of the British government. There
has never been any question of negotiating a new position,"
Major's office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Major told parliament earlier today, "IRA terrorism is utterly
unacceptable for any purpose, at any time, in any place." He urged
the IRA to "call a cease-fire and make it a credible cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said that Major's rejection of the
proposals meant the IRA would not resume a 17-month truce it
abandoned in February.

<HEADLINE> France, Russia Sign Memorandum on Tsarist Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- France and Russia today signed a
memorandum on the compensation by Russia for its tsarist era debts
owed to French bond holders with the payment by Moscow of only 400
million U.S. dollars, an amount described as "laughably" low by
the families of the then bond purchasers.
</P>
<P>
The debt, which came down from tsarist-era bonds bought by
French small bond holders to finance the construction of railways
in Russia from 1882 to 1917, was estimated at 160 billion francs
(32 billion U.S. dollars) by an association specialized on Russian
debts owed to France.
</P>
<P>
Groups of families of bond purchasers immediately expressed
disappointment over the agreement, as the amount was extremely
unfair for the small bond holders whose fathers or grandfathers
could have spent their lifetime's savings to buy the bonds.
</P>
<P>
However, the Association Francaise des Porteurs d'Emprunts
Russes (AFPER) said that the signing of the agreement was after
all a victory for the holders.
</P>
<P>
Joel Freymond, an advisor for the bond holders, described the
amount to be paid by Russia as "laughable" and much lower than the
compensation paid 10 years ago by Russia to British bond holders
of the same tsarist bonds, renounced by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Francois Bayle, president of the Groupement National de Defense
des Porteurs de Titres Russes, described the deal as "scandalous"
and a "sell-out." He threatened to bring the case to the European
Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
However, French and Russian officials described the signing of
the memorandum as politically rather than economically
significant, as Russia is trying to draw French investments to
make up the diminishing U.S. and German businesses there.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed by French Minister of Finances Jean
Arthuis and Vice President of the Government of the Russian
Federation Oleg Davydov after visiting Russian Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin held talks with President Jacques Chirac and
Prime Minister Alain Juppe today over the issue.
</P>
<P>
The compensation covers repayment in several years by Russia
for the 4 million bonds believed to be held by 400,000 French bond
holders and war damages inflicted on French properties in Russia
during the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.
</P>
<P>
About 1.6 million French people bought Russia's tsarist bonds
from 1882 to 1917 and most of the bond holders have died out and
their bonds gone with their owners, said the Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
The French government nominated Jean-Claude Paye, former
secretary general of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, to be in charge of the compensation work for French
bonds holders, a job described as "complicated" by Prime Minister
Juppe at a press conference today.

<HEADLINE> ETA Chief Arrested for Planning to Kill Spanish King </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 26 (Xinhua) -- France today arrested an
important chief of the Spanish Basque separatist group ETA, Juan
Luis Aguirre, alias Isuntza, who reportedly planned to assassinate
King Carlos in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
French police arrested Isuntza on a highway north of the border
town of Bayonne next to Spain, after the latter's car forced its
way through a road check at about 11:30 (0930 GMT), reported
Agence France Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Isuntza was armed, with a baby and a young German woman, who
was also a member of ETA and traveling with a false identity card,
AFP quoted police as saying.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja as
revealing for the first time today at a press conference in
Madrid, given after the arrest of Isuntza, that an ETA plan to
assassinate King Carlos in Palma de Majorque, the Baleares
Islands, was foiled by Spanish paramilitary police who arrested an
ETA commando.
</P>
<P>
Oreja said that he had sent a message of congratulations to his
French counterpart, Jean-Louis Debre, for the arrest of the
dangerous terrorist, who was in charge of ETA's military
operations with Javier Arizcunren Ruiz, alias Kanturi.
</P>
<P>
France arrested another ETA leader, Maria Insausti Mugica,
alias Karpov, in Bordeaux last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Isuntza will be transferred to Paris and could be finally
extradited to Spain, in accordance with agreements signed between
Debre and Oreja.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Ukraine Fail to Agree on Fleet Division Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Rodionov and his Ukrainian counterpart, Alexander Kuzmuk, failed
to reach agreement here today on the Black Sea Fleet's division
issues.
</P>
<P>
During their three-hour talks in Moscow, the two ministers
discussed "problems of the Black Sea Fleet" in order to pave the
way for Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin's visit to
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides failed to reach agreement, particularly
over the basing issue of the fleet.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Kuzmuk told reporters, "We outlined our stands
on the problem, and it is up to political leaders to decide."
</P>
<P>
He said that joint basing of Russian and Ukrainian fleets in
Sevastopol, in Ukraine's Crimea, is possible. "These two regiments
have the right to look into each other's eyes and shake hands," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rodionov said, in his turn, that he does not agree with
Kuzmuk's opinion. "Two regiments or two armies, those of friendly
but sovereign countries, cannot stay in one garrison and one
region. This situation can have abnormal consequences," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the two ministers agreed that new approaches and new ways
should be found to settle the fleet issues "with will, wisdom and
tolerance."

Kuzmuk arrived in Moscow earlier today for a two-day official

ANKARA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish oil companies are
preparing to open a bureau in the Iraqi capital Baghdad for a
pipeline link which will carry Iraqi natural gas to the European
market, the Anatolia News Agency reported today.
</P>

Although no feasibility studies have been carried out, the
Iraqi officials were estimating the cost of the project to be 5 to
6 billion U.S. dollars, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
Several Turkish companies including the state-run oil company
are reportedly planning to set up a joint liaison office in

<HEADLINE> Canada to Erase Measles by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- It may be possible for Canada
to realize the goal of eliminating measles by the end of the
century, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
There has already been dramatic success since a program was
introduced this year to vaccinate all children across the country
against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Since July, Canada has found only 31 cases, compared with 287
in the first six months of the year, according to today's Globe
and Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Canada had the highest rate of measles per capita in the
Americas in 1996, most of the cases developed early this year
before new programs went into effect, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
To step up fights against measles, all but one Canadian
provinces have adopted a standard of giving infants two measles
shots spaced a month apart.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a catchup program has been adopted in most
provinces and the territories to reach all school-aged children
who have not already received the two shot dose.
</P>
<P>
Measles results in fever, inflammation of the respiratory tract
and the eruption of red spots. Complications of the disease were
once a leading cause of encephalitis and respiratory illness,
which could be fatal in young children.

OTTAWA, November 26 (Xinhua) -- The prospects of Canada's
housing industry are the best they have been in years, according
to the Conference Board of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"The outlook is for increasing activity in housing starts and
resales, despite the shaky position of consumer balance sheets,"
said James Frank, chief economist of the board.
</P>
<P>
For the first time in several years, real wages of unionized
workers will rise next year as will real salaries, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Job gains will be more sustained through the end of the decade,
with employment growth in each of the next three years reaching
about 2.5 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
"The prospects for housing, especially at the low end, are
good," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Canada's housing industry stands to benefits from a large
number of younger workers that are set to move out of their
parents' homes as their job prospects improve.
</P>
<P>
The current low interest rates will also help fuel the housing
sector of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. predicted earlier that
housing starts next year will climb 9.1 percent form this year's
forecast of 123,400 dwellings, an 11-percent gain over last year.
</P>
<P>
But sales of existing homes are expected to rise only 2 percent
next year after a 20-percent jump this year, the corporation
added.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Private Sector to Administer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 26 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is preparing a new draft
law to allow the private sector to administer the country's free
trade zones, Egyptian Finance Minister Mohi Eddin El-Gharib said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Private companies may invest and build infrastructures in the
free trade zones, the minister was quoted by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a tribunal will be set up to settle possible
disputes between the governmental and the private sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a large number of power stations and highways in the
free trade zones will be established by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The draft bill will be referred to the People's Assembly during
its current session, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to establish the joint Arab free
trade zone and joint Arab economic market to promote trade
exchange among the Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
According to El-Gharib, the inter-Arab trade represents only
eight percent of the Arab countries' total trade volume, while
trade with non-Arab countries accounts for 92 percent of the
total.
