<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Arrives in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali arrived here today leading a high-caliber delegation for an
official visit which will see a number of agreements signed.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian delegation, which includes 10 ministers, will
take part in the 14th meeting of the Egyptian-Jordanian Higher
Committee scheduled to start this evening.
</P>
<P>
The committee will discuss several joint projects between the
two sides in all domains, particularly in trade, industry and
economy.
</P>
<P>
Six agreements and protocols of bilateral cooperation in
economic and cultural fields will be signed during the two-day
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Talks will also cover several political issues of common
interest, atop of which the latest developments of the Mideast
peace process and efforts to defrost the Arab-Israeli peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Mideast peace march has slowed down since the deal on
Israeli partial withdrawal from Hebron was successfully brokered
by the U.S., Jordan and Egypt in January. An Israeli decision to
build a new neighborhood for Jews has stranded the peace talks for
three months.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries having peace
treaties with Israel, have played important mediator's roles in
the past Mideast peace negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean President Condemns Child Sexual Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
today criticized media and certain section of society for
promoting moral decadence among Zimbabwean youth which has
triggered an increase in sexual abuse of children in the past few
months.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates attending the commemoration of the Day of
the African Child in Harare, Mugabe expressed shock at reports of
rape, most of which involve children which he said,
demonstrated that morality was no longer a virtue in society.
</P>
<P>
He said, "When a father rapes his own two or three year-old
girl child, one begins to wonder what is becoming of our
society."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has lately witnessed an upsurge in the number of rape
cases, some involving six months old infants.
</P>
<P>
The upsurge has resulted in calls for stiffer penalties for
perpetrators, with some women's groups advocating the castration
of convicted rapists.
</P>
<P>
"We need to conscientize society and make it feel that it has
a duty to ensure that no child is abused," Mugabe said.
</P>
<P>
This year's Day of the African Child embraced 150 child
parliamentarians who debated key issues affecting Zimbabwean
children.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Calls on Socialists Not to Attack Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister and First
Secretary of the Socialist Party Lionel Jospin today appealed to
the adherents of his leftist movement not to attack his government
over such issues as the European single currency and closure of
the Renault Vilvoorde auto plant.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the national conference of the Socialist Party,
Jospin said that he wanted to establish "rules of the game"
between the government and the party.
</P>
<P>
Jospin has been severely criticized by some radical Socialists
for ratifying the Stability Pact of the European Union at the
Amsterdam summit early last month, which imposed strict
restriction on budget spending upon future members of the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
He was also chastised for failing to stop the Renault automaker
from closing its Vilvoorde auto plant in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Jospin reminded the party members that the rightist parties of
France had "hardened" their position after their defeat in the
legislative elections, and that they were closing in with the
extreme right.
</P>
<P>
One month after coming to power, the prime minister admitted
that it was very difficult to make the two ends of his electoral
promises and France's engagement for the European monetary union
meet.

<HEADLINE> Fighting in Cambodia Kills at Least Five People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Sporadic fighting here between
forces loyal to the country's co-prime ministers left at least
five people killed and 50 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges of fire erupted in a camp about 20 kilometers
from the capital, when troops loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun
Sen tried to confiscate weapons of those supporting First Prime
Minister Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
At about 3 p.m., some 1,000 troops loyal to Hun Sen besieged a
camp of those loyal to the prince at about eight kilometers west
of the capital. Both sides used rocket launchers and mortars in
their hours of fighting, leaving a number of civilian and military
casualties.
</P>
<P>
Heavy shelling was also reported near a down town hospital in
the afternoon. At least five shells exploded in residential
quarters.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary statistics, at least five people were
killed and more than 50 others injured in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Local hospitals have said they would have no ability to receive
more wounded people, most of whom are civilians.
</P>
<P>
In the tense situation caused by the fighting, the capital's
only international airport, banks and shops were closed.
</P>
<P>
The Phnom Penh city government announced that an indefinite
curfew was imposed in the city.
</P>
<P>
An advisor to Ranariddh today accused Hun Sen of attempting a
coup d'etat, while Hun Sen charged his co-premier with treachery
and preparing for war.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, now reportedly in Vietnam, made a statement on the
state television, said he would take all necessary measures to
protect the interests of the country and the people.
</P>
<P>
The prince and his top advisers were reportedly out of the
country. The radio loyal to the prince stopped broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said the troops loyal to the prince were likely to
be bombarded again on Sunday, until they accept the conditions set
by those supporting Hun Sen.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Clashes Continue in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The violent clashes between
Palestinian rioters and Israeli soldiers continued in Hebron
today, during which at least two Palestinians were injured.
</P>
<P>
The scale of today's clashes was relatively lower compared
with the past days since the violence began last Saturday. Dozens
of Palestinian youths threw stones and firebombs at Israeli
soldiers who responded with rubber bullets and tear gas,
injuring one Palestinian protester.
</P>
<P>
Today's clashes lasted only for several hours this morning,
and the situation reportedly stabilized in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
What was new was that a group of Jewish settlers living in
Hebron joined for the first time in the confrontation by
throwing stones and rubbish at the Palestinians. A Palestinian
woman passerby was lightly injured. The settlers also shouted
the offensive anti-Islamic slogan "Mohammed (the Islamic prophet)
is a pig."
</P>
<P>
Since Israeli troops redeployed from 80 percent of Hebron
under the agreement signed in January, about 450 Jewish settlers
remained living on the other 20 percent of the city, which was
heavily guarded by Israeli soldiers. Hebron has long been the
showcase of the Israeli-Palestinian confrontations.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of violence in the volatile city was sparked
last Saturday by a leaflet depicting Mohammed as a pig writing
the holy Koran. The leaflets were pasted in the city's
storefronts by a rightist Jewish woman from Jerusalem, who has
been charged with offending religious sensibilities at the
Jerusalem District Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of Muslims demonstrated in Nazareth of
norhtern Israel this afternoon to protest the blasphemous act
against Islam. The demonstration was organized by the Islamic
Movement to protest the Hebron leaflets.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Israeli police were put on high alert
against possible outbreak of violence, but the demonstration
passed quietly.
</P>
<P>
The latest wave of violence erupted against the backdrop of
the prolonged deadlock of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The
peace process has been frozen since March when Israel began
building the Har Homa settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is demanding an halt
to the settlement activities as a precondition for resuming the
talks, while the Israeli government insists on the PNA's promise
to resume security cooperation with Israel and to launch a
long-term crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent mediation efforts by the United Sates and
Egypt, the deadlock continued due to the wide gap between the
two sides, leading to fears about widespread escalation of
violence in the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Jordan Sides With Arabs on Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Trade, Industry
and Supply Hani Moulki said today that his country might retrack
its former decision to attend the Doha economic conference slated
for November.
</P>
<P>
This came in statements by the Jordanian minister following his
meeting here this afternoon with Egyptian Minister of Economy and
International Cooperation Nawal Tatawi.
</P>
<P>
"My country has previously declared its approval to take part
in the conference but it eventually sides with the Arab stance,"
said Moulki.
</P>
<P>
Discouraged by the lack of a breakthrough in the deadlocked
peace process, several Arab countries have decided to boycott the
fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference
which Israel will participate. Egypt has yet to announce its own
decision.
</P>
<P>
Amman and Cairo, the hosts to the previous two MENA conferences
and the only two Arab countries to have made peace with Israel,
have played important mediating roles in the Mideast peace
process, which has sunk into deep crisis.
</P>
<P>
Switching to Arab economic integration, Moulki referred to
the call of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and King Hussein of
Jordan for setting up an Arab common market that can face up to
world economic pressures.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt was the first to call for setting up an Arab free trade
zone as a nucleus of the Arab common market," he said. "Jordan
believes that it is the right way so that the Arab area would be
of economic importance in the new economic world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ten Jordanian ministers arrived here today for the 14th
Egyptian-Jordanian Higher Committee meetings set to start this
evening under the co-chairmanship of Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri and his Jordanian counterpart Abdul-Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
Tatawi, in her turn, underlined that present world political
and economic developments and changes require further cooperation
and integration among all Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee of the Egyptian-Jordanian Higher
Committee has adopted recommendations that might boost
distinguished relations between the two countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
Foremost among those recommendations is working to increase the
volume of trade exchange between the two countries, she added.
</P>
<P>
Two agreements on electrical linkage and joint technical
cooperation in the field of livestock will be signed, she said.
</P>
<P>
Altogether six agreements and protocols of cooperation between
Egypt and Jordan in economic and cultural fields will be signed
during the two-day committee meetings.

NAIROBI, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister Kalonzo
Musyoka today said that the Kenyan government is confident in the
new administration of Hong Kong which began operation on July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival from Hong Kong after attending the
handing-over ceremony, Musyoka said that Hong Kong would be
administered with high level autonomy which would ensure it
remains the world's finance center.

Speaking at a press conference held at the Jomo Kenyatta
International Airport, he said that Kenya had effectively warded
off an attempt to move the headquarters of the U.N. Environment
Program (UNEP) in Nairobi to other place.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka said that Germany, South Africa, Brazil and Singapore
had sought to introduce a declaration announcing the world
environmental body to be based in Germany. The Kenyan minister
had attended the 19th special session of the United Nations in
New York on the follow-up of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro
five years ago.
</P>
<P>
There were also attempts to shift the HABITAT office from
Nairobi, but "we effectively countered them", he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Turkmenia Protests Russia-Azerbaijan Oil Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Turkmen Foreign Ministry today
lodged a "strong protest" against signing of a Russian-Azerbaijani
agreement on the joint development of the Kyapaz oil field in the
Caspina Sea, which the ministry states belongs to Turkmenia.
</P>
<P>
The Russia-Azerbaijani agreement was signed Friday during the
visit of Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliyev to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Turkmen side demanded that "the agreement be annulled to
avoid the consequences for which Turkmenistan will not bear any
responsibility."
</P>
<P>
The ministry in a statement said that international legal order
should be restored in the Caspian Sea area, taking into account
the new political realities and the need to ensure civilized use
of its resources in the interests of all littoral states.
</P>
<P>
Turkmenia has repeatedly asked Azerbaijan to begin constructive
dialogue and refrain from any specific actions before an agreement
is reached.
</P>
<P>
"In this context, we cannot but be surprised, to say the least,
by the decision adopted by Russia and Azerbaijan with regard to
the oil field, for Turkmenistan's rights to this deposit are
obvious and cannot be a matter of ambiguous interpretation," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Russian Ambassador Vadim Cherepov was
summoned to the Turkmen Foreign Ministry earlier today to hear its
"strong protest." Enitem

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will help the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides overcome their differences in
searching for a comprehensive settlement in next week's direct
negotiations near New York, a U.N. envoy said here today.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters at Larnaca Airport before leaving for New
York, U.N. Resident Representative in Cyprus Gustave Feissel said
the U.N. is ready to help the two sides with ideas and proposals
depending on the problems they encounter.
</P>
<P>
"We should not prejudge or anticipate what is going to happen"
at the direct negotiations between Cyprus President Glafcos
Clrides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, due to begin
July 9, said Feissel, who is also to take part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Feissel added the U.N.'s first concern in the negotiations is
to resolve the protracted Cyprus problem, but any
confidence-building measures which may flow out the talks will be
fostered.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy noted that both Clerides and Denktash are fully
aware of the responsibilities they bear as they travel to New York
for the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Denktash left today for New York from Turkey where he

The U.N.-sponsored Cyprus peace talks aim at reuniting this
Eastern Mediterranean island under a bizonal, bicommunal
federation.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of Nigeria's National Drug
Law Enforcement Agency Musa Bamaiyi today expressed great concern
over drug abuse by youths in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 90 percent of the mental cases treated
in psychiatrical hospitals in Nigeria can be attributable to drug
abuse by youths.
</P>
<P>
This development, he said, is posing great threat to the
future of the country's economy and image abroad, as well as the
standard of medical care in the country.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony for launching a youth program organized by the
Nation Orientation Agency, Bamaiyi reminded parents of proper
education of their children.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president of the National Orientation Agency
described the involvement of drug abuse by youths, examination
malpractices and armed robbery in the country as alarming.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has over recent years made great efforts to crack down
upon drug abuse and smuggling and some progress has been
reported. But what has been learned from today's ceremony paints
a grey picture of the result of the efforts.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia today
claimed having gained some ground north of Kabul, but admitted
they were yet to capture the key highway town of Jabul Siraj.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources in Peshawar, Pakistan's northwestern major
city, said the Islamic militia had captured five villages east of
Jabul Siraj, a much contested strategic center about 80 km north
of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban launched an attack this morning on positions held
by the forces loyal to former military chief Ahmad Masood, who
grabbed Jabul Siraj from the Taliban's hands in late May, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
About 30 people from both sides were killed in the fighting
which was still going on, and the Taliban captured 80 Masood's
men, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources also confirmed that the fighting between the
Taliban and northern opposition forces were still going on in
Kunduz and Faryeb provinces.
</P>
<P>
Recently, fighting has been raging on several fronts, north of
the Afghan capital, in northwestern Faryab province and in the
northern province of Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
However, both the Taliban and the northern opposition forces
have made only minor territorial gains.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has asked for a ceasefire, but both sides
have refused.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban are demanding the release of its high-ranking
officials being held prisoner in northern Afghanistan before
negotiating an end to the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban coalition, led by Masood and Uzbek warlord
Abdul Malik, is demanding the demilitarization of Kabul before
they could agree to a ceasefire.

ROME, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Australia's Michael Doohan, on an
Honda, won the Imola grand prix for his seventh win in eight
starts in the 500cc world motorcycling championship in Imola on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian suffered a terrible start from pole position and
had to ride through the field to restore his supremacy.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Nobuatsu Aoki led from the first turn and the Suzuki of
Australian Anthony Gobert tucked in behind him, leaving Doohan in
fourth spot.
</P>
<P>
However by the seventh of the 25 laps, Doohan had regained the
lead and eventually cruised to his 41st grand prix victory by 8.6
seconds from Nobuatsu Aoki. Doohan even clocked the fastest lap
in his penultimate circuit at the Dino Farrari venue.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Checa of Spain, second to Doohan in official qualifying,
nearly had a nasty accident four laps from home as he slid off
into the gravel. But he cleverly negotiated the dangerous surface
before rejoining the race.
</P>
<P>
Max Biaggi of Italy won the 250cc event, increasing his
overall lead in the world championship standings, ahead of fellow
Honda riders Olivier Jacque of France and Japan's Tohru Ukawa.

<HEADLINE> Australia's New Combat Force on Parade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,500 soldiers and 900
vehicles paraded in the coastal city of Brisbane today in one of
the largest gatherings of Australian combat forces since the
Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
Army Chief General John Sanderson told the troops that the
parade marked the beginning of an era in which the army would
build a modern, dynamic high technology force for the defense of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
The occasion marked the first official gathering of the 7th
Task Force, which represents the first step in the Army's
restructuring program, the Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The new unit comprises soldiers, vehicles and guns which today
spread over most of the parade ground at the Enoggera army base in
Brisbane.
</P>
<P>
The 7th Task Force is an amalgamation of the old Brisbane-based
6th and 7th Brigades and was formed to create a single integrated
unit complete with its own armor, artillery, transport and support
elements.
</P>
<P>
"It's planned as the forerunner of a total of seven task forces
and a special operations group which will make up the Australian
army of the 21st century," the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
"The 3,000-plus soldiers you see on parade represent about
three quarters of the largest combat formation Australia has had
since the Vietnam war," General Sanderson said.
</P>
<P>
"It is our objective to build and equip seven such task forces
and a special forces group over the next decade".
</P>
<P>
"This will provide a potent and versatile foundation for
Australian continental defense and also provide the nation with a
range of options to contribute to global and regional security
should this be necessary," the army chief said.
</P>
<P>
He said units making up the task force would have to operate
over great distances and be more self-reliant with greater and
more precise firepower than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Defense spending represents 1.9 percent of Australia's gross
domestic product, a figure which Defense Minister Ian McLachlan
has indicated will have to start increasing soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Three civilians were wounded today
in violent Israeli bombardment of a heights opposite the Israeli
self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon, which came in
retaliation for a guerrilla attack on an Israeli patrol, security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous security sources in south Lebanon said that
Israeli artillery fired more than 100 shells in a couple of hours
at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, some 65 kilometers
southeast of Beirut.
</P>
<P>
A seven-year-old boy and two others were injured when their
village of Ain Buswar was hit by several 120mm and 155mm heavy
shells, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Apachi helicopters also carried out a series of air
raids on the heights, which is often used by guerrillas as a
springboard to launch attacks on the Israeli-occupied buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas of the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of
God, ambushed an Israeli foot patrol near the town of Sujoud in
the central sector of the border strip earlier this morning.
</P>
<P>
A Hezbollah statement said that all elements of the Israeli
patrol were killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia
said that one Israeli soldier was killed. But the Lebanese
security sources stressed that two Israeli soldiers died as a
result of the guerrilla offensive.
</P>
<P>
The escalation came on the eve of a meeting of a five-nation
panel to look into two complaints filed by Lebanon and Israel
respectively accusing each other of violating a cease-fire
understanding the two countries reached in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the
United States, who make up the cease-fire monitoring committee,
is to hold the meeting in the south Lebanese border town of
Naqoura Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Israel established the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone"
in 1985 ostensibly to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fewer Palestinians Apply for Visitors' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The number of Palestinians
abroad visiting relatives in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
this summer will be very small compared with that of previous
years, according to a report of The Jerusalem Times.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian English weekly newspaper quoted Muhammad
Hussein, head of the Palestinian Passport Department, as saying
this week that the down-slide trend is due to Israeli measures,
which have grown stricter than ever.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said that back in 1995 Israel gave permits to 35,000
applicants, but discouraged by the conditions created by the
Jewish state, the number of applicants has dropped drastically
this year.
</P>
<P>
"So far, we have received only 16,000 application forms of
which Israel has approved a mere 2,500," he said.
</P>
<P>
In explaining the limited number of applicants in 1997, the
Under-secretary of the Palestinian Ministry of Civil Affairs,
Freij Kheiri, said that the visitors were frustrated by the
discomforts experienced throughout the journey.
</P>
<P>
"For one, there is the interminable wait at the crossing
points which could take up to 36 hours before travelers continue
their journey. And this applies to both arrivals and
departures. Secondly, there is nowhere they can rest properly," he
elaborated.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the journey was made especially uncomfortable
because the buses conveying the visitors from Jordan to the Gaza
Strip were accompanied throughout the journey by Israeli police
who kept them under close observation.
</P>
<P>
Kheiri condemned Israel's policy and called it a violation of
the Oslo Accords, which state that Palestinians abroad could
visit their relatives any time they wish.
</P>
<P>
"This is a policy of collective punishment, aimed at stifling
the Palestinians economically, politically, and socially, all of
which contradicts basic human rights," he added.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian economists consider the summer visits by
Palestinians abroad to be a sizable source of revenues for the
Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
The visitors may spend millions of U.S. dollars to purchase
real estate, and considerable amounts on entertainment, apart
from the financial help they extend to their relatives.

<HEADLINE> Henan Sets Minimum Living Standard for Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Henan Province
decreed a bottom-line living standard for its farmers in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the system, those who live under the poverty level
will receive aid from the government to enable them to reach the
standard.
</P>
<P>
This is an important step in the establishment of a multi-tier
social security network throughout the country, according to
central government officials.
</P>
<P>
The funds for this will be jointly provided by the relevant
county, township and village authorities.
</P>
<P>
Henan is the province with the largest population in China. Of
its more than 90 million people, 4.9 million are living in
poverty, which means that they do not have sufficient food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
At present, the basic living standard set for the province's
farmers is between 450 and 500 yuan (about 60 US dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The standard is based on local prices and consumption level,
provincial officials said.

<HEADLINE> Gansu Tackling Township Enterprise Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Gansu Province
has mapped out a plan to reduce pollution emitted by township
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The plan mainly targets paper-making, tanning and cement-making
enterprises, which are the worst polluters.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, 30 paper mills each having an annual production
capacity of over 5,000 tons, 40 leather enterprises each having an
annual manufacturing capacity of 30,000 hides and 50 cement plants
will be technologically upgraded.
</P>
<P>
These enterprises are expected to reduce their sewage discharge
by seven million tons before the year 2000 and improve their
sewage treatment rate to more than 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are some 600 small-scale township enterprises in the
province engaged in oil refining, paper making, tanning, and lead
and zinc processing.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities started to tackle the pollution
caused by these enterprises last year, and have closed down or
diverted the operations of 538 of them.
</P>
<P>
In addition, they have banned the introduction of pulp-making
equipment using chemical techniques with a production capacity of
less than 10,000 tons, and urged paper mills which have an annual
capacity of more than 5,000 tons but less than 10,000 tons each to
merge their operations with other factories, in a bid to reduce
pollution.

<HEADLINE> PM: Jordan to Side With Arabs on Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali suggested today his country might not attend the Doha
economic conference if no progress is made on the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Majali made the statement to reporters after his meeting with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak this morning, according to the
Egypt's Middle East news agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
"Talk about this conference depends on circumstances and on
the peace process. We hope the peace process could be revived so
that the economic conference can resume," he said.
</P>
<P>
Majali said Jordan would side with other Arab countries in
deciding whether or not to participate in such a regional meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Jordan will not separate from other Arabs," he said, echoing
the statement by Jordanian Minister of Industry, Trade and Supply
Hani Moulki Saturday that his country might retreat its former
decision to attend the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
economic conference.
</P>
<P>
"My country has previously declared its approval to take part
in the conference but it eventually sides with the Arab stance,"
said Moulki, who and other nine Jordanian ministers are here for
the 14th Jordanian-Egyptian Higher Committee meetings.
</P>
<P>
Discouraged by the lack of a breakthrough in the deadlocked
peace process, several Arab countries have decided to boycott the
Doha meeting, which Israel will attend. Egypt has yet to announce
its own decision.
</P>
<P>
Morocco, Jordan and Egypt have hosted the previous three MENA
economic conferences separately in Casablanca, in 1994, in Amman,
in 1995 and in Cairo, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Majali also expressed support for the Egyptian efforts to
revive the deadlocked Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian premier said the Israeli leadership is still
intransigent and unaware that no permanent peace can be
established without returning the Arab lands to their owners and
without setting up a Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its
capital.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the Arab nation sides with these views," Majali
said. The western world also sides with these ideas and is now
embracing the Palestinian issue due to the Israeli intransigence,
he added.
</P>
<P>
No permanent peace will be established without Syria, Lebanon
or the Palestinians, the Jordanian premier stressed.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he conveyed to Mubarak a message from King
Hussein of Jordan and is taking a reply message back to the king.
</P>
<P>
His meeting with the Egyptian president dealt with three main
issues, namely bilateral ties on all levels, inter-Arab relations
and the peace process, according to the MENA report.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the only two Arab countries to have made
peace with Israel, have played important mediating roles in the
Mideast peace process.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia: Firewood Collecting Women Lead Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 15,000 women in Addis
Ababa earn their miserable livelihood by selling firewood.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed here today by the Office of the Project for
Firewood Carrier Women, which is engaged in jointly conducting
the study with the World Labor Organization and the Ministry of
Labor and Social Affairs of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, the firewood collecting women, earning
below 65 Birr (9.6 U.S. Dollars) per month, are among the
low-income group in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
They are aged between 10 and 19 and have to travel about 30
kilometers on foot to deliver the firewood to customers. They
carry about 35 kilograms of firewood which in most cases is
overweight.
</P>
<P>
These women are providing a third of the demand for firewood
in the metropolis which has a population of several million.
</P>
<P>
The study said the destitute women are engaged in illegal
activity since they cause depletion of forests in the suburbs
of Addis.
</P>
<P>
The study is to identify an alternative income generating
means for the poor women besides helping them take part in
afforestation.
</P>
<P>
Plans have been drawn to offer the women training and later
extend loan services in a bid to help them to be self-supportive,
the study added.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Airlines Suspends Flights to Phnom Penh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia Airlines (MAS) has
canceled all flights to Phnom Penh, the capital city of Cambodia,
indefinitely due to the deteriorating political situation in that
country, Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said today.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the political situation in that country is
becoming more serious and in the interest of the safety of
passengers, MAS has decided that all flights to Phnom Penh be
stopped until peace is restored in that country," Ling said.
</P>
<P>
MAS would review the developments in Phnom Penh from time to
time before deciding when to resume its flights there, the
minister told reporters after opening a conference of the
Malaysian Chinese Association (MCA) in Genting Highlands, 35 kms
northeast of Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
MAS canceled today's flight from Kuala Lumpur to Phnom Penh
scheduled for this morning and its flight back from Phnom Penh to
Kuala Lumpur scheduled for this evening.
</P>
<P>
The current situation in Cambodia, which is scheduled to
officially join the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
later this month, defeated the spirit of ASEAN to make its member
countries more prosperous by bringing in investors, traders and
tourists, Ling commented.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai-HK Cooperation To Enter New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to the
motherland will usher in a new period of economic cooperation
between Shanghai and Hong Kong, according to Shanghai Mayor Xu
Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Xu made the statement in an article in the latest issue of
"Shanghai Today" magazine. He said that the economic ties between
the two metropolises have shown a new trend ever since China
adopted the reform and opening policy in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the scale of the cooperation has been
enlarged day by day, as the two-way trade increased from 1.7
billion US dollars-worth in 1989 to 3.64 billion US dollars-worth
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong investors have expanded the scope of their
investment from industrial fields to the financial, commercial and
real estate sectors. In addition, they have turned from direct
investment to indirect financing, including helping local
enterprises with bank loans, the issue of b-shares, h-shares and
setting up cooperative funds.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Shanghai has also begun to invest in Hong
Kong, which has resulted in a two-way flow of funds, the mayor
noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that Shanghai and Hong Kong should further enhance
their economic cooperation, based on the principles of being
mutually complementary and mutual beneficial, developing unitedly,
and achieving common prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The mayor suggested that the two areas should further cooperate
in the fields of service, banking and trade, as well as in hi-tech
industries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the two places should also step up their cooperation
in the fields of communications, telecommunications and urban
infrastructure, the mayor stressed.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Open Embassy in Algiers: Mbeki </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The South African government will
open an embassy soon in Algiers, which will be a vehicle to boost
links and trade, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki said during a visit
in the Algerian capital today.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki made the disclosure after talks with Algerian Premier
Ahmed Ouyahia in which both agreed on steps to boost cooperation
and trade links, according to a report from the official Algerian
News Agency APS.
</P>
<P>
The two sides "reasserted their determination to reinforce and
consolidate links of friendship and cooperation existing between
the two countries,'' Mbeki and Ouyahia said in a joint
communique.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to set up a joint cooperation committee and work
on finalizing agreements of interest to both sides, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki held talks with president liamine zeroual and several
other algerian leaders before leaving algiers today at the end of
a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The South African leader visited Tunisia earlier in the week
and is expected to arrive in Mali today. His trip is focused on
developing diplomatic and trade relations with the three African
countries.

<HEADLINE> India's Petrochemical Products Demand to Double By </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The demand for petrochemical
products in India will almost double by the year 2001, according
to a study published by the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI) today.
</P>
<P>
A boom in agriculture, food processing, power and
telecommunication sectors will mainly contribute to the increased
demand, which is expected to touch nine million tons as against
5.1 million tons in 1995, the study says.
</P>
<P>
The FICCI has suggested focusing on skilled manpower
availability and attracting foreign direct investment to sustain
the demand.
</P>
<P>
But the FICCI also said that it is difficult to find the right
kind of feed-stock for various uses in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Protestants Begin March in N. Ireland, Tension High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 500 Protestants began their
annual parade this morning in Northern Ireland as hundreds of
British troops and police took up control of the march route.
</P>
<P>
Riot police were reported to have seized control of main roads
in Portadown in Northern Ireland early today in one of the biggest
security operations in 28 years of conflict.
</P>
<P>
The troops were on high alert to guard against any trouble
after weeks of controversy over plans by the Protestant Orange
Order to hold an annual parade which will go through the Roman
Catholic-controlled zone later in the day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said at
a press conference that a decision to allow an Orange Order parade
along the Catholic Garvaghy Road of Portadown as "a sad day for
all of us."
</P>
<P>
"Many people will be angry with what has occurred and I ask for
restraint," she said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Orange Order says the parades are peaceful
celebrations, but the Catholic Irish nationalists, who wish to end
the British rule over the Northern Ireland, were strongly opposed
to the parade, arguing the march shows intimidation to the
Catholic residents.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that in the dead of the night, some of the
Catholic protesters sat on the road but police officers kept
advancing, raising their see-through riot shields to fend off a
hail of bottles and stones hurled by youngsters on the
pavement. Police even fired plastic bullets and injured several
Catholic residents.
</P>
<P>
But the clashes subsided as dawn broke, revealing the full
panoply of armored vehicle power along the disputed roadway.
</P>
<P>
Last year, police prevented the marchers from going through the
Catholic enclave but changed their decision after days of
Protestant rioting and sparked Catholic fury instead.
</P>
<P>
Dozen more Protestant parades will be staged until July 12, the
most cherished date in the Orange calendar which marks a 17th
century Protestant victory over Britain's last Catholic
King.

<HEADLINE> Split over Enlargement Pace Overshadows NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the 16 member states of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will endorse the
eastward expansion at their Madrid summit to be held on July 8 and
9, but split over which countries should join the military
alliance in the first wave overshadows the summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders have planned to unveil a new military organization
that will have closer ties with its partner countries and provide
a balanced power-sharing system within the alliance, thus making
the so-called European Security and Defense Identity more visible.
</P>
<P>
As they prepare for it, the item atop their agenda is not
whether NATO should expand, but which countries should be admitted.
</P>
<P>
A serious row has emerged between the United States and its
European allies over which countries to invite to join NATO in
the Madrid summit.
</P>
<P>
On June 12, the Clinton Administration announced, under the
pressure from the U.S. Congress, that Washington would support only
three countries - Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic - to join
NATO in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position has reportedly gained support from four NATO
member states -- Iceland, Britain, Norway and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
But France, supported by eight other NATO member states
predominately from southern Europe, has lobbied hard for the
candidacies of Romania and Slovenia as well, in an effort to
avoid too heavy a shift in NATO's future orientation toward
Central Europe.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands have taken a flexible stance on
this issue. German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Wednesday after
meeting with Romanian President Emil Constantinescu in Bonn that
he was in favor of Romania's entry "soon".
</P>
<P>
But a German official said "it would be a misinterpretation of
his remarks to take 'soon' to mean at the NATO summit. There is no
fixed date."
</P>
<P>
Both Germany and the Netherlands are expected to fall in with
Washington eventually, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
However, most European allies are somehow disturbed by what
some see as an American attempt to "dictate" to them who will be
admitted as new members of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac and other European leaders seem
to fear that the U.S. will attempt to turn the Madrid summit into
an event that combines holding a beauty contest for potential
members and a crowning of the U.S. president as king of the
NATO, an article in the International Herald Tribune commented.
</P>
<P>
Some hopes were being expressed that the Americans will back
down in part by agreeing to let Slovenia join the alliance in the
first wave.
</P>
<P>
However, that has been rejected by U.S. diplomatic
sources. They said that if Washington relented towards Slovenia,
"that would make it even worse for Romania".
</P>
<P>
Clinton said early this week that he did not foresee any
circumstances under which he would change his mind on limiting the
first wave expansion to three.
</P>
<P>
While reaffirming that five countries now fulfilled the
conditions for joining, France indicated in a statement on July 2
that it would not block the admission of only three countries if
Clinton insisted.
</P>
<P>
The statement, one NATO diplomat in Brussels explained, was
France's way of putting the onus on the United States to explain
to Romania and Slovenia why they could not be admitted together
with the three others.
</P>
<P>
Other NATO member states supporting the two countries would
probably follow France's example and accept Clinton's preference,
the same diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
These countries are also hoping that even if Washington refuses
to yield, it might agree to a form of words in the Madrid
communique that would make clear that Romania and Slovenia would
be guaranteed membership in the second wave "a year or two" after
the first entrants had joined, at NATO's 50th anniversary in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
A possible compromise deal to end the U.S.-Europe diplomatic
feuding could involve Austria abandoning its neutrality and
joining, alongside Romania and Slovenia in 2001, some experts
predicted.
</P>
<P>
Senior NATO sources in Brussels are increasingly confident that
Austria is poised to abandon half a century of neutrality and
apply for NATO membership later this year.
</P>
<P>
NATO's foreign ministers plan to meet in Madrid on Monday to
hammer out a stand. If those talks fail, the issue will be taken
up by the leaders on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some experts fear that even if the Americans get away at the
summit, this split will sow the seeds of future difficulties in
the relationship between the United States and its European
allies.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Clashes Foretell New Intifadah: Hebron Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Head of Hebron Municipality Mostafa
el-Natshah termed today the present clashes between Palestinians
and Israeli forces as a sign of the eruption of a new Intifadah
(uprising).
</P>
<P>
In an interview this morning with the Egyptian Voice of Arabs
radio, Natshah said that confrontation between the two sides will
continue until the Israeli government honors its commitments to
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the escalated confrontations to the Israeli
government's insistence on going ahead with its settlement policy
and Israeli settlers' provocative practices.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Islamic posters that were circulated in the West Bank
city of Hebron recently were only the latest of such provocations,
the Palestinian official added.
</P>
<P>
Hebron has long been the showcase of the Israeli-Palestinian
confrontations. Since Israeli troops redeployed from 80 percent of
Hebron under an agreement signed in January, about 450 Jewish
settlers have remained living in the city heavily guarded by
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of violence in the volatile city was sparked
last Saturday by the distribution of leaflets depicting Islam's
Prophet Mohammed as a pig writing the holy Koran by a rightist
Jewish woman from Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out against the backdrop of prolonged
deadlock of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks. The talks collapsed
in March as Israel began building a new settlement in East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) is demanding an halt
to the settlement activities as a precondition for resuming the
talks, while Israel asks the PNA to resume security cooperation
and crack down on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Despite mediation efforts by the U.S. and Egypt, the wide gap
remains between the two sides, leading to fears about escalation
of violence in the Palestinian territories.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 6 (Xinhua) -- English club Derby County have made a
multi-million dollar bid for Roberto Baggio, Italy's Gazzetta
dello Sport newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gazzetta said Derby were prepared to spend 16 million dollars
to sign Italian star forward Baggio from AC Milan.
</P>
<P>
Derby, who signed Italian international midfielder Stefano
Eranio from Milan in May, made an offer for Baggio after talks
between the two clubs last Thursday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Baggio said last month he would leave the five-times European
champions before the start of next season.
</P>
<P>
Italian newspapers have linked him to several clubs, including
Vicenza, Napoli, Sampdoria and Spain's Barcelona and Atletico
Madrid.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Protesters Call for War with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,000 demonstrators burned
Israeli and U.S. flags in front of the United Nations office
building here today to protest against the Israeli posters
depicting Islam's Prophet Mohammed as a pig.
</P>
<P>
Chanting "Death to America" and "Death to Israel", the angry
protesters called for war with Israel while appealing to the
Islamic community to get united to confront what they called the
Israeli plots and condemning the U.S. support for the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"To destroy the Zionist army, we must go through a sea of
blood," the crowd chanted.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, mostly clothed in black, held placards that
read "Israel Rushing toward Doomsday" and "the Army of God is
Ready."
</P>
<P>
Seyyed Ahmad Khatami, a clergyman who teaches at Iran's
influential Qom Islamic seminary, told the crowd that the Israelis
who were involved in making the posters must be executed.
</P>
<P>
"The person who drew the picture, the owner of the printing
house that printed it, all are condemned to death," Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
"The only way to end these insults is through destruction of
Israel," the clergyman said and called on the Muslim activists
around the world to attack Israeli interests.
</P>
<P>
Last week, posters showing the Muslim Prophet Mohammed as a pig
writing the holy Koran were pasted on more than 20 Palestinian
stores near the downtown of the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The incident has aroused great anger among Arab states and
ignited a fresh round of violence in the West Bank and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities last week detained Tatiana Susskind, 25,
a resident of Jerusalem, for the drawing of the pictures.

<HEADLINE> UK Scientists Engineer Animals Possible of Making Human Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 6 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are using the
revolutionary clone technology to engineer animals which will
generate the key proteins and antibodies in human plasma.
</P>
<P>
The new technique will provide a steady supply of cheap safe
blood products worth up to 1.5 billion pounds (about 2.4 billion
U.S. dollars) a year, The Observer said today.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons and hospital administrators, struggling to overcome
blood shortages, have welcomed the breakthrough, saying it could
save lives and help prevent the spread of blood-born viruses such
as HIV and hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
PPL Therapeutics, the Edinburgh firm supporting the program, is
creating cows and sheep with human DNA. Scientists use "chemical
scissors" to remove or alter the animals' blood plasma -- albumen,
clotting factors and antibodies.
</P>
<P>
Scientists plan to rear herds of the animals and extract the
proteins from their milk before mixing them to create plasma.
</P>
<P>
Cheap, reliable supplies of plasma are vital when dealing with
patients who have lost a lot of blood, and health professionals
welcomed the breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The Observer quoted Charles Collins, a member of the Royal
College of Surgeons` council, as saying "this is of major
importance. The production of large amounts of cheap plasma would
greatly help doctors, surgeons and paramedics to stabilize and
treat patients."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the technique could eventually lead to
animals producing blood containing natural human antibodies to
help fight diseases including cystic fibrosis, haemophilia,
osteoporosis and some cancers.
</P>
<P>
However, scientists argue that extensive trials to ensure the
safety of the products could take years.

LAGOS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The life expectancy of Nigerian men

(UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
A survey by UNFPA shows only 66 percent of Nigerians had

</P>
<P>
It puts the country's population at 115 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of the population with access to health
services#,UNFPA explained, is "the percentage of the population
that can reach appropriate local health services by the local
means of transport in no more than one hour."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the percentage of Nigerians with access to safe
water between 1990 and 1994 was estimated at 39 percent, while 36
percent had access to sanitation in the same period.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has provided about 1.6 million
U.S. Dollars to Tanzania for repairing the road between Nyakanazi
and Kibondo in western Tanzania, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement to this effect which was signed here
on Friday, a portion of the money would be used for repair work
at Simbo area on the Kigoma-Kasulu Road about 15 kilometers from
the regional headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The upgrading of the road will facilitate the planned
repatriation of refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Representative to Tanzania Lennart Kotsalainen said at
the signing ceremony that if the road is not repaired, it would
hinder the transport of refugees to camps and the whole
repatriation exercise.
</P>
<P>
The repair work is scheduled to start next week and will be
completed in January.
</P>
<P>
"The road between Nyakanazi and Kibondo area is an obstacle to

JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- There are conflicting reports
over the future of Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amnon Shahak, who
reportedly has decided not to extend his term due to disputes with
the government.
</P>
<P>
Israeli private television Channel 2 reported Saturday night
that Shahak, in an unprecedented move, would not seek to have his
term extended to a full fourth year due to his discontent with his
working relationship with Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The report said Shahak was to inform Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai that he was not interested in extending his term when
they meet later this week to discuss Shahak's future in the army.
</P>
<P>
Shahak is likely to step down on Israel's 50th independence
day next year, seven months before his fourth year in office ends,
the report added.
</P>
<P>
But Israel Radio reported this morning that Shahak had denied
the report, saying no meeting has been set between him and
Mordechai. "The report did not come from the chief of staff and
did not reflect his opinion," a statement released by an army
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A Defense Ministry spokesman also said that Mordechai had not
yet concluded the appointments in the army's general staff.
</P>
<P>
If the television report proves true, it would be the first
time that a chief of staff does not seek a fourth year, which has
traditionally been taken as granted.
</P>
<P>
It remained unclear whether it was the disappointment with the
prolonged deadlock in the peace process, in addition to the tense
relationship with the Netanyahu government, that had led to
Shahak's decision to retire from the army earlier.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after Netanyahu's election victory last year,
rumors surfaced that Shahak and other top members of the general
staff, such as his deputy Matan Vilnai, would resign if Yitzhak
Mordechai was named Defense Minister.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a former army commander, was reportedly angered at
Shahak and Vilnai for taking posts that he had wanted before he
decided to retire from the army to enter politics.
</P>
<P>
However, after being named as the defense minister, Mordechai
has made great efforts to defuse tensions with the general staff
and succeeded in fostering good working relations with them.
</P>
<P>
If Shahak indeed retires, the speculation is that Mordechai
will have no choice but to recommend to the government that
Vilnai replace Shahak. Another possible candidate for the post
is the head of Army Planning Branch Shaul Mofaz, a former head
of the Southern Command.

<HEADLINE> Israel Blamed for Worsening Situation in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The recent deteriorating security
situation in Hebron has been a result of the provocative policies
of the Israeli government, Palestinian ambassador to Zimbabwe Ali
Halimeh claimed.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Sunday Mail paper, Halimeh said the new
Israeli administration is responsible for the collapse of the
negotiations between the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)
and the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
He said, ''It is known to the entire world that Prime Minister
B. Netanyahu is not interested in a political settlement with the
Palestinians and he himself is to blame for the deteriorating
situation in the area.''
</P>
<P>
''The tension which is prevailing in the Middle East is a
result of the persistent policies of Netanyahu, policies which
reject basic principles of the peace Madrid conference and the
Oslo declaration of principles and the signed agreement between
the previous government and the PLO,'' Halimeh said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said the Netanyahu government has embarked on a
campaign to destabilize the Palestinian self-rule territories
through economic blockades and through their security
establishment and encouraging violence since it was formed.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Palestinian people will continue to
protect the achievement which has been made until the
establishment of the Palestinian independent state with Jerusalem
as its capital.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa could have one
million Internet users by the end of this year, local daily
Sunday Independent quoted a Web publisher as reporting today.
</P>
<P>
"There are already about 500,000 users in South Africa and at
the current private and corporate connectivity levels, it is not
unrealistic to expect it to reach the million mark by the end of
the year," Robin Parker, the marketing director of Africa, said.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of the century, the South African internet site
development and advertizing market could be worth one billion
Rand (222 million U.S. dollars), with more than two million Rand
of on line transactions a year, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
"Individual connectivity is growing by about 12 percent a
month and the usage of specific value sites is growing at between
20 percent and and 40 percent," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Most Pollees Feel Japan's Safety Level Crumbling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of Japanese believed
that the country is not as safe as it used to be, said a survey
released recently by a leading Japanese newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which was conducted by Yomiuri Shimbun on June 21
and 22, randomly selected 3,000 eligible voters across the
country. The response rate was 68 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 81 percent of respondents said that
they felt the safety level in Japan deteriorating in the past
several years, while 15 percent said the condition had improved.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 sarin nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway system, the
increasing number of crimes committed by illegal aliens and the
rising number of violent crimes by young offenders were cited as
evidence of the deterioration of public order in Japan, which
used to be the safest country among the developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Asked to specify the kinds of crimes most likely to affect them
or members of their families, 36 percent of the pollees cited
crank calls, 33 percent cited fraud and illegal marketing, and 31
percent cited random crimes.
</P>
<P>
Growing concerns about crimes made the respondents call for
tighter controls by the law enforcement authorities.
</P>
<P>
As many as 55 percent of respondents approved of the recent
policy change by the National Police Agency to arrest young
offenders rather than to "protect" them. Forty-one percent of the
pollees said such a change was unavoidable.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Snatches her First Wimbledon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- World number one tennis player
Martina Hingis of Switzerland snatched her first Wimbledon women's
singles title here today after beating Czech tennis veteran Jana
Novotna in a three-set battle 2-6 6-3 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Novotna, 1993 Wimbledon finalist, opened the final clash with a
flying form by breaking two consecutive games of Hingis and ran
away with the first 6:2 in less than 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, a 1994 Wimbledon junior champion and a doubles winner
in 1996, staged patient counterattacks in the second set and
gradually gained an upper hand over the 28-year-old Novotna, who
was suffering from an strained stomach muscle.
</P>
<P>
With the second set in her pocket, the 16-year-old tennis
genius displayed dazzaling tennis and wholly dominated and won the
third set in a convincing manner.
</P>
<P>
Explaining her failure today, Novotna said: "I came into the
match with a bit of injury. It was pulled abdominal stomach
muscle."
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, I had a little bit of pain in the second set
and it got worse and worse as the match progressed," she added.
</P>
<P>
Novotna also paid tribute to her younger opponent by saying
"She's so normal. When she is not on court she acts like a normal
teenage kid, but on the other hand she knows very well what she is
doing. When she's out there she wants to win and she has the
advantage that she has so much variety in her game."
</P>
<P>
Hingis, the youngest Wimbledon champion in 110 years, told
reporters after the match: "I felt like a beginner. I did not play
badly. She was just all over the net."
</P>
<P>
The smiling Hingis noted "two different players came together
in this game and she's aggressive, I'm defensive. I did it this
time, She could win next time."

<HEADLINE> Link Between Skin Conditions, Infertility Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli gynecologist
has concluded that hirsutism, overweight and acne in teenage
girls are a warning sign that they may suffer later from
polycystic ovary syndrome and have serious fertility problems,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Roy Homberg, senior gynecologist at the Rabin Medical
Center, reported his research results at a recent conference of
endocrinologists and dermatologists.
</P>
<P>
He noted that dermatologists are often the first specialists
girls consult in teenage years.
</P>
<P>
When the problem is that there is too much hair on the body
and acne, they should look into the possibility of this syndrome,
a disorder marked by a failure to ovulate or menstruate and an
inability to become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
It is caused by the endocrine gland getting out of balance,
with higher levels of some hormones such as testosterone and
estrogen and lower levels of follicle-stimulating hormone.
</P>
<P>
The latter causes the ovarian follicles to grow only
partially, and they do not release eggs.
</P>
<P>
The ovary often grows to twice the size of a normal ovary and
is covered by a smooth, pearly-white capsule.
</P>
<P>
The treatment includes giving female hormones or surgical
removal of the affected ovary. Dermatologists should be on the
lookout, for the pattern of symptoms in early adolescence.
</P>
<P>
Proper treatment can save considerable misery, not only in
dealing with infertility, but also with diabetes and high blood
cholesterol, which in older women are also part of this
syndrome.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Forms Interim Council in Hill District </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
constituted a five-member interim local government council for
Khagrachhari hill district, one of the three troubled southern
hill districts, following the extended term of the elected body
expired on July 4.
</P>
<P>
According to an official handout here today, the new committee
took over charge at a simple ceremony at the district local
government office on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, interim committees for the other two hill districts,
Bandarban and Rangamati, could not be formed for court injunction.
</P>
<P>
A High Court Division bench has placed an embargo on the
government, following a writ filed by the two councils, in
appointing interim committee for the hill districts.
</P>
<P>
The government in 1989 introduced the local government council
system for the three districts in Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT).
The councils for the hill districts were installed that year
through direct elections for a three-year term.
</P>
<P>
But, due to unrest triggered by tribal insurgency in the CHT, a
second election to the local government could not yet be held.
</P>
<P>
After the expiry of the elected committees in 1992, the
government had extended their term five times. The parliament
passed a bill early this year, empowering the government to
appoint an interim committee to replace the original councils in
the CHT.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said new election to the local government
councils of the CHT would be held in a peaceful atmosphere after a
solution of the CHT problem through signing agreement with the
tribal rebels.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to hold the next round of talks on
July 14 with the tribal insurgents, who have been fighting about
two decades for the self-rule of the resource-rich hill areas.

<HEADLINE> Law Needed in India to Stop U.S. Bio-piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian experts have time and
again called for enacting new laws in the country so as to stop
U.S. bio-piracy, the National Herald said here today.
</P>
<P>
The developed nations, the United States in particular, "have
been thieving away our resource-rich bio-diversity for decades
now. It is said that the gene-bank in the U.S. have stored almost
90 percent genes of our plant and animal resources. And this loot
will go on and on unless a stringent law is put in place at the
soonest to end it," the paper quoted experts as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is what the U.S. does not want. In order to put pressure
on India not to enact such a law, the U.S. government has been
bullying her to accept the unequal intellectual property rights
treaty," it further said.
</P>
<P>
"India is endowed by nature with a rich bio-diversity of 45,000
plants and 95,000 animal species... ninety percent of plant
species have already been patented by outside agencies without
least assertion of ownership rights by the Indian states," it
said.
</P>
<P>
"If this genetic loot is to be stopped forthwith, New Delhi
must immediately enact a stringent law to make such thieving a
cognizable offense. Not doing so is not only posing an economic
threat to our country but is also putting at risk the livelihood
of millions of our countrymen," it stressed.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Green Food Production Bases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build 10 additional
green food production bases nationwide by the year of 2000, which
will both increase farmers' income and promote agricultural
growth, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Known as organic or natural food in the west, green food means
high-quality, nutritious agricultural products with low content of
chemical fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
Green foods are usually sold at prices 10 percent higher than
regular food in China.
</P>
<P>
Li Lintao, an official with the China Green Food Development
Center, said that the 10 major cities with such production bases
include Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The center was accepted as a member of the International
Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements in 1993.
</P>
<P>
He said that the center is now seeking support from local
governments, to have more farmers to produce green food.
</P>
<P>
Experts with the bases will provide technological service to
local farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Vegetable Production Base in the capital's eastern
suburb covers an area of 13.3 hectares, and earns a total of 2.5
million yuan in profits every year.
</P>
<P>
He said that China had had 712 kinds of green food products by
the end of 1996, and the industry's output value reached 15
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Only 0.1 percent of the country's cultivated land have been
allocated for green food production, Li said, adding the figure is
expected to hit one percent by the end of this century.

<HEADLINE> In Memory of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The year of 1997 sees the 60th
anniversary of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which militarist
Japan provoked to wage its all-out war of aggression against China.
</P>
<P>
As an old Chinese saying goes: "Past experience, if not
forgotten, is a guide for the future." Therefore, today, it is
absolutely necessary to look back upon Japanese militarists' war
of aggression against China and to draw a profound lesson from it.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary because there has always existed a small
right-wing force in Japan which denies Japan's history of
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Those people became even more active in recent years,
intensifying their efforts to eulogize and whitewash Japanese
militarism and tried hard to reverse the verdict on Japan's
invasion of other Asian nations, including China.
</P>
<P>
They said Japan was defending its "legitimate rights" when it
forced the 21 Demands on China in 1915, which was aimed at
dominating China, and when it launched the September 18 Incident
in 1931, which was a significant step toward Japan's occupation of
the entire northeast of China.
</P>
<P>
They claimed the Marco Polo Bridge Incident was not created by
the Japanese side and instead was the work of the Chinese troops.
</P>
<P>
They even alleged the Rape of Nanjing (Nanking) in 1937 was
"merely fabrication."
</P>
<P>
By these remarks of utmost absurdity, they distorted history to
the utmost degree, thus severely hurting the feelings of the
Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Their moves cannot but make people highly vigilant. What on
earth do they intend to?
</P>
<P>
Opening the historical records which are not yet dust-laden, we
can easily find that Japan's invasion and occupation of China was
a long-premediated ambition of the Japanese militarists.
</P>
<P>
The notorious (Giichi) Tanaka Memorial to the Throne in 1927
revealed Japan's ambition of annexing China as part of its
strategy to conquer and dominate the world as early as in the
1920s.
</P>
<P>
It was under the strategy of the Tanaka memorial -- "to conquer
China, we must first conquer Manchuria and Mongolia; to conquer
the whole world, we must first conquer China" -- that the Japanese
militarists provoked the September 18 Incident and concocted the
so-called Manchuria state within China.
</P>
<P>
It was under the same strategy that, Japan, after deliberate
planning, created the Marco Polo Bridge Incident on July 7, 1937
and later spread the flames of war to more than two thirds of
Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
During the war, Japanese aggressor troops desperately
implemented the policy of "kill all, loot all and burn all" on
Chinese soil, and even used biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
The atrocities that Japan inflicted upon China were the most
barbarous and most brutal in human history.
</P>
<P>
Japan's aggression against China was unprecedented in human
history in terms of duration, scale and damage.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, as many as 35 million Chinese
were killed or wounded during the war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Calculated by the exchange rates of 1937, the direct damage
which Japan caused to China reached as high as 100 billion
U.S. dollars, while the indirect damage 500 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The monstrous crime that Japanese militarists committed in
China, human testimony and material evidence which is still there
will by no means disappear with the mere disavowals of a handful
of Japanese.
</P>
<P>
The more they try to cover it up, the more the crime will be
exposed. What the small group of Japanese are doing will only
make the already shameful historical records of Japan all the more
disgusting.
</P>
<P>
These people who are trying to reverse the historical verdict
may not realize that they are functioning as teachers by negative
example. Consequently, people have removed the scales from their
eyes, and are able to see that in Japan there indeed exists a
small group of right-wing forces ready to make trouble with
ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
The right-wing forces may be thin in manpower, but their energy
and influence should never be underestimated. Therefore they
deserve high vigilance.
</P>
<P>
To adopt a correct view of history is the political basis for
the development of Sino-Japanese relations. It is also the
starting point for the establishment of mutual trust between the
two countries and an essential precondition to friendship between
the two nations from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
To admit rather than deny that period of history when Japan
inflicted atrocities on China is a matter of principle.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a few people in Japan, overtly or covertly,
have accused China of repeatedly picking on Japan on the issue of
history.
</P>
<P>
But, as a matter of fact, since the end of the war, the Chinese
side has always held that the two countries should look forward in
developing bilateral relations, and that there should be a
distinction between Japanese militarists and the broad masses of
Japanese people, who also suffered from the war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, China buried old grudges with Japan and
resumed diplomatic relations with it, in the hope that the
unpleasant page of history could be forever turned over.
</P>
<P>
However, the tree may crave calm, but the wind will not stop.
A small group of Japanese repeatedly stirred up trouble after the
resumption of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. Consequently,
the spirit of the 1972 Sino-Japanese Joint Statement was profaned
and the feelings of the Chinese people were severely hurt. Only
under such circumstances was the Chinese side compelled to make
necessary reactions.
</P>
<P>
Facts show that the issue of history does not re-emerge from
time to time because the Chinese people are fond of bringing up
matters of the past, still less that the Chinese people like to
continually pick on Japan. The crux of the problem is quite clear.
</P>
<P>
Even today, a handful of Japanese are advocating reactionary
militarist historical views in an attempt to reverse the verdict
on Japan's history of aggression.
</P>
<P>
Their remarks and activities bring troubles not only to China
but also to Japan and the Japanese people, because their words and
deeds do not conform to the historical views of the Japanese
people and their common wishes to develop friendship with China.
In fact, they are obstructing and sabotaging the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
China and Japan should join their efforts to oppose and stop
such activities, to strictly abide by the 1972 Joint Statement and
the 1978 Treaty of Peace and Friendship to guarantee the sound and
stable development of bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> First Farmer's Banking Office Set up in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 6 (Xinhua) -- With a view to eradicating
poverty in the rural areas, the first banking office run by
farmers in Nepal was set up Saturday in Dhading district, about 40
kilometers west of here.
</P>
<P>
The starting of the banking office by a group of farmers
through cooperative institutions is significant, it is very useful
for the farmers saving small amount of money for improving living
standard and the development of the district, said Nepali Finance
Minister Rabindra Nath Sharma when inaugurating the banking
office.
</P>
<P>
Through the so-called "Small Farmers Banking Office", farmers
could exploit maximum resources, saving more money and utilizing
them in productive activities, noted Sharma.
</P>
<P>
Devendra Pratap Shaha, acting general manager of the Nepali
Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), promised to work more for the
welfare of farmers by expanding the small farmers' development
programs all over the country to wipe out poverty from grassroots
level, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Farmers speaking on the occasion demanded more facilities from
the country's central bank and the ADB as well as donors for
sustaining farmers' projects in the long run.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' banking office had collected some 1.51 million
rupees (about 25,000 U.S. dollars), out of it, about 1.32 million
rupees (22,000 dollars) has been loaned, said the reports.

<HEADLINE> Baht Flotation to Hit Thailand's Property Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The flotation of the baht is
dealing yet another blow to Thailand's ailing property industry,
said the chief of Thailand's largest real estate developer.
</P>
<P>
Anant Assavapokin, managing director of the Land and House,
said the sector would be hit by the end of the year with higher
construction costs pushing up the price of property and turning
away buyers.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's property sector has been in a poor state for about
four years now, with sales of completed office buildings and
apartments being stagnant and developers unable to repay their
loans from banks and interest.
</P>
<P>
The problem now was no one could be sure when the value of the
baht would settle and it was difficult for developers to predict
future capital costs, Anant told a seminar on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said he had ordered all 30 of his sales offices across the
country to stop selling houses currently under, or about to be
constructed, as the company had to recalculate building costs,
which were certain to rise.
</P>
<P>
He said that some people predicted that the baht will go down
to as low as 35 baht per US dollar. If this turned out to be true,
the situation would be even worse.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Air freight grew fastest of all
cargo transportation in the first four months of the year,
outpacing passenger transportation, today's China Daily reported.

<HEADLINE> Yuan Hits Record High From Dollar Oversupply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese RMB yuan surged to a
25-month high against the US dollar on the Shanghai-based China
Foreign Exchange Trade Center in June, propelled by an oversupply
of greenbacks in the domestic market, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The renminbi touched an 8.2905 high against the US dollar on
June 25, the highest closing price since May 19, 1995 when it
ended at 8.2892.
</P>
<P>
The yuan continued to rise in June, despite the dollar's strong
performance in the world market. The yuan closed higher at 8.2906
against the dollar on June 27, the last trading day of the month,
up from 8.2914 on June 2.
</P>
<P>
"The growing oversupply of dollars has been a major factor
supporting the yuan's gradual upward trend since the beginning of
the year," a Bank of China dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar supply exceeds demand because of China's strong
trade surplus, steady foreign investment and more foreign
financial institutions doing business in China.
</P>
<P>
Customs statistics show China posted a 13.9 billion US dollars
trade surplus in the first five months, compared to a 451 million
US dollars deficit the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Relatively tight macro-economic control has curbed inflation,
which caused more support for the yuan. China's benchmark retail
price index rose 0.8 percent in May.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Port Cargo Handling Halts due to Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Some 16 ships were waiting to unload
goods and containers in Chittagong port, the largest seaport in
south Bangladesh, while 17 others were in the outer anchorage till
today, according to port sources.
</P>
<P>
Following a hassle between merchant workers and coaster hatch
workers over cargo handling rights, a massive cargo jam had been
created in the last four days, disrupting import-export trade
through the country's commercial lifeline.
</P>
<P>
Port sources said more than 100 trucks carrying export items,
mainly readymade garments, remained in queue outside the port.
However, port activities, except dispatch and delivery and cargo
handling, are still going on, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 merchant workers stopped handling cargo last
Thursday in protest against engagement of hatch workers in
lighterage cargo from ships anchored at the outer anchorage.
</P>
<P>
Sources said rivalry between the two workers associations, the
Merchant Workers's Union and the Coaster Hatch Workers Union, has
been continuing for a long time over sharing of work at the hatch
of vessels at the outer sea.
</P>
<P>
Kamal Uddin, president of the Merchant Workers' Union", said
"We will continue our strike until and unless the hatch workers
are withdrawn from lighterage works as we are supposed to that
job."
</P>
<P>
The hatch workers, however, said that they were driven out from
their work by the merchant workers by force in 1986 and they were
struggling for the last few years to get back their right of
handling lighterage works at the outer sea.
</P>
<P>
In those days, Chittagong Mayor ABM Mohiuddin Chowdhury and
port authorities were continuing effort to end the dispute between
the two groups, but no sign of development was in sight, said
sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters
Association (BGMEA) in a statement Saturday urged the government
to immediately deploy the emergency force to break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
The BGMEA's president Golam Quddus apprehended that the
deadlock at Chittagong port would have serious adverse impact on
the country's overall export trade, resulting in colossal loss of
foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign buyers are losing confidence in Bangladesh as the
deadline for export could not be met due to repeated deadlock in
the port," he added.

<HEADLINE> Thai Executives Back Baht Float: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The float of the baht since
Wednesday is welcomed by a majority of executives of banks and
finance firms in Thailand, according to the Bangkok Post today
quoting a poll.
</P>
<P>
Of the 131 samples, 85.5 percent agreed with the float, 8.4
percent disagreed and 6.1 percent had no comment.
</P>
<P>
Of the supporters, about 47.7 percent said they supported the
float decision because it reflects the reality prevailing in the
money and capital markets, according to the poll, conducted on
Wednesday and Thursday by the ABAC-KSC Internet Poll Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
About 19.8 percent of the supporters backed the float because
they had confidence in the government's policy to solve economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
The remaining supporters said the float would stimulate capital
flows from abroad (14.4 percent); would yield positive effects on
the economy in the long run (12.6 percent) and would help increase
foreign reserves (5.5 percent).
</P>
<P>
Others said it would cause problems as financial institutions
have not yet been ready for the change (27.3 percent); add debt
burden on leading importers and certain state-owned businesses
(18.2 percent) and cause fluctuations in the value of the baht
(9.0 percent).

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Becomes One of World's Big Gold Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia is one of the world's
"big-ten" gold-producing countries with an annual production
capacity reaching 129 tons in 1996, Leo Hadi, country manager of
the World Gold Council (WGC) said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia was indeed a big gold producer but compared with the
world's need for gold which reached 3,000 tons a year, the
production level in the country was still low, Hadi said in
Denpasar, Bali on Saturday.

He said the biggest gold producer country in the world today
was Italy, but this country was also the biggest gold consumer
with an annual need for gold of 514 tons.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's gold industry had been developed for a long time
but its potential as an export commodity had not yet exploited
optimally, he said.
</P>
<P>
For the purpose, he said, the World Gold Council Indonesia was
holding a gold appreciation program which had been carried out
since 1993 through exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's main market for its gold export is the Middle East,
China (through Hong Kong) and the United States.

PANAMA CITY, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Central American commercial
integration process should be accelerated, Carlos Alberto
Federspiel, President of the Federation of Chambers of Commerce of
the Central American isthmus, said here recently.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a recent meeting of representatives of regional
chambers of commerce, Federspiel said "it is important that the
regional economies get ready to work in search of an economic
union, to prepare for the Americas Free Trade Agreement (AFTA)
that must be ratified by 2005."

<P>
"We are in front of globalization, which is an era of changes

<HEADLINE> China Using High-Tech to Improve Traffic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- China has worked out a plan to
establish about 100 urban traffic computer command centers over
the next decade to relieve the increasing traffic jams and
accidents.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 280,000 traffic accidents occurred
last year in China, killing 73,655 people and injuring 174,447,
today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
It is urgent for China to curb traffic congestion and reduce
accidents, as the number of motor vehicles has been quickly
expanding in the bicycle capital of the world, according to
Chinese officials.
</P>
<P>
Large and medium cities will install electronic
video-monitoring systems to direct its traffic flows, said Zhang
Dianping, chief of the Traffic Management Bureau under the
Ministry of Public Security.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Continues Minsheng Discussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Discussions continue about the
World Bank's proposed participation in China Minsheng Banking
Corp, today's China Daily quoted a top Minsheng official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng is China's only non-State bank.
</P>
<P>
Minsheng Chairman Jing Shuping said the bank had given its
financial statements to the International Finance Corp (IFC), a
World Bank subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
More talks are expected after the company finishes studying the
statements. IFC, which specializes in financing the private
sector, last year asked to buy a stake in Minsheng, which
responded warmly.
</P>
<P>
China's financial authorities supported the idea, Jing
said. The purchase would be the second case of international
involvement in China's banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The first was the Asian Development Bank's equity investment in
China Everbright Bank last year.
</P>
<P>
The issue drew international banking attention because the
country's banking sector had excluded foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said ADB's purchase was not
"foreign" because ADB was an international institution, of which
China holds a share.
</P>
<P>
However, the central bank said the Everbright case would be an
experiment.
</P>
<P>
Jing said Minsheng hoped to receive IFC assistance in its
efforts to become a world standard commercial bank. That has been
one of the bank's top tasks since the bank opened early last year.
</P>
<P>
The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce (ACFIC)
launched the bank to serve the country's capital-starved private
sector. Jing is chairman of the federation.
</P>
<P>
The bank's majority shareholders are private enterprises. It
aroused IFC's interest, which had been waiting to play a role in
the country's financial reform.

SANTIAGO, July 5 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine and Chilean defense
and foreign ministers will hold a meeting scheduled for July
10-11, but the place has not been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Defense Minister Perez Yoma said today that the meeting
is something very special, since there will not be an agenda of
programmed themes.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the place where the meeting will be held, Perez
said it will be "out of Santiago," "but we are not going to say
where, at least today."

square kilometers to Chile, but the agreement has not been
ratified by the Chilean and Argentine congresses.

<HEADLINE> Italy and Yugoslavia to Meet in European Basketball Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Italy and Yugoslavia will meet at
the final of the European Men's Basketball Championships after
respective victories over Russia and Greece in Barcelona on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Defending champions Yugoslavia were always in control in their
88-80 win over Greece but the Italians were forced to come from
behind in their frantic 67-65 win over Russia.
</P>
<P>
Italy beat the Yugoslavs 74-69 in a group match earlier in the
competition, and are yet to lose a match in the tournament but
will nervetheless start the game as underdogs.
</P>
<P>
The Italians looked to be on their way out of the competition
after a poor start which left them 28-18 down.
</P>
<P>
Carlton Myers, tightly guarded by Russia's Sergei Babkov, was
slow to find his form.
</P>
<P>
But it was Myers who turned the game round, and with the
Russians giving up several vital possesions in the closing
minutes, the Italians were able to hang on.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Yugoslavia had played their best game of the
tournament to deal with the previously unbeaten Greek side.
</P>
<P>
Zeljko Obradovic's team went in at the break only four points
up, but quickly took control and surged to a 65-50 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Greeks closed to 74-68, and with five opponents in foul
trouble looked likely to give the reigning champions a close run.
</P>
<P>
But poor shot selection cost the Greeks the chance to draw
closer and the Yugoslavs kept their heads to run out comfortable
winners.
</P>
<P>
Two of Obradovic's key players are doubtful for Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
Aleksandar Djordjevic did not start the match and was troubled
by a leg injury throughout the game, particularly in the final
time-out.
</P>
<P>
The injury may limit Djordjevic's role in the final, while
fellow guard Predrag Danilovic pulled up at the end of the
semifinal with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
All four semifinalists have already guaranteed places in next
year's world championships.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Issues Alert Against Cotton Pests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese agrotechnicians are being
urged to improve their monitoring of bollworms infesting cotton
fields and take stringent and effective measures against the pest
inflicting a disaster, according to the China Information Daily.
</P>
<P>
China this year has more than 4.565 million hectares of
cotton, slightly less than that for 1996, but the newspaper
reported that a bollworm disaster once again threatened to infest
the crop as it came to the blossom stage.
</P>
<P>
Bai Zhijian, Vice Minister of Agriculture, said at a national
cotton meeting that the fight against bollworms is important to
keep cotton output on a par with that of last year.
</P>
<P>
To do so, he said, growers need to raise their yields since the
total acreage under cotton is less than last year's.
</P>
<P>
Bollworms brought disasters in cotton fields of the Yellow and
Huaihe river valleys in 1992, causing an economic loss of four
billion yuan.

<P>
LONDON, July 5 (Xinhua) -- Irishman Steve Collins retained his
World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight title by stopping
American challenger Craig Cummings in the third round at Glasgow
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the 32-year-old Dubliner's seventh successful defence of
the title he took off British boxer Chris Eubank in March 1995.
</P>
<P>
Kilt-wearing Collins was left on his backside by a Cummings
left hook after just 16 seconds but quickly reasserted himself by
decking the American, a late replacement for Syrian-born Anwar
Oshana, before the end of a pulsating opening round.
</P>
<P>
It was all one way in the second, with 29-year-old Cummings
unable to cope with the power of his Irish opponent.
</P>
<P>
And it was no surprise when a series of heavy punches without
reply prompted the referee to call off the fight after one minutes
17 seconds of the third round.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Collins now improved his record to 36 wins,
20 knockouts and three defeats.
