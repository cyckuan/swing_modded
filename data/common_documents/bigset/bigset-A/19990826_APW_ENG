<HEADLINE> FBI Document War Crimes in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Dozens of FBI forensic experts have begun  
arriving in Kosovo to conduct a second round of searches for 
evidence of war crimes at the request of the International Criminal 
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, the FBI said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal asked them to conduct searches and tests on seven  
sites for physical evidence that might corroborate, or rebut, 
witness statements alleging that Serbian forces committed war 
crimes against ethnic Albanian civilians, FBI spokesman Chris 
Whitcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic and four of his top aides  
have been indicted by the tribunal, which accused them of being 
ultimately responsible for atrocities by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	All the sites are in central Kosovo province in the sector now  
patrolled by British troops and Canadian policemen. The FBI teams 
will set up operations in the town of Glogovac, Whitcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first members of the 66-person contingent arrived in Kosovo  
on Wednesday evening and the last members of the group left 
Washington on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This group includes many of the 65 FBI agents who spent 11 days  
in June examining alleged war crime scenes in Kosovo. That mission 
was originally asked to examine two sites in the Italian sector of 
Kosovo around Djakovica, but it worked so swiftly that the tribunal 
added seven more sites to their task. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI officials attributed that mission's efficiency to a decision  
to fly in everything it would need, including tents, food, fuel, 
electrical generators, transportation and water, because the 
conflict in Kosovo has destroyed the local economy. In all, they 
brought in 95,000 pounds of equipment. Members of the FBI Hostage 
Rescue Team provided security. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were totally self-sufficient,'' said Art Eberhart, who led  
one of the two 18-member FBI crime scene teams on the first 
mission. The new mission is similarly equipped. 
</P>
<P>
	As in the first mission, the new effort has two teams. Each  
includes a leader, an eight-person evidence response team, a 
photographer, a communicator, a crime scene reconstruction 
specialist, an explosives expert, a dentist, an investigator from 
the tribunal, a pathologist and an anthropologist from the U.S. 
Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, and a doctor from the private 
Physicians for Human Rights.

<HEADLINE> Religion in the News  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GANGES, Mich. (AP) -- Anita Sivam is used to fielding questions  
about her religion from curious friends and teachers at school. But 
this summer, the 13-year-old got a chance to ask her own questions 
about Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of more than a dozen campers at the annual Hindu  
Children's Camp, she spent a week learning how to chant Hindu 
prayers and about the theology behind her family's beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We learned how to pray and a lot about our religion here, but  
it's also nice because we meet kids of our own religion,'' said the 
eighth-grader from Schererville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp was established more than a quarter of a century ago at  
the Vivekananda Monastery in southwest Michigan to educate Hindu 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	A few similar programs across the country cater to the estimated  
1.1 million Hindus in North America today, compared with fewer than 
100,000 just two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the campers are the children of Hindus who immigrated to  
the United States from India in the last 30 years, according to 
Swami Varadananda, the camp's director. 
</P>
<P>
	He said many parents find it challenging to educate children  
about Hinduism in a society where it is a minority religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want their children to know what their traditions and  
backgrounds are,'' he said. ``Parents want them to have the Indian 
background, but the kids are American. There is a cultural 
difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the program combines religion and fun to reinforce or,  
for some campers, to introduce Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp's sponsor, the Vivekananda Vedanta Society of Chicago,  
is a branch of the Ramakrishna Order. Vedanta teaches that man's 
real nature is divine, and the aim of human life is to realize that 
divinity. It is one of many approaches in Hinduism. Group members 
use the title of swami to address their religious leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The camp's site was chosen after the group's leader spotted a  
sign for Ganges, Mich., while driving along the Lake Michigan 
shoreline. Ganges is the name of a holy river in India. In 
Michigan, a state legislator established Ganges Township in 
Michigan in 1847, but no one knows why he chose the name. 
</P>
<P>
	On one sunny day, the campers spend two hours practicing yoga  
and listening to a sermon about the sin of arrogance. The boys wear 
shorts, but girls, at the request of an instructor giving the 
sermon, cover their legs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are trying to mold their characters,'' said the instructor,  
Swami Chidananda. ``This gives them some basic ideas of good 
behavior. At least they'll have some conception of how to pray, how 
to worship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After class, the group heads outside to tie-dye T-shirts in  
bright blues, purples and oranges. Lunch, including pizza and 
pasta, is vegetarian in keeping with Hindu dietary laws. Later in 
the day, the campers will practice meditation, another tenet of 
Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first year, my mom forced us to come,'' admits Rakhee  
Dodia, 17, of Gilman, Ill., who has returned twice, this year as a 
junior counselor. ``But I like what I've learned. This way if 
someone asks you about your religion, you can answer them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's also nice to be around kids whose families have similar  
backgrounds to her own, she said. ``No one asks us what our 
nationality or religion is,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rakhee's mother, Rekha Dodia, said she sent her daughter to the  
camp to learn religious values, as well as cultural values such as 
modesty and appropriate limits on relationships between boys and 
girls. 
</P>
<P>
	``My children's friends are primarily American kids, and  
sometimes they feel bad because `My mother doesn't let me date or 
do this or that,' and they compare,'' Mrs. Dodia said. ``Then they 
go to camp and realize these kids have the same rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting children to feel comfortable in a temple is also a goal  
of a separate youth weekend camp offered at the Bharatiya Temple in 
Troy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just wanted to bring the kids together and focus on how one  
should live, even if it's not specifically with prayers,'' said V. 
Laxmanan, the temple administrator, who estimates 60 kids ages 6 to 
17 attended. 
</P>
<P>
	Nand Ravanam, 14, of Burr Ridge, Ill., missed Boy Scout camp to  
come to Ganges, but he has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents try to teach me as much about religion as  
possible,'' he said. ``What I've learned about my religion and the 
value of being here with people exactly like me has made it worth 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Running Back Carjacked </HEADLINE>

<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida running back Vannez Gooch was  
carjacked at gunpoint early Thursday morning and taken to a 
secluded road in Putnam County, where he was released unharmed, 
according to the Alachua County Sheriff's Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooch, 22, was abducted outside his Gainesville apartment about  
2 a.m. and left stranded in Putnam County as two men fled in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooch began walking in search of assistance when Putnam County  
sheriffs discovered him, according to sheriff's reports. Several 
hours later, the car was found abandoned in East Palatka, about 35 
east of Gainesville. 
</P>
<P>
	Gooch, a 5-foot-8 junior who transferred from Florida State in  
1998, was not at Thursday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not talked to him. I heard the story and fortunately  
he's OK,'' Gators coach Steve Spurrier said.

<HEADLINE> No Action Taken Against IRA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain's governor for Northern  
Ireland took no punitive action Thursday against the Irish 
Republican Army, even though she said the outlawed group had been 
involved in a recent killing and arms smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Mo Mowlam issued her verdict after weeks of pressure from  
leaders of Northern Ireland's pro-British Protestant majority to 
impose punitive sanctions on the IRA and its allied Sinn Fein 
party, most specifically to halt the ongoing accelerated paroles of 
imprisoned IRA members. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday the province's police commander, Chief Constable  
Ronnie Flanagan, said his detectives had ``no doubt'' that the IRA 
kidnapped, tortured and killed a Belfast man last month in apparent 
violation of the group's July 1997 cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	But Mowlam said she wouldn't halt prisoner paroles or take any  
other action except to keep the IRA's activities ``under close 
review.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the situation in relation to the IRA is deeply  
worrying, I do not believe that there is a sufficient basis to 
conclude that the IRA cease-fire has broken down,'' she said in a 
prepared statement. ``Nor do I believe it is disintegrating, or 
that these recent events represent a decision by the organization 
to return to violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, lambasted  
Mowlam's decision. Security spokesman Ken Maginnis called it 
``utter, unmitigated rubbish,'' and added: ``We know that she's 
being held to ransom by the threats of Sinn Fein.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mowlam denied accusations that the IRA was now free to kill more  
people, so long as the group didn't claim responsibility. She 
emphasized that she had already ``come extremely close'' to taking 
punitive action. 
</P>
<P>
	But when asked whether IRA paroles would be halted if the IRA  
was implicated in another killing, she said: ``I don't want to say 
categorically `one more (killing) and that's it.' ... But I'm 
making it very clear that we are very close to the edge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA cease-fire, along with matching truces by Northern  
Ireland's outlawed pro-British paramilitary groups, provide an 
essential buttress for the Good Friday peace accord of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that historic agreement, Sinn Fein is supposed to  
receive two posts in a new 12-member Cabinet for Northern Ireland. 
But the Ulster Unionists have refused to form the administration 
until the IRA accepts its obligation to disarm under terms of the 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	A fresh round of multiparty talks led by former U.S. Sen. George  
Mitchell, who chaired the 1998 negotiations, is scheduled to begin 
in Belfast Sept. 6. His goal is to resolve the deadlock between the 
Ulster Unionists and Sinn Fein and identify a workable compromise 
that would allow the four-party Cabinet to be formed and IRA 
disarmament to begin.

<HEADLINE>  Russia Bombs Retreating Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russia's military said today that its  
planes bombed a column of Islamic militants retreating to Chechnya 
from fighting in the neighboring Russian region of Dagestan, but 
officials gave conflicting accounts of whether Chechen territory 
was targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	Chechen officials claimed the Russian jets made 16 bombing runs  
against bases in Chechnya belonging to the insurgents, who had 
taken part in the occupation of several villages in Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Defense Ministry's press center in Dagestan said  
Russian jets bombed the militants in Dagestan near the Chechen 
village of Buniaul, but denied earlier military reports that 
Chechen territory was attacked. The center claimed the jets 
destroyed three vehicles carrying rebels leaving Dagestan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian command has reserved for itself the right to  
deliver strikes on the rebels wherever they are,'' the press center 
said, according to the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev and Air Force Chief of Staff  
Anatoly Kornukov also denied that Chechen territory had been bombed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``No strikes on Chechen territory were delivered yesterday,''  
Sergeyev told Interfax during a trip today to the Astrakhan region. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian jets have bombed rebel bases in Chechnya several times  
since Islamic militants seeking an independent Dagestan crossed the 
Chechen border into Dagestan's Botlikh region on Aug. 7 and took at 
least six villages. 
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of bombardment by Russian forces, the rebels --  
estimated at one point to have a fighting force of more than 2,000 
gunmen in Dagestan -- had largely fled the region by today, but 
handfuls of militants remained and waged attacks against local 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, 20 rebels clashed with police around Andi villlage  
for two hours. Casualties were not known for either side. 
</P>
<P>
	Wounded Russian troops at a hospital in Makhachkala also claimed  
Wednesday that rebel snipers were still active in many villages. 
The soldiers, who refused to give their names, said they were hit 
in Tando, one of the most hotly contested villages. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin today claimed victory in  
the ``first stage'' of the fight against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening a Cabinet meeting, Putin said the government ``will  
continue, the same as before, to settle all acute problems only by 
political methods ... (but) has enough resources for repulsing any 
terrorists or gangsters, no matter where they hide.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Interior Ministry troops in Dagestan, Yevgeny  
Ryabtsev, said Wednesday the remaining rebels were surrounded, cut 
off from supply or retreat routes, and will be wiped out by Russian 
helicopter gunships. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Federal Security Service chief Nikolai Patrushev, who  
arrived Wednesday in Dagestan, said he was under orders from the 
government ``to have the bandit groups destroyed ... and to 
guarantee stability in this republic of the Russian Federation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials claim 1,000 rebels have been killed in the  
conflict, though rebel leaders put their casualty figure at just 
37. Federal authorities said 60 Russian army and Interior Ministry 
troops were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting was the worst in Russia since government troops  
withdrew from Chechnya after a 1994-96 war with separatists, giving 
Chechnya de facto independence.

	Reno Pledges To Find Truth on Waco  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno is promising to  
get to the bottom of the fiery 1993 Waco siege. The FBI now admits 
its agents may have fired potentially flammable tear gas canisters 
the day the Branch Davidian compound burst into flames. ``It is 
absolutely critical that we do everything humanly possible to learn 
all the facts as accurately as possible and make them available to 
the Congress and public,'' said Reno, who, along with FBI Director 
Louis Freeh, has ordered a fresh investigation of what transpired 
on April 19, 1993, at the Branch Davidian compound.

<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man who killed a gay acquaintance who  
had revealed a crush on him during a taping of ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' was convicted today of second-degree murder for a second 
time. Jonathan Schmitz could be sentenced to life in prison for the 
March 1995 death of Scott Amedure, which occurred three days after 
the two taped a segment for the talk show. Schmitz was found guilty 
of second-degree murder in 1996 but the verdict was thrown out on 
appeal due to errors in jury selection. The shooting led to debate 
over ambush tactics sometimes used by talk shows like Jones'. 
Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 14.

	Downpour Cripples NYC Rush Hour

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An early morning downpour today filled city  
streets with rainwater, crippled subways and commuter trains, and 
turned the rush hour into a slow, sodden slog. The normal 45-minute 
commute from the city's outer boroughs to midtown Manhattan was 
turned into a two-hour trek featuring wet bus seats, 6-inch-deep 
puddles at intersections and non-existent taxicabs. Up to 3 inches 
of rain fell after midnight, much of it between 7 a.m. and 9 a.m., 
the National Weather Service said.

side effects from the contraceptive device were downplayed. 
American Home Products Corp. said today its Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories subsidiary will settle the claims of those women who 
said they suffered from nausea, irregular menstrual bleeding, 
headaches and depression after using Norplant. The Dallas Morning

	Rodman: Lakers Will Want Me Back  
</P>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman says he is sure the  
Los Angeles Lakers will re-sign him -- if they want to win. ``They 
ain't gonna win with what they've got, I'll tell you that,'' Rodman 
was quoted as saying today in the Orange County Register. The 
38-year-old Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San Antonio 
Spurs and Chicago Bulls before joining the Lakers for a short stint 
last season. The Lakers waived him in April.

<HEADLINE> Crashes Spotlight SUV Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The carnage was visible from an overpass -- bodies  
and blood from a crash in which six teens were thrown out of a 
sport utility vehicle. Two of them died. 
</P>
<P>
	A day earlier, a rollover accident involving another SUV killed  
two and injured five others. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no question SUVs are popular -- 2.8 million were sold in  
this country last year. But as sales continue to climb, accidents 
involving the vehicles have prompted the government and other 
researchers to take a hard look at their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The two Massachusetts crashes this week illustrate another  
danger -- large numbers of passengers not wearing seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaynah Barnes saw the aftermath of Wednesday's accident from a  
highway overpass. She said it appeared bodies had traveled up to 30 
feet or more from the white Ford Explorer lying on its roof. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they had been wearing their seat belts, they would not have  
been thrown out at least,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Massachusetts State Police agreed. Authorities said it appeared  
that none of the youths wore seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Barnes, 23, said the accident will make her a faithful seat  
belt wearer, but she she's not deterred from wanting an SUV. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's driver error, there's no car that's safe,'' Ms.  
Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety experts say SUVs, like pickup trucks and vans, are  
heavier, ride higher off the ground and have stiffer frames that 
don't give. Transportation officials say their size also leads to 
more rollover accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Transportation announced in March it was  
requiring the 20-year-old mandatory rollover warning labels in SUVs 
be made brighter and more prominent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sport utility vehicles have a rollover fatality rate of 98  
fatalities per million registered vehicles. That's more than twice 
the 44 fatalities per million registered vehicles for all other 
light vehicle types, according to the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 60 percent of the SUV occupants killed in 1997 died in  
crashes when the vehicle rolled over, according to the NHTSA. 
Transportation officials also say that 1,088 of the 1,482 SUV 
rollover deaths that year -- 73 percent -- involved people who did 
not use their seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHTSA is studying rollovers, including those by SUVs. And  
researchers at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis said they have 
just undertaken a study of SUV safety, both for drivers of SUVs and 
drivers of cars involved in accidents with SUVs. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard researcher Edmond Toy said SUVs are marketed as being  
safer for people to drive because of their weight and size, but he 
said the safety tradeoff may be that they are more apt to tip over. 
</P>
<P>
	Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile  
Manufacturers, which represents 11 auto makers, said vehicles are 
being made safer than ever, but people need to drive them properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``An SUV doesn't drive the same way that a car does,'' she said.  
``It's built different. Different vehicles drive differently, 
drivers should recognize that any time they're driving a vehicle 
they are not used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bergquist said the industry also has promoted seat belt use,  
which is reaching a high of 70 percent participation, but has found 
young people the hardest to reach. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're old enough to get their license,'' she said, ``but  
they're still too young to recognize their own mortality.''

<HEADLINE> Youth Unemployment at 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Summertime unemployment among Americans ages  
16 to 24 is at its lowest level in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth unemployment rate in July -- normally the peak month  
for young people to be working or seeking jobs because of school 
vacations and recent graduations -- was 10.1 percent, the Labor 
Department said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the lowest since the summer of 1969, when the rate was  
9.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Significant disparity persists, however, between the  
unemployment rates for young black and white Americans. The 
unemployment rate this summer for young whites was 8.1 percent; for 
blacks it was 21.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unemployment rate was still too high for our black  
youth,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. ``More than one in 
five black youth seeking a job this summer remained unemployed -- 
more than double the unemployment rate of white youth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 2.5 million young people actively looking for jobs  
could not find them in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The summertime unemployment rate for youth has been falling  
gradually since 1992, when it hit 14.5 percent. Last summer, youth 
unemployment was 10.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate for people of all ages has held  
near a 29-year low for more than a year now. At the latest 
calculation, in June, it was 4.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> `Tartuffe' Revival Is Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- God bless the religious hypocrite.  
</P>
<P>
	Without this sanctimonious creature, we wouldn't have  
``Tartuffe,'' Moliere's masterpiece exposing the foibles of the 
puritanically inclined. And we wouldn't have the New York 
Shakespeare Festival's blissful production that captures the broad 
comedy if not quite the black humor of a play that has remained 
timely for more than four centuries. 
</P>
<P>
	This ``Tartuffe'' is a robust revival, brimming with rich comic  
performances that strike the right tone for the wide-open spaces of 
Central Park's Delacorte Theater. Subtle it's not, but that's OK 
because the production gets Moliere's satiric darts across the 
footlights with pinpoint accuracy. 
</P>
<P>
	At the revival's center, of course, is the title cad himself,  
portrayed by Dylan Baker. The actor is the epitome of oily charm as 
he eases into the Parisian household of the wealthy Orgon without a 
murmur from his ecstatic host. Looking like a scraggly Pilgrim and 
dangling a huge crucifix, Tartuffe murmurs, ``I may be pious, but I 
am human, too.'' It's a fact that soon becomes hilariously 
apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	If everyone else is convinced of Tartuffe's duplicity, they  
can't persuade Orgon, played with the giddy joy of a true believer 
by the wonderful Charles Kimbrough. 
</P>
<P>
	Any ``Tartuffe'' worth its sting rises or falls on its famous  
seduction scene, performed here by Baker and the fetching J. 
Smith-Cameron. It's played bawdier than usual, with more than its 
share of skin. 
</P>
<P>
	As Orgon's wife Elmire, Smith-Cameron captures the spirit of a  
woman determined to expose Tartuffe for the fraud he is. While her 
husband hides under the table, Elmire coos and coaxes Tartuffe into 
showing his lecherous colors. 
</P>
<P>
	Director Mark Brokow brilliantly stages this tussle on an  
elongated table that literally spins around the playing area. Baker 
and Smith-Cameron are formidable opponents, getting the laughs and 
the language down pat. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's quite an accomplishment. Richard Wilbur's  
translation, hilarious and poetic at the same time, demands actors 
who can handle verse and funny business at the same time. This cast 
can. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Testa, a vision in chartreuse, bulldozes her way through  
the role of the saucy maid Dorine. Equally high-powered is Dana 
Ivey as Orgon's tart-tongued mother. Danielle Ferland offers an 
appealing baby-cakes version of Orgon's daughter, a girl whose path 
to true love is blocked by a recalcitrant father. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot wraps up rather quickly and artificially, but no  
matter. In the end, this ``Tartuffe'' is a joyous affair, a 
high-spirited romp that can't help make an audience laugh -- and 
then cheer when the religious fraud gets his just reward.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Grades Stress Teens Most </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Asked to identify their greatest  
concerns, teen-agers across the country cited academic pressure and 
the stress of college admissions over worries about campus violence 
or drug use. 
</P>
<P>
	A new survey released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of  
Education asked 1,015 teen-agers to grade the safety of their 
schools. Seventy-seven percent gave their high schools an A or B 
for ``being a safe place, without violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a lot of dramatic stuff about the problems teens face  
in school on television, but the reality, if anyone asks us, is 
that we're not worrying about violence, we're worrying about our 
grades,'' said Karen Denning, 16, of San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	However, minority teens were far more concerned about school  
violence than their white peers, with just 58 percent of blacks 
giving their school an A or B for safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey asked students to list the top pressures they face.  
The largest group -- 44 percent -- cited ``the pressure to get good 
grades,'' and 32 percent said getting into college was among their 
greatest concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-nine percent said fitting in was one of the greatest  
pressures, 19 percent listed the pressure to use drugs or alcohol 
and 13 percent listed the pressure to be sexually active. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm worrying about my future,'' said Ashley Mitchell, 16, of  
San Jose. ``That's a lot more important than worrying about whether 
to drink at a party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found three-fourths of the high school students said  
their future looked promising, even though two-thirds said their 
lives were difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	The new poll was released by Secretary of Education Richard  
Riley during a speech in which he urged business leaders in Silicon 
Valley to support technology in schools. The poll was conducted by 
Peter D. Hart Research Associates and paid for by Shell Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``As educators, parents and concerned citizens, it is important  
for us to listen to what students are telling us about their lives 
and their aspirations,'' Riley said. ``This survey clearly shows us 
that today's teens are not a generation to be discounted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan Chaplin of The Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., a  
social policy research group, said most young people realize they 
need to finish high school and attend college in order to earn a 
good living. Many high schools are also setting higher standards, 
with more rigorous testing and requirements for graduation, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The payoff to finishing more education has increased, and that  
presumably has added more pressure to kids,'' Chaplin said.

	GOOSE CREEK, S.C. (AP) -- Mel Gibson comes to town and they drain  
the swamp. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansive lagoon system at the Cypress Gardens nature  
preserve was reduced to mud and cypress trees so a Hollywood film 
crew can scout for possible hazards during the filming of Gibson's 
upcoming movie, ``The Patriot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gibson is starring as a fictional character loosely based on  
South Carolina Revolutionary War Gen. Francis Marion, called the 
Swamp Fox for his guerrilla-like tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the movie, which will be filmed at Cypress Gardens in  
November or December, calls for Gibson and others on horseback to 
disappear into the woods after ambushing British troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Cypress trees and stumps beneath swamp waters could pose  
problems as horses plod through. The movie will be released next 
summer.

<HEADLINE> Johnson Exceeded Expectations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- When Clyde Hart recruited Michael Johnson  
out of Skyline High School in Dallas, he never visualized he was 
getting the greatest long sprinter in history. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I could say I saw him as a real sleeper to break a  
world record,'' the Baylor coach said. ``I thought he'd eventually 
be good, which is far behind what he became.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hart saw Johnson break a world record at the 1996 Olympics,  
where he ran a stunning 19.32 seconds for 200 meters in his famous 
gold shoes. He saw him break another record Thursday night, when 
Johnson eclipsed Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old mark in the 400, the 
oldest men's existing track record, with a remarkable run of 43.18 
seconds at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's rigid running style, upright with his hands moving up  
and down like a wooden soldier, his low knee lift and his 
piston-like strides, often has been criticized. 
</P>
<P>
	No one can criticize his accomplishments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- World record-holder in two events.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Three-time Olympic champion, in the 1,600-meter relay in 1992  
and in the 200 and 400 in 1996 -- the first man to achieve the 
sprint double at the games. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Four-time world champion in the 400 and two-time world  
champion in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	-- U.S. 200 champion five times; U.S. 400 champion three times,  
with sweeps of those events in 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Had 58 consecutive victories in the 400 from 1990-97 and 32 in  
the 200 from 1990-92. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Roger Black, the runner-up in the 400 at the Atlanta  
Olympics, said as long Johnson is running everyone else will have 
to battle for second place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always said there are two races with that guy in the  
race,'' Black said. ``People who say they are going to beat Michael 
Johnson are idiots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's few losses have come when he was injured.  
</P>
<P>
	The most glaring injury came during his celebrated 150-meter  
match race against Donovan Bailey at Toronto in 1997, when Johnson 
pulled up about halfway through with a pulled right hamstring. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a race to determine the world's fastest human, and  
Johnson was more embarrassed about getting hurt during such a 
high-powered event and being unable to finish than he was about 
losing. Of course, he had expected to win, just like he does every 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries also plagued Johnson during his first three years in  
college. He set a school record of 20.41 in the 200, but a pulled 
hamstring muscle cost him most of his freshman season in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	He lowered his 200 time to 20.07 and his 400 time to 45.23 as a  
sophomore, but broke a fibula in the 200 final at the NCAA 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	After breaking the U.S. indoor record in the 200 with 20.49 at  
the NCAA Championships as a junior, a pulled hamstring kept him out 
of the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, in his senior year, he remained healthy and displayed  
his remarkable potential. He won the NCAA indoor 200, and the NCAA 
and national outdoor 200s and was ranked No. in the world in the 
200 and 400 after running 19.85 and 44.17, respectively, in those 
events. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also has been plagued by injuries since his  
unprecedented sprint sweep at Atlanta. Most troublesome has been an 
imbalance in the hip and pelvis areas. That puzzling problem, now 
apparently under control with the help of physiotherapist Dale 
Smith, who administers to him constantly, forced Johnson to miss 
several meets or pull up in others. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that he is healthy, the 31-year-old Johnson can continue his  
master plan, which he hopes will carry him through to another 
200-400 double at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is a perfectionist, and plans his season's goals long in  
advance. Only injuries seem to distract him. 
</P>
<P>
	He is even prepared for retirement.  
</P>
<P>
	``Eventually (decline) happens to everyone,'' he said. ``The day  
I'm not running fast and it's not because of injuries, I'll be in 
retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For everything he's done, Johnson has been called track's  
``Superman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superman is still flying down the track and no one can catch  
him.

<HEADLINE> Gay Ariz. Lawmaker Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- An openly gay state lawmaker who is an officer in  
the Army Reserve is being investigated by the military after 
discussing his personal life during House debate. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Rep. Steve May, R-Phoenix, denounced a bill  
proposed by Rep. Karen Johnson, R-Mesa, that would have prohibited 
using public money to pay for benefits for same-sex couples. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to Johnson's remark that homosexuality was ``at the  
lower end of the behavioral spectrum'' and a threat to society, May 
told a House panel: ``You can hate me. You can discriminate against 
me. You can be as bigoted as you want to be. But treat me fairly 
under the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May's sexual orientation became widely known during an  
unsuccessful state senate bid three years ago, though he has not 
generally been an activist in political matters regarding 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Reserve officials are investigating May under a ``don't  
ask, don't tell'' policy, governing homosexuals in the military, 
established in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	May contends he wasn't subject to Defense Department regulations  
when he spoke to the press because he was not an active reservist. 
He was recalled to active duty in February after the comments were 
made. 
</P>
<P>
	May argues that since he has never discussed the issue with Army  
colleagues or while on active duty, he hasn't violated the policy. 
</P>
<P>
	May also sees the investigation as pitting his First Amendment  
rights as a lawmaker against a military policy he calls 
destructive. 
</P>
<P>
	``My case shows the silliness of the `don't ask, don't tell'  
policy,'' he said. ``I'm trained and qualified to serve the 
military. The military has chosen to exclude trained and qualified 
people simply because of a stated sexual preference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	May, a lieutenant trained in nuclear, chemical and biological  
warfare defense, also is qualified as a paratrooper. He is 
second-in-command of the 348th Transportation Company. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Eileen Norton, commander of the 484th Transportation  
Battalion, confirmed an investigation is under way but provided no 
details. 
</P>
<P>
	One aspect of the policy permits military investigation when  
there is ``credible information'' to believe the subject is gay, 
the issue in May's case. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacey Sobel, senior attorney with the Washington-based Service  
Members Legal Defense Network, told The Arizona Republic the fact 
that May's comments came before he was recalled into active duty 
may not make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he has made a statement in the past ... they can try to  
pursue a discharge,'' said Sobel, whose network represents military 
employes involved in ``don't ask, don't tell'' cases.

<HEADLINE> 'George' Magazine Remains Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The next issue of George Magazine will hit  
newsstands just as the late John F. Kennedy Jr. left it, though 
October's issue will be devoted to commemorating his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of you asked us how we plan to pay tribute to John in our  
pages. The answer is we've left this issue of George as it was 
before John's death because it was the last one he edited,'' the 
staff said in ``A Letter for the Editor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	JFK Jr., his wife Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and sister-in-law  
Lauren Bessette died in July when the plane he was piloting crashed 
off the shore of Martha's Vineyard. The September issue is due on 
newsstands Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter, ordinarily written by JFK Jr., the staff noted  
that people often asked if their famous editor was really involved 
in the magazine's production. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone who works at George has heard the question a hundred  
times, `Does he ever come into the office?''' the letter said. ``We 
would respond with a mixture of courtesy, because he was gracious 
and would expect the same of us; a little bit of humor, because it 
was a funny question, if you knew the truth; and a touch of 
frustration because he worked hard and made sacrifices for 
George.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letter described just how involved Kennedy was with the  
magazine: 
</P>
<P>
	``John was the co-founder, editor-in-chief, and president of  
this magazine, but the confusion about his role was understandable, 
because nobody expects celebrities to hold day jobs. Truth is, John 
had a hand in every aspect of creating and producing George -- the 
big picture and the daily details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue includes an interview with Attorney General Janet  
Reno, articles on Rob Lowe and Elizabeth Dole, and a listing of 
``the 20 most fascinating women in politics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He edited George because the magazine manifested certain  
beliefs he wanted to promote ... That for all its imperfections, 
politics is a noble profession, and given his unique perspective on 
and place in the political world, he could make a difference by 
saying so,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the October issue will be devoted to commemorating JFK  
Jr., said Lisa Dallos, director of media relations for the 
magazine.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Hostile to Cruise's Apology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAINES, Alaska (AP) -- When Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines'  
president came to apologize for dumping toxic chemicals from cruise 
ships into Alaska waters, locals greeted him with distrust and 
derision. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement of Royal Caribbean's plea agreement with the  
Justice Department for dumping oily water and other pollutants 
further damaged the cruise ship industry's troubled relationship 
with southeast Alaska's small towns. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president Jack Williams tried to smooth the waters this  
week by taking his apology to four communities on the Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want you to know, folks, that we are very, very sorry  
for what happened, but now we have to move forward,'' Williams told 
a group in Haines on Wednesday. ``I hope over time we can convince 
you that we're worthy of your trust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said millions of dollars have been spent on new waste  
disposal equipment and policies to keep Alaska's waters clean. New 
ships will use gas-fired turbines, sharply reducing the blue-gray 
smoke that pours from smokestacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Many listeners here were not persuaded.  
</P>
<P>
	In Haines, 75 miles northwest of Juneau, where timber and  
fishing is being eclipsed by tourism, there were worries about a 
toxic dry-cleaning fluid known as perc that the company 
acknowledged dumping. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, we've considered this to be the best food in the  
world, totally pure,'' Rob Goldberg said, holding up a jar of 
home-canned salmon. Long-haired, bearded and bespectacled, the 
environmentalist stared hard at the clean-cut corporate leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Williams, is there perc in my salmon?''  
</P>
<P>
	Williams said there was no way he could say.  
</P>
<P>
	Many asked for cash to put independent observers on the  
company's ships, to test fish to find out if the dumping left 
toxins and to compensate fishermen hurt by declining local salmon 
runs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel that you're diverting us, that all you want to do is  
talk to us and show us your image,'' said Harry Johnson, a leader 
among Indians in Haines. 
</P>
<P>
	In the national plea deal, the Miami-based cruise line agreed to  
pay a record $18 million criminal fine and plead guilty to 21 
felony counts in five U.S. cities and in Puerto Rico. The Alaska 
fines are the largest: $6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The dumping case has energized a movement to rein in southeast  
Alaska's cruise ship industry, which pours millions of dollars into 
local economies but also exacts a price. 
</P>
<P>
	A large cruise ship carrying more than 1,000 passengers can  
virtually double the population of Haines. An empty stretch of 
wilderness can swiftly be overrun with ship tourists on rafting, 
kayaking and hiking tours. 
</P>
<P>
	In Juneau, where as many as 10,000 cruise passengers can jam  
downtown streets in a single day, more than 500,000 are expected 
this year. The drone from helicopter tours of nearby glaciers 
rattle the windows of the city's houses. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, voters in Haines will consider a limit on the number  
of ships allowed to make port. Voters in Juneau, the state capital, 
will decide Oct. 5 whether to levy a $5 head tax on each cruise 
ship passenger.

<HEADLINE> Senators Fans Threaten To Sue Yashin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- An Ottawa businessman has issued an ultimatum to  
Senators captain Alexei Yashin on behalf of season ticket-holders -- 
play hockey or we sue. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it's wrong what he's doing,'' said Len Potechin.  
</P>
<P>
	Hockey fans have been patient in two previous contract disputes  
between Yashin and the Senators, said Potechin. ``The third time, 
there's no understanding. He's just greedy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So Potechin, aided by friend and lawyer Arthur Cogan, has set  
the wheels in motion for a lawsuit against Yashin for breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	After hearing from Yashin's agent that the star forward won't  
play this season because he is unhappy with his $3.6-million 
contract, the disgruntled fans moved into action. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bingo, we said,'' said Potechin, a Senators season  
ticket-holder since the team's first season in 1992. ``If he's not 
available, we won't sit back and take it. We put out money in good 
faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Cogan sent a letter to Yashin stating that his  
holdout will put him in breach of contract with the season 
ticket-holders. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have been quoted to have stated that you only must think  
about yourself. However, let me remind you that there are thousands 
of season ticket-holder who have committed serious funds in 
contemplation of your fulfilling your contract,'' the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Yashin doesn't show up for the first game, Cogan says he will  
file for a certification of the class action. Yashin might then be 
served with an action. The player would have to file a defense and 
answer questions under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this might serve as a wakeup call for other athletes  
in a similar position who refuse to honor their contract,'' said 
Cogan. 
</P>
<P>
	Yashin, training in Florida with a some other Russian players,  
said he wasn't worried. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever they do, it's fine with me. It's a free country, they  
can do whatever they want to do,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Volume of Help-Wanted Ads Unchanged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The volume of help-wanted advertising in major  
U.S. newspapers remained unchanged at a three-year low in July, the 
Conference Board reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The private research business group said its monthly help-wanted  
index held steady at 85 in July, matching the revised figure for 
June. June's figure initially was reported as 84. 
</P>
<P>
	The index, which stood at 89 in July 1998, is used as a private  
gauge of changes in local, regional and national job supply. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the index is at its lowest level since the summer of  
1996, ``the labor market is tighter now than it was then,'' said 
Kenneth Goldstein, the economist for the Conference Board. ``The 
manufacturing sector, which has been downsizing for a year and a 
half, is now hiring laid-off workers because of mounting orders of 
durable goods.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said he expects the unemployment rate to drop 4  
percent before the start of the new millennium. The nation's 
unemployment rate was 4.3 percent in July and had fallen to a 
29-year low of 4.2 percent in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The seasonally adjusted advertising index, which stood at 100 in  
the base year of 1987, is derived from measuring the volume of 
unemployment ads in 51 major newspapers across the country each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
	From May through July, help-wanted advertising fell in seven  
regions and rose in two. The steepest declines took place in the 
West South Central region, which includes Dallas, Houston, San 
Antonio, New Orleans, Oklahoma City, and Tulsa, Okla., down 7.6 
percent; and the West North Central region, including Kansas City, 
Mo.; Minneapolis; Omaha, Neb., and St. Louis, down 7.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Increases took place in the Pacific region, which includes, Los  
Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Sacramento and San Bernardino, 
Calif., and Seattle, up 2.4 percent; and the East North Central 
region, which includes, Chicago; Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, 
Dayton and Toledo in Ohio; Indianapolis and Gary in Indiana; 
Detroit and Milwaukee, up 2.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: `Dudley Do-Right' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Again, the question is why.  
</P>
<P>
	Why make another live-action movie out of another baby boomer TV  
institution? Why give it a bad script and put talented actors in 
roles where questionable scripting and plotless meandering muzzle 
them? Why trample the memory of a perfectly good cartoon that had a 
delightfully cockeyed 1960s sensibility? 
</P>
<P>
	Sadly, it's happened again. ``Dudley Do-right'' is a Dud  
Done-wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there's anything really wrong with it; it's perfect  
cookie-cutter Hollywood with, admittedly, a couple nice flourishes. 
But we seem to have settled, in the late 1990s, for films that have 
nothing wrong with them -- and very little right with them as well. 
</P>
<P>
	You know the premise: The clumsy but goodhearted Dudley Do-right  
(Brendan Fraser) is a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police 
patrolling his own small but beloved region of the Great White 
North. He's in love with Nell Fenwick (Sarah Jessica Parker); his 
adversary is the epitome of exuberant villainy, Snidely Whiplash 
(Alfred Molina), with his waxed mustache and stovepipe hat. 
</P>
<P>
	The plot: Snidely is fixing to take over Semi-Happy Valley and  
turn it into Whiplash City, much as Mr. Potter turned Bedford Falls 
into Potterville in ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' Snidely has an 
ingenious plan: Salt the hills with gold, then watch the 
prospectors come -- and bring an economic boom with them. It works: 
``Yuppie wetbacks'' in SUVs stream across the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
	Dudley, ever the faithful Mountie, must stop him and win the  
love of Nell, a thoroughly fickle and undesirable girl who can't 
seem to decide who's better for her -- Dudley or Snidely. (Hello? 
Black cape! Evil cackle!) 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from mediocrity, this movie faces one really basic  
problem. It sets up an epic battle between Dudley and Snidely, when 
part of the appeal of the Jay Ward cartoons was that the clashes 
were never epic, just eternally unceasing. Like the Coyote and the 
Road Runner, Dudley and Snidely were trapped in some cartoon limbo, 
doomed to never really win and never really lose. That weary 
adversarial nature made the cartoons more fun. Here, it's just 
insipid. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser, whose talent was unleashed in ``Gods &AMP; Monsters'' and  
``Blast From the Past,'' is sent back to his ``George of the 
Jungle'' days here. His performance is fine -- above average -- but 
that's not saying much when you consider the inferior material he's 
dealing with. Likewise Molina's Snidely. 
</P>
<P>
	Parker is merely annoying as Nell. Her best line comes when  
she's watching an obnoxiously stereotypical Indian performance 
replete with war paint and feathers. ``This is so authentic,'' she 
gushes. 
</P>
<P>
	The best turn comes from Eric Idle, a whiskey-addled prospector  
who befriends the dethroned Dudley and turns out to be a zenlike 
mentor -- and, in the end, something far more. Robert Prosky makes a 
perfect Inspector Fenwick, and Alex Rocco is great fun as the chief 
of the Kumquat Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugh Wilson, who recently wrote -- and directed Fraser in -- the  
lovely ``Blast From the Past,'' falters with ``Dudley Do-right.'' 
While ``Blast'' was nuanced and melancholy, ``Dudley'' is flat and 
only occasionally entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The best part of the whole affair occurs before the movie  
begins: a new ``Fractured Fairy Tale,'' narrated by a guy who 
sounds remarkably like the late Edward Everett Horton, the original 
narrator. 
</P>
<P>
	There are a couple of laugh-out-loud moments. Snidely Whiplash  
and his right-hand man take mud baths together. A group of 
``Brooklyn Indians'' called the ``Kumquat Nation'' (including one 
named Standing Room Only) do Riverdance numbers. And, just months 
after the ``South Park'' movie, Canada is skewered again: ``This 
just in,'' says a news anchorman. ``Scientists say Canadian Bacon 
is actually ordinary ham.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Dudley Do-right'' does sport a bit of Leslie Nielsenesque  
deadpan sensibility, but ultimately it's a 90-minute obstacle 
course of overdone slapstick and unsuccessful attempts at being 
sardonic. 
</P>
<P>
	This sort of outing is becoming a big-screen ``Through the  
Looking Glass'': As cartoons become smarter (witness this summer's 
``The Iron Giant''), movies from cartoons become more stupid. 
``Dudley Do-right'' is a kiddie matinee; if you're an adult, rent a 
video of the old cartoons instead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dudley Do-right,'' a Universal Pictures release, is directed,  
written and executive produced by Wilson. It is rated PG.

<HEADLINE> MetLife Acquires General American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. will acquire  
the troubled General American Life Insurance Co. and its 
subsidiaries in a deal worth $1.2 billion, the companies announced 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife, the nation's second-largest insurance company with $357  
billion in assets, intends to keep General American's headquarters 
in St. Louis. The smaller company's assets are roughly $30 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	General American, burdened by $6.8 billion in obligations, began  
seeking a buyer earlier this month after it couldn't pay 37 big 
institutional investors, mainly money-market funds, who tried to 
cash out on $5 billion invested in General American contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife officials said they have a program in mind to stabilize  
General American's economic situation, but didn't release details 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	General American officials said investors would benefit from the  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition is in the best interest of our policyholders,  
associates, agents, brokers and the communities in which we 
operate,'' said Richard A. Liddy, chairman and chief executive of 
GenAmerica Corp., parent of the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds from the transaction will be deposited into escrow.  
After charges permitted under the definitive agreement, the escrow 
proceeds will be distributed to General American policyholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction has been approved by the MetLife and General  
American boards and must also get approval from the Missouri 
Director of Insurance.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Films Hurt US Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the import-battered U.S. steel industry  
was forced to lay off 10,000 workers last year, the government 
responded with a $1.5 billion loan program, a White House ``action 
plan'' and the threat of punitive tariffs against foreign steel 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the U.S. film industry saw 20,000 jobs leave the  
country, primarily because film and television producers were 
seeking lower-cost locations, no one in Congress or the 
administration rushed to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks may look at this and say, 'That's just a Hollywood  
issue.' But it's not,'' says Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., who is 
taking the lead on Capitol Hill to help persuade American producers 
to stay home. ``It affects working people all over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, overseas productions made up 14 percent of all U.S.  
film and TV projects. But by 1998, they comprised 27 percent, 
according to a study last month commissioned by two major Hollywood 
unions, the Directors Guild of America and the Screen Actors Guild. 
</P>
<P>
	That has meant a fivefold increase in lost wages, spending and  
taxes from those runaway productions to more than $10 billion in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	And the study said that for grips, best boys, extras, caterers,  
sound technicians and other movie-related workers, the picture is 
only getting worse. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of the business is going to Canada, which  
offers tax credits to studios for wage costs, a very favorable 
currency exchange rate and much-improved quality in its crews and 
locations. All that combines for a 25 percent reduction in cost by 
choosing to film in Canada, the study concluded -- a sometimes 
irresistible lure for film producers trying to find ways to hold 
down expenses on multimillion-dollar productions. 
</P>
<P>
	The California legislature is among state governments that have  
taken notice of the film flight, passing two bills that would 
provide tax credits for certain productions that use California 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
	Runaway productions also are a concern for states such as Texas,  
North Carolina, Washington and Illinois, which often get 
smaller-budget projects that are more likely to leave the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Ver Kuilen, managing director of the Illinois Film Office,  
estimates the list of all the projects written with Illinois 
locations that were filmed elsewhere added up to $52 million in 
lost direct spending last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those was ``Blues Brothers 2000,'' the sequel to the  
original film that put Chicago and its south suburbs on the 
moviemaking map. Adding insult to injury, after crews shot only a 
few location scenes in the Windy City, officials from the Toronto 
film office called their counterparts there for advice on how to 
make their city appear more Chicago-like. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not have gotten most of them anyway,'' Ver Kuilen said  
of that and other films. ``But 20 years ago, nobody even thought of 
going to Canada. Now, it's their first thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Weller and the coalition of the unions and state film  
offices are faced with several obstacles as they try to lure the 
studios back home by making the United States a more attractive 
location. 
</P>
<P>
	First, there still is little awareness in Congress and in the  
Clinton administration that a significant problem exists that 
affects more than just California. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, there is no consensus yet among those working on the issue  
on what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller began by proposing, along with Reps. Mark Foley, R-Fla.,  
and Xavier Becerra, D-Calif., an amendment to the Republicans' 
recently passed tax bill that would have provided a 20 percent tax 
credit for film-related wages, tax-free film production bonds and 
low-interest loans. As planned, he promptly withdrew the probably 
overgenerous measure, only meaning to raise the issue's profile. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller also is urging the administration to put the issue on the  
table at the next World Trade Organization talks, set for Seattle 
in November. He would like to see the U.S. trade representative 
address with Canada its requirement that up to 60 percent of the 
content shown on its stations be Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
	Weller says that although the policy is meant to protect  
Canadian culture, it instead is being used as an economic tool to 
give an unfair advantage to Canadian markets over American ones.

	``If they want it to go the way of the TVs and other electronics  
products, then so be it. We will be a minority participant in the 
making of this product too,'' Ver Kuilen said. ``The trend is 
ominous for what has always been a U.S. industry.''

<HEADLINE> Rides Closed at Amusement Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Paramount Parks closed seven rides at five  
North American amusement parks after fatal accidents this week on 
two types of rides: a standup roller coaster and a free-fall ride 
called the Drop Zone. 
</P>
<P>
	All three of the roller coasters were to reopen by tonight, but  
the other rides will remain closed indefinitely, Paramount 
spokesman Susan Lomax said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A roller coaster at Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo, Calif.,  
was closed while the park investigated why its Boomerang Ride came 
to an abrupt halt Wednesday, stranding 28 people high above the 
ground for nearly four hours in 100-degree heat. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramount Parks closings followed an accident Sunday that  
killed a 12-year-old boy on the Drop Zone at the Great America park 
in Santa Clara, Calif., and a roller coaster accident Monday at the 
Kings Dominion park near Richmond, Va. Timothy Fan, 20, was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are reopening the standup roller coasters because our  
investigation of the accident at Kings Dominion showed that it was 
the result of rider misconduct,'' Ms. Lomax said. ``The ride and 
the safety restraints were perating as designed and intended.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Tomei, a lawyer for Fan's family, said he doesn't see how a  
ride can be safe if someone falls from it while it's moving. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I am concerned, once they have locked you in that  
machine, you're not supposed to get out unless you're Houdini,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other standup roller coasters to be reopened are King Cobra  
at Kings Island and Skyrider at Paramount Canada's Wonderland in 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	The other closed rides are the Drop Zone rides at Paramount's  
Carowinds near Charlotte, N.C., Paramount's Kings Island near 
Cincinnati and the Toronto park. 
</P>
<P>
	Those rides will remain closed indefinitely until Paramount  
officials get full reports on how the accidents occurred, Ms. Lomax 
said Wednesday from company headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she had no idea how long that will take.  
</P>
<P>
	Ensuring safety on amusement park rides is difficult because  
inspection procedures aren't standardized for rides and there are 
no reliable statistics for accidents that result in injuries or 
deaths, said Richard McClary of Memphis, Tenn., a former federal 
workplace safety inspector who now is a safety consultant to 
amusement park operators. 
</P>
<P>
	McClary also said some states have no ride inspection programs,  
other states have good inspection programs and some states have 
none. 
</P>
<P>
	``The accidents are happening in the states that have very good  
inspection programs, as well as those that have no inspection 
programs,'' said McClary, executive director of the Memphis Area 
Safety Council. 
</P>
<P>
	McClary and other safety consultants are trying to get industry  
officials to standardize inspection and accident reporting 
procedures. He said the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission 
investigates ride accidents, but only after fatalities or multiple 
injuries have occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	A commission spokesman, Ken Giles, said today that federal law  
exempts fixed-location rides, such as those in theme parks, from 
the commission's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Amusement park and carnival rides kill slightly more than five  
Americans a year, based on 25 years of statistics from the 
commission. There have been more than 130 ride-related deaths since 
1973. 
</P>
<P>
	Many injuries go unreported because victims are treated at  
first-aid stations on site and then go to private doctors, McClary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's really no concrete, hard evidence on what the problem  
is, and this is a big problem. There's no central reporting 
agency,'' McClary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Park operators are reviewing their safety procedures to avoid  
further accidents, said Paul Ruben, North American editor for Park 
World, a British-published magazine that covers the outdoor 
amusement industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Park employees, insurers and state inspectors need to determine  
what caused the accidents and what preventive steps can be taken, 
Ruben said from his office in Penfield, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until those steps are taken, that's the reason you're seeing  
similar rides closed in other parks,'' Ruben said. ``Sometimes, 
it's just rider horseplay, and you can't do anything to stop people 
from misbehaving themselves.''

<HEADLINE> Bankers Hope Sermons Ease Y2K Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's bankers have gotten into the  
sermon-writing business. It's not fire and brimstone they're 
offering, but a way to cool passions arising from fears of a Year 
2000 catastrophe. They're preaching that the world won't come to an 
end, that in fact life will go on normally after the millennial 
date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bankers Association is distributing a folksy sample  
sermon for clergy to help them debunk expectations of a Y2K 
meltdown that would cripple the banking system. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to reach out to the religious community,'' John  
Hall, a spokesman for the trade group said Wednesday, referring to 
the four-page homily which it is distributing to bankers to share 
with their local ministers, priests and rabbis. 
</P>
<P>
	The heads of the country's ATM networks, meanwhile, urged  
consumers not to withdraw unusually large amounts of cash, while 
assuring them that their cards will work normally through the 
year-end date change. 
</P>
<P>
	The sermon aims to counter the belief fostered in some religious  
and survivalist literature that the Year 2000 will bring an 
apocalypse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things will work,'' it says. ``Hospitals will be open. Police  
and fire departments will be prepared. Power companies will be 
fully staffed. Banks will keep your money safe. They're backed by 
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the FDIC, and the federal 
banking regulators have examined every bank in the country for Y2K 
readiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sermon urges: ``We want to go into the new millennium with  
hope, eagerness and faith in this new century of promise. We don't 
want to be crouched in our basements with candles, matches and 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are, after all, two ways to cross the Red Sea. With  
Moses, who with God's help, led the children of Israel into a 
bright, hopeful future. Or with Pharaoh, who in trying to preserve 
the old, hurled his chariots, his officers and his army into the 
sea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesmen for the American Anglican Council and the U.S.  
Catholic Conference declined comment Wednesday on the sermon. The 
distribution of it was first reported by the American Banker, a 
trade publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Goodland, an Episcopal priest who lives in Fountain Hills,  
Ariz., said today he wouldn't use the sermon. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're treading where angels fear to tread,'' he said of the  
bankers' group. Goodland, who was the mayor of Ames, Iowa, in the 
1980s, said problems with his own ATM card have made him question 
banks' readiness for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	At any rate, he said, ``Faith and trust in God is really where  
it belongs, not in banks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, the ATM network executives advised  
consumers to treat the last weekend of the millennium as they would 
any long holiday weekend, withdrawing only the requisite amount of 
cash from automated teller machines. 
</P>
<P>
	The network companies, which are members of the Electronic Funds  
Transfer Association, link banks and other financial institutions 
with hundreds of thousands of ATMs nationwide as well as 
point-of-sale machines used to pay for purchases in grocery stores 
and other retail locations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no need to bury cash in your back yard. There's no  
need to stuff twenty-dollar bills under your mattress,'' said 
Philip Valvardi, president of Money Access Service Inc., which 
operates the MAC network. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Lynch, president and chief executive officer of New  
Jersey-based NYCE Corp., said all the ATM networks' computer 
systems have been fully tested and found ``ready and compatible. 
... Consumers should have complete confidence that their services 
are going to work normally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contingency plans also have been prepared, Lynch noted.  
</P>
<P>
	Stan Paur, president and CEO of Houston-based Pulse EFT  
Association, had this message: ``Stay calm on Y2K. ... The ATMs 
will work. The point of sale (machines) will be available. The sky 
is not going to fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal regulators had given the banking industry a June 30  
testing deadline to make sure its computer systems are ready to 
handle the Year 2000 technology problem, which arises because some 
computers originally programmed to recognize only the last two 
digits of a year could interpret 2000 as 1900. The financial 
services industry has spent some $8.5 billion to $9 billion to fix 
the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators reported early this month that 99 percent of the  
nation's federally insured banks, thrifts and credit unions have 
completed testing for the Year 2000 computer glitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve recently approved a plan to make special  
loans to financial institutions that might need emergency money 
because of consumer fears about system breakdowns caused by 
computers that can't handle the date change. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said in congressional testimony  
that banks will be the safest place for people to keep their cash 
at the end of the year.

	Russia Admits Bombing Chechen Towns  
</P>
<P>
	MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- Russia's military acknowledged today  
its planes bombed two towns in breakaway Chechnya in attacks 
against Islamic rebels withdrawing from a nearby Russian region. 
Chechen officials claimed last night that Russian jets made 16 
bombing runs against bases in Chechnya belonging to insurgents who 
had taken part in the occupation of several villages across the 
border in Dagestan. The Defense Ministry confirmed that Russian 
jets bombed Islamic militants yesterday in two Chechen villages. It 
claimed to have destroyed three vehicles carrying rebels who had 
left Dagestan.

	Aboriginal Woman Loses Legal Battle  
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In a crucial test case for Australia's  
``stolen generation,'' a 56-year-old Aboriginal woman taken from 
her mother at birth by New South Wales authorities today lost a 
legal battle against the state. Joy Williams was seeking 
unspecified compensation, claiming the state breached its duty to 
care for her when they took her from her mother shortly after she 
was born and placed her in an orphanage. The case came on the same 
day that Prime Minister John Howard expressed the government's 
``deep and sincere regret'' over past governments' policies toward 
Aborigines in a landmark speech to Parliament. From 1910 until the 
1970s, 100,000 Aboriginal children were taken from their parents 
under the belief that Aborigines were doomed and saving the 
children was the only humane alternative.

	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Fearing violence by ethnic  
Albanians, Serbs are urging the United Nations to create safe 
havens for them in Kosovo, a move strongly opposed by the Albanians 
as a first step toward partitioning the province. Meanwhile, the 
standoff in Orahovac entered its fourth day today, with the town's 
ethnic Albanians still refusing to remove barriers from roads and 
allow Russian troops to deploy. Serbs want the Russians there to 
protect them against the Albanians. Creation of a peaceful, 
multiethnic Kosovo was a key goal of the 78-day NATO bombing 
campaign, which forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to 
halt his 18-month crackdown against ethnic Albanians and accept 
NATO-led peacekeepers in the province.

National Hurricane Center in Miami also urged people on the

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- A debate on the plight of children caught  
up in wars around the world erupted into a war of words between 
Iraqi and U.S. diplomats over who is responsible for the suffering 
of Iraqi children. The exchange at the end of a daylong debate 
yesterday was sparked by a recent UNICEF report and highlighted the 
tensions that must be dealt with as the U.N. Security Council 
debates a new policy toward Iraq. Iraqi Ambassador Saeed Hasan 
started the exchange, citing a survey of child mortality in Iraq. 
He complained that children there are dying at an alarming rate 
because of U.N. sanctions against Baghdad. But U.S. diplomat Mark 
Minton noted that in northern Iraq, where the United Nations runs a 
humanitarian program, the child mortality rate dropped 
significantly in the last decade.

<HEADLINE> Economy Slows in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A swollen trade deficit helped slow the U.S.  
economy's growth in the second quarter, but consumers continued to 
spend briskly in a sign that business remains strong, economists 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department said Thursday that the nation's gross  
domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- grew at 
an annual rate of 1.8 percent from April through June, down from 
4.3 percent during the first quarter. The government originally 
estimated the second-quarter growth rate at 2.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised GDP report comes two days after the Federal Reserve  
raised interest rates for the second time this summer in an effort 
to cool the economy. The Fed hinted that additional rate increases 
this year may not be needed unless the economy shows signs of 
overheating or if inflation flares. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 127.59 points at  
11,198.45. Stocks may have been hurt by a portion of the GDP report 
showing lower corporate profits, some analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the economy has slowed in recent months, it is still  
expected to grow by a robust rate of nearly 4 percent for the year. 
The total output of goods and services for the quarter was $7.8 
trillion, when adjusted for inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deficit and slower inventory growth subtracted from  
GDP growth in the second quarter, while stronger than previously 
expected consumer and business spending added to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report is a reflection of a strong economy, not a weak  
one,'' said Wells Fargo's chief economist, Sung Won Sohn. 
``Consumers are still on a spending spree. That's one of the 
reasons why businesses cannot keep inventories on the shelves and 
that imports are up so much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter trade deficit was $14.4 billion bigger than  
previously estimated and shaved 1.34 percentage points off the 
nation's economic growth. A 14.4 percent jump in imports 
overwhelmed a 4.3 percent rise in exports during the period. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve policy-makers anticipated that the trade deficit  
``would continue to worsen, although more slowly and with a less 
negative effect on the U.S. economy,'' according to minutes af 
their June 30 meeting released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crisis, which has cut into American export sales while 
increasing competition on U.S. manufacturers from a flood of 
cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	With Americans snapping up cheaper imported goods, consumer  
spending in the second quarter rose at an annual rate of 4.6 
percent. That was brisker than estimated a month ago, but slower 
than the torrid 6.7 percent pace of spending in the first quarter. 
Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of total economic 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, business investment -- spending on new  
equipment and plants -- rose at an annual rate of 11.2 percent in 
the second quarter, an even stronger showing than the government 
first estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending for new homes increased at an annual rate of 7.7  
percent, better than the 5.1 percent rate originally estimated, but 
still slower than the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the things the Fed looks at in gauging the potential for  
inflation to flare is the strength of domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Given that consumers and businesses continue to have a hearty  
appetite for spending, ``I don't think the Fed will look at this 
report and say, `Oh, our job is done, the economy is slowing,''' 
said Cynthia Latta, an economist with Standard and Poor's DRI. ``I 
think they are going to be as vigilant as ever in watching for a 
possible acceleration of inflation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thus far, inflation remains contained. The government did not  
revise an inflation gauge tied to second-quarter GDP, which rose 
2.1 percent. In the first quarter of this year, that inflation 
measure rose 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are actually spending more than they earn, so the  
nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- fell to a record low of negative 1.3 percent in 
the second quarter, the GDP report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, rising labor costs resulting from the lowest  
unemployment rate in three decades cut into U.S. companies' 
profits. Profits fell at an annual rate of $9.2 billion in the 
second quarter, the biggest drop since the end of 1997. In the 
first quarter of the year, profits rose at a $47.1 billion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last  
week fell by 5,000 to 283,000, the Labor Department said. The labor 
market is considered extremely tight whenever jobless claims fall 
below 300,000.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 8, Rockies 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Brian Giles drove in four runs as the  
Pittsburgh Pirates roughed up Colorado ace Pedro Astacio for six 
runs in the first two innings of an 8-4 victory over the Rockies on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Al Martin had three hits and two RBIs to back rookie left-hander  
Jimmy Anderson (2-1), who retired the first 10 hitters before being 
lifted after 5 2-3 innings in his third career start. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio (14-10) had won four consecutive decisions and lasted at  
least seven innings in his last eight starts, only to yield six 
runs and seven hits in two innings. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a major turnaround for Astacio, who had pitched nine  
innings in three of his four starts this month and was 4-0 in his 
last six starts against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Astacio's ERA jumped from 4.73 -- good by Coors Field standards --  
to 4.96 with a quick, ineffective outing than seemed more likely in 
Coors than in more pitcher-friendly Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Giles had a sacrifice fly in a two-run Pirates' first inning and  
a three-run triple in the second that made it 6-0. Giles needs six 
RBIs to drive in 100 runs for the first time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin added run-scoring singles in the third and the fifth,  
when he stopped an 0-for-27 streak against left-handers with a hit 
off Rigo Beltran. That hit followed the second hit by Anderson, who 
earlier crossed up a drawn-in Rockies defense by slapping the ball 
into right field to drive in the first run of the four-run second 
inning. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirates pitchers are 7-for-11 with two RBIs in their last four  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Shumpert's seventh homer, in the fourth, was the first hit  
off Anderson, who left following two singles, a walk and a 
run-scoring error by third baseman Ed Sprague in a two-run sixth. 
Todd Helton hit his 25th homer, in the seventh off Greg Hansell. 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The Rockies were denied their first winning multiple-city  
road trip since September. They went 3-3 in Chicago and Pittsburgh. 
... The Pirates, who allow youngsters to run the bases following 
Sunday home games, let fans 55 and older run the bases after the 
game. ... Colorado went 2-4 in Pittsburgh this season. .... Larry 
Walker, whose .357 average leads the NL, sat out his second 
consecutive game with sore knees. .... Pirates SS Pat Meares began 
a minor league rehabilitation assignment Thursday at Triple-A 
Nashville. He played in 17 games before undergoing surgery to 
repair a damaged tendon in his left hand. ... The Rockies are 1-5 
against left-handed starters this month. ... Sprague's error was 
his 25th.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Make Pitching Moves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs placed right-hander Kevin Tapani  
on the 15-day disabled list Thursday with a sore lower back. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs made the move after Thursday's game. Before the game,  
the team recalled right-handed reliever Rodney Myers and optioned 
reliever Steve Rain to Triple-A Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani, who was 0-9 in his last 10 starts, will stay in Chicago  
to undergo tests rather than go with the Cubs for a West Coast 
trip, which begins Friday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the right thing to do considering where we are  
in the season,'' Tapani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Under the circumstances, it's better to shut him down,'' Cubs  
manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Right-hander Kyle Farnsworth was recalled from Iowa and will  
start Sunday for the Cubs. Farnsworth was 2-7 with a 6.17 ERA with 
the major league team. 
</P>
<P>
	Myers, who was in uniform for Thursday's game, was making his  
second appearance this year with the Cubs. In 32 relief appearances 
from April 14-July 8, he was 3-1 with a 5.49 ERA. In 20 games at 
Iowa, Myers was 2-4 with two saves and a 4.11 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	Rain was 0-1 with a 9.20 ERA, giving up 28 hits and walking  
seven over 14 2-3 innings over 16 games.

<HEADLINE> Gete Wami Wins 10,000m Gold Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Gete Wami of Ethiopia won the 10,000  
meters gold medal at the world championships today, coming from 
behind in the last lap to beat Britain's Paula Radcliffe and set a 
new championship record. 
</P>
<P>
	Tegla Loroupe of Kenya took the bronze.  
</P>
<P>
	Wami finished in 30 minutes 24.56 seconds, the fastest time of  
the year, to take the title. Radcliffe followed in 30:27.13, a 
British record, and Loroupe set a Kenyan record with 30:32.03. 
</P>
<P>
	In a thrilling finish, Radcliffe regained the lead at the bell  
only to see Wami rush by her with an tremendous finishing kick. 
Radcliffe had taken the early initiative and led for most of the 
race. Leroupe took over with 3 laps to go but could not sustain a 
punishing pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Sally Barsosio of Kenya was not at the World Championships to  
defend her title.

<HEADLINE> Report: Liver Centers Inaccessible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Most liver transplants are performed in a  
relatively small number of cities, and many Americans live far from 
transplant centers, an inspector general report concludes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a bitter fight over how to allocate scarce organs for  
transplant, some in the transplant community have argued that new 
federal policies might wind up denying people access to their local 
centers. But the new report argues there's little local access to 
begin with. 
</P>
<P>
	``Widespread local access to liver transplant centers is a  
myth,'' said the report from the Department of Health and Human 
Services inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	HHS issued regulations last year directing the network that runs  
the nation's organ transplant program to create new policies for 
the distribution of organs that would offer organs to the sickest 
patients first. The current system relies heavily on geography, 
directing most organs to local patients even if there are sicker 
ones elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	Many in the transplant community have been fighting this policy,  
which Congress put on hold until October. Among other things, they 
argue that sending all the organs to the sickest patients could 
jeopardize some programs and force their patients to travel great 
distances to get transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not examine whether that would happen, although  
last month, the Institute of Medicine issued a report that found no 
evidence that greater sharing of organs would close transplant 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, the inspector general was attempting to clarify the  
extend to which local access currently exists. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the debate on this rule there was a lot of comment made on  
the importance and value of local access. The implication often 
made was that local access often exists,'' Mark Yessian, who worked 
on the report from the inspector general's Boston office, said 
Thursday. ``We tried to clarify the situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report focused on liver transplant programs because liver  
policy has generated the most controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	It found that in 1997, more than 80 percent of transplants were  
performed in 35 cities and just 20 centers performed more than half 
of all liver transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the report said 77 of the nation's 117 liver transplant  
programs were in cities with two or more centers. At the same time, 
there were 57 centers that performed fewer than 25 transplants per 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Furthermore, most new liver programs have opened in cities that  
already at least one other program. And 45 percent of Americans 
already live in areas that do not have a local center. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is not likely to settle the debate over the issue.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the United Network for Organ Sharing noted that  
the report also found that 34 percent of all transplants were 
performed in cities that had just one transplant center. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's still a pretty significant number,'' said spokesman Bob  
Spieldenner. ``If you talk to those patients, they'd say it's 
pretty important for them (to have a nearby center).'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added that while many patients may not live in the same local  
area as a transplant center, they may be in the same state, making 
it a relatively short distance to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier to drive to get follow-up care instead of getting  
on a plane and traveling somewhere else,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Confrontation With Umpires Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The fight between baseball and its umpires may  
reach the field next Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The American and National leagues have given the umpires' union  
a new schedule for work assignments, several baseball officials 
said Thursday, and after Sept. 1, it doesn't list the 22 umps whose 
resignations were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball's lawyers say the resignations, which were effective  
Sept. 2, begin at the start of the day. The union contends that 
even if it is determined that owners legally accepted the 
resignations, they don't take effect until after that day's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Union president Jerry Crawford said Thursday the issue had not  
been raised yet with management but added that when umpires 
submitted their mass resignations in July, their understanding was 
they would take effect after games of Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Some baseball officials are worried that some of the departing  
umpires may create confrontations next Thursday, and attempt to 
work games. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams have been told to have alternate umpires in ballparks  
ready to work the games, just in case of a mass walkout. Some of 
the NL umpires who are not scheduled to depart have discussed 
striking in support of their colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``We figure we have some options,'' Crawford said. ``I don't  
think I'm ready to tell the world what we'll do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only eight games are scheduled for next Thursday: Philadelphia  
at San Francisco and St. Louis at Milwaukee in the NL, and six 
games in the AL. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires have filed unfair labor practice charges against the  
leagues, and now claim their mass resignations were caused by their 
anger at management and were merely symbolic, not an attempt to 
force an early start of bargaining for a new labor contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired when 27 umps either didn't resign or  
quickly withdrew their resignations. Baseball then accepted the 
resignations of 22 umps and hired 25 replacements from the minor 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires want the NLRB to seek an injunction in federal court in  
New York that would keep the 22 umps at work, and NLRB regional 
director Dan Silverman said last week the agency would try to let 
the parties know its thinking before Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	If the NLRB doesn't seek an injunction, the umpires' union may  
try to get one on its own in federal court in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that once we exhaust all our options as far as the  
legal grounds, we'll certainly go back to our counsels and see 
where we are,'' Crawford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The leagues sent a letter to all umpires, but its contents  
weren't immediately known. The umpires were scheduled to receive 
the letter Friday by overnight mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding that it's another one of their scare  
tactics,'' Crawford said. ``I don't know what's in the letters but 
I'm sure that it's nothing nice.''

<HEADLINE> Hot Forecast for Men's Marathon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Hot, hot, hot.  
</P>
<P>
	That's how it's likely to be Saturday for the men's marathon at  
the World Championships in a region of southern Spain known as 
``the frying pan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The favorites include the two Spaniards who finished 1-2 at the  
1997 worlds in Athens, Greece, in heat almost as suffocating -- Abel 
Anton and Martin Fiz -- and their compatriot Fabian Roncero. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton and Fiz, raised in the cool, green hills of northern  
Spain, are expecting the worst when the 26.2-mile race begins on 
Saturday at 6:45 p.m. local time -- the hottest time of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I have ever gone up against something like  
this,'' said Fiz, 36, who won gold at the '95 worlds and lives in 
the northern Basque region. ``I can't tell you how hot it will 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anton, also 36 and a leader of Spain's recent distance-running  
boom, was even more to the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, I would not suggest running in conditions like this.  
It's going to be terrible,'' he said. ``We're professionals, but 
I'd tell others not to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't fear my rivals, but I fear the weather,'' said  
Roncero, a 2:07 performer who trains in Madrid. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures this week in Seville have reached 104. If that  
happens Saturday, it will be brutal -- or worse. The forecast 
suggests the temperatures may fall a bit, but that means a mild 
90-92. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never heard of an elite marathoner dying in a hot  
race,'' said former distance-running great Alberto Salazar. ``But 
if it's 40 centigrade (100 F), that's something else. I've never 
known of a world-level marathon with that kind of temperature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Athens, Anton out-kicked Fiz to take gold. Tactics will be  
the same here with Fiz trying to break free of the pack after the 
first half and Anton relying on his kick. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look for the first 20 kilometers (13 miles) to be slow with  
everybody feeling out the temperatures, and the last half to be 
very quick,'' Anton said. 
</P>
<P>
	As always, the marathon at the worlds -- lacking financial  
incentives -- has trouble drawing all of the best runners. The most 
notable absentee is Brazilian world record-holder Ronaldo da Costa 
(2:06:05), who said Seville was too hot for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Other favorites could include Italian Danilo Goffi, Japanese  
Nobuyuki Sato and Australian Steve Moneghetti, the bronze medalist 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still don't know who is in the entire field,'' Fiz said. ``I  
know some aren't here because they are afraid of the heat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winning time should be in the 2:11-2:13 range, ``which in  
these conditions is about equal to 2:07 in normal weather,'' Fiz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anton, Fiz and Roncero are under heavy pressure to finish 1-2-3  
in their home country. Organizers expect huge crowds -- hitting the 
sidewalks for their early evening ``paseo'' -- to crowd Seville's 
palm- and orange-tree-lined avenues as Sevillanos return this 
weekend from their traditional August vacations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spaniards have turned down lucrative offers to run in large  
city marathons to be here, with the Spanish federation offering a 
Spanish winner $100,000, $70,000 for second and $40,000 for third. 
The winner also receives $60,000, the championship purse. 
</P>
<P>
	``Athens will be tough to repeat, but winning here would be very  
special,'' Anton said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been our focus for months now,'' Fiz said, ``and  
there would be nothing better than winning in Seville, in your home 
country.''

<HEADLINE> Sharp Philippines Workers On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Workers at Sharp Philippines Corp.  
have gone on strike to protest the termination of 57 employees this 
week, union leaders said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The workers, who walked out Wednesday, also accused management  
of failing to implement a 10 percent wage increase included in 
their collective bargaining agreement and a wage increase 
legislated in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissed workers, including seven union officers, were  
among 545 employees who had been picketing in recent weeks to 
pressure management to discuss their grievances, said union vice 
president Cristeta Aquino, who was among those dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
	The strike at the factory in Muntinglupa City in metropolitan  
Manila has affected production of television sets, karaoke units, 
washing machines and other appliances, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, a subsidiary of Sharp Corp. of Japan, declined to  
comment.

<HEADLINE> Sampras Finds Trouble Early At Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost every move Pete Sampras makes these days  
goes into the record book. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old right-hander is the No. 1 seed at the U.S Open  
for a fifth time, tying the Open Era record set by John McEnroe 
from 1981-85. 
</P>
<P>
	He is seeking his fifth title at the National Tennis Center,  
which would tie him with Jimmy Connors, two behind a trio of 
players, including Bill Tilden. 
</P>
<P>
	And a victory in the century's last Grand Slam tournament, the  
12th of his career, would break the record Sampras shares with 
former Australian star Roy Emerson for most Grand Slam men's 
singles titles. He tied Emerson in July when he won his sixth 
Wimbledon crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The road to the record book, however, could be a little rough.  
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's draw, Marat Safin, a young Russian with a big  
serve, was selected to play Sampras in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Sampras' bracket is two-time finalist Jim Courier,  
Frenchman Fabrice Santoro and 16th-seeded Nicolas Lapentti of 
Ecuador, who won the RCA Championships in Indianapolis last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, the top-seeded player in the women's field, will  
face Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic in her opening match. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, seeded No. 2, will begin the defense of her  
women's singles title against fellow American Corina Morariu. 
Davenport, somewhat of a surprise when she won a year ago, added 
the Wimbledon crown earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams sisters -- third-seeded Venus and No. 7 Serena -- are  
playing in opposite halves of the draw and could meet in the title 
match, as they did earlier this year in Key Biscayne, Fla. Venus, 
who has never lost to her younger sister, opens against a 
qualifier, while Serena will play Kimberly Po, who won their only 
other meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sampras is seeded No. 1, Australian Pat Rafter has won the  
last two men's singles titles on the hard courts at Arthur Ashe 
Stadium. Seeded fourth this year, Rafter also could have his hands 
full with his first opponent, Cedric Pioline of France. Pioline 
reached the U.S. Open final in 1993 and the Wimbledon title match 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded second is Andre Agassi, winner of the French Open in June  
and runnerup to Sampras at Wimbledon. He begins the chase for his 
second U.S. Open crown against Sweden's Nicklas Kulti. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Safin made headlines last year when, in the  
decisive fifth Davis Cup match between Russia and the United 
States, he battled Courier for five sets before falling. He then 
made his Grand Slam tournament debut at the French Open in 1998, 
where reached the fourth round, then duplicated that showing at the 
U.S. Open a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras skipped the early part of the year after a late push saw  
him end 1998 as No. 1 for a record sixth straight year. He lost 
early at the French Open, the one Grand Slam tournament that has 
eluded his winning ways, before beginning a 24-match winning streak 
that was broken when he retired from a match last week in 
Indianapolis with a strained hip flexor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter is also coming into the Open after being sidelined with  
an injury. He retired from his match in Indianapolis and pulled out 
of a tournament this week with tendinitis in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Safin's Davis Cup teammate who  
won the Australian Open in January, will take on Alberto Martin of 
Spain in his opener. After a stretch in which he lost seven 
consecutive matches, Kafelnikov has regained the all-court game 
that took him to No. 1 in the world, albeit briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras and Agassi are seeded to meet in the U.S. Open final,  
which would be the third time they have battled for the crown in 
Flushing Meadows. They also met in the Wimbledon final in July and 
in the Australian Open title match in 1995. Agassi won Down Under, 
with Sampras capturing their other three battles with a Grand Slam 
title on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	If the seedings hold, fourth-round pairings would pit Sampras  
against 16th-seeded Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, No. 7 Todd Martin 
against No. 9 Greg Rusedski of Britain, Rafter against No. 14 Tommy 
Haas of Germany, No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil against No. 11 
Mark Philippoussis of Australia, No. 6 Tim Henman of Britain 
against No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, Kafelnikov 
against No. 13 Alex Corretja of Spain, No. 8 Carlos Moya of Spain 
against No. 10 Marcelo Rios of Chile, and Agassi against No. 15 
Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's draw, fourth-round pairings could pit Hingis  
against No. 10 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, No. 8 Jana Novotna 
of the Czech Republic against No. 15 Amelie Mauresmo of France, 
Venus Williams against No. 13 Dominique Van Roost of France, No. 6 
Amanda Coetzer of South Africa against No. 12 Barbara Schett of 
Austria, Serena Williams against No. 16 Conchita Martinez of Spain, 
No. 4 Monica Seles against No. 11 Nathalie Tauziat of France, No. 5 
Mary Pierce against No. 14 Sandrine Testud in an all-French match, 
and Davenport against No. 9 Julie Halard-Decugis of France.

<HEADLINE> Titans Set To Christen New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three years, three stadiums and one  
nickname later, the Tennessee Titans finally are home. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the 200-mile commutes to home games, sparse crowds,  
cramped locker rooms and aging stadiums. This Friday, the Titans 
move into brand-new, 67,700-seat Adelphia Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the way the National Football League should be,''  
coach Jeff Fisher said of the open-air, natural grass stadium with 
spacious locker rooms for players and extra-wide seats for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like moving from a condo to a mansion,'' left tackle Brad  
Hopkins said of the stadium already nicknamed ``The Delph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going from pinto beans to limousines,'' quipped end  
Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delph is the latest in a growing list of new stadiums in the  
NFL. Cleveland's opens this weekend. Cincinnati's new stadium opens 
next season, while Pittsburgh's will be finished in 2001. New 
stadiums also are planned for Denver, Philadelphia and New England. 
</P>
<P>
	A stadium was the $292 million carrot that Nashville dangled in  
front of owner Bud Adams when he was looking to leave Houston in 
1995. The stadium survived an angry public debate and a tornado 
during construction and will be christened when the Titans (0-2) 
play host to the Atlanta Falcons (1-1) in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a new beginning,'' cornerback Darryll Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	The sparkling coliseum is far different from the franchise's  
former home, the cavernous Astrodome in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Tifsport Bermuda grass instead of Astroturf. Fans have  
an easy walk to their seats, with the bottom half of the stadium 
set below ground level. Easy-to-read scoreboards measuring 
156-by-56 feet are at each end of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	An irrigation and drainage system under the field can handle 10  
inches of rain an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinted glass shields the club sections. Splashes of color come  
from the eight red light standards hovering over the top rows, and 
the blue and red seats inside. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a far cry from the team's last two stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the team's first in Tennessee, the then-Oilers  
practiced in Nashville and played home games 200 miles away at the 
antiquated Liberty Bowl in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the team played at 41,100-seat Vanderbilt Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	Both stadiums had tiny locker rooms, and both years the team was  
last in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Titans have plenty of elbow room in a locker room that  
is big enough for them to run plays. Their families even have a 
spacious waiting room across the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 40 restrooms for female fans, compared to 26 for men.  
</P>
<P>
	A total of 144 suites and 9,600 club seats are designed to  
produce the revenue that will keep the franchise competitive. More 
than 49,000 fans have purchased personal seat licenses ranging from 
$250 to $4,500 that allow them to purchase season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Titans prepare for the regular-season home opener on  
Sept. 12 against Cincinnati, the final touches are being placed on 
The Delph. The stadium opening also eliminates what has been a 
constant distraction for the Titans, who have finished 8-8 the last 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure's on. We've got to win now,'' center Bruce  
Matthews said.

<HEADLINE> Mars' South Pole Picked for Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA scientists hope to land a robot  
spacecraft on a gently rolling plain near Mars' South Pole next 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose a location with some surface features, but no cliffs  
or jagged peaks,'' said Richard Zurek, the project chief at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Zurek said the Mars Polar Lander site appears to have layers of  
dust and ice of varying thickness that could contain a record of 
climate changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense, digging into its surface will be like reading tree  
rings or layers in an ice core,'' Zurek said in a statement 
Tuesday. ``In addition, we may find evidence of soil particles that 
formed in ancient seas on Mars and were later blown into the polar 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The landing will be centered in a target zone 124 miles long and  
12.4 miles wide. It is 76 degrees south latitude and 195 degrees 
west longitude, near the Martian South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists selected the site after studying pictures and other  
data from the Mars Global Surveyor, a craft currently orbiting 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander is scheduled to touch down Dec. 3, near  
the end of the spring season in the Martian southern hemisphere. 
During this time, the target area will be in constant sunlight, an 
important factor given that the spacecraft gets its power from 
solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Polar Lander was launched Jan. 3. The lander has equipment  
to study the soil and to look for ice beneath the surface. Just 
before the craft enters the Martian atmosphere, it will release two 
penetrating probes that will punch beneath the soil surface to look 
for water ice near the landing site.

<HEADLINE> Arista To Release Prince Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just call him the artist who formerly shunned  
major recording labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Arista Records announced Wednesday that it will issue a new  
single from The Artist Formerly Known as Prince in late September. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greatest Romance Ever Sold,'' will be followed by a new  
album in early November, called ``Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic.'' It 
will be The Artist's first studio album affiliated with a major 
label since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I had to get out of the recording industry for  
awhile so that I could reclaim my artistry and become empowered by 
it again,'' the Artist said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer got out of a contract with Warner Brothers in 1995  
and after a brief period with EMI, began producing music on his own 
label, NPG Records.

<HEADLINE> Karsay's Hurting Arm Dims Hopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Just when it looked like the Cleveland Indians  
may have found an answer to a desperate need for another starting 
pitcher, Steve Karsay came up with a sore forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	After his first two starts of the season, during which Karsay  
gave up just one run in 10 innings to improve his record to 10-1, 
Karsay was hit hard Tuesday against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now we've got to take two things into consideration,'' Indians  
manager Mike Hargrove said. ``A, the health of the pitcher, and B, 
what gives the club the best chance to win. It very well may be 
that this is a red flag that says Steve needs to go back to the 
bullpen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether Karsay will go on the disabled list is  
expected soon. 
</P>
<P>
	Hargrove's concern is that the strain of asking Karsay to be a  
starting pitcher may have caused the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way to say this is the specific cause, but after  
being in the bullpen all year and then making two starts where he 
threw 57 and 92 pitches, that's a load,'' Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
	Karsay gave up five runs in three innings against the A's.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to say starting caused it, but it may have,'' he  
said. ``I thought going from the bullpen to the rotation would be 
easier than it was.''

<HEADLINE> Jones Pulls Out After Injury in 200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Marion Jones withdrew from the World  
Championships today, a day after pulling up with a back injury in 
the semifinals of the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's out of the championships,'' said her agent, Charlie  
Wells. ``She's still walking around and we're evaulating her. She 
still has muscle spasms in her lower back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Jones would be out the rest of the season, Wells  
said, ``We still need a couple of days to make that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the sport's top female star, came to the championships  
seeking a record four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the 100 meters Sunday in a season's best 10.70 seconds  
but settled for bronze Monday in the long jump. In addition to the 
200, she had planned to run in one of the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones' championships ended in agony Wednesday night when she  
crumbled onto the track during her 200 semifinal and was carried 
off on a gurney. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by USA Track and Field said, ``Marion is in  
good spririts but is still experiencing back pain and occasional 
spasms. Her medical team continues to assess the nature of her 
injury and provide treatment.' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' husband, shot put champion C.J. Hunter, refused to  
comment when approached at his Seville hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Four finals were scheduled tonight: men's and women's 400  
meters, women's 10,000 meters, and men's pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
	The highlight of the night was the men's 400, where Michael  
Johnson planned to attack Butch Reynolds' 11-year-old world record 
of 43.29 seconds, the longest-standing men's track record. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time champion Ludmila Engquist continued her amazing  
comeback from breast cancer by winning her quarterfinal heat in the 
100-meter hurdles in 12.65 seconds. The Russian-born Swede was 
diagnosed with cancer in March, had her right breast removed in 
April, and has been undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	American Gail Devers clocked the fastest time in the four heats  
(12.53), a personal season's best. Nigeria's Glory Alozie and world 
indoor champion Olga Shishigina won the other two heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Heptathlon champion Eunice Barber of France failed to qualify  
for the hurdles semfinals, finishing sixth in her heat in 13.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had intended to use the Seville championships as a dress  
rehearsal for next year's Sydney Olympics and a bid for an 
unprecedented five gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian sprinter Nova Pedris-Kneebone said Jones' absence, no  
matter how long, would have a severe impact on the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic,'' she said. ``In my eyes she's the Wonder Woman  
of track and field. She's gained so much respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation, said: ``Marion Jones has become a symbol of all that is 
best in athletics; enthusiasm and the simple joy of competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had been the heavy favorite in the 200.  
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's race, she went down about 50 meters from the  
finish, clutching her lower back with her left hand and in extreme 
pain, her face contorted. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors worked over Jones at the stadium for about 2 1/2 hours,  
before she walked out slowly under her own power without speaking 
to the media. Plans to take her to a hospital were scrapped and she 
returned to her hotel room, asking not to be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks she's invincible -- she's not,'' said fellow  
American sprinter Inger Miller, who finished second behind Jones in 
the 100 and now is the favorite in the 200. ``I've been telling 
people that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller ran in the first 200 semifinal and was watching as Jones  
competed in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally, she's first out of the curve, so I was saying,  
`Where is she? What lane is she in?''' Miller said. ``It's 
shocking. It's sad that Marion had to get hurt. I looked forward to 
competing against her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also watching Jones' race was men's 100-meter champion Maurice  
Greene, who was running immediately afterwards in the men's 200 
semifinal heats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very nervous,'' he said. ``My event was next. You get  
scared seeing an athlete go down like that. I don't think Marion 
was trying to do too much for her, just something she'd never tried 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heat, the hard Mondo track and the daily grind all took  
their toll on Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a track built for one race,'' said Emmanuel Hudson,  
Greene's manager. ``It's not a practice track. Marion hadn't had a 
day off since the championships began (last Saturday). That's a lot 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been taking a beating on the track. It's for sure a long  
jump injury. Everyone forgets she's been training for the long jump 
all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' injury overshadowed Wednesday's competition, highlighted  
by six finals. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Colin Jackson became Britain's first world  
or Olympic champion since 1993, winning the 110-meter hurdles with 
his season's best, 13.04 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic's Tomas Dvorak repeated as world champion in  
the decathlon, amassing 8,744 points -- 250 fewer than his world 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles-Michael Friedek of Germany scored a major upset in the  
men's triple jump, beating world record-holder Jonathan Edwards 
with the year's best leap, 57 feet, 8 1/2 inches). 
</P>
<P>
	The other winners were Cuba's Daimi Pernia, who took the women's  
400 hurdles with a world-leading 52.99; Germany's Astrid 
Kumbernuss, the 1996 Olympic champion in the women's shot put, who 
took her third world title with her season's best, (65-1 1/2); and 
Russia's German Skurygin in the men's 50-kilometer walk at 3:44:23.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies in Va. Coaster Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DOSWELL, Va. (AP) -- A man who died after falling from a roller  
coaster had partially wiggled out of the shoulder harness holding 
him in the ride, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Fan, 20, died Monday night after falling from the  
Shockwave, a stand-up roller coaster at Paramount's Kings Dominion, 
about 20 miles north of Richmond. 
</P>
<P>
	A preliminary investigation showed the ride was operating as  
designed when Fan fell and that his safety restraints did not fail, 
the Hanover County Sheriff's office said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Betsy Moss, a spokeswoman for Kings Dominion, said the ride's  
double-restraint system, which includes a shoulder harness and a 
waist-level restraint bar, was found locked in place after the 
train pulled to the platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Tomei, an attorney representing Fan's family, questioned  
how someone could get out of restraints on a fast-moving roller 
coaster. 
</P>
<P>
	``This thing is going 50 mph. You're subject to the centrifugal  
force. ... How are you going to get yourself wriggled out? Is this 
Harry Houdini here?'' he asked. ``They didn't check him in right, 
or one of their safety precautions failed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No lawsuit had been filed as of Thursday evening.  
</P>
<P>
	The Shockwave and two other stand-up roller coasters at  
Paramount amusement parks were temporarily shut down after the 
accident.

<HEADLINE> Cisco To Buy 2 Equipment Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cisco Systems Inc. is buying two small companies  
that make advanced optical equipment for communications networks, 
paying $6.9 billion in stock for Cerent Corp. and an additional 
$500 million for Monterey Networks Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cerent purchase is the biggest ever for Cisco, which is  
trying to maintain its dominance of the networking technology 
industry amid a rapid convergence of data, telephone and video 
communications over the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerent, based in Petaluma, Calif., makes equipment that eases  
bottlenecks between the speedy fiber-optic ``backbones'' that make 
up the Internet and older, slower telephone networks made with 
copper. The company, whose clients include Qwest Communications and 
Frontier Corp., has posted only $10 million in sales in its 2 1/2 
years in business and has never turned a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Monterey, based in Richardson, Texas, makes technology used to  
increase capacity at the core of an optical network. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, which already holds a minority stake in both companies,  
will be issuing 100 million shares of its stock in exchange for all 
remaining equity in Cerent and 7.3 million shares for the rest of 
Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
	In morning trading today, Cisco's shares were 25 cents lower at  
$68.37 1/2 as the most active issue on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Cerent 
and Monterey aren't publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose Calif., expects to record a one-time  
charge of between 7 cents and 11 cents a share this quarter in 
connection with the Monterey deal.

<HEADLINE> Presenting Lobster-cam on the Web </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- A new Web site is launching lobsters into  
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
	It's based inside a trap under the waters of Spruce Head, where  
a camera sends a new photo to an Internet site every two minutes, 
sometimes showing a caged crustacean poking its antennae around or 
climbing across the lens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Web address is http://www.midcoast.com/lobcam/  
</P>
<P>
	The so-called Lobster Cam was set up by the University of  
Maine's Lobster Institute to help advance science while having a 
little fun in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought it would be neat,'' said Robert Bayer,  
executive director of the institute and a professor of biosystems 
science and engineering at the university. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was several years in the making and had a number of false  
starts with technological problems and students working on it,'' 
Bayer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The first graduate student who worked on the project ended up  
with a waterlogged camera. Bayer offered some extra motivation by 
promising an ``A'' grade and a case of beer to whoever could get 
the thing working. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Davis, a senior aquaculture student from Augusta, is  
walking away with the prize. 
</P>
<P>
	An avid diver with experience in electronics, Davis ran a  
coaxial cable and a power cable through a garden hose to an 
underwater video camera housed inside the trap. 
</P>
<P>
	It connects to a computer on the dock at Atwood Lobster in  
Spruce Head. The pictures can be reached through the Web site for 
Midcoast Internet Solutions. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting up a ``Web cam'' underwater is pretty unusual, Davis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The marine environment is very corrosive and it's hard to have  
something with any longevity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Waterman, a South Thomaston Fisherman, has promised to  
pull the trap regularly to wipe slime off the lens and replace the 
bait. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think its pretty neat,'' Waterman said. ``I don't think  
anyone has done it. They've done it on nude beaches, and now 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pictures can only be seen during the day until a burnt-out  
light in the trap is fixed. Bayer said the lobsters aren't camera 
shy; sometimes they climb up on the camera and peek at the lens. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been in place for two months, long enough to catch the  
interest of the International Lobster Congress in Adelaide, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	The group has promised to keep the Lobster Cam up constantly on  
a computer screen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's interested in what goes on in their trap,'' Bayer  
said.

<HEADLINE> Johnson: 'I Can Run Faster' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Michael Johnson has the record he craved  
his entire career. Now he wants to break it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Just minutes after shattering the 11-year-old world record in  
the 400 meters with an electrifying time of 43.18 seconds, Johnson 
set his sights on running even faster. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can do better,'' said Johnson, after winning his fourth  
consecutive 400 title at the World Championships. ``I know I can 
run 42 seconds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That certainly seems possible for the athlete they call  
Superman, perhaps the greatest 400 runner in history. 
</P>
<P>
	The only milestone that had eluded Johnson has been the 400  
record. On Thursday night, he not only broke it -- he destroyed it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson shaved .11 seconds off the record of 43.29 set by fellow  
American Butch Reynolds in 1988, the longest standing men's track 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted this record,'' he said. ``It completes the  
circle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a dazzling performance reminiscent of the 1996 Atlanta  
Olympics, where Johnson ran 19.32 seconds to break his own world 
record in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson said there's more still to come.  
</P>
<P>
	He compared Thursday's record to when he set his first world  
mark in the 200, clocking 19.66 at the Olympic trials in 1996. Two 
months later in Atlanta, he lowered his record by 0.34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I broke the 200 record ... and later came back and shattered  
it, and I think I can do the same thing in the (400),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His coach, Clyde Hart, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Now that he's broken it, I think he'll do it again,'' Hart  
said. ``He did that in the 200. It just might not be this year. It 
might be next year at the Olympics -- that's a pretty big setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and Hart sat down at the beginning of the season and  
decided to attack the world record in Seville. 
</P>
<P>
	When Johnson ran 43.95 seconds in the semifinals, even after  
shutting down several times in the last 60 meters, it was clear 
that he was poised for the record in the final. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday night, coming off the final bend with a big lead,  
Johnson powered down the straight, legs churning in his upright 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
	Pulling way ahead of the field, he glanced out of the corner of  
his eye at the trackside clock. When he crossed the line and saw 
the time, Johnson punched the air with his right fist. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson got down one knee, head bowed, then dropped on his back  
for a minute. He got up, grabbed an American flag and took a 
victory lap, soaking up the applause from the near capacity crowd 
in the 60,000 Estadio Olimpico. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's splits for each 100 were approximately 10.9, 10.1,  
11.3 and 11.9. 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second time in 31 years that the 400 record has  
been broken. Lee Evans' record of 43.86, set at the 1968 Mexico 
Olympics, stood for 20 years before Reynolds broke it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is only the second runner to hold both long sprint  
records at the same time. The other was Tommie Smith, who owned the 
220-yard record from 1966-68 and the 440-yard mark from 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	The record should silence Johnson's critics, who have questioned  
his withdrawals from meets with injuries and even his reluctance to 
sign autographs before competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year I let (criticism) get to me a little more,'' he  
said. ``But I was able to regroup and get back to what I do best, 
and that's keeping my mouth shut and running on the track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Hart: ``If this doesn't answer the critics, I don't know  
what will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record capped a remarkable decade in which he broke two  
records, became the first man to sweep the 200 and 400 at the same 
Olympic Games (1996), and the first to sweep both long sprints at 
the World Championships (1995). He also won four consecutive world 
titles in the 400 and he won world titles in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	``My next goal is Sydney, and I want to defend both titles,''  
Johnson said. ``Now I have the record and I can concentrate on 
Sydney. I'm looking toward the Olympics now because I do have the 
world records now in both events. 
</P>
<P>
	``That pressure is off. I can focus on just winning the race and  
not think time is running out. I'm getting older, this may the last 
opportunity. I don't have to worry about it now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken at the championships and  
earned Johnson a $100,000 bonus, on top of the $60,000 for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also tied Carl Lewis for the most gold medals at the  
championships with eight. He can break that record Sunday as the 
anchor on the United States' 1,600-meter relay team in the final 
event of the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's other three finals produced two championship records.  
</P>
<P>
	Maxim Tarasov extended Russia's domination of the men's pole  
vault -- Sergy Bubka won the event at the first six championships -- 
by winning at 19 feet, 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia's Gete Wami, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in the  
women's 10,000 meters, took 16 seconds off the championship record, 
beating Britain's Paula Radcliffe by more than two seconds at 
30:24.56. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's other final, Australia's Cathy Freeman, who in  
1997 became the first aboriginal Australian to win a world title, 
won the women's 400 again at 49.67, the second-fastest in the world 
this year.

<HEADLINE> Casino Dispute Could Make History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- No member of an American Indian tribe has  
spent time in jail over a gambling dispute since Congress first 
allowed tribes to negotiate gambling compacts with states 11 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	That could change Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	If 11 members of the Santee Sioux Tribal Council are jailed for  
contempt of court -- which some expect -- it will be the first time 
Indians are imprisoned because of an impasse since passage of the 
Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute started in February 1996 when the tribe first opened  
its Ohiya Casino. The tribe filed a lawsuit on opening day accusing 
the state of not negotiating in good faith on a gambling compact. 
The act requires states to negotiate such agreements with tribes to 
set rules and limits on gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Santee leaders face possible jail time because they refuse to  
pay court-ordered fines of $6,000 per day for operating the casino 
on their reservation in northeast Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
	Each member of the Tribal Council is to appear in federal court  
Friday for disobeying U.S. District Judge William Cambridge's 
orders to close the casino or pay the fines. The tribal leaders 
could leave the courtroom in handcuffs, said attorneys on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel they have the right to do that,'' Tribal Chairman  
Butch Denny said. ``We are a sovereign nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Santee leaders say the tribe needs casino gambling to boost the  
economic well-being of its 2,500 members. In a state where the 
unemployment rate is one of the nation's lowest at 2.5 percent, the 
reservation struggles with a rate of 74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino, which employs about 25 people, has 70 slot machines  
that brought in more than $900,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We look at this solely as a way to provide economic  
opportunity for our people,'' said Roger Trudell, the tribe's 
treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nebraska officials say casino-style gambling is not allowed  
anywhere else in the state, and they do not want to make an 
exception to the law. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Tom Monaghan said the tribe has exhausted its  
options. Meanwhile, the Ohiya Casino remains open and none of the 
fines have been paid. 
</P>
<P>
	National experts say no tribal member has been jailed over the  
issue. And such disputes should never reach a point where tribal 
leaders face the threat of jail, said Sheila Morago of the Indian 
Gaming Association in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1992 confrontation over Indian gambling in Arizona came the  
closest to landing tribal members in jail after the FBI sent trucks 
to the state's six reservations to confiscate slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Ft. McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community near Phoenix,  
tribal members used bulldozers to block trucks loaded with gambling 
equipment from leaving the reservation. They relented, but six 
months later they reached a compact with the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santee have applied for a compact under new procedures  
initiated by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt. Those rules allow 
tribes to negotiate with the Interior Department in states where 
government officials are resistant to gaming compacts. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal courts have yet to rule if the federal agency can serve  
as or appoint a mediator to work out gambling disputes.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Signs Jason Bowen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Free-agent defenseman Jason Bowen signed with the  
Colorado Avalanche, along with two players from the club's minor 
league affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
	Wing Christian Matte and center Serge Aubin, who were the  
leading scorers last season for Hershey of the American Hockey 
League agreed to one-year contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Matte, 24, will make $425,000 this season if he makes the  
Avalanche roster or $100,000 in Hershey. 
</P>
<P>
	He played seven games with Colorado last season and totaled one  
goal and one assist. Matte led Hershey with 31 goals and 47 assists 
in 60 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Aubin, 24, will get a $375,000 NHL salary or $65,000 in the  
minors. Signed as a free agent by the Avalanche in the summer of 
1998, Aubin was Hershey's second leading scorer with 30 goals and 
39 assists in 64 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen, 6-foot-4 and 220 pounds, comes from the Edmonton  
organization. He signed for $350,000 or $75,000 in the AHL. He was 
drafted 15th overall by Philadelphia in 1992 and traded to the 
Oilers on Oct. 15, 1997. He began his career as a left wing but 
converted to defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowen spent last season with Hamilton in the AHL, where he  
totaled three goals, three assists and 178 penalty minutes in 58 
games.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid Stock Soars on Merger Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rite Aid Corp.' stock rose more than 17 percent  
Wednesday amid speculation the nation's third-largest pharmacy 
chain is about to sell off some of its poor performing stores or 
possibly merge with a bigger company. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Rite Aid rose $3.43 3/4 to $22.87 1/2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	After the market closed, the Camp Hill, Pa.-based company said  
it's ``in discussions involving possible corporate transactions 
that, if consummated, would be material.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the company postponed its analyst meeting to Sept.  
22 from Sept. 2. A Rite Aid spokeswoman refused to elaborate on the 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid is likely to sell several hundred of its poor  
performing West Coast stores, many of which it acquired with its 
purchase of Thrifty Payless in 1997, said analyst Eric Bussard of 
Midwest Research in Cleveland. There is also speculation that 
Wal-Mart or Sears might be interested in buying Rite Aid, a move 
which would likely face regulatory scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid, which had been on a buying spree until its earnings  
started to lag in 1999, has more than 4,000 store locations in 30 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, the company restated earnings downward for the fiscal  
year ended Feb. 27, decreasing net income to $143.7 million from 
$158 million. The revisions reflected how the company accounted for 
expenses related to recent acquisitions, store openings and the 
closing of smaller stores and distribution centers.

<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Spurs forward Sean Elliott is out of the  
hospital and back home after a kidney transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	The 31-year-old player now embarks on several weeks of  
recuperation before he'll know whether it's feasible to return to 
the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott, a 10-year veteran who helped lead San Antonio to its  
first NBA championship in June, smiled and waved to a few fans as 
he left Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Go Sean! Go!'' onlookers cheered. Elliott signed autographs  
for hospital workers as he was discharged. On Tuesday, he provided 
a catered lunch for nurses involved in his operation. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he is ``happy to be going home.''  
</P>
<P>
	Elliott had the transplant Aug. 16, receiving a kidney donated  
by his 32-year-old brother Noel, a sales associate in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Noel Elliott, discharged Friday, pushed his brother out of the  
hospital in a wheelchair on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sean Elliott needed the transplant because of a condition known  
as focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. The illness prevents the 
kidneys from properly filtering waste from the blood. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the transplant, Elliott was weeks away from having to  
undergo kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
	Another brief surgery was performed Saturday to make sure  
Elliott's new kidney was properly connected and working. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott said he wants to play again for the Spurs, although such  
a feat after a kidney transplant is believed to be unprecedented in 
major sports. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Francis Wright, his transplant surgeon, has not ruled out a  
comeback. Doctors said it could be two to three months before they 
know whether a return is realistic.

<HEADLINE> Gravity Measured by Dropping Atoms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Galileo once dropped stones from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to  
show that objects of different sizes fall at the same rate under 
Earth's gravity. More than 400 years later, researchers say they 
got the same result by dropping atoms. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings, published today in the journal Nature, confirm  
that the rate at which something falls is independent of its mass -- 
whether it be an atom or chunk of glass used in the modern 
experiment or a rock dropped from a tilting building in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no reason to suspect that isolated atoms would fall  
differently than more massive objects,'' said Steven Chu, a 
physicist at Stanford University. ``Nevertheless, you want to 
establish that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Galileo's experiment, the modern technology precisely  
measured the rate at which the atoms accelerated while falling 
under gravity. The result represents a million-fold increase in 
accuracy over previous tests, Chu said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chu and his colleagues super-cooled cesium atoms to within  
two-millionths of a degree above absolute zero, the point at which 
all movement stops. Absolute zero is minus 459 degrees Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
	``The atoms are so slow that their motion is predominantly of a  
gravity free-fall,'' he said. ``They then can be considered objects 
like a baseball tossed up and down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The particles' rate of fall was then measured. The researchers  
ran a similar test in which they dropped a glass prism. The results 
were the same for both the large and small objects. 
</P>
<P>
	The acceleration due to gravity is about 32 feet per second per  
second, a figure that varies slightly depending on where on Earth 
it is measured. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings of Galileo, Chu and all other physicists may sound  
odd to anyone who has dropped a tray of food. A slice of bread hits 
the ground after a glass of wine because of air resistance, not 
changes in gravitational acceleration. 
</P>
<P>
	Chu shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in physics for his laser-cooling  
invention dubbed ``atomic fountains,'' the same technology used in 
the atom-dropping experiment. It is also used to improve the 
precision of atomic clocks.

<HEADLINE> Grizzlies' Pick Francis to Rockets? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- The Grizzlies and Rockets  
reportedly were talking about a nine-player trade that could send 
disgruntled Vancouver draft pick Steve Francis to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver Sun and Houston Chronicle said today trade talks  
were under way. 
</P>
<P>
	According to The Chronicle, the Rockets were dangling Michael  
Dickerson, Othella Harrington, Brent Price and Antoine Carr in a 
possible bench-clearing deal that hinges on the availability of 
Francis. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Vancouver players said to be involved include Michael  
Smith, Lee Mayberry, Tony Massenburg and Rodrick Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grizzlies have been unable to sign Francis, the second  
overall pick in June's draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis has called a Friday news conference, but what he will  
say remains a mystery, even to Stu Jackson, the Grizzlie's general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to wait, but I'm not going to wait with baited  
breath,'' Jackson said Wednesday. ``I don't know what he's going to 
announce. But I'll tell you this, any announcement that he has 
isn't going to lever us one way or the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to do what's in the best interest of our club when  
we feel we have to do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation of Francis' uncertain future with the Grizzlies took  
another turn when the New York-based Edelman Public Relations firm 
said Francis scheduled a press conference for noon Friday in his 
hometown of Takoma Park, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	Edelman representative Peter Land would only say that the  
subject of the press conference was ``basketball-related.'' Francis 
and his agent, Jeff Fried, have been unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson acknowledged that there were personal issues raised by  
Francis during contract talks. And, Jackson admitted that he has 
made numerous attempts to deal Francis to another team. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing a trade, however, Jackson doesn't know what else he can  
do to convince Francis to play for the Grizzlies this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would allow Francis to sit out the year and re-enter  
the draft, Jackson said, ``That's an option of ours. ... I can't 
say that I would do that. I just don't know. We're not at that 
point right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rookie salary cap, Francis is due a three-year  
contract worth about $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Francis, 22, has said he has reservations about playing in  
Vancouver because it's too far from his family and the grandmother 
who has raised him since his mother died of cancer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said the Grizzlies have included Francis in trade talks  
with several NBA teams. He refused to comment on rumours of a 
possible seven-player deal with the Detroit Pistons or the swap 
with the Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets also refused comment on trade speculation.  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun said trade talks with the Pistons had cooled.  
</P>
<P>
	If Francis sits out the year, and doesn't play for any team in  
North America or Europe, he could re-enter next year's NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-3 Francis averaged 17 points and 2.8 steals a game in  
his one year at Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Football Prayer Debated by School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A Texas teen-ager has decided not to lead her  
classmates in prayer before high school football games, fearing her 
role in a constitutional battle could get her expelled. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephanie Vega had been elected by other students to deliver  
short messages ``solemnizing'' each of the Santa Fe Indians' home 
games. But the 16-year-old junior on Wednesday changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled this year that  
student-led prayers were allowable at solemn events like 
graduations. But the court ruled out prayers before football games, 
saying they don't share the ``singularly serious nature'' of 
graduations. 
</P>
<P>
	School districts statewide have been struggling to decide how to  
comply with the ruling. High school football in Texas is incredibly 
popular, with fan fervor in some communities easily rivaling the 
devotion to college and professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
	In Santa Fe, superintendent Richard Ownby had warned that any  
student who led prayers at the Indians' Sept. 3 opener ``would be 
disciplined as if they had cursed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When a student is told by the government that she may say  
anything except a prayer, and if she does pray, she will be 
disciplined as if she had cursed, it is just too much pressure,'' 
Vega said in a statement. ``I do not want to be expelled from 
school for using the word `God' in a reverent manner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ownby said he regrets his comparison.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a poor choice of examples on my part,'' he said. ``But  
it is my belief that you have to deal with a student that prays the 
same as any other student that does something you told them not to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue began with a 1995 lawsuit filed by two families, one  
Mormon and the other Catholic, targeting Santa Fe High School 
policies allowing non-denominational, student-initiated prayer at 
school events. 
</P>
<P>
	While a federal judge sided with the school, the appeals court  
found use of the word ``invocation'' in a policy regarding sporting 
events implied government support of prayer and was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The Santa Fe school district, outside Houston, has petitioned  
the U.S. Supreme Court to review the case. The petition is 
supported by Gov. George W. Bush and states that include Alabama, 
Colorado, Louisiana, Mississippi, Nebraska, South Carolina and 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas supports the prayer  
ban. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think students realize what it's like to sit in a  
stadium and listen to a prayer about the wonders of Jesus Christ 
when you are a member of the Jewish or Muslim faith,'' said Diana 
Phillip of the ACLU's Dallas office. ``It can appear that school 
districts feel one religion is superior to others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With or without authorization, the tradition of pre-game prayer  
is likely to continue in many cities, said Shellie Hoffman, 
director of legal services for the Texas Association of School 
Boards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're going to see some interesting things over the  
next couple of weeks,'' she said. ``I think we're going to figure 
out exactly how important prayer at football games was in 
small-town Texas.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Sink on Weak Demand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures retreated Thursday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade after separate reports indicated ample supplies in 
storage are not being sold ahead of what is expected to be a 
relatively large fall harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, cocoa futures plummeted, while pork prices  
continued their slide from recent highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the losses after the U.S. Census Bureau reported  
the amount of beans crushed into meal and oil in July came in below 
estimates, at 127.396 million bushels. And the U.S. Agriculture 
Department reported sales for the previous and upcoming crop came 
in at a total 460,500 metric tons -- slightly below market 
expectations. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures helped take the steam out a market that in the past  
few months has surged because of drought in some major growing 
areas. Recent rains are believed to have reversed some of the 
potential losses, and both the government and analysts still expect 
farmers to harvest a record-large crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were pressured by the USDA's morning report,  
which showed net weekly export sales of 987,300 metric tons, with 
contract cancellations covering 250,400 metric tons. Investors had 
been expecting sales of about 1.2 million metric tons as the buying 
season picks up ahead of the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by projections for a large Canadian  
wheat harvest, which will compete with the U.S. crop for export 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 cents to $2.83 a bushel;  
December corn fell 4 cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 1/4 cents to $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans fell 8 3/4 cents to 
$4.66 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures tumbled on the Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange  
division of the New York Board of Trade amid perceptions recent 
rainfall in Ivory Coast --one of the world's largest cocoa producers 
-- will prove beneficial to the fall crop. 
</P>
<P>
	That comes at a time when there are ample supplies in storage  
following a bumper crop last year and unexpectedly weak demand from 
chocolate makers. Ivory Coast produces about 40 percent of the 
world's cocoa crop, and analysts are expected the largest fall 
harvest to set records. 
</P>
<P>
	September cocoa fell $41 to $872 a ton.  
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures continued their retreat amid perceptions there are 
enough supplies in storage to keep meatpackers from increasing 
purchases of hogs for slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange earlier this week, and the government last week,  
reported that frozen supplies were larger than traders had 
anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose 0.90 cent to 66.35 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose 0.62 cent to 79.17 cents a pound; 
October lean hogs fell 1.05 cents to 45.15 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies fell 1.60 cents to 58.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Economy Slows in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. economy grew at a substantially  
slower annual rate of 1.8 percent in the second quarter, reflecting 
the drag from a bloated trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department reported today that the increase in the  
gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- 
from April through June was slower than the 2.3 percent the 
government had estimated one month ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-quarter slowdown came after the economy surprised  
many analysts by growing at a brisk annual rate of 4.3 percent in 
the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The inflation-sensitive bond market showed little reaction to  
the report, as yields on 30-year Treasurys held steady at 5.86 
percent this morning, up from late Wednesday's 5.85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve nudged up interest rates for the  
second time this summer in an effort to cool the economy and keep 
inflation at bay. The Fed also signaled that additional rate 
increases this year may not be needed unless the economy shows 
signs of overheating or inflation dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the economy has slowed in recent months, it is still  
expected to grow almost 4 percent this year, a robust pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised GDP report said economic growth was reduced by 1.34  
percentage points by a second-quarter trade deficit that was $14.4 
billion worse than originally estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	During the April-June quarter the trade deficit swelled to $33.8  
billion as a 14.4 percent jump in imports overwhelmed a 4.3 percent 
rise in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big factor of course was imports. On the surface it looks  
as though things slowed a great deal more but actually the surge in 
imports is further testimony of the strength of private-sector 
demand and of a really healthy economy,'' said Cynthia Latta, an 
economist with Standard and Poor's DRI. 
</P>
<P>
	The surging trade imbalance reflects the impact of the global  
financial crisis, which has cut into American export sales while 
increasing competition on U.S. manufacturers from a flood of 
cheaper imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, the government said the profits of U.S. companies  
decreased at an annual rate of $9.2 billion in the second quarter, 
the biggest drop since the end of 1997. In the first quarter of the 
year, profits rose at a $47.1 billion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to facing stiff price competition from imports, U.S.  
companies are being pinched by increasing labor costs resulting 
from the lowest unemployment rates in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report today, the Labor Department said the number  
of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week fell by 
5,000 to 283,000. Jobless-claims levels below 300,000 are generally 
considered an indication of an extremely tight labor market. 
</P>
<P>
	Many economists had expected the ballooning trade deficit to  
cool economic growth and calm fears that the economy could 
overheat. 
</P>
<P>
	The booming U.S economy has been powered by robust consumer  
spending, which accounts for two-thirds of total economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said today that consumer spending in the second  
quarter rose at an annual rate of 4.6 percent. That was brisker 
than estimated one month ago but still slower than the torrid 6.7 
percent pace of spending in the January-March quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers continue to spend even more than they earn, pulling  
the nation's personal savings rate -- savings as a percentage of 
disposable income -- to a record low of negative 1.3 percent in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The government did not revise an inflation gauge tied to  
second-quarter GDP, which rose 2.1 percent. In the first quarter of 
this year, that inflation measure rose 1.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Business investment -- spending on new equipment and plants --  
rose at an annual rate of 11.2 percent in the second quarter, an 
even stronger showing than the government first estimated. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the government said spending for new homes and  
apartments increased at a 7.7 percent rate, better than the 5.1 
percent rate originally estimated, but still slower than the first 
quarter of 1999. Analysts believe the housing market will cool in 
the coming months because of rising mortgage rates. 
</P>
<P>
	All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of  
$34.7 billion in the second quarter of the year, pushing the 
country's total output of goods and services to $7.8 trillion, 
after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> 3 Stabbed on Amtrak Train in Ohio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLMSTED FALLS, Ohio (AP) -- A man with an 8-inch knife stabbed  
two conductors and a passenger on an Amtrak train outside Cleveland 
on Thursday and was pulled from a crowd and arrested after a rider 
pointed him out, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was in critical condition with a head wound and another  
was in serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they had no motive. The suspect, before a court  
appearance, shouted to reporters that he acted in self-defense when 
a train porter pulled a gun on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers on the Lake Shore Limited run from Chicago to New  
York were jolted awake about 3:20 a.m. as the suspect and the 
victims ran through the train, leaving a bloody trail through seven 
cars. The train carried 376 passengers and 12 crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Aaron Hall, 41, of Ontario, Calif., was arrested when a  
passenger in a crowd leaving the stopped train told police, 
``That's him. That's him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, still dressed in bloody clothes in his court appearance,  
was charged with three counts of attempted murder and held on $1 
million bail. 
</P>
<P>
	His court-appointed attorney, Gerald Tiszczek, had no comment.  
</P>
<P>
	When police searched Hall, who was bleeding from a wound to his  
left hand, they found the knife in his pants, said Dennis 
McCafferty, police chief for Olmsted Township, about 15 miles 
southwest of Cleveland. Hall apparently cut himself when he tried 
to hide the knife, McCafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked like he didn't seem to know what was going on,''  
said John Gaus, a tow truck driver who arrived with police. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the police station, Hall kicked out a window of a police  
cruiser, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the attack apparently began in a dining hall. Amtrak  
said the three victims were stabbed as they tried to subdue Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacqueline Williams of Worcester, Mass., who boarded the train  
in Toledo with her 12-year-old daughter, said one of the wounded 
conductors burst into her car. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as he came in, I heard the worker shout into a  
walkie-talkie: `He's got a knife! He stabbed me! He stabbed me!''' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said she thought the attacker was following the  
conductor, but turned to put a blanket over her daughter and didn't 
get a good look. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was terrified,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Michael Dwyer, 52, was in critical condition with a head wound.  
John Henry Crotty was in serious condition with stab wounds to his 
cheek and jaw. His age was not immediately known. Sean Wilcox, 26, 
was treated for wounds to his shoulder and chin and released. 
</P>
<P>
	A 59-year-old passenger was hospitalized after complaining of  
chest pains and anxiety.

<HEADLINE> Johansson Out of Hamlet and Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COMMACK, N.Y. (AP) -- Thomas Johansson withdrew from the Hamlet  
Cup and next week's U.S. Open due to myocarditis and viral 
pericarditis, which affect the lining of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson, 24, who reached the Hamlet quarterfinals, complained  
of stomach problems after each of his first two matches this week. 
He underwent eight hours of examinations under the guidance of Dr. 
David Dines. 
</P>
<P>
	The disease, which Dines said is reversible, causes the affected  
part of the heart to not be able to pump the proper amount of 
blood. The recovery time is undetermined. 
</P>
<P>
	``I arranged for him to see two cardiac specialists,'' Dines  
said Thursday. ``They both agreed that Thomas has myocarditis and 
viral pericarditis, which affects the lining of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``That puts an athlete, especially a tennis player who runs so  
much, at risk. The condition can be treated with medication and 
rest and normal activities can resume.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johansson is returning home to Sweden for further treatment.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was ready to withdraw from this tournament because I felt so  
badly this morning,'' said Johansson, who advanced to the 
quarterfinals of last year's U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since I had the day off, I figured I wouldn't practice and  
that I'd be fine for Friday's match,'' Johansson said. ``Instead, I 
went to see Dr. Dines.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dines, the medical director of the Hamlet Cup, said that  
Johansson was bothered by flu-like symptoms for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great that we finally know the problem and that it can be  
cured,'' he said. ``I'm taking pills now and then I will see the 
doctors when I get to Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was frightened and nervous and scared when I heard the final  
diagnosis. Wednesday, I was ready to hit the wall during the match, 
but I struggled through it.''

<HEADLINE> Lions' Gibson Lost for Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- In another blow to the Detroit Lions'  
injury-riddled offensive line, tackle Aaron Gibson needs surgery on 
his injured left shoulder and will be out for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews, an Alabama-based orthopedist, evaluated  
Gibson Wednesday after the Lions put the 6-foot-4, 380-pound rookie 
through two weeks of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to have surgery,'' head coach Bobby Ross said.  
``He's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed that Gibson injured the shoulder prior to being  
drafted out of Wisconsin in April. 
</P>
<P>
	There is no medical term for the condition, but doctors will go  
in to ``clean some things out'' during surgery next Thursday in 
Birmingham, Ala., Lions spokeswoman Deanna Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions medical personnel originally thought surgery was not  
needed immediately. They had hoped weightlifting and other 
exercises would allow the first-round draft pick to play this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	But there was only a 50-50 chance that he would have been able  
to play, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point, it's time to move on. We have a plan and we  
have to put it in place,'' he said. ``We were never going to be 
able to use him the way that we wanted to use him, which was as a 
starter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ross, who has been shuffling several injured players on offense,  
had said Gibson could make a good right tackle but might also have 
used him at guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Roque will start at right tackle against the Miami Dolphins  
in an exhibition on Saturday, replacing Tony Ramirez, who sat out 
double practice sessions Wednesday with an injured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Engel will be at center instead of Mike Compton, who  
sprained a ligament in his left knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Bryant Westbrook, who broke a bone in his left hand  
three weeks ago, had the pins removed Tuesday and should be ready 
to play next week against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Rookie running back Sedrick Irvin out of Michigan State will  
miss the Miami game because of turf toe. Fullback Brock Olivo is 
expected to take his place. 
</P>
<P>
	``This game is going to give us an awful lot of information with  
regards to where we are as a team heading into the regular 
season,'' Ross said. ``It is a great opportunity for us to evaluate 
people in this situation.''

	CONCORD, Calif. (AP) -- Officials want Whitney Houston to  
reimburse the city for the $100,000 spent preparing for a concert 
she canceled 15 minutes before show time. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston said she bowed out of an Aug. 1 concert at the  
public-owned Concord Pavilion because she was ill. About 5,000 fans 
were in their seats when the announcement was made, and thousands 
more were turned around in the parking lot. 
</P>

	City officials said about 8,500 tickets of a possible 12,500 had  
been sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pavilion's booking agent, San Francisco-based Bill Graham  
Presents, said Houston's representatives had promised to look into 
the matter.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- European stocks closed mixed Thursday, with many  
of the domestic bourses ending the day relatively flat. A drop in 
crude oil prices dragged down energy shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's announcement that it plans to sell more than 30  
million barrels of its crude oil reserves, along with strong 
inventory reports from the U.S. Department of Energy and the 
American Petroleum Institute, led to the drop in prices.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Examine Meteorite Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists who cracked open a meteorite that  
fell to earth last year found tiny pockets of briny water, 
providing the first close look at water not originating on earth, 
according to an article in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	While astronomers have long thought that water flowed through  
asteroids and other bodies formed at the beginning of the solar 
system, the meteorite's liquid cargo offered the first chance to 
actually study it in a lab. 
</P>
<P>
	``The existence of a water-soluble salt in this meteorite is  
astonishing,'' wrote R. N. Clayton of the University of Chicago, 
who was not involved the research on the meteorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The meteorite burned through the sky and was spotted by a group  
of boys in Monahans, Texas, who alerted scientists from NASA's 
Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NASA team, including asteroid specialist Michael  
Zolensky, cracked open part of the meteorite at their lab, they 
found purple crystals of halite -- or rock salt -- that contained 
minuscule pockets of water with bubbles, which indicated that water 
flowed on whatever parent body spawned the meteorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Chondrite meteorites, such as the one found in Monahans, are  
thought to comprise some of the most primitive ingredients from the 
early period of the solar system, and the water in the crystals 
could date as far back as 4.5 billion years.

<HEADLINE> Bullock Reportedly Received Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A report that a former University of Michigan  
basketball player accepted money from a booster could trigger a 
further NCAA investigation, the Detroit Free Press reported 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper, citing sources familiar with a federation  
investigation, said former Michigan guard Louis Bullock, a 
second-round NBA draft pick, ignored a school directive to avoid Ed 
Martin and accepted money that he considered a loan backed by 
future professional basketball earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Convertino, who is investigating  
Martin's activities, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	No action will be taken until the FBI investigation is  
completed, athletic department spokesman Bruce Madej said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock's alleged relationship with Martin could put the  
university in more trouble with the NCAA as it tries to prove 
compliance with the association's rules. Cash, gifts or loans to 
players from boosters are strictly prohibited under NCAA 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, a retired Ford Motor Co. electrician, is under  
investigation as a suspected leader of a gambling ring that focused 
on Detroit-area auto plants. The FBI raided Martin's home and at 
least 10 other area residences in April as part of its 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bullock, who was drafted by the Minnesota Timberwolves and then  
traded to the Orlando Magic, could not be reached for comment. He 
has previously denied impropriety with Martin.

<HEADLINE> Saints, Williams Waiting and Hoping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- He's on the billboards. He's in the TV  
commercials and the newspaper ads. But will Ricky Williams actually 
be on the field for the New Orleans Saints regular season opener? 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka says he's counting in it. Williams says he  
doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will miss Saturday's exhibition game against Green Bay  
with what doctors call a ``high left ankle sprain'' suffered Aug. 
13 against Miami. Although the injury will probably keep him out of 
the last preseason game as well, Ditka said he expects Williams to 
be ready for the season opener Sept. 12 against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, absolutely. There is no question in my mind,'' Ditka  
said. ``There's no question in my mind that he'll be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who took off the protective boot he was wearing and  
donned shoulder pads and helmet for a 15-minute session on the 
stair-stepper Wednesday, had the boot back on and the pads off 
again Thursday when he spent 15 minutes riding a stationary bike. 
</P>
<P>
	As to his comment to a reporter earlier in the week that he had  
a torn ligament and would miss four to six weeks, Williams admitted 
he really had no idea how long he'd be out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think you can tell someone how long they're going to  
be out, really,'' Williams said. ``You can give an estimate, but 
most doctors' estimates are on the safe side, so to speak. I've 
been given a lot of estimates, anywhere from two to six weeks. I 
feel great right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An examination this week by an orthopedist confirmed the Saints'  
diagnosis that surgery was not indicated, Saints trainer Dean 
Kleinschmidt said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Saints call it a sprain, and Williams described it as  
a ``widening'' of bone in his lower left leg, medical authorities 
refer to it as a separation in Williams left syndesmosis, a fibrous 
band that runs between the tibia and fibula and bonds the bones 
together in the lower leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all part of the same thing,'' said Dr. Lewis G. Maharam,  
president of the New York chapter of the American College of Sports 
Medicine. ``All sprains are is a tear in the ligament. A high 
sprain is just tearing at the base of the ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	``High sprains are harder to treat and can sometimes take six  
weeks to heal. But they can heal sooner. Everybody heals at 
different rates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Professional athletes generally recover more quickly because  
they can devote full time to rehabilitation, Maharam said. And, he 
said, doctors tend to be ultraconservative when predicting 
recuperation times. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an injury can cause pain when an athlete tries to run,  
twist or cut, Maharam said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints have not had a winning season since 1992, going 6-10  
each of the last two years. The Saints have keyed this year's 
ticket sales promotions to Williams, just as they tied promotions 
to Ditka when he signed on as head coach in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-page newspaper ads in New Orleans and surrounding cities  
ran throughout the summer, showing a smiling Williams running with 
a football under his arm. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a happy day in this business when you can attach your  
brand to a star,'' said Greg Suit, Saints vice president for 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Season ticket sales, which ended with the first home exhibition  
game, were up by 2,200 from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With New Orleans coming off a victory against Miami in which  
Williams showed his talent for nine plays prior to the injury, the 
Saints expected between 50,000 and 55,000 for their first home 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sold 5,000 tickets on the Monday following that game,''  
Suit said. ``That's all kinds of tickets -- single-game, season 
tickets, the works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When word circulated that Williams would not play, sales  
screeched to a halt at only 41,788. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did notice a pause,'' Suit said. ``But it's picking back  
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Williams back on the field would certainly add impetus.  
But a four-week recovery period would make that an uncertain 
proposition. From the original date of the injury, four weeks of 
rehabilitation means Williams would be out until Sept. 10, leaving 
him with just two days to prepare for the Carolina game. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan is for the Heisman Trophy winner to begin running next  
week and be ready to play in the opener, Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't do anything to hurt him,'' Ditka said. ``I think  
the final analysis is really going to come down to Ricky and how he 
feels.''

<HEADLINE> Kansas City's Top Pick Sitting Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Offensive tackle John Tait, the 14th pick  
in the NFL draft, might sit out the season and re-enter the draft 
next year rather than sign with Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait, who left BYU after his junior year, told The Salt Lake  
Tribune he would rather miss the 1999 season than sign a deal he 
considers undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an option,'' Tait said.  
</P>
<P>
	Tait said he hasn't made a decision. With negotiations at a  
standstill, he said: ``If this thing goes into the season, we 
definitely have to make some big decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs open Sept. 5 at Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City reportedly has offered a five-year contract but Tait  
wants the right to cancel the final season if he meets incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson rejected the proposal for  
voidable years after Tait missed most of training camp. News 
reports have described Tait's performance during two Chiefs 
mini-camps as poor. 
</P>
<P>
	After being selected All-Western Athletic Conference last season  
Tait decided to skip his senior year, partly because at age 24 he 
was becoming old for a rookie by NFL standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait is one of two unsigned first-round picks. The other is  
tackle L.J. Shelton of Eastern Michigan, taken 21st by Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Umps File New Charges Against Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The next fight for baseball umpires might be  
among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As umpires filed a new unfair labor practice charge against  
owners, there were indications the group opposed to union head 
Richie Phillips will try to topple him next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-Phillips faction has been organizing, a person with  
knowledge of the group's activities said Wednesday on the condition 
he not be identified. 
</P>
<P>
	Fourteen umpires, mostly in the AL, issued a statement last  
month criticizing Phillips and they have been seeking more umpires 
to join them. 
</P>
<P>
	They could try to force him out in a union vote, but it's more  
likely they will file a decertification petition with the National 
Labor Relations Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's to be determined,'' said Dave Phillips, a senior umpire  
in the opposition group. ``We haven't discussed that yet. But we 
want our union to be based on democracy, with a non-dictatorial 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opposition group is headed by three AL umps: Dave Phillips,  
not related to the union head, Joe Brinkman and John Hirschbeck. 
They voted last spring against giving Richie Phillips a new 
contract and were among the 27 umpires who refused to go along with 
the union's strategy of mass resignations, causing the plan to 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	The union had hoped to force the start of negotiations for a new  
labor deal. Instead, 22 umpires' resignations were accepted, 
effective Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires now claim the resignations were merely symbolic and want  
the NLRB to seek an injunction to keep owners from terminating the 
22. It's unclear when the agency will act, and it may defer action 
to an arbitrator. NLRB regional director Dan Silverman said last 
week the agency would try to let the parties know its thinking 
before Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	``The leadership we have at present is a leadership that has led  
these guys to absolute slaughter,'' Dave Phillips said. ``Less than 
one month and a half ago, we didn't have 22 guys out of work. We, 
the Major League Umpires Association, don't want to see Richie 
Phillips lead them the way of the Professional Air Traffic 
Controllers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1981, President Reagan fired more than 11,000 PATCO members  
when they defied a back-to-work order. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that whatever they do, they'll be unsuccessful,''  
Richie Phillips said. ``I believe they will do whatever they can do 
to try to cover up their own dishonor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest unfair labor practice charge deals with the 25 new  
umpires baseball has hired from the minor leagues. While many of 
them have been vacation callups this summer, some have been working 
in the minor leagues since they were formally hired last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a clear contract violation,'' Richie Phillips said.  
``It's a clear unilateral change in the contract. It's purposeful 
undermining of the union. It shows there was no need for the hiring 
of these umpires in July for potential duty in September.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In papers filed with the NLRB, umpires claim baseball jumped at  
the disunity among umpires in an attempt to break the union. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the newly hired umpires will be pressured by  
baseball to side against him in the umpires' internal struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe all these umpires will be shortly receiving serious  
threats from major league baseball, and I expect that to happen in 
the next 24 hours,'' Phillips said. ``They will be told that if 
they support the union, they essentially will have the shortest 
careers in history. That message will come in letter form and phone 
calls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While most AL umps back the dissident group, the NL umps are  
near unanimous in their support of Phillips. There have been rumors 
that many NL umps will walk out next week, and baseball has told 
teams to have replacements available. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've discussed several options,'' said NL ump Jerry Crawford,  
the union president. ``Have we decided on any? No. I wouldn't rule 
out anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owners do not think the latest charge has merit but didn't want  
to respond publicly, one management lawyer said on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Phillips also accused Richie Phillips of creating a  
conflict of interest by having Pilot Air Freight Inc., a company 
controlled by the union head, pay some umpires. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that any response by me would only lend a measure of  
dignity to those comments,'' Richie Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some umpires out there that do specific work for  
Richie Phillips, yes there are,'' Crawford said. ``Ask Davey 
Phillips who he gets paid by. Whatever guys do for Pilot Air 
Freight, it's got nothing to do with baseball. There's other guys 
that have other jobs out there. What's the big deal?''

<HEADLINE> Bush Gets Another Tricky Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) -- Another day, another tricky question for  
George W. Bush about his past. But this time the subject was 
harmless -- his favorite book as a child -- and Bush simply drew a 
blank. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember any specific books,'' he hedged, when asked  
by a schoolchild. He said he liked to read about baseball great 
Willie Mays and some book on Texas history. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's two days in South Carolina offered him a respite from the  
questions that have dogged him about whether he ever used drugs. 
But the Republican presidential candidate and Texas governor said 
the grilling he's been under has not been so bad after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the press has been fair to me,'' he said when asked  
about the scrutiny at a Myrtle Beach news conference. ``I don't get 
to decide what you ask, but I get to decide how I answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was the only time Bush broached the subject in his  
appearances, although his stump speeches contained his usual 
criticism of the politics of ``personal destruction'' and his 
familiar warnings to young people about the dangers of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who finishes a three-state swing Friday in Atlanta after a  
stop in Raleigh, N.C., was more relaxed than when the scrutiny was 
at its height and he tartly complained about ``gotcha'' questions 
where the media ``float a rumor and make the candidate prove a 
negative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pressed last week on drugs, Bush said he had not taken any at  
least since 1974. He has not acknowledged using them at all and has 
not been specifically accused of doing so. Polls are suggesting 
Americans are tired of the questions and don't feel drug use in the 
distant past would disqualify someone from the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	An enthusiastic crowd of some 600 greeted him at a Myrtle Beach  
rally on Thursday morning, where he was introduced by country 
musician Steve Gatlin of the Gatlin Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what he did 30 years ago,'' Gatlin said. ``I care  
what he did last week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a state with many veterans and a strong attachment to the  
armed forces, Bush won resounding applause with his promise to 
``rebuild the military power of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later Bush and his wife Laura went to Royall Elementary School  
in Florence to read to children. 
</P>
<P>
	After Mrs. Bush read them ``Gloria and Officer Buckle,'' safety  
tips from a police officer and police dog, the governor asked the 
children how many read more than they watch television. All raised 
their hands. 
</P>
<P>
	The children had been selected from the second and third grades  
for their good reading habits. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush told them ``reading exercises your brain and watching TV  
does not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he also let on that his childhood reading may not have been  
purely for pleasure, saying: ``I read quite a bit growing up 
because my mother made me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The emphasis on education was pertinent in South Carolina,  
perennially lagging on Scholastic Achievement Test scores. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush said the state will have to fix its own educational  
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the people in South Carolina should not look to  
Washington to solve South Carolina's educational problems,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	School principal Julie Smith said some of the state's education  
problems are due to the lack of money and a president who 
emphasized education could help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Funding has been a significant problem in South Carolina,''  
she said. ``We have to kind of beg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has acknowledged ``mistakes'' as a youth and said he drank  
too much before quitting altogether 13 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Cannery Row Development Plan Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTEREY, Calif. (AP) -- A $50 million plan to develop crumbling  
Cannery Row was unanimously rejected by City Council members who 
said it didn't fit in with the site's history. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents had said that dozens of new shops, restaurants and  
condominiums just yards from Monterey Bay would destroy the city's 
cultural heritage and create terrible traffic jams. The council's 
vote Wednesday night was 5-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we have before us is a good project,'' Councilwoman  
Theresa Canepa said, ``but it just doesn't quite fit in with our 
Cannery Row.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Developer Dan Summers, one of three partners behind the Cannery  
Row Marketplace plan, said the vote was ``very unexpected and very 
disappointing'' and said he wasn't sure what his next step will be. 
</P>
<P>
	``We probably won't come back with another development  
proposal,'' he said. ``Frankly, I am in the dark as to what to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Summers had said the plan would bring the area new jobs and  
$700,000 annually in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	The single remaining structure on the site is the former  
Stohan's gift gallery, which once served as a reduction plant where 
inedible fish parts were turned into fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
	Stohan's is one of the last vestiges of the extensive canning  
industry that made Monterey the ``sardine capital of the world'' 
early in the 20th century. The vibrant, bustling industry supported 
by immigrant labor and chronicled by John Steinbeck has since been 
replaced by the Monterey Bay Aquarium and blocks of shops and 
restaurants that draw nearly 2 million visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The project called for Stohan's to be moved and rebuilt into a  
small cannery museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the development would have included four large  
buildings with 115,000 square feet of stores and restaurants, 47 
condominiums and rental units, a plaza overlooking the Monterey Bay 
and 613 parking spaces.

<HEADLINE> Menifee Aims For Travers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Victory Gallop will be paraded  
past the stands after the fourth race Saturday at Saratoga so that 
fans can express their appreciation for a great career. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old colt was retired after being injured while  
winning the Whitney Handicap by a nose Aug. 1. In 1998, the 
stretch-running Victory Gallop missed winning the Travers for 
trainer Elliott Walden by the same narrow margin. 
</P>
<P>
	Four races after the tribute, Walden will try to win the 130th  
Travers with stretch-running Menifee, who, like Victory Gallop in 
1998, finished second in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee was made the 9-5 early favorite Thursday to beat seven  
other 3-year-olds in the Grade I Travers over 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, winner of the 1 1/8-mile Swaps at Hollywood Park and  
second by a half-length to Menifee in the 1 1/8-mile Haskell 
Invitation Handicap on Aug. 8 at Monmouth Park, was 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The next two choices were 7-2 Ecton Park, Menifee's stablemate,  
who won the 1 1/8-mile Jim Dandy on Aug. 8 at Saratoga, and 9-2 Lemon 
Drop Kid, second in the Jim Dandy in his first start since he won 
the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Victory Gallop, Menifee failed to win the Belmont Stakes.  
In fact, he was a disappointing eighth, but he rebounded to win the 
Haskell, his third win in seven starts this year. He also has three 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park followed his 12th-place finish in the 1 1/4-mile  
Kentucky Derby with a close second in the 1 1/8-mile Ohio Derby, then 
won the Jim Dandy on a sloppy track. 
</P>
<P>
	`I don't know if the rain helped him or not,'' Walden said. ``I  
really don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One who thinks it did is Scotty Schulhofer, trainer of Lemon  
Drop Kid, beaten by 5 1/4 lengths in the Jim Dandy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Menifee is the horse to beat, but if it comes up sloppy, then  
he's (Walden) got his other horse. If there's a fast trace track, 
it's going to be a great race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rain is forecast for Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who scored his only win in nine starts this year in  
the Swaps at Hollywood Park, finished second, one-half length 
behind Menifee in the Haskell. The D. Wayne Lukas-trained colt also 
has three seconds and three thirds, and his last eight starts have 
been in Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered in the Travers, a $1 million Grade I stakes, were  
Vision and Verse, second by a head in the Belmont and sixth in the 
Jim Dandy; Unbridled Jet, fourth in the Haskell; Best of Luck, 
fourth in both the Belmont and Haskell; and Badger Gold, claimed by 
Flying Zee Stable for $100,000 two races ago, who finished third in 
the Jim Dandy. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Vision and Verse and Unbridled Jet, trained by Bill  
Mott, nor Walden's two colts will run as an entry because of 
different owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Each starter will carry 126 pounds. Post time is 5:12 p.m. EDT,  
and ESPN will televise.

<HEADLINE> Bengals' Smith Could See Action Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GEORGETOWN, Ky. (AP) -- After his late arrival to training camp,  
Cincinnati Bengals rookie quarterback Akili Smith is quickly 
cramming for a possible pro debut this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's meeting with (quarterbacks coach) Kenny (Anderson) during  
the daytime when other guys are resting, he's going out on the 
field half an hour before we all do,'' coach Bruce Coslet said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Coslet said Smith could play Saturday when the Bengals face the  
Buffalo Bills in their preseason home opener, but only in the right 
circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to put him in there to fail,'' he said. ``I'm not  
going to put him in there when (reserve right tackle) Mike 
Doughty's playing left tackle and Bruce Smith is still in there. 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation has to be right, and then obviously he will have  
a limited playlist. I'm going to try to put him in the game when 
he'll have a chance to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One day after signing a contract and arriving at camp, Smith  
went through his first full day of practice at Georgetown College, 
getting roughly the same number of snaps as starter Jeff Blake 
during the two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today got a little better,'' the former Oregon star said.  
``The more and more reps I get, the better I feel. The one thing 
I'm seeing is that the defensive linemen are extremely fast. You've 
got to go back and plant your foot and get ready to throw an 
accurate pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith missed 3 1/2 weeks of training camp while the Bengals and  
agent Leigh Steinberg negotiated a seven-year contract worth as 
much as $56 million if Smith reaches all his incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he worked out during the holdout.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make sure I came in at least in physical shape,  
because I knew I was going to be behind mentally,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith didn't try anything fancy in practice on Wednesday, and  
seemed to gain confidence as the day went on. Near the end of the 
afternoon session, he completed consecutive right-side slant 
patterns to receivers Willie Jackson and Darnay Scott. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're giving me some plays I feel comfortable with, and as  
long as I keep executing them out here, I'll be fine on Saturday,'' 
he said. ``I want to go out there and play a quarter, a 
quarter-and-a-half, or whatever they have installed for me, and get 
an idea of what kind of defensive speed there is out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After practice, Smith played catch with fourth-round pick Craig  
Yeast, Tim Couch's favorite receiver at Kentucky. Couch narrowly 
edged Smith last spring in the competition to be the Cleveland 
Browns' top pick in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	In other news, reserve tackle Jamain Stephens was missing  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens, signed earlier this month after being waived by  
Pittsburgh, was excused from the morning practice Wednesday to 
attend to some personal business but was expected back at camp at 
lunchtime, according to team spokesman Jack Brennan. He did not 
return, however, and was not on the field for the afternoon 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Bengals confirmed they lost long snapper Greg Truitt  
for the season after Truitt tore the anterior cruciate ligament and 
cartilage in his right knee during Friday's preseason game at 
Detroit. He will undergo surgery within the next two weeks to 
repair those injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Bush, a reserve snapper and tight end, will replace  
Truitt. 
</P>
<P>
	Nose tackle Kimo von Oelhoffen could miss the next two weeks  
because of injured tendons in his left foot. Offensive lineman 
Kevin Sargent will miss the Bengals' home preseason game Saturday 
against Buffalo while he undergoes additional examination of his 
ailing neck, while rookie receiver Quincy Jackson is questionable 
with a right knee sprain. 
</P>
<P>
	Punter Brad Costello expects to be available for duty against  
Buffalo. He missed the Bengals' game at Detroit because of a hip 
injury. Halfback Ki-Jana Carter is also expected to see his first 
preseason action.

<HEADLINE> Seahawks' WR Set To Sit Out Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHENEY, Wash. (AP) -- Veteran wide receiver Joey Galloway is  
willing to miss the entire season in his contract dispute with the 
Seattle Seahawks, a source told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway has missed all of training camp as he seeks to  
renegotiate and extend a contract he signed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are offering Galloway a seven-year, $35 million  
deal, with a $7 million signing bonus. Galloway wants a five-year, 
$24 million contract, with a $9 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are depleted by injuries to their receiving corps.  
Team officials declined to comment Wednesday on the prospect of 
Galloway missing the season. 
</P>
<P>
	New Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, who talked with Galloway  
earlier this week, is fining the receiver $5,000 a day for missing 
training camp at Eastern Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `We want you here, but this is our offer,''' Holmgren  
said. ``It's a fair offer. It makes him the second-highest-paid 
receiver in all of football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay's Antonio Freeman last week signed a seven-year deal  
worth $42 million, including a $10 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've tried to get hold of his agent since I've talked to  
Joey. But he won't return our calls now,'' said Holmgren, also 
general manager and vice president of football operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway's agent, Eric Metz, said Wednesday money isn't the main  
issue for the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joey doesn't want to be the highest-paid receiver in the  
NFL,'' Metz said. ``He just wants a fair deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway caught 65 passes for 1,047 yards and 10 touchdowns last  
year in his fourth season with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a source who declined to be identified said the star  
receiver is willing to sit out the entire season if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Joey didn't want to go public on the issue,'' the source said.  
``He tries to handle himself with dignity and class. The team is 
trying to railroad him along.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galloway, from Ohio State, is working out in Columbus, Ohio, in  
case the two sides can reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Seahawks want Joey to just return punts and still say  
they'll go to the Super Bowl, he'll do it,'' the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks have not made the playoffs since 1988.  
</P>
<P>
	If Galloway does not sign a contract, friends will try to find  
him broadcasting work this season, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks play their third preseason game on Saturday,  
against Arizona. If he doesn't sign a deal soon, Galloway could 
miss the Sept. 12 season opener against Detroit, Holmgren said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's getting to that point right now,'' Holmgren said.  
``Regardless of how good you are, you need at least a week of 
practice before you can get on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks signed receiver Phil Savoy off waivers from the  
Baltimore Ravens on Wednesday. Savoy was originally drafted in the 
seventh round by the Arizona Cardinals in 1998 out of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks got a scare in practice on Wednesday when receiver  
Sean Dawkins injured his finger during the morning practice. He 
returned to the afternoon practice wearing a splint. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting receiver Michael Pritchard is out for two to three  
weeks recovering from knee surgery.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Stuck on Roller Coaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VALLEJO, Calif. (AP) -- A roller coaster headed into a loop came  
to an abrupt stop, stranding 28 people high above the ground in 
100-degree heat for nearly four hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Five of those stuck on Six Flags Marine World's Boomerang ride  
Wednesday afternoon were later taken to a hospital with symptoms of 
heat exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before the ride stopped, witnesses said, a long black cable  
attached to the ride broke loose and lashed back and forth around 
the tracks. Todd Dufren, visiting the park with his family, saw the 
cable ``whipping around all over the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The screams on the roller coaster changed from fun screams to  
`Oh my God we're gonna die' screams of terror, and the whole ride 
just stopped all of a sudden,'' Dufren said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ride was closed while the cause of the accident is  
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-car roller coaster stopped at about 3:45 p.m.  
Wednesday. The last two passengers were not brought down for about 
four hours, said park spokeswoman Kristi Vonne. 
</P>
<P>
	The nearly two-minute ride carries passengers as high as 125  
feet at speeds up to 48 mph backwards and through three 
head-over-heels loops. The roller coaster stopped about 70 feet off 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Vallejo is about 40 miles northeast of San Francisco.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 12, Marlins 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Even among strikeout pitchers, Randy Johnson is the  
fastest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson reached 300 strikeouts in record time, notching nine in  
seven innings Thursday to help the streaking Arizona Diamondbacks 
beat the Florida Marlins, 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson (14-8) achieved the milestone in his 29th start. The  
previous best was Pedro Martinez, who reached 300 in 31 starts in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Damien Miller hit a grand slam in Arizona's eight-run ninth.  
Matt Williams drove in four runs with two singles, a double and a 
sacrifice fly. Tony Womack had two hits and a walk, two stolen 
bases and three runs scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks extended their winning streak to six games and  
completed a three-game sweep of Florida, which has lost six in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson reached 300 strikeouts with his eighth of the game  
against Kevin Millar to end the fifth inning. Johnson, who also 
achieved the milestone in 1993 and 1998, joins Nolan Ryan and Sandy 
Koufax as the only pitchers to reach the 300 mark three times. Ryan 
had a record six 300 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, who allowed six hits and one run, left the game with a  
4-1 lead and 301 strikeouts. He struck out six of the first nine 
batters, but Florida bunched three consecutive hits to score in the 
third. After Luis Castillo singled to extend his hitting streak to 
14 games, Dave Berg singled and Bruce Aven doubled off the wall. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Meadows (10-13) allowed seven hits and four runs in 6 2-3  
innings against the Diamondbacks, who improved to 27-7 since July 
20, best in the major leagues. Arizona is 6-0 this year against 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack led off the game with a walk, stole his 56th base and  
scored on Williams' two-out single. 
</P>
<P>
	In the third inning, Womack doubled, Jay Bell walked and Luis  
Gonzalez singled home a run. Williams followed with a sacrifice fly 
to make the score 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	Womack singled in the fifth and scored on Williams' two-out  
double. 
</P>
<P>
	In the ninth, pinch hitter Robert Ryan had an RBI single,  
Gonzalez was hit by a pitch to force in a run, Williams singled 
home a run and Erubiel Durazo hit a sacrifice fly. After a walk 
reloaded the bases with two out, Miller hit his seventh homer off 
Brent Billingsley. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's Danny Bautista doubled home a run in the eighth.  
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* The start was Johnson's 13th in a row allowing less than  
three earned runs. His ERA during that stretch is 1.54. ... Marlins 
outfielder Cliff Floyd, sidelined much of the season with knee and 
Achilles' tendon injuries, plans to join the team on its trip to 
Houston and St. Louis beginning Friday. He said he might play in 
St. Louis. ... Womack scored in the first inning in all three games 
of the series. ... The Marlins lead the league with 37 triples.

<HEADLINE>  Airline Workers Held in Drug Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Security lapses at Miami International Airport and  
American Airlines enabled dozens of the carrier's employees and 
contract workers to operate an international smuggling ring that 
transported weapons and drugs to U.S. cities, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 48 people were arrested Wednesday on charges of  
conspiracy, drug smuggling and weapons offenses in what is believed 
to be the largest number of drug arrests involving a U.S. airline. 
Many face life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said workers hid drugs in food cars, garbage bags  
and carry-on luggage, gaining easy access to secure areas by 
flashing their ID badges. Some of the drugs was bogus cocaine and 
heroin supplied by agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on their days off, uniformed ramp workers were allowed to  
drive baggage vehicles to arriving international flights and unload 
a single bag containing contraband without being challenged, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need is much closer scrutiny, much closer monitoring  
on the part of the airlines of their employees,'' said U.S. Customs 
Service Commissioner Raymond Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in management was known to have been arrested, and no  
American pilots or flight attendants were indicted. American, the 
nation's No. 2 airline, said it has cooperated with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a company with zero tolerance for illegal drugs,''  
said Larry Wansley, American's managing director of security. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed the problem on a ``small group of  
employees,'' but prosecutors disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a case of one or two rogues,'' U.S. Attorney  
Thomas Scott said. ``I think that alone speaks mouthfuls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests resulted from two sting operations. One began after  
a pilot complained in April 1998 that his coffee tasted weak. 
Investigators discovered 15 pounds of heroin stashed in coffee 
packs aboard an American plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Ramp Rats started in 1997 after agents confirmed  
suspicions of widespread drug smuggling from Miami to other U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs were put aboard American Airlines flights in Colombia  
and Central America, flown to Miami, and then went on to 
Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore and Cleveland, investigators 
said. The defendants also allegedly smuggled disabled guns and hand 
grenades that undercover agents had given them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it was an undercover operation, it's hard to judge,  
but they were making lots of money doing this, more than their 
salaries,'' said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Brent 
Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 people were named in the indictment, including 30  
American baggage handlers and ground crew workers at Miami 
International. Thirteen current or former employees of LSG/Sky 
Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa Airlines, were 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted were an Immigration and Naturalization Service  
agent, an inspector with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a 
Broward County sheriff's deputy who worked part-time as a baggage 
handler. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, eight people -- including seven current or former  
baggage handlers and ramp agents for American -- were named in a 
complaint in New York in a similar case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors estimate that since 1996, the defendants used their  
employee privileges on hundreds of trips from Miami to smuggle 
10,000 pounds of drugs into the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, officials in Colombia identified American as the airline  
used by 10 Colombians charged over the weekend with smuggling more 
than 1,000 pounds of heroin to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines has seen its share of adverse publicity in the  
last several months, including a jetliner crash in Little Rock, 
Ark., that killed 11 people, federal antitrust charges and labor 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	And this week's busts were only the latest involving drugs and  
American. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, agents in Puerto Rico arrested an American Airlines  
ramp supervisor on charges of trying to smuggle 205 pounds of 
cocaine into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal agents in Miami arrested six American mechanics  
suspected of smuggling a half-ton of cocaine and heroin by stashing 
the drugs behind cabin walls and ceiling panels and in the cockpit 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, mechanics conducting an overnight maintenance check on  
an American jet in Dallas found 64 pounds of cocaine stuffed into 
the wall panels of the Boeing 757's cockpit.

<HEADLINE> GM Rejects Offer To Settle Damages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- General Motors has rejected a settlement  
offer from plaintiffs severely burned when their Chevrolet Malibu 
exploded in a crash, and the automaker today continued to seek a 
reduction in the $4.9 billion a jury awarded the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides were in court on GM's request for a new trial or  
reduced damages. GM told Superior Court Judge Ernest Williams that 
critical information on the vehicle's safety record, the cause of 
the crash and other evidence were excluded at the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is it was not a fair fight,'' said GM attorney David  
Heilbron. ``We really didn't get our side of the story told to the 
jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The six plaintiffs, driver Patricia Anderson of Los Angeles, her  
four children and a family friend, offered to settle for about $400 
million if GM recalled similar vehicles and replaced what they said 
were faulty gas tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury last month awarded the plaintiffs $107 million in  
compensatory damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages for 
injuries from the 1993 accident, the largest product-liability 
award in U.S. history. Legal experts have said the punitive damages 
probably would be reduced on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	While the accident was caused by a drunken driver who rear-ended  
Ms. Anderson's 1979 Malibu, the explosion resulted from a poorly 
designed fuel system, said Brian Panish, the plaintiffs' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement offer would require GM to recall all vehicles  
from 1978 to 1983 with the same gas-tank design. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 10-week trial, GM said, it was not allowed to  
introduce evidence on the Malibu's safety record or present 
information about the drunken driver that would have cleared the 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we tried to show during the trial -- but were not permitted  
to -- there is nothing wrong with the fuel systems of these 
vehicles,'' GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said in a statement GM 
issued rejecting the settlement offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another effort on the part of the trial lawyers to  
avoid dealing with this case on the merits, which is what we intend 
to do during the post-trial process,'' Rhadigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Panish made the settlement offer in a letter Aug. 20 to GM  
Chairman Jack Smith. The plaintiffs offered to reduce the punitive 
damages by $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of the vehicles remain on the roads, and the plaintiffs  
want to ``protect people in the future,'' Panish said. ``Our 
clients have been through so much tragedy, they don't want this to 
happen to anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM attorneys said the accident was solely the fault of the  
driver who hit Ms. Anderson's car and that the Malibu was among the 
safest vehicles on the road from that time. 
</P>
<P>
	``This vehicle saved the lives of those six people,'' said GM  
attorney Richard Shapiro. 
</P>
<P>
	In the letter to Smith, Panish said the plaintiffs would fight  
any reduction in punitive damages if GM does not accept the 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will have made it clear to everyone, including the court,  
that even $4.8 billion is not quite enough to get a corporation of 
your wealth to change its conduct,'' Panish wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The gas tank in the 1979 Malibu and similar vehicles was too  
close to the rear bumper and could have been placed in a safer 
position over the axle or protected by a shield at minimal cost, 
the plaintiffs said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM attorneys said the engineers who designed the vehicle  
determined that putting the gas tank behind the axle, as it was on 
the Malibu, was a safer design.

<HEADLINE> Roethlisberger Makes Dramatic Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- John Roethlisberger finished his floor  
exercise and punched the air with his right fist. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after reconstructive knee surgery, the two-time Olympian  
wore a leg brace and a huge smile as he made a dramatic return at 
the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Jason Gatson and Blaine Wilson were atop the standings  
after Wednesday's opening night of the men's competition, the 
happiest gymnast was the guy who placed third in the all-around 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who won four national titles in the early 1990s,  
also won the pommel horse Wednesday with a score of 9.95. He had 
been sidelined for months after blowing out his right knee at the 
national championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far the biggest accomplishment I've had in my  
career,'' he said, choking up. ``I'm a 29-year-old gymnast with a 
reconstructed knee, and I'm real proud to be where I am. I'm 
prouder of this than anything I've done before. Forget the national 
championships and the Olympics, this is it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The women's portion of the championships was scheduled to start  
Thursday night, with Kristen Maloney trying to defend her 
all-around title. Among her top opponents is Vanessa Atler, who won 
two gold medals at the 1998 Goodwill Games and was second in the 
national championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dominique Moceanu and Amy Chow, two members of the U.S. team  
that won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, are missing the 
championships because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships opened Wednesday in a nearly empty Arco Arena,  
with only a few hundred spectators on hand at the start of the 
men's competition. A much larger crowd was expected for the women. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson took a small step toward finally catching his training  
partner, Wilson, by taking a slim lead Wednesday in the preliminary 
phase of the all-around competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's scores count for 20 percent of the competition. The  
remaining 80 percent will be based on scores in Friday night's 
all-around finals. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is seeking an unprecedented fourth straight national  
title. Gatson finished second to Wilson at the national 
championships in 1996 and '98. He was third in 1997, behind Wilson 
and Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roethlisberger was the star Wednesday night with his  
performance, and with his obvious pleasure at being able to compete 
at such a high level again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to say, `Wow!''' he said. ``I wondered if I  
could still hang with these guys. And to be third? I didn't expect 
that. I didn't care if it was first, third or 30th. I was just 
psyched to be able to perform again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The top 14 men in the all-around competition qualify for the  
World Championships team trials, to be held Sept. 15-18 in Kansas 
City, Mo. That event will help choose the American squad for the 
World Gymnastics Championships from Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson, 18, who trains with Wilson at the U.S. Olympic Training  
Center in Colorado Springs, Colo., won the parallel bars event with 
a mark of 9.95 and placed first in the floor exercise with a mark 
of 9.8 en route to 57.325 points in the preliminary phase of the 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 25, won on the rings with a mark of 9.6 as he got a  
total score of 57.225. He is competing despite recent problems with 
both shoulders. After the pommel horse routine, Wilson rubbed his 
right shoulder for several seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a battle all summer, rehabbing a shoulder. It's  
tough when you get old,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man sitting next to him at the post-competition news  
conference shook his head and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	``You ain't old,'' Roethlisberger said.

<HEADLINE>  Airline Workers Held in Drug Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Security lapses at Miami International Airport and  
American Airlines enabled dozens of the carrier's employees and 
contract workers to operate an international smuggling ring that 
transported weapons and drugs to U.S. cities, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 48 people were arrested Wednesday on charges of  
conspiracy, drug smuggling and weapons offenses in what is believed 
to be the largest number of drug arrests involving a U.S. airline. 
Many face life in prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said workers hid drugs in food cars, garbage bags  
and carry-on luggage, gaining easy access to secure areas by 
flashing their ID badges. Some of the drugs was bogus cocaine and 
heroin supplied by agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Even on their days off, uniformed ramp workers were allowed to  
drive baggage vehicles to arriving international flights and unload 
a single bag containing contraband without being challenged, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need is much closer scrutiny, much closer monitoring  
on the part of the airlines of their employees,'' said U.S. Customs 
Service Commissioner Raymond Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
	No one in management was known to have been arrested, and no  
American pilots or flight attendants were indicted. American, the 
nation's No. 2 airline, said it has cooperated with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a company with zero tolerance for illegal drugs,''  
said Larry Wansley, American's managing director of security. 
</P>
<P>
	The company blamed the problem on a ``small group of  
employees,'' but prosecutors disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a case of one or two rogues,'' U.S. Attorney  
Thomas Scott said. ``I think that alone speaks mouthfuls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The arrests resulted from two sting operations. One began after  
a pilot complained in April 1998 that his coffee tasted weak. 
Investigators discovered 15 pounds of heroin stashed in coffee 
packs aboard an American plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Operation Ramp Rats started in 1997 after agents confirmed  
suspicions of widespread drug smuggling from Miami to other U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	The drugs were put aboard American Airlines flights in Colombia  
and Central America, flown to Miami, and then went on to 
Philadelphia, Washington, Baltimore and Cleveland, investigators 
said. The defendants also allegedly smuggled disabled guns and hand 
grenades that undercover agents had given them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because it was an undercover operation, it's hard to judge,  
but they were making lots of money doing this, more than their 
salaries,'' said Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Brent 
Eaton. 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 people were named in the indictment, including 30  
American baggage handlers and ground crew workers at Miami 
International. Thirteen current or former employees of LSG/Sky 
Chefs, a food service contractor owned by Lufthansa Airlines, were 
indicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Also indicted were an Immigration and Naturalization Service  
agent, an inspector with the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a 
Broward County sheriff's deputy who worked part-time as a baggage 
handler. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, eight people -- including seven current or former  
baggage handlers and ramp agents for American -- were named in a 
complaint in New York in a similar case. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors estimate that since 1996, the defendants used their  
employee privileges on hundreds of trips from Miami to smuggle 
10,000 pounds of drugs into the New York area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, officials in Colombia identified American as the airline  
used by 10 Colombians charged over the weekend with smuggling more 
than 1,000 pounds of heroin to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines has seen its share of adverse publicity in the  
last several months, including a jetliner crash in Little Rock, 
Ark., that killed 11 people, federal antitrust charges and labor 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
	And this week's busts were only the latest involving drugs and  
American. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, agents in Puerto Rico arrested an American Airlines  
ramp supervisor on charges of trying to smuggle 205 pounds of 
cocaine into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, federal agents in Miami arrested six American mechanics  
suspected of smuggling a half-ton of cocaine and heroin by stashing 
the drugs behind cabin walls and ceiling panels and in the cockpit 
electronics. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, mechanics conducting an overnight maintenance check on  
an American jet in Dallas found 64 pounds of cocaine stuffed into 
the wall panels of the Boeing 757's cockpit.

<HEADLINE> Donnelley Settles Fraud Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons Co., the nation's largest  
commercial printer, says it will pay $22 million to settle charges 
that the company underpaid postage on thousands of catalogs, 
magazines and other materials over a 10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, announced Wednesday by federal prosecutors in  
Philadelphia, was the largest postage fraud settlement in at least 
a decade, according to the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago-based company violated an honor system established  
by the Postal Service that gives volume mailers a discount when 
they presort the materials before handing them over to the service 
for delivery, said Assistant U.S. Attorney John Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We rely on large mailers to accurately tell us what they are  
mailing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal inspectors began investigating Donnelley's Lancaster,  
Pa., printing plant after workers were seen adding non-sorted 
magazines and catalogs to mail that had already been processed for 
distribution, Joseph said. 
</P>
<P>
	Donnelley spokesman William Lowe said the company decided to  
settle the case in order to avoid a long trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has nearly 200 plants around the world, which print  
magazines such as TV Guide and Sports Illustrated. It is also the 
world's largest printer of phone books.

<HEADLINE> Gore Favors Teaching Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore says he wouldn't oppose  
public schools teaching creationism as part of a religion course, 
but he personally favors the teaching of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore bases his opinion on court rulings that allow the teaching  
of creationism as part of a religious course but not as a science, 
a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may teach creationism in the context of a religious  
course; that is clearly up to the local districts to decide,'' Gore 
spokesman Alejandro Cabrera said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	This month, the Kansas state school board adopted new testing  
standards that play down the scientific importance of evolution. 
Local school districts will decide what subjects are taught but 
critics and advocates of the new standards say the decision could 
bring more religion into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has forbidden the teaching of  
creationism, the belief that a higher power created the universe, 
because of the religious foundation of that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president favors the teaching of evolution in public  
schools,'' Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously that decision should and will be made at the local  
level and localities should be free to decide their own 
curriculum,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Rides Horses, Plays Golf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton emerged on Thursday  
from two days of relatively secluded relaxation at his borrowed 
vacation home to ride horseback with his daughter and play 
back-to-back rounds of golf with college friends. 
</P>
<P>
	A squadron of wild geese flew over a nearby field as the  
president and daughter Chelsea rode on sandy narrow paths through 
groves of oak trees at the 40-acre Blue Heron Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left after an hour for the Farm Neck golf club where he  
spent the rest of the day playing golf with two sets of college 
friends. He made no remark when his first shot veered into the 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
	During a later round with Clare O'Callahan, Maurie Flanagan and  
her son, Sean, Clinton paused after his first shot and asked: ``Is 
it OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit one more. Go ahead,'' replied Sean. So Clinton did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Much better,'' O'Callahan offered.  
</P>
<P>
	On tap was an evening clambake on the beach at the summer home  
of Mattel executive Bill Rollnick and his wife, Nancy Ellison. 
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were at the Rollnick 
clambake two years ago when word came from Paris that Princess 
Diana had been killed in an automobile crash. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clintons were relaxing out of public view Wednesday,  
they attended a beach party with 30 or so people who live near 
their compound, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent a couple of hours there, and then they just went  
back and had a quiet evening at home,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard off the  
Massachusetts coast on Saturday for a round of fund raisers in the 
posh Hamptons district of eastern Long Island. Beneficiaries will 
include the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's 
expected campaign to win an open U.S. Senate seat in New York 
state.

<HEADLINE> Treatment for Heroin Passes Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Marilu Anderson never thought she would  
end up this way, in a room filled with soft chairs and new age 
music, with acupuncture needles in her ears to curb the cravings 
for heroin needles in her arm. 
</P>
<P>
	She was working as a nurse when she got hooked on smack 14 years  
ago, starting a tailspin into joblessness, despair and the brink of 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``For years, heroin has been thought of as something only the  
scumbags did,'' said the 47-year-old woman who now works at a pet 
shop. ``But in reality, it was working-class people like myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1992 and 1997, the number of Americans entering  
treatment centers for heroin surged 29 percent -- from 180,000 to 
232,000 -- surpassing cocaine and signaling just how pervasive the 
deadly opiate has become, according to a federal report released 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	About 16 percent of the 1.5 million treatment admissions in 1997  
were for heroin and other opiates, compared with 15 percent for 
cocaine. It is the first time since 1992 that heroin has surpassed 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	For Anderson, recovery has been a seven-month ordeal that  
requires treatments every week. She still faces continual cravings 
and peddlers who roam the streets outside her downtown apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could usually pull off the freeway in any town and find it  
in 30 minutes,'' she said, her ponytail bobbing behind her as she 
left an afternoon treatment session. ``A lot of teens and college 
kids think if they snort it, they can't get addicted. They're 
wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, that's how Anderson got started -- by snorting, not  
shooting up -- and it was one of the most disturbing trends 
identified in Wednesday's report by the Substance Abuse and Mental 
Health Services Administration, a branch of the U.S. Department of 
Health and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
	``People who are using heroin are discovering it is, in fact, a  
dangerous drug,'' said Dr. H. Westley Clark, director of the Center 
for Substance Abuse Treatment at HHS. Fashion magazines have been 
accused of glamorizing heroin through use of strung-out-looking 
models. 
</P>
<P>
	``Heroin chic -- there's a down side to it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The perception has been that heroin is only dangerous when it's  
injected, Clark said, and injecting drugs does add the risk of 
contracting the HIV virus or hepatitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Fielding, counseling manager at a treatment center in  
Rockville, Md., said heroin can be even more devastating because 
people generally ``binge'' on cocaine, using it only periodically 
but in great quantities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once you're addicted to heroin, you have to have it every  
day,'' Fielding explained. ``Every day, they have to figure out how 
they're going to get the money for that heroin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report offered some good news about other drugs: In that  
same five-year period, the number of people seeking treatment for 
cocaine use declined by 17 percent, from 267,000 to 222,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Alcohol abuse remains the most common reason people seek help,  
although it is not as dominant as it once was, dropping from 59 
percent of all admissions to about half. And while other surveys 
indicate marijuana is by far the most popular illegal drug, it 
accounted for just 13 percent of admissions to treatment centers in 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which includes data from about two-thirds of the  
nation's drug and alcohol admissions, also details demographic and 
geographic trends. 
</P>
<P>
	It finds heroin treatments were concentrated in the Far West and  
Northeast. Methamphetamine, meanwhile, has spread from the West 
into the nation's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, only California and Nevada had more than 50 admissions  
per 100,000 people age 12 and over. By 1997, there were that many 
across the Northwest and into Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Kansas, 
Nebraska and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call it the methamphetamine plague,'' said Alan Leshner,  
director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse. ``It's spreading 
like an infectious disease across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon is already on pace for its highest number of drug-related  
deaths in any year -- a dubious milestone blamed largely on an 
influx of purer heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	By the beginning of this month, 119 people had overdosed on the  
drug and died so far this year, compared to just 68 over the same 
period a year ago. The trend stunned Portland last summer, when two 
young, heroin-addicted lovers hanged themselves from a downtown 
bridge, the bodies swinging in full view of rush-hour commuters. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson counts herself lucky that she entered rehab and didn't  
contract HIV from sharing needles. But she's the first to admit 
drug addiction took her to the edge in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sat there one night holding a shotgun to my face, crying.  
And the next day I called the drug hot line,'' Anderson said. 
``Your life reaches a point where it's so unmanageable and hopeless 
that it's just a dead-end street.''

<HEADLINE>  Brazilians Protest Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Brazilians, fed up  
with belt-tightening reforms that keep unemployment high and wages 
low, converged peacefully on the capital Thursday with a loud 
message for the government: Change course or face growing social 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the close watch of almost 6,000 police and army troops,  
the so-called March of the 100,000 clogged streets around the 
city's modernistic, cone-shaped cathedral. Police estimated there 
were about 60,000 protesters, while organizers put the number at 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Red flags and banners calling for the resignation of President  
Fernando Henrique Cardoso colored the dry savannah landscape. 
Deafening music from a dozen decorated sound trucks created a 
carnival-like atmosphere on the broad lawns of the Esplanade of 
Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was organized by an array of 80 institutions,  
including leftist parties, labor unions and student groups. It was 
the biggest rally ever against the free-market reforms of Cardoso, 
who took office in 1995 and was re-elected last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters planned to deliver a petition with more than 1  
million signatures asking for a congressional investigation into 
suspected irregularities in the 1998 privatization of Telebras, the 
federal telecommunications company. Some leaders also want to 
examine Cardoso's role in the episode -- the first step toward 
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no future with Cardoso. The poor are going through  
sharp pain because of his policies,'' said Flavio Ramos, who 
traveled 600 miles by bus from the northeastern state of Ceara to 
press for ``drastic change.'' A public hospital nurse, Ramos earns 
the equivalent of $155 a month to support three children and his 
ex-wife. Like other government workers, he hasn't had a raise in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he does have a job. Sandro Alexis de Oliveira, who worked  
for 10 years in a health ministry brigade fighting tropical 
diseases, was fired in July along with 6,250 other workers. The 
layoff was part of an effort to cut public spending and reduce the 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This rally has to raise some issues,'' he said. ``Cardoso has  
to change and govern for the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood is very different from five years ago, when Cardoso  
swept to the presidency on the success of the anti-inflation plan 
he crafted as finance minister. Known as the Real Plan, it 
eliminated chronic four-digit inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso pledged to mend and modernize the economy. He privatized  
government companies, broke up the federal oil monopoly and opened 
Brazil's borders to imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strong currency, the real, hurt exporters and aggravated  
weaknesses in the economy. The budget deficit ballooned, and the 
government was slow to take steps to fix it. When the Asian crisis 
rocked global markets in 1997, Brazil plunged into recession and 
eventually was forced to devalue the real. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity is at a record low. In a survey this month by the  
respected Vox Populi pollsters, 59 percent said he was doing a bad 
or terrible job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazilians believed that he was the one who would protect the  
real, that would avoid a devaluation,'' said political analyst 
Villas-Boas Correa. ``He is now paying the bill.''

proposed genocide trial for former Khmer Rouge leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. team met members of the government task force in charge  
of drawing up plans for a tribunal, receiving from them a copy of 
Cambodia's draft law on genocide. The U.N. team brought a set of 
proposals meant to ensure maximum foreign participation. 
</P>
<P>
	U.N. Assistant Secretary General for Legal Affairs Ralph Zacklin  
said the two sides had a ``frank exchange of views'' but one 
Cambodia official indicated the two sides were still far apart. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will proceed with the system that we already have,'' said  
Om Yentieng, a member of the government task force. ``There will be 
no new court, special court or mixed court other than the existing 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations and human rights groups fear that a trial  
held in a purely Cambodian court will not ensure justice. They 
maintain that Cambodian courts lack the competence and political 
independence to conduct a fair trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The extremist policies of the Khmer Rouge are held responsible  
for the death of an estimated 1.7 million people when the communist 
group held power from 1975-79. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, after two decades in the jungle waging civil  
war, several top Khmer Rouge leaders have surrendered or been 
arrested, making them vulnerable to prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a copy of Cambodia's draft law, Cambodia is moving  
away from the idea of a mixed tribunal, which would incorporate 
elements of both an international tribunal and a Cambodian court. 
</P>
<P>
	While allowing for foreign judges and prosecutors, the draft  
would not allow them to hold a majority on any judicial panel, a 
point the United Nations had sought. It includes no provision for 
foreign lawyers for defendants and no ban on pardons for those 
found guilty, a point many human rights lawyers consider essential. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. team agreed to review the draft, and will resume formal  
talks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Cambodian opposition leader Sam Rainsy led up  
to 3,000 people in a demonstration supporting the U.N. position. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Rainsy said Cambodia needed an international tribunal to  
prosecute Khmer Rouge leaders ``and put an end to impunity in this 
country,'' a reference to the ability of officials and influential 
people to escape justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Hun Sen favors bringing the Khmer Rouge leaders  
to trial but says pushing too hard could renew the civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say neither Hun Sen nor his junior partner in the  
coalition government, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, want a trial that 
would highlight their past links to the Khmer Rouge.

<HEADLINE>  Brazilians Protest Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Brazilians, fed up  
with belt-tightening reforms that keep unemployment high and wages 
low, converged peacefully on the capital Thursday with a loud 
message for the government: Change course or face growing social 
unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the close watch of almost 6,000 police and army troops,  
the so-called March of the 100,000 clogged streets around the 
city's modernistic, cone-shaped cathedral. Police estimated there 
were about 60,000 protesters, while organizers put the number at 
90,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Red flags and banners calling for the resignation of President  
Fernando Henrique Cardoso colored the dry savannah landscape. 
Deafening music from a dozen decorated sound trucks created a 
carnival-like atmosphere on the broad lawns of the Esplanade of 
Ministries. 
</P>
<P>
	The protest was organized by an array of 80 institutions,  
including leftist parties, labor unions and student groups. It was 
the biggest rally ever against the free-market reforms of Cardoso, 
who took office in 1995 and was re-elected last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters planned to deliver a petition with more than 1  
million signatures asking for a congressional investigation into 
suspected irregularities in the 1998 privatization of Telebras, the 
federal telecommunications company. Some leaders also want to 
examine Cardoso's role in the episode -- the first step toward 
impeachment proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no future with Cardoso. The poor are going through  
sharp pain because of his policies,'' said Flavio Ramos, who 
traveled 600 miles by bus from the northeastern state of Ceara to 
press for ``drastic change.'' A public hospital nurse, Ramos earns 
the equivalent of $155 a month to support three children and his 
ex-wife. Like other government workers, he hasn't had a raise in 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	But he does have a job. Sandro Alexis de Oliveira, who worked  
for 10 years in a health ministry brigade fighting tropical 
diseases, was fired in July along with 6,250 other workers. The 
layoff was part of an effort to cut public spending and reduce the 
budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This rally has to raise some issues,'' he said. ``Cardoso has  
to change and govern for the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The mood is very different from five years ago, when Cardoso  
swept to the presidency on the success of the anti-inflation plan 
he crafted as finance minister. Known as the Real Plan, it 
eliminated chronic four-digit inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso pledged to mend and modernize the economy. He privatized  
government companies, broke up the federal oil monopoly and opened 
Brazil's borders to imports. 
</P>
<P>
	But the strong currency, the real, hurt exporters and aggravated  
weaknesses in the economy. The budget deficit ballooned, and the 
government was slow to take steps to fix it. When the Asian crisis 
rocked global markets in 1997, Brazil plunged into recession and 
eventually was forced to devalue the real. 
</P>
<P>
	His popularity is at a record low. In a survey this month by the  
respected Vox Populi pollsters, 59 percent said he was doing a bad 
or terrible job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brazilians believed that he was the one who would protect the  
real, that would avoid a devaluation,'' said political analyst 
Villas-Boas Correa. ``He is now paying the bill.''

<HEADLINE> Requiem for Mozart-Smart Theory? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lisa Aikin doesn't buy the theory that listening to the music of  
Mozart makes people smarter, but her two young children often 
request her ``Mozart Effect'' CD when the family is in the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The kids call it ``mommy's happy music.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Aikin's skepticism may be well placed: Two studies published  
today in the journal Nature challenge earlier research and the 
popular belief about the effect of music on intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The results call into question 1993 research that showed college  
students temporarily gained up to nine IQ points after listening to 
a Mozart piano sonata. The widely reported findings spawned an 
industry of supposedly mind-enhancing recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	South Dakota, Georgia and Tennessee, as well as the National  
Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences, give away classical CDs to 
new mothers. Several ``Mozart Effect'' CDs have been on the 
Billboard classical charts since January 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	However, researchers found that any IQ improvements from  
listening to Mozart were not statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Listening to classical music is probably good for kids -- good  
for reasons other than it's going to make them smarter,'' said 
Harvard Medical School researcher Christopher Chabris, who analyzed 
16 previous studies and published his findings in today's issue of 
the journal Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying study, other researchers reported that they  
tried to reproduce the 1993 results and failed. 
</P>
<P>
	The authors of the previous research said it's too early to play  
a requiem for the Mozart effect. The latest studies tried to find 
evidence of improvement in overall intelligence, while the original 
results were more limited, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In every talk that I give, I make it very clear that there is  
no scientific evidence that listening to music will make you 
smarter,'' said Fran Rauscher, lead researcher of the 1993 study 
and a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh. 
</P>
<P>
	She said her test subjects showed the greatest improvement in  
spatial thinking skills, which are useful in doing math or playing 
chess. The participants were asked to visualize the shape of paper 
after being told how it would be folded or cut. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chabris' analysis, involving 714 people, found no  
significant improvement in either broader abstract reasoning or 
spatial thinking. 
</P>
<P>
	The participants were tested before and after listening to  
Mozart. On average, Mozart listeners' scores were enhanced by 1.4 
IQ points. In the paper-folding test, scores increased by 2.1 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Both numbers fall below the 4.5-point difference that would be  
expected of anyone taking the test twice on the same day, Chabris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom-line message is that there is either no Mozart  
effect or a very small Mozart effect,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One study he analyzed showed no difference between students who  
listened to Mozart and those who heard a passage from a Stephen 
King horror story. That suggests that people are better at the 
tests when they're mentally engaged, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The original researchers theorized that the music, specifically  
Mozart's Sonata for Two Pianos in D Major (K. 448), primes higher 
brain functions because it is complex, highly structured and 
nonrepetitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very premature to think that they have made a big dent in  
our results,'' said a co-author of the 1993 study, Gordon Shaw, a 
physicist at the University of California at Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other Nature report, researchers said they failed to  
reproduce the original results. In the Mozart effect's strongest 
showing, listeners scored only three points higher than those who 
heard nothing, said Kenneth Steele, an Appalachian State University 
professor in Boone, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Rauscher said the researchers failed to follow the procedures of  
the original work. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Aikin, who lives in Danville, Calif., just likes the music.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was intrigued by it because it was a nice compilation,'' she  
said. ``Who knows if it raises my children's IQ? Even if it 
doesn't, I'm still happy with it.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Rides Horses, Plays Golf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDGARTOWN, Mass. (AP) -- President Clinton emerged on Thursday  
from two days of relatively secluded relaxation at his borrowed 
vacation home to ride horseback with his daughter and play 
back-to-back rounds of golf with college friends. 
</P>
<P>
	A squadron of wild geese flew over a nearby field as the  
president and daughter Chelsea rode on sandy narrow paths through 
groves of oak trees at the 40-acre Blue Heron Farm. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton left after an hour for the Farm Neck golf club where he  
spent the rest of the day playing golf with two sets of college 
friends. He made no remark when his first shot veered into the 
woods. 
</P>
<P>
	During a later round with Clare O'Callahan, Maurie Flanagan and  
her son, Sean, Clinton paused after his first shot and asked: ``Is 
it OK?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Hit one more. Go ahead,'' replied Sean. So Clinton did.  
</P>
<P>
	``Much better,'' O'Callahan offered.  
</P>
<P>
	On tap was an evening clambake on the beach at the summer home  
of Mattel executive Bill Rollnick and his wife, Nancy Ellison. 
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were at the Rollnick 
clambake two years ago when word came from Paris that Princess 
Diana had been killed in an automobile crash. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Clintons were relaxing out of public view Wednesday,  
they attended a beach party with 30 or so people who live near 
their compound, said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``They spent a couple of hours there, and then they just went  
back and had a quiet evening at home,'' Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons are scheduled to leave Martha's Vineyard off the  
Massachusetts coast on Saturday for a round of fund raisers in the 
posh Hamptons district of eastern Long Island. Beneficiaries will 
include the Democratic National Committee and Mrs. Clinton's 
expected campaign to win an open U.S. Senate seat in New York 
state.

<HEADLINE>  Shutdown at O'Hare After Man Bolts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A passenger ran past a security checkpoint and  
disappeared into the crowd at O'Hare International Airport on 
Thursday, prompting United Airlines to shut down a terminal for 
almost three hours as authorities searched for him. 
</P>
<P>
	United canceled 123 flights and expected delays of several hours  
on others, spokesman Joe Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was not found and Chicago Police said officers turned up  
nothing suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 passengers were cleared from the terminal during the  
search, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was leaving a concourse and heading toward the baggage  
claim area when he turned back and ran up a one-way staircase 
leading to the concourse, said United spokesman Matthew Triaca. 
Guards are stationed at the staircase, but the man ran past them. 
</P>
<P>
	No United flights left the terminal during the search and only a  
few landed at other United gates. United had resumed flights by 
early evening.

<HEADLINE> Callaway, Taylor Made in Dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- A temporary restraining order was denied  
Callaway Golf Co. in its bid to keep a top executive from becoming 
president of rival Taylor Made Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego County Superior Court Judge Michael Anello did grant  
Callaway's request to expedite a hearing on a petition seeking a 
temporary injunction against Mark King. The hearing was set for 
Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway believes trade secrets involving the launch of its new  
golf ball could be in jeopardy if King is allowed to work for its 
crosstown rival. Carlsbad, about 40 miles north of San Diego, is 
the home base for Callaway, Taylor Made and Cobra, the world's 
three largest golf companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an entirely unprecedented situation for us, where we  
have a guy come in to be the No. 2 man in a $150 million golf ball 
operation about which nothing has leaked out, every single aspect 
has been kept under wraps ... who moves to a direct competitor,'' 
Callaway spokesman Larry Dorman said. 
</P>
<P>
	King had spent the past 1 1/2 years as vice president of sales for  
Callaway Golf Ball Co. Although King had a ``no-compete'' clause in 
his Callaway contract, he resigned last week to become president of 
Taylor Made. 
</P>
<P>
	Callaway is trying to stop Taylor Made from hiring him, either  
through the final 14 months of his contract or until the matter can 
be settled through arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Callaway get the temporary injunction, it could create a  
void in Taylor Made's new management structure. Owned by 
Adidas-Salomon, the company brought its golf club, shoes and 
apparel divisions under one umbrella last week, calling it Taylor 
Made-Adidas Golf. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor Made lawyer Timothy Epp says the company has done nothing  
wrong in hiring King and believes Taylor Made will be successful in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	King worked under Chuck Yash at Callaway Golf Ball. Yash last  
week replaced 80-year-old founder Ely Callaway as president of the 
company, although he will continue to be president of the golf ball 
subsidiary through the launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Yash also will become chief executive officer of Callaway no  
later than the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yash and King previously worked at Taylor Made, Yash as  
president for four years and King as a sales representative and 
later a vice president.

<HEADLINE> Another Clemente in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The number isn't quite the same -- it's 12, or  
21 turned backward -- but the name is: Clemente. In Pittsburgh, 
there is no more famous name in sports -- or a name more difficult 
to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for a visiting player. Even for Roberto Clemente's own  
nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 27 years, a player named Clemente played  
major league baseball in Pittsburgh, catching fly balls in the very 
outfield where Roberto played, batting in the very batter's box 
where Roberto Clemente stood before getting his 3,000th hit nearly 
27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To rookie center fielder Edgard Clemente of the Colorado  
Rockies, playing this week in the city where his uncle is revered, 
in the stadium where his uncle played his final three seasons, was 
an ethereal, unforgettable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw his statue outside the stadium, I walked across the  
bridge that is named after him,'' Clemente said. ``The park outside 
the stadium is named for him, too. He is still a hero in 
Pittsburgh. How many players have statues? To have a statue, you 
must be a big player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente remains very big in Pittsburgh, where there  
were more ``Clemente 21'' jerseys in the stands for Thursday's 
Rockies-Pirates game than for any current Pirates player. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue. The bridge. The legacy. It's almost enough to make a  
promising young player who has yet to prove himself in the majors 
wish he had another name. Which Edgard Clemente might have next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped his father's last name, Velazquez, to go by his  
mother's maiden name in tribute to his uncle, who died three years 
before he was born. But he may go back to Velazquez next year, now 
that he has returned the name Clemente to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe next year, maybe in two years, I will change back,''  
Clemente said. ``But I asked my aunt and my cousins if I could keep 
the name, and they said they didn't mind. As long as I want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente asked permission from Vera Clemente, the late Roberto's  
wife, before changing his name last year in honor of the 25th 
anniversary of his uncle's Hall of Fame induction. Edgard's mother, 
Carmen, who was Roberto's sister, and Roberto Clemente's sons also 
embraced the change. Luis Clemente called Edgard in Pittsburgh this 
week to wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous, I was afraid that if I did not do well  
here that the fans might say something,'' Clemente said. ``But 
they've been good. When they see my name, they are always very 
friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Rockies teammate, pitcher Roberto Ramirez, didn't realize that  
Edgard Clemente was related to Roberto, thinking he chose the name 
at random because Roberto Clemente is so revered in Latin American 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I took it like I might have taken the name McGwire  
or Sosa because they are popular now,'' Clemente said. ``Like I 
could have called myself Edgard Sosa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edgard, 23, is not the only Clemente in baseball; Roberto Jr. is  
a Spanish language broadcaster for the New York Yankees, the team 
his father helped defeat in the 1960 World Series. But Edgard is 
the first in the Clemente family to play in the majors since his 
uncle, who died in an airplane crash on Dec. 31, 1972, while 
transporting relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are giving Edgard a 50-game trial in center field --  
not right field, where Roberto played -- and manager Jim Leyland 
likes what he sees so far: a live arm and a lively bat. Clemente 
was 2-for-4 in Colorado's 8-4 loss Thursday and has five homers 
since returning from the minors on Aug. 9 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll probably end up as a corner outfielder, not a center  
fielder, and he's a free swinger sometimes,'' Leyland said. ``But 
he can hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truly, he must be a Clemente.

<HEADLINE> Barbie Legs Used To Make Fingers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Barbie, the doll with the drop-dead  
figure and more lives than a whole family of cats, is now doing her 
part for medical science. 
</P>
<P>
	In her 40 years, Barbie has had more than 75 careers, ranging  
from astronaut to paleontologist. Now, she's become a medical 
assistant -- of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
	It turns out the plastic knee joints in Barbie's long legs make  
good knuckles in prosthetic fingers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jane Bahor, who makes lifelike body parts for amputees at Duke  
University Medical Center in Durham, has used knees from retired 
Barbie dolls to make new fingers for about a dozen patients. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's made her cultural contribution, now she can make a  
medical contribution,'' Bahor said of Mattel's popular doll. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahor and a patient, Jennifer Jordan, then a North Carolina  
State University engineering student, came up with the idea three 
years ago while discussing how to make Jordan's prosthetic finger 
more realistic and useful. 
</P>
<P>
	Last fall, when Bahor thought the idea was really going to work,  
she called Mattel and asked to buy some knee joints. Mattel was so 
impressed that it sent Bahor a bag full of parts -- free. 
</P>
<P>
	Wearers of the fake fingers bend them in the same way they would  
bend Barbie's leg. They can use their other hand to bend the joint, 
as if cracking the knuckle. Just like Barbie's legs, the fingers 
stay bent until the owner straightens them. 
</P>
<P>
	Being able to bend prosthetic fingers makes it easier for an  
amputee to hold a pen, pick up a cup or grip the steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a simple thing like that is an enhancement,'' Bahor said.

<HEADLINE> Privacy Concerns Hit Amazon.com </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Internet retailer Amazon.com, which last week  
announced a new way to help gift buyers find its most popular 
products, said Thursday it was modifying its new Purchase Circles 
feature after complaints about consumer privacy. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is designed to help purchasers find hot products in  
3,000 different cities, universities and workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
	The service first appeared on Amazon.com's Web site last Friday.  
The Seattle-based company's technology collected consumer data, 
which it made available in searchable databases where online 
shoppers could see which books or music CDs are most popular with 
people in a certain area code, employer or military branch. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com had already found great success with a service that  
suggests merchandise to suit shoppers' own interests. Under the 
Purchase Circle plan, a customer selecting a CD of a trumpet 
concerto by Haydn also would see a list of CDs that others who have 
bought the same recording have also ordered from Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	But outcry over privacy concerns apparently prompted  
modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Amazon.com said Thursday it will now allow anonymous book, video  
and CD selections of individual customers to be excluded from the 
Purchase Circles to which they belong. Also, Amazon will remove a 
company-specific Purchase Circle at the company's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Both changes will be implemented ``as soon as possible,'' the  
company said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Privacy is of utmost importance to our customers and to us,''  
said Warren Adams, director of product development. ``While the 
vast majority of feedback from our customers indicates that 
Purchase Circles have been well received and are extremely valuable 
..., some customers have expressed concerns, so we're letting 
people decide individually.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To find the right Purchase Circle, Amazon.com customers browse  
through lists of places, companies, schools, organizations or 
government agencies. Once the right circle is found, the customer 
chooses whether to search for a book, video or music. Then a list 
of the 10 most popular items bought by Amazon.com customers in that 
Purchase Circle appears. 
</P>
<P>
	To create a Purchase Circle, Amazon.com collects buying  
information based on what products it ships to a particular Zip 
code. It also tracks goods bought by people with the same e-mail 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed last week said privacy shouldn't be an issue  
since the company does not release the preferences of any 
individuals and only creates a Purchase Circle after hundreds of 
items are bought in a particular area.

<HEADLINE> Gore Favors Teaching Evolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Weighing in on a Kansas controversy, Vice  
President Al Gore's office said Thursday he favors the teaching of 
evolution in public schools but would not oppose instruction in 
creationism if taught as part of a religious course. 
</P>
<P>
	``They may teach creationism in the context of a religious  
course; that is clearly up to the local districts to decide,'' said 
Alejandro Cabrera, speaking for Gore. He said Gore bases his 
opinion on court rulings that allow the teaching of creationism as 
part of a religious course but not as a science. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kansas state school board this month adopted new testing  
standards that play down the scientific importance of evolution. 
Local school districts will decide what subjects are taught but 
critics and advocates of the new standards say the decision could 
bring more religion into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Supreme Court has forbidden the teaching of  
creationism, the belief that a higher power created the universe, 
because of the religious foundation of that idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vice president favors the teaching of evolution in public  
schools,'' Cabrera said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously that decision should and will be made at the local  
level and localities should be free to decide their own 
curriculum,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GM Asks Judge for Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- General Motors should be let off the hook for  
the $4.9 billion awarded given to victims burned when their 
Chevrolet Malibu gas tank exploded in a crash, an attorney for the 
automaker told a judge Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	David Heilbron said if Superior Court Judge Ernest Williams does  
not throw out the award, he should whittle it down to a reasonable 
amount or grant GM a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams presided over a 10-week trial that ended last month  
with the jury awarding the six victims $107 million in compensatory 
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages, the biggest 
product-liability award in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is to say the least an extraordinary award,'' Heilbron  
said. ``There's never been anything like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge was expected to make a ruling late Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' attorney Brian Panish said the amount was justified  
because GM designed a car with a dangerous fuel system. Panish said 
GM chose to place the gas tank behind the axle and close to the 
rear bumper to save money, rather than position it in a safer spot 
above the axle, a design that would have cost a few dollars more on 
each vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Motors is blaming everyone but themselves,'' Panish  
said outside court. ``They will not accept responsibility for 
putting a price on people's lives. They were caught red-handed, and 
they were punished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Patricia Anderson of Los Angeles, her four children and family  
friend Jo Tigner sustained severe burns in the accident on 
Christmas Eve 1993. A vehicle operated by a drunken driver slammed 
into the rear of Ms. Anderson's 1979 Malibu, whose gas tank burst 
into flames. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the Malibu was one of the safest cars designed in that  
era and that the drunken driver was solely to blame for the 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's attorneys said it was a one-sided trial, with  
plaintiffs depicting GM as a heartless corporation and the judge 
excluding critical evidence about the vehicle's safety record and 
the drunken driver. GM also said its engineers determined in the 
1970s that placing the gas tank behind the axle was safer because a 
fuel tank over the axle was more likely to cause fires in the 
passenger area. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker rejected a settlement offer from the plaintiffs,  
who said they would slash $4.5 billion off the punitive damages if 
GM recalled the Malibus and vehicles with similar fuel systems made 
from 1978-83. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason to recall the vehicle. It is safe,'' said  
Louis Lindeman Jr., a product-liability attorney for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who said half of the damages she might receive  
would go to help burn victims, said Thursday she would rather see 
most of the money go toward preventing similar accidents in those 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they recall the cars, I'd be happy,'' Ms. Anderson  
said. ``I don't want this to happen to anybody else.''

<HEADLINE> Astros' Hidalgo Has Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Houston Astros outfielder Richard Hidalgo  
underwent a successful operation on his left knee Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo, one of 13 Astros on the disabled list this season, has  
inflammation resulting from loose cartilage. The Astros said it was 
caused by a congenital condition that caused the kneecap not to 
properly join together. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo is expected to make a full recovery within six weeks,  
but will miss the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Hidalgo, 24, hit .227 this season with 15 homers and 56 RBIs. He  
also has 15 outfield assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Astros outfielders Derek Bell (left groin) and Moises Alou (left  
knee surgery) also are on the disabled list, and Alou may not play 
at all this season as a result of a treadmill accident prior to 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	First baseman Jeff Bagwell and second baseman Craig Biggio are  
the only players from the Astros' opening-day lineup not to go on 
the disabled list this year.

	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Free agent Samaki Walker signed a two-year,  
$5.6 million contract with the San Antonio Spurs, according to a 
published report. 
</P>
<P>
	The San Antonio Express-News said the power forward will fill a

<P>
	``I'm very excited about joining the Spurs,'' Walker told the

been defined yet. The coaches will watch me play and see my 
abilities.''

	The Mavericks had been trying to sign Walker, whose three NBA

	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The maker of Norplant has offered to pay a  
reported $54 million to more than 36,000 women to settle claims 
that the implantable contraceptive device caused headaches, 
irregular menstrual bleeding, nausea and depression. American Home 
Products Corp., the parent of Norplant maker Wyeth-Ayerst 
Laboratories, called the move to end five years of litigation a 
business decision. Company lawyers told The Dallas Morning News 
that American Home will pay $1,500 to every woman who sued before 
March 1, adding up to more than $54 million. Stock in American Home

	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Supreme Court today upheld

who said the company's asbestos-based products made them ill. A 
Mississippi man who sued Owens Corning died several months ago of

said. The Commerce Department said today that the nation's gross 
domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- grew at 
an annual rate of 1.8 percent from April through June, down from 
4.3 percent during the first quarter. The government originally

realize my own bank would provide my credit card number to ... 
telemarketers,'' one consumer told a Treasury division. The House

sides were in court on GM's request for a new trial or reduced 
damages. GM told a judge that critical information on the vehicle's 
safety record, the cause of the crash and other evidence were 
excluded at the trial. The plaintiffs offered to settle for $400

<HEADLINE> Report: 270,000 N.Koreans Starved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- About 270,000 North Koreans are  
believed to have died of famine between 1995 and 1998, according to 
South Korean government figures released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	It compares with 220,000 famine-caused deaths reported by North  
Korean officials during the period. A U.S. congressional report 
estimated that more than 2 million people may have died of 
starvation in the country since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's National Statistics Office said they produced the  
estimates on the basis of North Korea's last reported population 
census in 1993 and testimonies of hundreds of defectors from the 
reclusive communist country. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has been largely dependent on outside aid to feed  
its people since 1995 when its agricultural industry collapsed 
after decades of mismanagement aggravated by years of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rarely releases economic and population figures, but  
has acknowledged in recent years that its economy was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1998 study by the World Food Program, UNICEF and the European  
Union found that because of long-term food shortages, 62 percent of 
North Korea's children under 7 years suffer from stunted growth.

<HEADLINE> National Football League Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Chris Palmer has a found a quarterback for the Cleveland Browns  
who he's already familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, who left his job as the Jacksonville offensive  
coordinator for the head coaching job in Cleveland, signed Jamie 
Martin to a one-year contract Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Last December, Martin filled in for Mark Brunell in the Jaguars'  
victory against Detroit. Then, in his only NFL start the next week 
against Tennessee, he tore a knee ligament that ended his season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Martin's knee sufficiently healed after surgery, Palmer  
wanted the free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's close to being ready,'' Palmer said. ``His familiarity is  
a factor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said Martin could provide the Browns a reserve with  
experience. Veteran Ty Detmer is expected to be the Browns' 
starting QB with No. 1 pick Tim Couch and fellow rookie Mike Cook 
serving as backups. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows the league and he knows the system. I think that will  
help him,'' Palmer said. ``Jamie is the ideal third quarterback.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Martin, Cook would probably be added to the  
practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 29, 6-2 and 210 pounds, saw brief action with the Rams  
in 1996 and was with the Redskins in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Bengals    	
</P>
<P>
	Rookie quarterback Akili Smith, who missed 3 1/2 weeks of training  
camp because of a contract holdout, went through his first full day 
of practice getting roughly the same number of snaps at quarterback 
as starter Jeff Blake during the two sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today got a little better,'' Smith said. ``The more and more  
reps I get, the better I feel. The one thing I'm seeing is that the 
defensive linemen are extremely fast. You've got to go back and 
plant your foot and get ready to throw an accurate pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith didn't try anything fancy, and seemed to gain confidence  
as the day went on. Near the end of the afternoon session, he 
completed consecutive right-side slant patterns to receivers Willie 
Jackson and Darnay Scott. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Seahawks    	
</P>
<P>
	Joey Galloway is willing to miss the season in his contract  
dispute with Seattle, a source told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran wide receiver has missed all of training camp as he  
seeks to renegotiate and extend a contract he signed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are offering Galloway a seven-year, $35 million  
deal, with a $7 million signing bonus. Galloway wants a five-year, 
$24 million contract, with a $9 million signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seahawks are depleted by injuries in the receiving corps.  
But team officials declined to comment on the prospect of Galloway 
missing the season. 
</P>
<P>
	New Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren, who talked with Galloway  
earlier this week, is fining the receiver $5,000 a day for missing 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Backup guard Jason Whittle will be the Giants' snapper for field  
goals and extra points, with Lance Scott sidelined with a sprained 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, the snapper the last two years, injured a ligament in his  
right knee during practice Tuesday. An MRI was inconclusive and he 
was sent to New York City for another on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of that test weren't immediately available.  
</P>
<P>
	Whittle has snapped this preseason and special teams coach Larry  
MacDuff said he will do that on Saturday in the exhibition against 
the Jets. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Bears    	
</P>
<P>
	Former Northwestern kicker Brian Gowins is the Bears' kicker, at  
least until Jeff Jaeger feels better. 
</P>
<P>
	Bears coach Dick Jauron was happy with Jaeger, one of the NFL's  
most consistent kickers the past few seasons. But Jaeger injured 
his left hip in the first full week of training camp and missed the 
next three weeks. He was supposed to return for last week's 
exhibition game, only to hurt the hip again before the game. 
</P>
<P>
	So the Bears brought in Gowins and Don Silvestri for workouts  
Wednesday. Gowins, the kicker on Northwestern's 1995 Rose Bowl 
team, signed a one-year deal a few hours later. 
</P>
<P>
	Punter Todd Sauerbrun handled all of the kicking duties for the  
first three exhibition games, but he's still recovering from his 
season-ending knee injury last year and Jauron doesn't want to 
overwork him. 
</P>
<P>
                             *Broncos    	
</P>
<P>
	The Broncos waived offensive lineman Leo Goeas 12 days after  
signing him in the wake of injuries along the front line. 
</P>
<P>
	Goeas, 33, was on Denver's roster last season and has also been  
with San Diego, St. Louis and Baltimore during his eight-year 
career.

	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Hurdler Ludmila Engquist just keeps flying  
through the heats at the World Championships, and then keeps 
lowering expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time gold medalist continued her remarkable comeback  
from breast cancer by winning her quarterfinal heat in the 
100-meter hurdles in 12.65 seconds Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 35-year-old had won her opening heat Wednesday in 12.62.  
</P>
<P>
	``I felt I ran a lot better today but the time was slower,''  
Engquist said. ``Obviously, because of my illness I am not able to 
pick up my speed as quickly as I used to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian-born Swede was diagnosed with cancer in March, had  
her right breast removed in April, and is in between chemotherapy 
treatments. 
</P>
<P>
	American star Gail Devers, the 1993 and 1995 world champion,  
posted the fastest time of the quarterfinals, skimming over the 
hurdles in 12.53 seconds, her best showing of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	That time impressed Engquist.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can only do 12.60,'' Engquist said. ``I can't see getting my  
times down any lower than that and running as fast as Gail did.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DEBUT EVENTS:* Blind athletes raced at a World Championships  
for the first time Thursday, with women competing in the 100 meters 
and men in the 200. 
</P>
<P>
	Each competitor is aided by a guide, who runs in the adjacent  
lane. The two are linked by a string that is looped around the 
racer's right wrist and the guide's left wrist. 
</P>
<P>
	Purificacion Santamarta of Spain, a 37-year-old mother of two,  
turned in the fastest time among the women and cried as she stepped 
off the podium after receiving her gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Her winning time of 12.55 seconds was 0.22 off her own record  
for the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Santamarta also holds world records for the blind in the 200,  
400 and 800, and owns six sprinting gold medals from the last two 
Paralympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Spaniard, Julio Requena Fernandez, won the men's contest  
in 24.09. Fernandez, who turns 40 next month, also picked up 
multiple gold medals at the last two Paralympics. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *IT'S NOT WHETHER YOU WIN OR LOSE:* Priscilla Mamba of Swaziland  
will always be able to say she competed with the best at the World 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Mamba finished 23rd in the women's 10,000 meters Thursday night  
in 38 minutes, 45.18 seconds -- more than eight minutes slower than 
winner Gete Wami and nearly five minutes behind the 22nd-place 
finisher. 
</P>
<P>
	Undeterred and cheered on by the crowd and some of the runners  
who finished ahead of her, Mamba continued running while Ethiopia's 
Wami and silver medalist Paula Radcliffe of Britain took victory 
laps with their country's flags. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven of the 30 starters dropped out during the race.

<HEADLINE> Harcourt General Plans Spin Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWTON, Mass. (AP) -- Publishing company Harcourt General Inc.  
plans to spin off its controlling interest in The Neiman Marcus 
Group, a specialty retailer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're spinning off The Neiman Marcus Group to make Harcourt  
General more of a focused company,'' Peter Farwell, Harcourt 
General's vice president for corporate relations, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailing and publishing ``don't go together in the eyes of many  
investors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Harcourt General, which has a 54 percent controlling interest in  
Neiman Marcus, said the spinoff is contingent upon receiving a 
favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the 
distribution of shares would be tax-free. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholder meetings for both companies are scheduled for Sept.  
15. to consider and vote on the plan, which is subject to 
regulatory approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Thursday, Harcourt General Inc. said that strong  
performances in its publishing and educational services businesses 
helped drive the company's earnings up to $140.5 million for the 
third quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings, which equaled $1.95 per share for the three-month  
period ending July 31, exceeded the expectations of Wall Street 
analysts, who had predicted earnings of $1.89 per share. In the 
same quarter a year earlier, Harcourt posted earnings of $110.8 
million, or $1.54 per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Harcourt General fell $1.93 3/4, or 4 percent, at $44.56 1/4  
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

	ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Texas Rangers right-hander Mark Clark  
and outfielder Mike Simms are on their way to the minors on medical 
rehabilitation assignments. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, who has been on the disabled list since June 20 with a  
partially torn ligament in his right elbow, will be assigned to 
Class-A Savannah of the South Atlantic League. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed as a free agent in the offseason, Clark threw batting  
practice for about 20 minutes Thursday with no problems. 
</P>
<P>
	But an MRI and X-rays had revealed a small tear of his ulnar  
collateral ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark, 3-7 with an 8.60 ERA in 15 starts for the Rangers this  
year, was expected to start Sunday for the Sand Gnats at Hickory. 
</P>
<P>
	Simms, who has missed the entire season with left heel and foot  
problems, will be assigned to Class-A Port Charlotte of the Florida

<HEADLINE> Mars' South Pole Picked for Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- NASA scientists hope to land a robot  
spacecraft on a gently rolling plain near Mars' South Pole next 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose a location with some surface features, but no cliffs  
or jagged peaks,'' said Richard Zurek, the project chief at the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Zurek said the Mars Polar Lander site appears to have layers of  
dust and ice of varying thickness that could contain a record of 
climate changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a sense, digging into its surface will be like reading tree  
rings or layers in an ice core,'' Zurek said in a statement 
Tuesday. ``In addition, we may find evidence of soil particles that 
formed in ancient seas on Mars and were later blown into the polar 
region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The landing will be centered in a target zone 124 miles long and  
12.4 miles wide. It is 76 degrees south latitude and 195 degrees 
west longitude, near the Martian South Pole. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists selected the site after studying pictures and other  
data from the Mars Global Surveyor, a craft currently orbiting 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mars Polar Lander is scheduled to touch down Dec. 3, near  
the end of the spring season in the Martian southern hemisphere. 
During this time, the target area will be in constant sunlight, an 
important factor given that the spacecraft gets its power from 
solar panels. 
</P>
<P>
	Mars Polar Lander was launched Jan. 3. The lander has equipment  
to study the soil and to look for ice beneath the surface. Just 
before the craft enters the Martian atmosphere, it will release two 
penetrating probes that will punch beneath the soil surface to look 
for water ice near the landing site.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With a round of characteristic chuckling, the  
14th Dalai Lama told a small group of reporters about the arduous 
seven-year process it took to produce his latest book. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rewrite! Rewrite! Rewrite!''  
</P>
<P>
	Those exertions paid off. As the lama was conducting a  
Kalachakra initiation into Buddhist enlightenment at Bloomington, 
Ind., this week, his brand-new book, ``Ethics for the New 
Millennium,'' made The New York Times best sellers list. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only that. He is one of the few authors ever to land two  
titles on the list simultaneously. ``The Art of Happiness,'' billed 
as a ``handbook for living,'' has been a best seller for 31 weeks 
running. (Both books are published by Riverhead.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Art of Happiness'' was written with Phoenix psychiatrist  
Howard C. Cutler, while ``Ethics,'' a perceptive and deceptively 
simple book, is the lama's second major solo writing in English. 
The first was his 1990 autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	With his success in the book market, the Dalai Lama joins the  
other two superstars of world religion, Pope John Paul II and the 
Rev. Billy Graham. And as a crowd-pleaser at New York's Central 
Park, only those two have drawn religious turnouts larger than the 
40,000 that the lama drew this month. An impressive accomplishment 
for a Buddhist in a traditionally Christian country. 
</P>
<P>
	The lama's fame stems from his own sunny personality and the  
pertinence of his teachings. Other contributing factors are his 
1989 Nobel Peace Prize and Hollywood pop Buddhism, and the mystique 
surrounding his office. 
</P>
<P>
	For centuries, each Dalai Lama has played a dual role as revered  
Buddhist personification of divine compassion and as monarch of 
Tibet. When the lama dies, monks search for his reincarnation in an 
infant, using various forms of divination. 
</P>
<P>
	He was born in 1935 and identified as the reincarnate Dalai Lama  
at age two. In 1959 he fled Chinese communist occupation and has 
since lived in India, managing the complex political task of 
rallying exiles and seeking restored autonomy for his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama downplays his traditional status as a divine  
bodhisattva and, lately, as Buddhism's first global celebrity. 
``Not relevant as a Buddhist practitioner. Wrong motivation! 
Becomes polluted,'' he remarks in clear but clipped English. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody criticize. Hostile doesn't matter. So ultimately  
check myself. So not bother what people say. I am called a devil. 
Some say god-king. Nonsense! I am just an ordinary human being,'' 
he says with another burst of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama takes a similarly low-key approach in ``Ethics  
for the New Millennium,'' asserting things you might not expect to 
hear from a world-class spiritual teacher: 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether or not a person is a religious believer does not  
matter much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We humans can live quite well without recourse to religious  
faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I sometimes say that religion is something we can perhaps do  
without.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Religious belief is not a precondition either of ethical  
conduct or of happiness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that the Dalai Lama is trashing religion. In fact he  
believes the person who sincerely practices a faith ``will benefit 
enormously'' and that religion can do the same for all of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	Problem is, he writes, ``the influence of religion on people's  
lives is generally marginal, at least in the developed world.'' He 
doubts that even a billion people could be called daily 
practitioners of their faiths. So his book seeks to teach a moral 
consciousness that makes no appeal to religious faith. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddhism lends itself to this approach more than many faiths,  
since it is more a path than a creed, more a mindset than a worship 
tradition, and holds no unified view on the existence of God or 
gods. That is part of its appeal to certain secularized questers in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the lama uses little denominational jargon, ``Ethics''  
centers on a soft-sell version of the concept lying at the heart of 
Buddhism: People suffer because they have raging desires that 
cannot be fulfilled. Control of desire brings happiness and 
compassionate living toward others. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama has been ever more convinced of this since his  
first visit to Europe in 1973. In more recent times he has visited 
the United States nearly once a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The rich tend to live in luxury and acquire more, he observes,  
rather than sharing their good fortune. The evident result is 
``anxiety, discontent, frustration, uncertainty, doubt and 
depression'' in wealthier nations. This inner suffering is 
connected with ``growing confusion as to what constitutes 
morality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Dalai Lama, the essence of morality is compassion toward  
other people and all creatures. But moderns are tempted to cut 
themselves off from neighbors and community, he thinks. Technology 
and economics exacerbate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	It strikes him that people in materially developed nations ``are  
in some ways less satisfied, are less happy, and to some extent 
suffer more than those living in the least developed countries... . 
It often seems that those with nothing are, in fact, the least 
anxious, though they are plagued with physical pains and 
suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Raised in isolation with scant knowledge of other faiths, the  
Dalai Lama today expresses respect for all the great world 
religions and thinks they should remain separate and distinct. 
``For me Buddhism remains the most precious path,'' he writes. But 
it is not necessarily best for everybody.

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stocks fell Thursday on various  
local news, with the large Tokyo market down on a stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese prices dropped as the yen rose even further against the  
U.S. dollar, battering export-oriented shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 188.87 points,  
or 1.06 percent, to end at 17,666.29. On Wednesday, the average 
fell 1.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts companies with large markets abroad because  
it makes Japanese goods less competitive overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	In the currency market, the dollar bought 111.06 yen in the late  
afternoon in Tokyo, down 0.26 yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and 
also below its late New York level of 111.14 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, shares rose on Wall Street's overnight gains  
despite worries that local interest rates may rise. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark Hang Seng Index rose 129.25 points, or 1 percent,  
to 13,608.38. On Wednesday, the index fell 1.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The market climbed on renewed interest in selected blue chips,  
following a 0.37 percent gain in the Dow Jones industrial average 
in New York, said Sean Li of Amsteel Securities HK Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	But some investors were staying out of the market ahead of  
Friday's meeting of the Hong Kong Association of Banks -- the 
banking cartel which sets local interest rates. It was unclear 
whether the Hong Kong banks would follow this week's rise in U.S. 
interest rates by increasing their own rates. 
</P>
<P>
	ELSEWHERE:   	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK: Shares ended lower amid heavy losses among banking  
shares. The SET index lost 12.63 points, or 2.7 percent, to close 
at 456.07. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Shares dropped, with sentiment dampened by the Bank  
Bali fraud. The JSE Composite index fell 7.74 points, or 0.60 
percent, at 581.513 points. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Shares closed lower despite a 4.1 percent GDP  
growth rate in the second quarter. The Composite Index fell 6.68 
points, or 0.87 percent, to 761.75. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Shares dropped amid worries about higher local interest  
rates. The PSE Index fell 23.43 points, or 1 percent, to 2,236.71. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Shares dropped on worries that Daewoo's debt-relief plan  
could hurt local banks and securities houses. The KOSPI fell 3.12 
points, or 0.32 percent, to 959.88. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares surged, led by market heavyweight United  
Overseas Bank. The STI rose 26.18 points, or 1.23 percent, to 
2,162.54. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Shares ended higher on strong company earnings. The All  
Ordinaries Index rose 12.80 points, or 0.40 percent, to 3,046.1. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Shares closed lower as investors cashed in on recent  
gains. The Weighted Price Index fell 29.52 points, or 0.40 percent, 
to 8,097.57. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: Shares rose as investors dove back into the market  
looking for bargains. The NZSE-40 Capital Index was up 13.08 
points, or 0.61 percent, to close at 2,144.65.

<HEADLINE> Rodman: Lakers Will Want Me Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is sure the Los  
Angeles Lakers will re-sign him -- if they want to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ain't gonna win with what they've got, I'll tell you  
that,'' Rodman told the Orange County Register for today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Lakers haven't offered anything formal, the  
flamboyant athlete who has made headlines on and off the court with 
his antics says Lakers owner Jerry Buss checked in on him recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to see what's going on, that's all. Just to see where my  
head's at,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what's going to happen. They're going to wait until the  
last minute, and it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said today he would not comment on  
Rodman's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San  
Antonio Spurs and Chicago Bulls before joining the Lakers for a 
short stint last season. The Lakers waived him in April.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Buying Equipment Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Shoring up an iron grip on the market  
for Internet equipment, Cisco Systems Inc. is paying $7.4 billion 
for two companies with expertise in the fiber-optic technology 
needed to carry telephone calls and TV over data networks. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisitions of Cerent and Monterey Networks announced  
Thursday put Cisco in direct competition with Lucent Technologies, 
Nortel Networks and Alcatel in a market that analysts expect to 
grow to $10 billion during the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cerent purchase is the biggest ever for Cisco, which today  
controls roughly 85 percent of the world's market for the routers 
and switches that direct data around computer networks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The size of this deal really surprised me, but Cisco had a  
clear hole in their product portfolio, and they simply had to fill 
it,'' said Chandan Sarkar, an analyst at Soundview Financial. ``I 
think these guys had Cisco over a barrel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cerent makes a microwave-sized device that can be used by  
providers of cable, phone and Internet service to ease bottlenecks 
between the speedy fiber-optic ``backbones'' that make up the 
Internet and older, slower telephone networks made with copper. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers for the devices, which sell for between $20,000 and  
$60,000, include Qwest Communications and Frontier Corp., both of 
which operate big fiber-optic networks. But Cerent, based in 
Petaluma, Calif., has posted only $10 million in sales in its 2 1/2 
years in business and has never turned a profit.

	Monterey, based in Richardson, Texas, makes technology used to  
increase capacity at the core of an optical network. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet is going optical fiber, no doubt, and Cisco just  
wasn't in on it yet,'' said Gina Socklow, an analyst at Brean 
Murray &AMP; Co. ``Now they're back in the race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Volpi, Cisco's vice president of business development, said  
the deals will enable it to help customers such as Internet service 
providers make the transition from ``old world networks -- voice 
networks'' to multimedia networks carrying data, voice and video 
together.

<P>
	Cisco, which already held a minority stake in both companies,  
will be issuing 100 million shares of its stock in exchange for all 
remaining equity in Cerent and 7.3 million shares for the rest of 
Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, Cisco's shares  
rose 31 1/4 cents each to $68.93 3/4. Cerent and Monterey aren't publicly 
traded. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, based in San Jose Calif., expects to record a one-time  
charge against earnings of between 7 cents and 11 cents a share 
this quarter in connection with the Monterey deal.

<HEADLINE> Former Coach Dave Holmes Dies at 75 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Former Hawaii and Eastern Washington  
University football coach Dave Holmes has died of an apparent heart 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes, 75, died Wednesday while fly fishing with a friend along  
the St. Joe River in northern Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes led Eastern Washington to a 34-13-1 record from 1963 to  
1967, with the .719 winning percentage the best in the school's 
history. He coached Hawaii to a 46-17-1 record from 1968 to 1973, 
with the .727 winning percentage also the best in the school's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	His Hawaii victories included a 10-7 upset of Washington in  
Seattle to open the 1973 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Holmes resigned after the 1973 season, despite a 9-2 record, in  
a philosophical dispute with an alumni group. He is a member of 
Hawaii's athletic Circle of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
	He coached at University High School in Spokane before retiring  
about 15 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Agronomy Day Boasts High-Tech Bean / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	URBANA, Ill. (AP) -- Crop sciences professor Ted Hymowitz adopted  
an unusual visual aide to help him explain soybean genetics to a 
group of farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	He planted a plot of soybeans in the shape of the 20 pairs of  
chromosomes, and soon had farmers gathering to hear his ideas at 
University of Illinois' 43rd annual Agronomy Day, an event designed 
to highlight the latest developments in agricultural research. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to take what we see under the microscope and  
pictorially demonstrate it,'' Hymowitz said. ``I thought this would 
help provide the public with some information about what goes on in 
the laboratory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,400 farmers who came this week were given information on  
the pros and cons of using genetically modified crops to battle 
insects, on ways to reduce phosphorus runoff and on OxyDiesel fuel, 
in which ethanol is blended with diesel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Agriculture is changing so fast that if you slow down you'll  
get passed by rather quickly,'' said Darin Butler, a global 
positioning systems coordinator in DeKalb for FS, a company that 
offers various services and products to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important to stay ahead of the game,'' Butler said.  
``Farmers who can attend ag days like this will have an idea of 
what university research is striving for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hymowitz's talk was on the University of Illinois' effort to  
determine which genes control what soybean traits and where those 
genes occur on the chromosomes. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's no different from when you read that researchers have  
discovered a gene associated with Alzheimer's disease or breast 
cancer and found what chromosome it is located on,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of soybeans, researchers are interested in genes  
that influence traits such as yield, protein oil and disease 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	More valuable corn was the focus of a presentation given by crop  
sciences professor Robert Lambert, who spoke about research being 
done on how to increase the levels of antioxidants vitamin E and 
vitamin A in corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Some studies have concluded that increased levels of those  
vitamins can benefit human and livestock health and can increase 
the quality and shelf life of beef, Lambert said. Researchers have 
been able to develop corn hybrids with as much as three times the 
amount of vitamin E and six times the amount of vitamin A in normal 
corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers who grew such hybrids could probably get more money per  
bushel. Companies that produce corn-based cereals would not have to 
add the vitamins, and groceries would be able to leave meat on the 
shelves longer to sell. 
</P>

	NEBRASKA CITY, Neb. (AP) -- Apple cider sold this fall at Arbor  
Day Farm and Kimmel Orchard will be pasteurized for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Nebraska City has been known for its cider  
beverages, including hot cider with cinnamon and cider slushes, but 
the sale of local apple cider decreased, however, when an E. coli 
outbreak in 1996 -- traced to unpasteurized apple juice manufactured 
in California -- was blamed in the death of a Colorado girl and 
illnesses in 66 others. 
</P>
<P>
	This fall, The National Arbor Day Foundation will flash  
pasteurize its products at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and 
the product will carry a label reading, ``This product is 
pasteurized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Research showed that high heat followed by quick cooling killed  
the E. coli bacteria while allowing the cider to retain its flavor, 
said Chris Aden, general manager at Arbor Day Farm.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Police Sell Over 7,000 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Some of the more than 7,000 guns sold by the  
Detroit Police Department to a wholesaler may have ended up in the 
city's gun shops -- which are being sued by the city for the 
proliferation of illegal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,659 handguns, .38-caliber police revolvers, and 777  
shotguns were sold between 1992 and 1999 under a contract with 
Century International Arms in Vermont, Chief Benny Napoleon said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales earned about $800,000 toward the purchase of new  
weapons for the 4,000-member department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you burn them and throw away almost a million dollars of  
city property? You have a city that's strapped for money, and you 
have to purchase new firearms for the safety of the officers,'' 
Napoleon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Napoleon said the now-expired contract carried no restrictions  
or conditions that would have prevented the guns from being resold 
to dealers in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dealers named in the city's $800 million lawsuit said they  
have purchased weapons from Century and it is very possible they 
bought some of the old police weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilwoman Brenda Scott said she wants police to melt the  
guns, something it does with weapons taken from suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are doing is self-defeating,'' Ms. Scott said. ``Who  
is to say those guns don't wind up back on the streets of the city 
of Detroit?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit and surrounding Wayne County are suing more than 30  
companies, accusing them of knowingly allowing firearms to get into 
the hands of felons and underage buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of cities nationwide are suing gun makers and  
dealers in lawsuits patterned after those taking on the tobacco 
industry.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutor Gets Denver Police Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A special prosecutor is looking into how police  
handled the videotaped arrest of two drug suspects, because a 
supervisor in the district attorney's office is related to an 
officer under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	A news helicopter taped 10 officers subduing and arresting the  
Hispanic men during a rush-hour chase Monday. The video appears to 
show at least two officers striking one suspect in the back of the 
head with their guns, and other officers kicking and hitting the 
suspects on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The police department is investigating the conduct of the  
officers, members of its gang unit, whom it refused to identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Results of the investigation were to have been forwarded to the  
office of District Attorney Bill Ritter. On Wednesday, Ritter asked 
for a special prosecutor, saying there was the appearance of a 
conflict of interest because a supervisor in his office is a sister 
of one officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge assigned the case to a special prosecutor.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the FBI said his agency is monitoring the  
internal police investigation and will forward any findings on 
possible civil rights violations to the Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Michele Parish, acting executive director of the local chapter  
of the American Civil Liberties Union, said her organization will 
wait until after the police investigation to decide whether to take 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver officers are allowed, by both department policy and state  
law, to use whatever force is necessary to make an arrest or take 
control of a situation, said Lt. Gail Rowe. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men and a third suspect were held without bail on  
charges of conspiring to distribute cocaine and methamphetamines, 
pending a detention hearing Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Shutdown at O'Hare After Man Bolts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A passenger ran past a security checkpoint and  
disappeared into the crowd at O'Hare International Airport on 
Thursday, prompting United Airlines to shut down a terminal for 
almost three hours as authorities searched for him. 
</P>
<P>
	United canceled 123 flights and expected delays of several hours  
on others, spokesman Joe Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was not found and Chicago Police said officers turned up  
nothing suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
	About 6,000 passengers were cleared from the terminal during the  
search, airline officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was leaving a concourse and heading toward the baggage  
claim area when he turned back and ran up a one-way staircase 
leading to the concourse, said United spokesman Matthew Triaca. 
Guards are stationed at the staircase, but the man ran past them. 
</P>
<P>
	No United flights left the terminal during the search and only a  
few landed at other United gates. United had resumed flights by 
early evening.

<HEADLINE>  Titans Set To Christen New Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Three years, three stadiums and one  
nickname later, the Tennessee Titans finally are home. 
</P>
<P>
	Gone are the 200-mile commutes to home games, sparse crowds,  
cramped locker rooms and aging stadiums. This Friday, the Titans 
move into brand-new, 67,700-seat Adelphia Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the way the National Football League should be,''  
coach Jeff Fisher said of the open-air, natural grass stadium with 
spacious locker rooms for players and extra-wide seats for fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like moving from a condo to a mansion,'' left tackle Brad  
Hopkins said of the stadium already nicknamed ``The Delph.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going from pinto beans to limousines,'' quipped end  
Henry Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delph is the latest in a growing list of new stadiums in the  
NFL. Cleveland's opens this weekend. Cincinnati's new stadium opens 
next season, while Pittsburgh's will be finished in 2001. New 
stadiums also are planned for Denver, Philadelphia and New England. 
</P>
<P>
	A stadium was the $292 million carrot that Nashville dangled in  
front of owner Bud Adams when he was looking to leave Houston in 
1995. The stadium survived an angry public debate and a tornado 
during construction and will be christened when the Titans (0-2) 
play host to the Atlanta Falcons (1-1) in an exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a new beginning,'' cornerback Darryll Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	The sparkling coliseum is far different from the franchise's  
former home, the cavernous Astrodome in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	There's Tifsport Bermuda grass instead of Astroturf. Fans have  
an easy walk to their seats, with the bottom half of the stadium 
set below ground level. Easy-to-read scoreboards measuring 
156-by-56 feet are at each end of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	An irrigation and drainage system under the field can handle 10  
inches of rain an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	Tinted glass shields the club sections. Splashes of color come  
from the eight red light standards hovering over the top rows, and 
the blue and red seats inside. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a far cry from the team's last two stadiums.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the team's first in Tennessee, the then-Oilers  
practiced in Nashville and played home games 200 miles away at the 
antiquated Liberty Bowl in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the team played at 41,100-seat Vanderbilt Stadium.  
</P>
<P>
	Both stadiums had tiny locker rooms, and both years the team was  
last in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the Titans have plenty of elbow room in a locker room that  
is big enough for them to run plays. Their families even have a 
spacious waiting room across the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	There are 40 restrooms for female fans, compared to 26 for men.  
</P>
<P>
	A total of 144 suites and 9,600 club seats are designed to  
produce the revenue that will keep the franchise competitive. More 
than 49,000 fans have purchased personal seat licenses ranging from 
$250 to $4,500 that allow them to purchase season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Titans prepare for the regular-season home opener on  
Sept. 12 against Cincinnati, the final touches are being placed on 
The Delph. The stadium opening also eliminates what has been a 
constant distraction for the Titans, who have finished 8-8 the last 
three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pressure's on. We've got to win now,'' center Bruce  
Matthews said.

<HEADLINE> Road to Enlightenment, Via Indiana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- For days, the Dalai Lama and more than  
two dozen Buddhist monks have purified the grounds of the Tibetan 
Cultural Center, meticulously crafting a brilliant sand painting 
called a mandala. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Kalachakra, or ``wheel of time'' ceremony, ends on  
Friday, the Dalai Lama will sweep the sand into an urn and monks 
will pour it into nearby Lake Monroe, unleashing what believers say 
are healing powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ritual is considered by Buddhists to be a stepping stone on  
the road to enlightenment. It has drawn thousands of people from 
across the globe to a Midwestern city better known as the home of 
Indiana University and its fiery basketball coach, Bob Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloomington may appear an unlikely setting for such a high  
Buddhist rite, but the Dalai Lama visited here in 1987 and 1996. 
The college town has been home to his brother, Thubten Norbu, since 
1965. 
</P>
<P>
	Norbu, 79, a retired professor, founded the Tibetan center here  
in 1979. ``This is my dream for so many years,'' Norbu said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dalai Lama and his followers adhere to the Mahayana school  
of Buddhism, which teaches that people can save others through 
grace and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
	The mandala is crafted from colored sand, representing a  
circular, spiritual home to 722 deities. If participants complete 
the ritual with the best of intentions -- to bring happiness to all 
living beings -- they can achieve a higher state of enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
	Their ideal being is the bodhisattva, a person who puts off his  
or her own nirvana -- or perfect peace -- in order to relieve the 
suffering of others. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The) Kalachakra, especially initiated by his holiness the  
Dalai Lama, means a great deal in one's life,'' said Tsering 
Dorjee, a 49-year-old native of Tibet now living in Switzerland. 
He's attending his third Kalachakra. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives me happiness, satisfaction, which inspires me to  
think of other people, help other people, be a good person,'' 
Dorjee said. ``That's the essence of all initiations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the actual initiation, held Wednesday and today,  
participants visualize themselves entering the mandala, where they 
are cleansed like newborn infants and implanted with seeds to the 
mind, body and speech of a buddha. They commit themselves to acting 
like one. 
</P>
<P>
	Non-Buddhists among the participants accept the Kalachakra  
ritual as a blessing and a means toward enlightenment and altruism. 
</P>
<P>
	For this Kalachakra, the 25th taught by the Dalai Lama, Norbu  
and his two sons transformed the center's 100 acres into a 
combination holy site-festival ground with new cottages to house 
monks, vendor stalls and a 45-foot-high concrete and limestone 
stupa, or shrine. 
</P>
<P>
	The focal point is an air-conditioned tent nearly the size of a  
football field that seats about 4,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, from a throne atop a stage, the 14th Dalai Lama --  
considered a reincarnation of the Buddha of compassion -- meditates 
and shares teachings passed down from the original Buddha 2,500 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Behind him hang giant banners depicting Buddha, the mandala and  
the four-faced Kalachakra deity. In front, monks sit on cushions 
the color of their maroon robes. To the right of the throne is the 
Kalachakra House, with a golden roof and silk curtains that shield 
the mandala. 
</P>
<P>
	Actors Richard Gere and Harrison Ford are among more than 3,000  
people who paid at least $350 to attend all 11 days of the ritual. 
Others have paid $40 to $50 to attend daily sessions.

<HEADLINE> Campanile Wins Steeplechase Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Campanile led throughout, holding  
gamely in the final yards to score a 3/4-length victory in Saratoga's 
58th running of the $112,100 Grade II New York Turf Writers Cup, a 
steeplechase event for horses 4 years old and older. 
</P>
<P>
	Willstown closed well to be runnerup in the 10-horse field  
another 3/4-length before Romantic. 
</P>
<P>
	The second and third finishers were both trained by Jonathan  
Sheppard, although they raced as separate wagering interests due to 
differing ownership. 
</P>
<P>
	Campanile carried 148 pounds and Blythe Miller 2 3/8 miles on the  
course labeled good to earn $67,260 for Gregory D. Hawkins with his 
third win in six starts this year. It was also the third straight 
jump win for Campanile who took Saratoga's Grade II A. P. Smithwick 
in his prior start. 
</P>
<P>
	Campanile returned $14.20, $6.80 and $4.20. Willstown paid  
$36.20 and $14.80 and Romantic was $5.50.

<HEADLINE> Deluge Cripples NYC Rush Hour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An early morning downpour today filled city  
streets with rainwater, crippled subways and commuter trains, and 
turned rush hour into a slow, sodden slog. 
</P>
<P>
	The normal 45-minute commute from the city's outer boroughs to  
midtown Manhattan became a two-hour trek featuring wet bus seats, 
6-inch-deep puddles at intersections and nonexistent taxicabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 3 inches of rain fell after midnight, much of it between 7  
a.m. and 9 a.m., the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Mercantile Exchange delayed trading of energy  
futures contracts by 45 minutes. Only one-quarter of the normal 
contingent of traders made it to work in lower Manhattan on time, 
exchange officials said. No other exchanges reported delays because 
of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	High water stranded drivers and cascaded into subway tunnels,  
cutting power on some lines when it washed over the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers on a No. 6 train who chose to skip wet streets and  
wait at a station for service to be restored were rewarded with 
free coffee. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Hoffman, the transit system's senior vice president for  
subways, happened to be working at the station and ordered coffee 
from a nearby deli for everyone on the train. 
</P>
<P>
	Eating on the train is against the rules, but no one complained.  
</P>
<P>
	``Once he got them the coffee, they were very, very happy,''  
said transit spokesman Al O'Leary. 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Gramiela tried for 2 1/2 hours to catch any form of  
transportation from his night job as an elevator operator on the 
Upper West Side to his day job at the Federal Reserve Bank downtown 
on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he gave up and went to get breakfast.  
</P>
<P>
	Others stuck it out. Long lines of umbrella-clutching commuters,  
some with rubber boots peeking from beneath somber executive suits 
and skirts, lined up to board packed buses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harlem, Hudson and New Haven lines of the Metro-North  
railroad, which serves the city's northern suburbs, were halted at 
about 8:30 a.m. when water covered the tracks and their electrified 
third rails. Some trains were stranded between stations. 
</P>
<P>
	Railroad spokeswoman Marjorie Anders said electrical components  
on the underside of the trains could short out if they are 
submerged. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 80 cars were stuck on FDR Drive, a primary highway on  
Manhattan's eastern edge, when a water main break worsened the road 
conditions. About 60 firefighters waded onto the road to rescue 
drivers and passengers, Fire Department spokesman Joseph 
Leoncavallo said.

<HEADLINE> Gene Study: Eat Less, Live Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genes that play a key role in aging tend to  
stay vigorous in response to a low-calorie diet, says a study that 
may help explain why animals that eat less often live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas A. Prolla and Richard Weindruch, both of the University of  
Wisconsin, Madison, said their genetic analysis of mice showed that 
genes that normally deteriorate with age tended to continue 
functioning in a youthful way when the mice were underfed. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the study, to be published in the journal Science on  
Friday, may explain why a reduced-calorie diet can cause mice to 
live up to 50 percent longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weindruch said it is not scientifically appropriate yet to  
recommend that people of normal weight go on calorie-restricted 
diets in order to prolong life, but he added: ``This line of 
research bears watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the research could lead to drugs that would help  
slow the aging process in humans, although there have been no 
definitive studies proving that a reduced-calorie diet in humans 
will extend life. 
</P>
<P>
	What is clear, Weindruch said, is that obesity damages health  
and that one reason for this might be changes in genes linked to 
aging. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been studies in monkeys that show a low calorie diet  
does lower blood pressure and raise levels of ``good'' cholesterol, 
both signs of improved health that suggest a longer life. Those 
studies, however, did not examine the fundamental genetic changes 
that occur as a part of the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is quite important because it breaks new ground in  
giving us an understanding of what happens to gene expression with 
age,'' said Dr. Raj Sohal, a professor of biological sciences at 
Southern Methodist University. Although the study was with mice, he 
said it suggests that ``if you overeat, you are accelerating the 
aging process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This study has analyzed more genes with regard to aging than  
all previous studies combined,'' said Prolla. He said 5 to 10 
percent of the entire mouse genome was examined. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wisconsin laboratory study, the researchers fed one group  
of mice a regular diet while restricting by 24 percent the calories 
in the food given to another group. The diets all contained 
healthful levels of vitamins, minerals and proteins. Only the 
calories were reduced. This creates a condition of undernutrition, 
but not malnutrition, Weindruch said. 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 months, muscles were taken from the animals and the  
activity of 6,347 genes was analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose muscle for analysis because it is an important target  
for the effects of aging,'' said Weindruch. ``Muscle is lost 
routinely with old age and contributes to physical frailty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that more than 100 genes either increased  
or decreased their activity with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the molecular level, normal aging looks like a state of  
chronic injury in muscle,'' said Prolla. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for mice fed the restricted diet, about 84 percent of  
the genetic alterations associated with aging were completely or 
partially suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the molecular level,'' the study found,  
``calorie-restricted mice appear to be biologically younger than 
animals receiving the control diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly suggests that the reduction of calorie intake not  
only increases lifespan in mice, but seems to affect a broad 
spectrum of age-associated changes at the gene expression level,'' 
said Weindruch. He said these genetic changes clearly play a role 
in extending life in those animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the genes affected by aging are those that help the body  
rid itself of oxygen radicals, chemicals produced during the 
process of metabolizing calories in cells. Oxygen radicals are 
known to be damaging to DNA, the body's genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice fed the full-calorie diet tended to lose the benefit of  
these oxygen radical control genes with age. The genes continued to 
work vigorously, however, in mice fed the calorie restricted genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the study evaluated muscles, Weindruch said that similar  
molecular effects may occur in the brain and in the heart, both of 
which tend to show the effects of the aging process.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Attendants Reject Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROMULUS, Mich. (AP) -- Northwest Airlines flight attendants let  
out a loud cheer as union officials announced that members voted 
overwhelmingly to reject a five-year tentative contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not what we wanted, this is what the airline wanted,''  
flight attendant Helen Mulane, based out of Detroit, said of the 
rejected contract. ``Now we're going to get what we want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local 2000 President Billie Davenport said the union will  
prepare a survey to determine what members want. The contract was 
rejected by a 6,108 to 2,727 vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attendants leaving the room where the votes were being tallied  
at Detroit Metropolitan Airport said that work rules, retirement 
benefits and pay were the biggest concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I deserve more for my 12 years,'' said William Russo,  
a Northwest flight attendant for 12 years. Russo said he doesn't 
care if it takes another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took us three years to get this, and it's a five-year deal.  
I'd rather wait another year for a good contract than another eight 
years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport and the International Brotherhood of Teamsters had  
supported the deal, announced June 10, while Local 2000 
Secretary-Treasurer Danny Campbell had criticized it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe what the flight attendants have said to Northwest  
Airlines is we're tired, we're angry, and we're tired of being 
treated like second-class citizens,'' Davenport said. ``My reaction 
is I stand behind the flight attendants 100 percent. They have a 
mandate here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement, Northwest said it was disappointed.  
</P>
<P>
	``We believe the agreement is fair and equitable and would have  
put Northwest flight attendants on par with their counterparts at 
the other U.S. airlines,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	When the vote was announced, about 100 people packed into the  
room let up a loud cheer, then began chanting, ``Stop corporate 
greed.'' Two people ran down the hallway yelling ``We won, we 
won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although flight attendants had voted overwhelmingly to authorize  
a strike before the tentative agreement was reached, the National 
Mediation Board would have to declare further negotiations at an 
impasse to begin a 30-day countdown to a strike. The process could 
take months. 
</P>
<P>
	A 15-day strike by pilots last September cost Northwest millions  
of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the strike, most other unions have reached contract  
agreements with Northwest. The Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal 
Association, which represents about 9,500 mechanics and cleaners, 
is preparing to begin negotiations with Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said the flight attendants union's executive board  
would meet today to determine the next step. 
</P>
<P>
	The average wage increase under the pact would have been 14  
percent, but flight attendants with less than six years of 
experience would have seen wages rise as much as 25 percent. The 
pact also would have increased pensions 57 percent in the first 
year and 78 percent over the life of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants also would have received a signing bonus equal  
to 3.5 percent of all pay from Aug. 1, 1996, until the date of 
signing. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight attendants have been seeking higher wages as payback for  
three years of salary cuts they took, beginning in 1993, to help 
keep Northwest out of bankruptcy. Their current hourly wages -- 
which range from $15.98 to start to up to $37.08 after 12 years -- 
are only 3 percent higher than before they accepted the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwest attendants' nonunion colleagues at Delta Air Lines  
start at $20.07 and reach a top scale of $47.85 after 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Marie Mastalerz, a flight attendant for 23 years, was in  
favor of the agreement because ``it made a lot of gains and we 
poured a good foundation to build on. There was no foundation in 
place for us to work with.''

<HEADLINE> Steel Imports Increase in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imports of foreign steel rose in July, the  
government said Thursday, in a reversal that suggests the U.S. 
industry's struggles may continue. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6 percent increase, which followed a 9 percent drop in June,  
was the third expansion in five months. Since November, when the 
Commerce Department first threatened punitive tariffs on imports of 
the industry's core product, foreign shipments have decreased by 
one-fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and the U.S. steel industry have been  
closely monitoring the monthly figures for signs of an end to a 
crisis from low-priced imports, which the industry blames for 
thousands of layoffs. While imports decline in some months, they 
often go back up the next. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite periodic monthly spikes, the administration has stayed  
with its policy of relying primarily on imposing tariffs at the 
industry's request and resisting stronger sanctions that 
administration officials fear could prompt a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	Each tariff request takes several months to resolve and, because  
it targets one product and one country at a time, the U.S. industry 
fears foreign steel companies can shift to making other products 
and other countries can step in to fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign steel producers ``will play with this until there is a  
permanent solution,'' said Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, who supports 
global steel quotas. ``They're doing what I predicted they would 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The government's July figures indicate that some product  
shifting may have occurred. The one-month increase reflected jumps 
primarily in shipments from Mexico, Ukraine and Taiwan -- countries 
that were not targeted in the early complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	In preliminary figures, the Commerce Department said imports  
totaled 2.9 million metric tons in July. That compares with final 
figures of 2.8 million in June. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first seven months of 1999, imports totaled 18.2 million  
metric tons. That is a 5 percent increase from the 17.2 million 
metric tons in the same period of 1997, before the Asian economic 
crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign companies 
to sell their surplus in the healthy U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 level was 10 percent below the 20.2 million metric tons  
during the first seven months of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Toms River 2 Victories From Repeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Once again, the team from Toms River,  
N.J., is two victories from winning the Little League World Series. 
And this time they're defying even greater odds. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider: 7,500 teams worldwide began tournament play this  
summer and only eight made it to Williamsport. 
</P>
<P>
	Then factor in that only two members of last year's title team  
from Toms River are back in uniform and the chances of repeating 
are even more remote. 
</P>
<P>
	The only numbers that really matter, however, are on the  
scoreboard, Toms River manager Mike Gaynor says. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're not going to win ever game. But when it's meant  
something and it's counted, we've been able to pull it out,'' 
Gaynor said. ``And that's why we're here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Great pitching and good defense don't hurt either. The team from  
Phenix City, Ala, Toms River's opponent in the U.S. championship 
Thursday, saw plenty of both earlier this week when Toms River beat 
them 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
	The other game Thursday features Osaka, Japan versus the  
all-stars from Puerto Rico for the International pool championship. 
Winners of each game play Saturday for the World Series 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Puerto Rico defeated Ramstein Air Force Base,  
Germany 16-3 in their final preliminary round game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lord have mercy, I wouldn't watch that thing again,'' Phenix  
City manager Tony Rasmus said after being asked if we would review 
replays of his team's shutout loss to Toms River. ``It would give 
me nightmares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toms River seems immune to the pressure that goes with trying to  
become only the third team in history to repeat as Little League 
champion. Monterrey, Mexico did it in 1957 and 1958, and Long 
Beach, Calif., in 1992 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After Toms River beat Brownsburg, Ind., 3-1 on Tuesday, star  
pitcher and outfielder Eric Campesi sounded like he'd rather be 
planted in front of the video game machines in the players' lounge 
than on the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing with the Seattle Mariners. I pitch with Jamie  
Moyer, and I especially like it because I like Ken Griffey, Jr. He 
hits those home runs,'' said Campisi, who along with Gaynor's son, 
Casey, are the only two returning players from last year's team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what I'll be doing during the off day. Maybe play  
video games or something,'' catcher Chris Cunningham said. Toms 
River had played three games in three days before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Actually, you'll be practicing,'' Gaynor quickly snapped back  
as Campisi laughed. 
</P>
<P>
	Not far from the field where Toms River practiced in front of  
dozens of fans, reporters and photographers, Phenix City took light 
batting practice with seven parents watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Rasmus doesn't mind if the attention is focused on the ``Beasts  
of the East.'' He's trying to keep his team from getting too 
distracted again by loud contingent of Toms River fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we got a better chance Thursday. It's got to be easier  
the second time around,'' Rasmus said. ``Any team's beatable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phenix City, which is an average height of 5-foot-3, is one of  
the smallest teams in the eight-team field but has packed quite a 
punch with six home runs in the two games since Toms River. 
</P>
<P>
	Is Phenix City looking to avenge its last loss?  
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, sir,'' said Rasmus' 12-year-old son, Colby, gave up six  
runs and eight hits over six innings against Toms River Sunday. 
``I'm going to pitch my best against them.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Martin Lawrence Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. (AP) -- Comic actor Martin Lawrence was  
alert and showed encouraging signs Thursday as he recovered from a 
coma triggered by a jog in heavy clothing on a hot day, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawrence was in critical but stable condition at Los Robles  
Regional Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was alert. He was following commands,'' spokeswoman Kris  
Carraway-Bowman said. ``His eyes were focusing, so neurologically 
that's very encouraging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 34-year-old former star of the TV sitcom ``Martin'' was able  
to write, but he could not speak because doctors were keeping him 
on a ventilator as a precaution, Ms. Carraway-Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hospital officials said Lawrence was trying to lose weight for a  
movie role when he went for a jog Sunday in 100-degree 
temperatures. His temperature was more than 107 degrees when he 
reached the hospital. He was in a coma for three days. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martin'' debuted in 1992 and was canceled by the Fox network  
in 1996. Lawrence has also starred in several movies, including 
``Life,'' ``Bad Boys'' and ``You So Crazy.''

<HEADLINE> Space Shuttle To Cost $317M More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A wedge-shaped rocket plane that would replace  
NASA's aging space shuttle is behind schedule and will cost about 
$317.6 million more than planned, congressional auditors report. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin Corp., builder of the prototype X-33,  
encountered problems with the reusable spacecraft's three key 
technologies: lightweight fuel tanks, rocket engines and heat 
shielding. 
</P>
<P>
	These problems pushed the first flight test back 16 months, to  
July 2000, the investigators said in a General Accounting Office 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA joined with Lockheed and other companies in plans to  
produce a craft that would bring cargo and passengers to space for 
one-tenth the cost of the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
	The original plans had the space agency paying $912.4 million.  
Lockheed was to contribute $211.6 million, but the technical 
problems increased the defense contractor's costs by $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed may classify the additional expenses as independent  
research and then bill the government for them as overhead for 
other contracts. Combined with increased NASA personnel costs, the 
GAO estimates the government will end up paying $1.23 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental program's ultimate goal is to produce a  
commercially owned and operated craft called the Venture Star, a 
space plane twice the size of the X-33 that would blast off to 
orbit in a single stage, unlike current systems that require 
multiple rockets. Returning to Earth, the craft would glide down 
and land like an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said that NASA should look closer at the impact  
of using the Venture Star to support the International Space 
Station. With less cargo room, it would take two to three Venture 
Star flights to equal one by the space shuttle. This increase in 
dockings with the space station might disrupt the stable, quiet 
times needed for scientific research. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are suggesting that NASA more clearly identify steps as  
this thing progresses to be able to verify that they are moving 
towards the goal,'' the GAO's Jerry Herley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Venture Star was to be operational by 2004, but with the  
delays development may not start until a year later, said Rep. Dana 
Rohrabacher, R-Calif., chairman of the House Science subcommittee 
on space and aeronautics. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrabacher complained that the Clinton administration ``put all  
of its technology eggs in one fragile basket,'' when it should be 
funding competing experimental designs for space planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This administration's approach to developing next-generation  
reusable launch vehicles isn't working,'' he said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Injury Ends Jones' Run in Seville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- The heat, the hard track and the daily  
grind took their toll on Marion Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	The world's top female track and field athlete came to the World  
Championships seeking a record four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	She leaves with one gold, one bronze and a bad back.  
</P>
<P>
	Jones was carried off the track on a gurney Wednesday night  
after crumbling onto the track in agony during the semifinals of 
the 200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	An official statement from USA Track and Field said Jones  
suffered spasms and cramping in her lower back. Further treatment 
and tests were needed to determine the full extent of her 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	It's virtually certain that Jones won't be competing any more at  
these championships, and the rest of her season could be in 
jeopardy, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian sprinter Nova Pedris-Kneebone said Jones' absence, no  
matter how long, would have a severe impact on the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tragic,'' she said. ``In my eyes, she's the Wonder Woman  
of track and field. She's gained so much respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo, president of the International Amateur Athletic  
Federation, also was shaken by Jones' injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was deeply affected by the injury sustained by Marion Jones,  
and I am sure that millions of fans around the world share this 
sentiment,'' Nebiolo said. ``Marion Jones has become a symbol of 
all that is best in athletics: enthusiasm and the simple joy of 
competition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The championships started with so much promise for Jones as she  
retained her 100-meter title Sunday in a year's best time of 10.70 
seconds. But then she had to settle for bronze in the long jump, 
dashing her hopes for four golds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was the heavy favorite in the 200 and was going to run in  
a relay later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's race, she went down about 50 meters from the  
finish, clutching her lower back with her left hand and in extreme 
pain, her face contorted. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was put onto a gurney and rolled into the medical area  
with her husband, shot put champion C.J. Hunter, at her side. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors worked on Jones at the stadium for about 2 1/2 hours,  
before she walked out slowly under her own power without speaking 
to the media. Plans to take her to a hospital were scrapped and she 
returned to her hotel room, asking not to be disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Competing so often on the hard Mondo track, the physical strains  
of long jumping and the extreme heat and humidity all may have 
played a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a track built for one race,'' Emmanuel Hudson, manager of  
men's 100-meter champion Maurice Greene, said. ``It's not a 
practice track. Marion hadn't had a day off since the championships 
began (last Saturday). That's a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's been taking a beating on the track. It's for sure a long  
jump injury. Everyone forgets she's been training for the long jump 
all week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' injury overshadowed Wednesday's competition, highlighted  
by six finals. 
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Colin Jackson became Britain's first world  
or Olympic champion since 1993, winning the 110-meter hurdles with 
his season's best, 13.04 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, the 1993 outdoor champion, completed a sweep of this  
year's indoor and outdoor titles by outleaning Cuba's Anier Garcia, 
the runnerup at 13.07. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson said he wished he could have shared his victory with  
young Scottish hurdler Ross Baillie, who died suddenly on June 19 
from a nut allergy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved for Ross to have been here,'' Jackson said.  
``I can imagine how excited he would have been to be part of the 
whole package. 
</P>
<P>
	``For him to have trained with me right until the end and then  
watched the world championship gold medal run would have been just 
fantastic. I always feel that without him here there is a part of 
me that is missing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Czech Republic's Tomas Dvorak repeated as world champion in  
the decathlon, amassing 8,744 points -- 250 fewer than his world 
record -- in the tough, 10-event competition over two sun-baked 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Dvorak, who blamed the heat for his relatively subpar  
performance, beat silver medalist Dean Macey of Britain by 188 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles-Michael Friedek of Germany, who didn't decide to compete  
until Tuesday because of a heel injury, pulled a major upset in the 
men's triple jump, beating world record-holder Jonathan Edwards 
with the year's best leap, 57 feet, 8 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards finished third at 57-4 1/4 and called his performance ``a  
disaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The other winners were Cuba's Daimi Pernia, who took the women's  
400 hurdles with a world-leading 52.99 despite nearly falling after 
smashing the final hurdle; Germany's Astrid Kumbernuss, the 1996 
Olympic champion in the women's shot put, won her third world title 
with her season's best, 65-1 1/2; and Russia's German Skurygin in the 
men's 50-kilometer walk at 3:44:23.

<HEADLINE> White House Warns Against GOP Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican tax cut plan, if enacted, would  
squeeze future budgets to the point where it would force automatic 
cuts in Medicare and other basic federal services, the White House 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton also weighed in from his vacation home in  
Martha's Vineyard, saying the GOP's proposed 10-year, $792 billion 
tax cut would create ``an impossible budgeting problem'' requiring 
cuts of nearly 50 percent in everything from education programs to 
air traffic control to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House offensive was the latest salvo in the battle  
over the GOP tax cut package, which Republicans say Americans have 
earned and deserve and the president, saying it risks the nation's 
economic future, has promised to veto. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., responding to the White  
House Wednesday, said it was the president's budget that would have 
cut Medicare by nearly $12 billion this year. ``I can't understand 
why the president would want to stand between the taxpayers and 
well-deserved tax relief to keep the economy growing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House budget office on Wednesday released figures  
showing that in its first five years the GOP tax cut would, under 
balanced budget requirements set under previous budget acts, 
trigger automatic cuts of nearly $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House argues that, under the GOP tax cut, it will be  
impossible to meet future balanced budget goals without making 
unacceptable cuts to essential federal programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Office of Management and Budget Director Jack Lew said the  
report only looked at mandatory spending -- those entitlement 
programs that Congress must fund every year -- and not at 
discretionary spending that Democrats say would also face crippling 
cuts under the GOP tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope Congress will treat this report as something of a  
wakeup call,'' Lew said. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimated that the GOP plan would force automatic  
cuts, or sequesters, of $41.4 billion to Medicare in the 2000-2004 
period. It would effectively shut down the Agriculture Department's 
Commodity Credit Corporation and other crop insurance programs for 
farmers and kill veterans education, child support enforcement, 
social service block grants and other programs, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The OMB has fired a warning shot across Congress' bow,  
confirming all the dangers we have predicted since the Republicans 
passed their budget resolution in April,'' said Rep. John Spratt, 
D-S.C., ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats insist the GOP plan is unreasonable if Washington is  
to meet minimum future requirements to fund education and defense 
needs, pay down the national debt and secure the future of Social 
Security and Medicare. Clinton has said he would support a tax cut 
of about $250 billion, but only after those other goals are met. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a letter Wednesday addressed to Hastert and Senate  
Majority Leader Trent Lott, said the Republican plan would leave 
the nation permanently in debt and it would be ``irresponsible of 
me to sign'' it. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican Conference Chairman J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,  
countered that the OMB report ``clearly misled the American 
people.'' He said the Republicans were committed to safeguarding 
Social Security and Medicare while ``the White House wants to keep 
money and power in Washington because they believe that bureaucrats 
know best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House and Senate Republicans pushed through their tax bill in  
the final hours before leaving for their August vacation, but are 
waiting until after they return in September before sending it to 
the president for his veto. 
</P>
<P>
	During the August recess, House and Senate Republicans have  
scheduled more than 600 events around the country to promote the 
benefits of their plan, including reductions in income tax rates, 
lower estate taxes and an easing of the tax penalty on some married 
couples.

<HEADLINE> North Korea Economy Contracts Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's economy contracted 1.1  
percent last year, the ninth straight year of recession in the 
communist country, South Korea's central bank said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The contraction was smaller, however, than the 6.8 percent  
recorded in 1997, thanks to improved agricultural production. The 
North Korean economy contracted 3.7 percent in 1996 and 4.6 percent 
in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea's economy contracted 5.8 percent last year as it  
went through a serious financial crisis. But it is expected to grow 
by about 5 percent to 6 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea rarely releases economic figures, but has  
acknowledged in recent years that its economy is in trouble. South 
Korea compiles annual estimates on North Korea's economy with data 
obtained from the North's trading partners and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The North's economy began shrinking in 1990, when it lost most  
of its trade partners with the collapse of communism in the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea has been largely dependent on outside aid to feed  
its people since 1995, when its agricultural industry collapsed 
after decades of mismanagement aggravated by years of bad weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's report said North Korea generated 17.6 trillion won  
($14.7 billion) in gross national income during 1998, or about 4 
percent of capitalist South Korea's tally. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also said North Korea's trade with the world reached  
$1.44 billion last year, down sharply from $2.18 billion in 1997, 
largely because of the financial difficulties in Asia. The North's 
trade with South Korea shrank by 28 percent to $222 million in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea exported $560 million worth of goods last year but  
imported $880 million worth for a trade deficit of $320 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The report estimated North Korea's foreign debts at $12.1  
billion.

<HEADLINE> Man Must Share Lottery Winnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A man who had been separated from his  
wife for seven years when he hit a $16 million lottery jackpot must 
share his winnings with his former spouse, a court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Appellate Court upheld a divorce decree awarding  
Roxanna Panganiban $6,000 a month in support from her ex-husband, 
Alan Panganiban. 
</P>
<P>
	Panganiban was unemployed when the couple married in New London  
in 1979. They frequently received welfare in Connecticut until he 
moved out of the state in March 1985, according to court documents. 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1992, Panganiban won $16 million in the Powerball  
Lottery with a ticket he purchased in Delaware. 
</P>
<P>
	After finding out about his lottery windfall, Mrs. Panganiban  
filed for divorce. A Connecticut judge dissolved the marriage, 
awarding her sole custody of the couple's son and $6,000 a month in 
alimony for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Panganiban said the decree was inapplicable because he had not  
lived in Connecticut for several years. The appellate court 
disagreed, saying he spent most of his married life in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices said the lower court was right to consider the  
lottery prize in fixing the alimony amount.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Judge Cut Record $581M Verdict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A judge cut in half a record $581  
million jury verdict that stemmed from a case in which a man sued 
for being overcharged $1,200 for two satellite dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	The $581 million verdict outraged business interests and  
prompted the Legislature to put caps on punitive damage awards to 
curb ``jackpot justice'' in Alabama. Although he cut it down to 
$300 million, Circuit Judge Marvin Wiggins said the verdict was not 
unjust. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court recognizes the impact this type of verdict has on  
businesses, society and the judicial process,'' Wiggins wrote. 
``However, our system of justice commands this type of judicial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``One must wonder if the jury had returned a verdict in favor of  
the defendants, would there be such a roar to overturn it and grant 
the plaintiffs a just award,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendant, Transamerica Bank, formerly Whirlpool Financial  
National Bank, said it plans to appeal to the Alabama Supreme 
Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you award people that kind of money for this type of  
situation, what do you do for someone who lost an arm or a leg or 
has been seriously disabled?'' said Jimmy Gewin, an attorney for 
Transamerica. ``What kind of yardstick do you use to compensate 
those people? You'd have to use trillions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barbara Carlisle and her parents, George and Velma Merriweather  
of Greensboro, sued Whirlpool and Gulf Coast Electronics, 
contending the companies tried to gouge them for $612 each on the 
purchase of two $1,100 satellite dishes sold door-to-door in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	A sales person told the three they would have to pay $34 a month  
for three years, but the contract ran for 4 1/2 years, said attorney 
Tom Methvin, who represented the family. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors heard testimony that the company cheated thousands of  
state residents out of $8 million by getting them to sign credit 
card deals that required them to pay as much as 300 percent in 
interest, even though the advertised rate was only 22 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The damages awarded by the jury were the highest ever awarded in  
Alabama. Lawyers for the plaintiffs said even with the reduction it 
may still be the highest. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiggins' ruling stated that although the verdict was ``shocking  
and unexpected,'' it was appropriate given that the jury found 
Whirlpool engaged in a ``malicious predatory sales practice 
designed to target and take advantage of the poor, undereducated, 
elderly and African-American citizens of Alabama.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even reduced, the punitive damages were just over 100 times more  
than would be permissible under the legislation passed in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new law, the punitive cap for businesses with a net  
worth of over $2 million is the greater of $500,000 or three times 
compensatory damages, which compensate an injured party. That would 
make the new maximum punitive award in this case $2.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The new cap covers lawsuits filed after Aug. 6.

<HEADLINE> $31M Award in Asbestos Suit Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- The Florida Supreme Court upheld today  
a $31 million award against Owens Corning for an asbestos-related 
death saying the company showed ``blatant disregard for human 
safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the largest punitive damage verdicts ever in  
Florida. However, the amount is a fraction of the $1.2 billion 
nationwide settlement the Toledo, Ohio-based Owens Corning reached 
last year with people who said the company's asbestos-based 
products made them ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who sued Owens Corning, Deward Ballard of Aberdeen,  
Miss., died several months ago of the rare lung cancer he 
contracted because of exposure to Kaylo, the asbestos-contaminated 
insulation sold by the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard never expected to see the money, which a West Palm Beach  
jury awarded him in January 1997 on top of $1.8 million to 
compensate him for lost wages and medical expenses. At the time, 
Ballard said he only had 12 to 15 months to live. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to Ballard's estate, according to Tampa lawyer  
John Venable of Tampa. Ballard had said he would give whatever he 
wins to the Shriners Hospitals for Crippled Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Simms, a Washington lawyer for Owens Corning, said he had  
not seen Thursday's ruling and could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a pre-national settlement program case, and has since  
been resolved through the national settlement,'' said Tricia 
Ingraham, a spokeswoman for Owens Corning. ``The ruling ... wasn't 
a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Owens Corning sold Kaylo from 1953 to the mid-1970s. Ballard, a  
former electrician, said he'd been exposed to asbestos while 
working around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballard originally sued 22 companies that mined, manufactured or  
sold products with asbestos, including W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. of Boca 
Raton. He settled with all the companies except Owens Corning, 
which is based in Toledo, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4th District Court of Appeal in West Palm Beach upheld the  
$31 million award in April 1998, ruling that Owens Corning made a 
``purely economic decision'' not to warn its customers that 
exposure to Kaylo could cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's high court voted 5-1 to uphold the decision.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Owens Corning were down 68 3/4 cents to $28.81 1/4 in  
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Ryder, Presidents Teams At Firestone  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Sergio Garcia is paired with David Duval.  
Tiger Woods goes 18 holes with Jose Maria Olazabal. Phil Mickelson 
will get a first-hand look at Jean Van de Velde. 
</P>
<P>
	It may sound like a Ryder Cup preview, but the NEC Invitational  
is hardly that. 
</P>
<P>
	This isn't about playing for a flag. This is about playing for  
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The NEC Invitational makes its debut today at Firestone Country  
Club, the second of three World Golf Championship events worth $5 
million -- $1 million to the winner and a mere $27,000 for last 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	The only qualification to play is making the Ryder Cup or  
Presidents Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's the strongest field, the strongest 40 players  
you'll find in the world today,'' Ernie Els said Wednesday. ``These 
guys have competed against each other at match play. It's very nice 
to see the guys that played on all these teams play stroke play 
together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe it's nice for guys like Els and Colin Montgomerie.  
</P>
<P>
	The sight of them can only remind the Americans that they don't  
own either of the cups. Europe won the Ryder Cup at Valderrama two 
years ago, and the International team pounded them in Australia 
nine months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was a pretty good beating we gave them,'' Els said.  
</P>
<P>
	But then, that was the last thing on Woods' mind, nor was he  
looking at this week's tournament as a chance to make a statement 
about the Ryder Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just another stroke-play event,'' he said. ``Maybe it  
would be different if it was a three-way match kind of a thing. But 
since we're all here playing stroke play, it's very similar to what 
we play anyway, the World Series of Golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NEC Invitational replaces the World Series of Golf, a field  
of worldwide winners who gathered at Firestone every year since 
1976. But not every international player who qualified came, 
especially because it ran up against important events on the 
European tour. 
</P>
<P>
	That's not the case this year, perhaps because of the $5 million  
purse, or that it offers a chance to see Ryder Cup foes up close 
just a month before the matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of guys on the European Ryder Cup team, it will be their  
last event before they head out to Europe and come back,'' Greg 
Norman said. ``They want to leave America leaving the statement. 
And yet there might be some who say, `I don't really want to get 
too far in tune four weeks out.' 
</P>
<P>
	``But I definitely believe the players, as competitive as they  
are, will be going in with that attitude.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three World Golf Championship events, the NEC  
Invitational is the only one that doesn't rely on world rankings or 
money lists. 
</P>
<P>
	That explains why Frank Nobilo (157th on the PGA Tour money  
list) and Andrew Coltart (No. 69 in the world ranking) are at 
Firestone this week and Chris Perry (11th on the money list) and 
Steve Stricker (No. 27 in the world ranking) are not. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem points out that only  
the top players can make the Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup teams. 
The International team is determined by world rankings, the U.S. 
teams on top-10 finishes (Ryder Cup) and money list (Presidents 
Cup), and Europe on earnings over a 12-month period. 
</P>
<P>
	The result?  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know of any other years if you had a stronger field  
than this one,'' Olazabal said. ``They prove they are really good 
and consistent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duval, the defending champion, will try to become the first  
player to win back-to-back official events at Firestone since Jack 
Nicklaus won the PGA Championship in 1975 and the World Series a 
year later. 
</P>
<P>
	Olazabal, who shattered Firestone scoring records in 1990 with a  
61 and an 18-under 262, and Norman will try to become the first 
three-time champion on the 7,139-yard, par-70 course. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Mickelson, Tom Lehman, Davis Love III and Justin Leonard  
are among 19 players trying to win their first tournament of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to see some great golf here this week from a lot  
of very talented players,'' Els said. 
</P>
<P>
	And there will be a lot of money on the line for the one who  
plays the best.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices fell sharply today as the yen's  
strength battered export-oriented shares. The dollar dipped against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 188.87 points,  
or 1.06 percent, to finish the day at 17,666.29. On Wednesday, the 
average closed down 240.25 points, or 1.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.06 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.26  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 111.14 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export issues hurt by a resurgent yen led a  
steep tumble on the main index. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts companies with large markets abroad because  
it tends to make Japanese goods more expensive overseas and lowers 
the value of their dollar earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
finished at a record high 11,326.04 points, up 42.74, or 0.4 
percent. U.S. stocks shot up on investor confidence that the 
American economy can continue to grow without high inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 13.72 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,481.08. 
The TOPIX closed down 12.27 points, or 0.81 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 549.80 million shares, down from 650.14 million shares 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 837 to 355 on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while 123 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar started higher from its New  
York level after an overnight rally in U.S. Treasury bonds and the 
robust showing Wednesday on Wall Street attracted investor interest 
in the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback slipped again as investors remained bullish  
about the prospects for a Japanese economic rebound. The dollar was 
supported by the Nikkei's turn into negative territory, but dealers 
said the trend of overseas investment in Japanese stocks hasn't 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 110.76 yen and 111.23 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.72 yen, down  
from 116.84 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.9450 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.9950 
percent, driving its price up to 99.62 yen from 99.20 yen.

<HEADLINE> Conviction in 'Jenny Jones' Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man who killed a gay acquaintance who  
had revealed a crush on him during a ``Jenny Jones Show'' taping 
was convicted of murder Thursday for the second time in a case that 
threw a spotlight on daytime TV's titillating fare. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury rejected the crime-of-passion defense of Jonathan  
Schmitz, who three days after the taping in 1995 shot Scott Amedure 
at his trailer home and then called police and confessed. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, 29, could get life in prison at sentencing Sept. 14.  
</P>
<P>
	As the verdict was announced, Schmitz hung his head, stared down  
and clasped his hands under his chin. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury deliberated less than three hours over two days, asking  
at one point to see a suggestive note, with a blinking construction 
light attached, left by Amedure on Schmitz's door the night before 
the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure, 32, revealed his crush on Schmitz on a ``Jenny Jones''  
segment titled ``Same-Sex Secret Crushes.'' As the audience whooped 
with delight, Ms. Jones elicited Amedure's whipped 
cream-and-strawberries fantasy involving Schmitz. Amedure put an 
arm around Schmitz, who turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz, who has said he is heterosexual, later claimed he was  
humiliated. He said he had been led to believe that the secret 
admirer he was going to meet on the show would be a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict Thursday marked the third time a jury has considered  
who was responsible for the slaying, which led to debate over 
ambush tactics sometimes used by talk shows like Jones'. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted of murder in 1996 and sentenced to 25 to  
50 years in prison, but the verdict was overturned on appeal 
because of errors in jury selection. Then, last April, a jury in a 
lawsuit brought by Amedure's family ordered the producers of ``The 
Jenny Jones Show'' to pay $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, Schmitz's defense was not allowed to bring up his  
history of depression and attempted suicide as a factor in the 
killing. Schmitz's attorney, Jerome Sabbota, also did not blame the 
show, nor did he call Ms. Jones to testify as she did in the other 
trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Sabbota sought a lesser verdict of manslaughter, arguing that  
Amedure continued to pursue Schmitz ardently after the taping of 
the show to the point that Schmitz ``lost all reason.'' The show 
never aired. 
</P>
<P>
	Amedure ``never let up and he never backed off. He created a  
situation when any reasonable person would have snapped,'' Sabbota 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Donna Pendergast told the jury that Schmitz  
overreacted to mere embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only reason that murder is an issue is that Scott Amedure  
was gay and (Schmitz's) manhood, so to speak, was insulted on 
national TV,'' she said. ``Well, you know what? Get over it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juror Kimberley Manney agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``If he was gay and a woman had approached him that way, would  
it have been right for him to kill her because she put a note and a 
flashing light in his door?'' she said after the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Other jurors said the delay between the taping and the killing  
ruled out a crime of passion. ``There was just way too much time 
involved for a reasonable person to make some choices,'' said juror 
Bruce Sole.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybean Futures Retreat / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures retreated Thursday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after separate reports indicated ample 
supplies in storage are not being sold ahead of what are expected 
to be relatively large fall harvests. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans led the losses after the U.S. Census Bureau reported  
the amount of beans crushed into meal and oil in July came in below 
estimates, at 127.396 million bushels. And the U.S. Agriculture 
Department reported sales for the previous and upcoming crop came 
in at a total 460,500 metric tons -- slightly below market 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	The figures helped take the steam out a market that in the past  
few months has surged ahead because of drought in some major 
growing areas. Recent rains are expected to have reversed some of 
the potential losses, and both the government and analysts still 
expect farmers to harvest a record-large crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were pressured by the U.S. Agriculture  
Department's report this morning that showed net weekly export 
sales of 987,300 metric tons, with net cancellations of 250,400 
metric tons. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors had been expecting sales of about 1.2 million metric  
tons as the buying season picks up. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by projections of a large Canadian  
wheat harvest, which will compete with the U.S. crop for export 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 3 cents to $2.83$ a bushel;  
December corn fell 4 cents to $2.15 3/4 a bushel; December oats fell 
1 1/4 cents to $1.14 a bushel; November soybeans fell 8 3/4 cents to 
$4.66 3/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while  
pork futures continued their slide amid perceptions there are 
enough supplies in storage to keep meatpackers from buying more 
hogs to slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
	October live cattle rose .90 cent to 66.35 cents a pound;  
October feeder cattle rose .62 cent to 79.17 cents a pound'; 
October lean hogs fell 1.05 cents to 45.15 cents a pound; February 
pork bellies fell 1.60 cents to 58.40 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Russia To Sell Part of Gazprom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government will sell 3.37 percent of  
Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer and the country's 
biggest of tax revenue, an official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as the government won an extra seat on  
Gazprom's board, after an extraordinary general meeting in which 
shareholders disbanded the board of directors and elected a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Russian media outlets had reported in recent weeks that  
a group of Kremlin advisers known as ``The Family,'' said to have 
strong influence over President Boris Yeltsin, was seeking to win 
control over Gazprom's billion-dollar cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now has five of 11 seats on the board of Gazprom.  
The remaining six seats are controlled by Gazprom executives and 
allies of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Former prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a Yeltsin ally,  
retained his position as chairman of the Gazprom board. Rem 
Vyakhirev, who oversees 35 percent of the company on behalf of the 
government, also retained his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently owns 38.37 percent of the company,  
which contributed a fifth of the government's tax income revenue 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin signed a decree in July fixing government ownership at  
35 percent. State Property Minister Farit Gazizulin announced 
Thursday that the government is planning to sell the other 3.37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazizulin, one of the government's representatives on the  
Gazprom board, provided no further information about the sale, such 
as whether foreign investors will be allowed to bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will remain the company's largest shareholder.  
The rest of the shares are held by Gazprom itself and by private 
investors. German gas giant Rurhgas is the largest foreign 
shareholder, with 4 percent of Gazprom stock.

<HEADLINE> CDC: TB Cases Decline Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The number of new tuberculosis cases in the  
United States dropped 8 percent last year, marking the sixth 
straight year of decline, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said there were  
18,361 cases of TB last year, down from 19,851 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	TB cases have dropped 31 percent since 1992, the height of a TB  
resurgence in the United States that was blamed on states cutting 
back on anti-tuberculosis efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC has attributed the six-year decline to new programs that  
seek out people with tuberculosis, diagnose them and make sure the 
patients take their full course of therapy, which can last six 
months or longer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're moving in the right direction, but we need to pick up  
some speed if we're going to reach our goal, which is TB 
elimination,'' said Amy Curtis, a CDC epidemiologist. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 TB rate was 6.8 cases per 100,000 people, compared with  
7.4 per 100,000 in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the government warned that between 1993 and  
1998, 45 states and the District of Columbia reported cases of 
drug-resistant TB.

<HEADLINE> Norplant Makers Offer Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The maker of Norplant will pay a reported  
$50 million-plus to more than 36,000 women to settle claims that 
the implantable contraceptive device caused headaches, irregular 
menstrual bleeding, nausea and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products Corp., the parent of Norplant maker  
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, called the move to end five years of 
litigation ``purely a business decision.'' It did not admit any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	The company Thursday would not specify the amount of the  
settlement, but lawyers told The Dallas Morning News that American 
Home will pay $1,500 to every woman who sued before March 1, adding 
up to more than $54 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement would resolve cases consolidated before a federal  
judge in Texas. It covers most of the thousands of lawsuits filed 
against Madison, N.J.-based American Home over Norplant. It does 
not cover claims by hundreds of other women who had different types 
of injuries, including scarring from having the implants removed. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home, which also makes Advil pain reliever and  
Robitussin cough medicine, also must contend with thousands of 
lawsuits by former users of the fen-phen diet-drug combination, 
which plaintiffs say caused heart valve damage and a potentially 
fatal lung disorder. 
</P>
<P>
	A New Brunswick, N.J., jury is now hearing the first  
class-action lawsuit over fen-phen to go to trial. Earlier this 
month, a Texas jury awarded more than $23 million to a woman who 
said the drug caused serious heart problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that compared with the fen-phen litigation, which  
could force the company to pay billions, the Norplant settlement is 
insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has prevailed in most of its Norplant lawsuits,  
winning three verdicts, 20 summary judgments and the dismissal of 
about 14,000 claims. But Alex Zisson, an analyst with Hambrecht &AMP; 
Quist, said the company was wise to settle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you pit a woman against a big corporation in front of a  
jury, anything can happen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock fell $1.81 1/4 to $46 a share on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Norplant consists of six capsules inserted into the upper arm.  
They release a synthetic hormone into the bloodstream that prevents 
pregnancy for up to five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs said that American Home misled customers about  
the severity of Norplant's side effects, which include excessive 
menstrual bleeding, severe headaches, nausea, dizziness, mood 
swings and depression. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products and St. Davids, Pa.-based Wyeth-Ayerst  
consistently have denied wrongdoing and said the side effects were 
described in the product's labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1 million American women and 5 million women worldwide  
have used Norplant. Annual U.S. sales peaked in 1992 at $120.7 
million but slid to $4.4 million through November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Turner Branch, who negotiated the settlement for the  
plaintiffs, acknowledged that $1,500 is not a large award but said 
the women agreed to settle to ``be done with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Settling these cases was purely a business decision,'' Joseph  
M. Mahady, president of Wyeth-Ayerst, North America, said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our legal success has come at a steep price because lawsuits  
are time-consuming, expensive and have a chilling effect on 
research,'' Mahady said. ``Now that the courts have found these 
cases to be without merit, we can turn our attention back to 
providing contraceptive options for American women.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Decry Voucher Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Far-flung court rulings on school vouchers and  
abortion are stirring anger in the Republican presidential campaign 
over what one candidate calls ``judicial activism run amok.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Texas Gov. George Bush and rival Steve Forbes on Thursday  
attacked a judge's suspension of Cleveland's voucher program, a 
decision that affects a prime education reform favored by the GOP 
presidential field and many governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called the ruling a ``judicial overreach with serious  
casualties -- Cleveland's disadvantaged school children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans see a potential wedge issue against Democrats in the  
voucher flap because the program is designed in part to help poor 
inner city children attend private schools offering superior 
education. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats argue that vouchers would destroy the public school  
system and there are better ways to give parents a choice, such as 
charter schools, experimental institutions that receive public 
support but can operate independently of local school district 
rules. Critics of vouchers also say such programs unfairly favor 
religious schools with tax money. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case is not about the state imposing religion,'' Bush  
argued. ``This is about parents having the right to choose an 
appropriate school for their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was first to attack the voucher ruling and he went beyond  
that to decry a county judge's decision in Arizona forcing 
officials to provide for an abortion for a 14-year-old girl who was 
23 weeks pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``These cases are just the latest offensive examples of judicial  
activism run amok,'' Forbes said. He said they underscore the need 
to appoint judges who will respect the rights of parents and the 
unborn. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr., who made the voucher  
ruling, was appointed by President Clinton. Judge William Sargeant 
of Maricopa County Superior Court, who made the abortion decision, 
is a Republican and not a presidential appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, whose anti-abortion views have hardened since he ran for  
the GOP nomination in 1996, has said that as president he would 
appoint judges opposed to abortion rights. Among rivals for the GOP 
nomination, Bush has said he would not make abortion views a test 
for his judicial appointments. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP candidate John McCain, recently accused by some  
conservatives of softening his anti-abortion stance, declined 
immediate comment on the abortion matter in his own state. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds like a tragic case,'' the senator said when asked  
about it while campaigning in San Diego. But he said he wanted to 
study the matter further before saying more. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes was not so reticent, calling the decision ``nothing short  
of infanticide.'' The state's Republican governor, Jane Hull, said 
the judge was acting in the perceived best interest of the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cleveland ruling came the week schools were opening, causing  
turmoil for the parents of some 4,000 pupils who have been using 
tuition vouchers paid for by taxpayers to go to private schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been unable to get a voucher pilot program through the  
Texas legislature. In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush, his brother, has just 
instituted the first statewide voucher program, a small one 
allowing students in the worst public schools to receive up to 
$3,389 to pay for private or parochial tuition.

<HEADLINE> Williams, Seles Advance At Pilot Pen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Now appearing at the net: Venus  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager with the blistering serve is finding new ways to  
punish opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	She blended strength with touch Wednesday to breeze into the  
quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Maria 
Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making a lot of good shots. I was actually coming to the  
net. It's a rare appearance to see me at the net. I'm going to 
really try to keep coming,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 127-mph serve is still tops on the women's tour. She hit  
only one ace against Sanchez Lorenzo and instead carved up her 
opponent with a crisp serve-and-volley game, showing a deft touch 
at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to hold back. I just want to go out there  
and hit the ball. I got passed a couple times and I'm not afraid of 
it,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 19, is seeded seventh and is looking for her fifth  
title of the year. She faces qualifier Magui Serna today. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Seles barely broke a sweat in her first set against Elena  
Likhovtseva, then had to hang on against the Russian for a 6-0, 7-6 
(8-6) second-round victory. She'll take on fifth-seeded Amanda 
Coetzer in a quarterfinal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Seles needed just 12 minutes to win the first  
set. But Likhovtseva found her touch and her legs in the second 
match, running down Seles' crosscourt returns and scoring on 
several drop shots.

<P>
	``I knew Elena is a fighter. I knew she would come out,'' Seles  
said. ``We could have gone to three sets very easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, seeded third and ranked fifth in the world, said her  
biggest advantage was ``not getting really frustrated when I let 
her back in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a permanent coach since her father, Karolj, died last  
year, Seles has turned to several people to work on her game. The 
most recent is former pro Jimmy Arias, who lives about 25 minutes 
from Seles in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can relate to a lot of things,'' she said. ``As a player,  
he knows so much about the game. He also knows how my dad worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania beat fourth-seeded  
Jana Novotna 7-6 (7-5), 6-0; Amelie Mauresmo of France beat 
sixth-seeded countrywoman Julie Halard-Decugis 6-1, 6-2; Coetzer 
advanced when Sabine Applemans retired because of a stomach virus; 
and eighth-seeded Sandrine Testude beat Barbara Schwartz 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna has had few matches since the French Open, in which she  
sprained her right ankle. She attributed Tuesday's loss to a lack 
of matches, limited movement and ``a very poor variety of shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never gave her the opportunity to make a mistake,'' Novotna  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragomir saw things a bit differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good match, a lot of ups and downs,'' Dragomir said.  
``I think I won because I won all the important points.''

<HEADLINE> Spending by Japan Workers Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Spending by Japanese workers jumped a  
higher-than-expected 2.6 percent in July as consumer sentiment 
improves despite falling incomes, the government said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in spending from the same month last year was well  
above forecasts by economists surveyed by Dow Jones, who estimated 
on average that spending would have risen 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The average wage-earner spent $3,290 in July, the Management and  
Coordination Agency said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also said that income for wage-earners declined 4  
percent in real terms, while disposable income -- the amount people 
have left after paying taxes -- fell 2.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued improvement in consumer sentiment is compensating for  
the deterioration in wages, helping to buoy spending, said agency 
official Dairoku Yamabe. 
</P>
<P>
	The rise in overall wage earner spending stemmed mainly from  
higher expenditures in the cultural and entertainment sector and 
the transportation and communications sector, Yamabe said.

<HEADLINE> Padres Claim $6.9 Million in Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Despite reaching the World Series for the first  
time in 14 years, the San Diego Padres claimed Thursday they had a 
net operating loss of $6.9 million last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The club also said its cash shortfall exceeded $16 million, an  
amount majority owner John Moores and his family, and Larry 
Lucchino, the president and a minority owner, had to borrow and-or 
contribute to pay the club's bills. Moores and Lucchino have put 
$65 million into the team since buying it on Dec. 21, 1994, the 
team said. 
</P>
<P>
	The team said its financial statements, audited by  
PriceWaterhouseCoopers, showed revenue increased from $59 million 
to $79 million, thanks to record-setting attendance of 2.56 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Expenses rose from $67 million to $86 million, primarily due to  
a $15 million increase in player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It says a lot about baseball,'' Moores said. ``We obviously  
did not factor that (winning the pennant) into our business plan. 
We had a lot of extra revenue from the playoffs and still lost a 
ton of money. I think most fans shouldn't care and I don't think 
they do, but it speaks a lot about the terrific competitive 
imbalance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres began 1999 without many of the high-priced stars who  
helped get them to the World Series, but their payroll remained 
about $48 million, not including benefits. Even though the team 
might approach or exceed 1998's attendance figure, it expects its 
losses for this year to be greater. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guarantee you it will get worse,'' Moores said. ``Again, the  
only thing Joe Sixpack cares about is competitive balance. That's 
the root of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres got back into contention after an awful start, but  
have plunged back to the bottom of the NL West. In addition, the 
Padres lose the right to sell advertising at Qualcomm Stadium to 
the NFL's Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, 1998 was the last year of expansion revenue, with the  
Padres receiving $2.3 million. ``Without that our losses would have 
been higher,'' Lucchino said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Padres expect to increase their revenue with the scheduled  
opening of their new downtown ballpark in 2002. But Moores said 
that won't solve all their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ballpark ``is necessary to have a chance at being  
competitive,'' Moores said. ``Our real bet is enlightened self 
interest on the part of other clubs, or the union, which ought to 
understand the fans really do care about competitive unbalance, and 
(commissioner) Bud Selig, who I think understands the problems of a 
small market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the net operating loss, the cash shortfall was  
increased in 1998 by ``below the line'' expenses such as interest 
on debt carried by the club, investments in the new ballpark 
project, the campaign for the new ballpark and typical balance 
sheet cash/accrual differences, the team said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Padres didn't include the tax benefits owners of a  
team get. After buying a team, owners can write off many of the 
acquisition costs over a five-year span.

<HEADLINE> MetLife Buying General American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. will acquire  
the troubled General American Life Insurance Co. and its 
subsidiaries in a deal worth $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced Thursday means a resolution to the liquidity  
crisis that has threatened General American since late last month, 
when Moody's Investors Service lowered its ratings of the insurer's 
debt and 37 big institutional investors, mainly pension and money 
market funds, demanded repayment totaling $5 billion from General 
American contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	General American was known to be seeking a merger partner as its  
liquidity problems worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife, based in New York, is the nation's second-largest  
insurance company, with $357 billion in assets. It dwarfs General 
American's roughly $30 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	``This acquisition is in the best interest of our policyholders,  
associates, agents, brokers and the communities in which we 
operate,'' said Richard A. Liddy, chairman and chief executive 
officer of General American. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the merger agreement, proceeds from the transaction will  
be deposited into escrow and ultimately will be distributed to 
General American policyholders. MetLife also intends to resolve 
General American's current cash-flow problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction has been approved by the MetLife and General  
American boards and must also be approved by the Missouri Director 
of Insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	MetLife said it would keep General American's headquarters in  
St. Louis, where General American has 3,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Moody's lowered its ratings of General American after ARM  
Financial Inc. decided to withdraw from an insitutional funding 
business the two companies shared. With the ratings drop, funds 
that are required to invest in highly-rated debt began withdrawing 
their investments. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 10, as the withdrawal orders mounted, General American  
said it would not be able to meet the institutions' demands. The 
company began operating under the supervision of Missouri 
regulators.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Creeps Toward the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis strengthened as it crept  
up on the Bahamas Thursday, sending residents scurrying to grocery 
stores to stock up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday morning, Dennis was expected to come within 40 miles  
of the Bahamas' Eleuthera Island, a 110-mile-long strip of pink 
sand that 8,000 people call home. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember Hurricane Andrew here from 1992, so  
we're keeping an eye out for it,'' Eleuthera hotel owner Harcourt 
Cambridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bahamian capital, Nassau, boats were hauled out of the  
harbor, and the governor general's official residence was boarded 
up. One resident, 25-year-old Brian Deal, said he had bought lumber 
to cover his windows but was waiting to see how the storm would 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected a weather system moving east across the  
United States to force Dennis away from Florida. The National 
Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis might never hit land. But it 
also could turn and strike near South Carolina as early as Sunday, 
when it could be packing winds up to 109 mph, said forecaster 
Robert Molleda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the  
coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75  
mph. At 5 p.m. EDT Thursday, its maximum winds were up to 80 mph 
with hurricane force winds extending 45 miles from its center. The 
strongest were in the northeast quadrant facing open seas. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was stalled about 40 miles east-northeast of San Salvador  
and 210 miles east-southeast of Nassau. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters predicted the storm would strengthen as it continued  
at about 7 mph on its west-northwest course. 
</P>
<P>
	As Dennis advanced, Bahamian authorities put the central Bahamas  
and some northwest Bahamian islands on hurricane warning and the 
rest of the northwest on hurricane watch. Some officials said they 
feared residents were being complacent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Club Eleuthera Resort said it was considering chartering an  
airplane to fly 180 Italian guests to a sister resort in Cuba if 
the storm worsened. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the guests are a little nervous because they've heard  
all the stories about hurricanes, but we've told them not to worry 
at this point,'' manager Shawna McCarthney said . 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nearby storms posed little threat Thursday,  
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southeast Caribbean, though, two wooden houses in  
Barbados were torn down Thursday morning by winds that the Barbados 
Meteorological Office said could have been associated with Tropical 
Storm Emily, even though it was more than 200 miles away and likely 
to dissipate offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything in my house is damaged, my house flat on the  
ground,'' Etheline Forde, a farm laborer, said at the ruins of her 
Atlantic Oceanside home on eastern Peak Bay.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Screenwriter and playwright Norman Wexler,  
whose work included ``Saturday Night Fever'' and ``Serpico,'' died 
Monday after suffering a heart attack. He was 73. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harvard College graduate wrote movies and plays that exposed  
life's grit. In 1970, he earned his first Oscar nomination for the 
movie ``Joe,'' starring Susan Sarandon and Peter Boyle, about a 
racist factory worker and his search for a businessman's hippie 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexler earned more praise for ``Serpico'' in 1973, a screenplay  
based on the true story of a New York cop's battles against 
corruption in the police department. 
</P>
<P>
	His blockbuster ``Saturday Night Fever,'' nominated for an  
Oscar, explored the life of a store clerk, played by John Travolta, 
who submerged himself in the world of disco. 
</P>
<P>
	In his later career, Wexler tallied a few flops, including  
``Stayin' Alive,'' the sequel to ``Saturday Night Fever,'' and 
``Raw Deal'' starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexler, who suffered from manic depression, was arrested by the  
FBI in 1972 after he said he planned to shoot President Nixon.

	Wilson was executive vice president of the Billy Graham  
Evangelistic Association from its founding until 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1950, while serving as business manager of Northwestern  
College in Minneapolis, Wilson helped Graham -- then president of 
the college -- incorporate the evangelical association, which serves 
as headquarters for Graham's crusades. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson also served as president of the Minneapolis Children's  
Heart Fund, chairman of the board of Prison Fellowship in 
Washington, D.C., and vice president and director of the Bank of 
Minneapolis and Trust Co.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal O'Connor Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cardinal John J. O'Connor, who has been  
suffering from nausea and weakness, was hospitalized for a second 
day Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cardinal was expected to remain at Memorial Sloan-Kettering  
Cancer Center at least until Friday. Whether he will be released 
before the weekend ``to some degree depends on how the tests go,'' 
spokesman Joe Zwilling said. 
</P>
<P>
	``His mood remains good and upbeat,'' Zwilling said.  
</P>
<P>
	The hospital declined to discuss specifics. Zwilling called the  
tests routine. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor suffered a bout of flu and pneumonia over the winter,  
and had surgery for an enlarged prostate in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Connor, who will turn 80 in January, reportedly has told  
priests he plans to retire by 2000. Church law prohibits cardinals 
from voting for a new pope or holding certain church offices after 
age 80. O'Connor has been cardinal since 1985.

<HEADLINE> Fed Rate Decision Wasn't Unanimous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's decision to raise  
interest rates for the first time in two years wasn't unanimous: 
One Fed policy-maker dissented on the grounds that the move wasn't 
needed to keep inflation under control, according to minutes of the 
June 30 meeting released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McTeer, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas  
and a member of the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, was 
the sole opponent of Fed's June 30 decision to raise the federal 
funds rate -- the interest that banks charge each other on overnight 
loans -- by a quarter of a point to 5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine voting members, including Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan,  
supported the decision. Alice Rivlin, who at the time was preparing 
to leave her post as vice chairman, didn't attend the meeting and 
didn't vote. 
</P>
<P>
	McTeer dissented ``because he believed that tightening was  
unnecessary to contain inflation,'' the minutes said. ``He noted 
that most measures of current inflation remain low and he saw few 
signs of inflation in the pipeline.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the view of most members, bumping up interest rates  
``represented a desirable and cautious pre-emptive step in the 
direction of reducing what they saw as a significant risk of rising 
inflation,'' the minutes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9-1 decision to bump up interest rates was coupled with a  
move by the Fed to switch its policy directive -- intended to signal 
future moves -- to neutral, from one leaning toward raising rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The record of the meeting showed that the decision to switch the  
directive to neutral was reached after considerable debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Some members were concerned that adopting a directive leaning  
toward a rate increase might be interpreted as an indication that 
the central bank was ``relatively certain that it would need to 
take further tightening action fairly soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other members raised concerns that a neutral directive ``could  
foster the misleading conclusion'' that policy-makers ``no longer 
believed a further adjustment to policy might be warranted at some 
point later this year.'' Those members ``saw the odds as reasonably 
high that further tightening would be needed before the end of the 
year to gain adequate assurance that inflation would be 
contained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, all nine members supporting the move to boost rates  
said they also could support the neutral directive because any 
misinterpretations by Fed watchers could be corrected in 
Greenspan's testimony to Congress in July on the state of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Fed announced its neutral directive on June 30, the  
markets rallied. Greenspan tried to correct the situation by 
sounding more hawkish in his appearance before Congress pledging to 
move ``promptly and forcefully'' to counter inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those remarks were taken as strongly signaling an August rate  
increase. On Tuesday, the Fed nudged up interest rates for the 
second time this summer by a quarter of a point. 
</P>
<P>
	The minutes for the Aug. 24 Fed meeting will be released Oct. 7.

<HEADLINE> Rodman: Lakers Will Want Me Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is sure the Los  
Angeles Lakers will re-sign him -- if they want to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``They ain't gonna win with what they've got, I'll tell you  
that,'' Rodman told the Orange County Register for today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Lakers haven't offered anything formal, the  
flamboyant athlete who has made headlines on and off the court with 
his antics says Lakers owner Jerry Buss checked in on him recently. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to see what's going on, that's all. Just to see where my  
head's at,'' Rodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what's going to happen. They're going to wait until the  
last minute, and it's going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers spokesman John Black said today he would not comment on  
Rodman's remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Rodman played for the Detroit Pistons, San  
Antonio Spurs and Chicago Bulls before joining the Lakers for a 
short stint last season. The Lakers waived him in April.

<HEADLINE> Ape Fossils Provides New Insight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A baboon-sized ape that lived in East Africa  
about 15 million years ago may have been among the first primates 
to leave the treetops and live on the ground, a key step in the 
evolutionary path that theoretically led eventually to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The fossilized partial skeleton of the animal is distinctly  
different from other ancient apes, prompting researcher Steve Ward 
and his colleagues to identify it as the only member of a new ape 
genus they call Equatorius. 
</P>
<P>
	Ward, a primate anatomy expert at Northeastern Ohio Universities  
College of Medicine in Rootstown, Ohio, is senior author of a study 
to be published Friday in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Hand, finger, arm and shoulder bones show strong evidence that  
Equatorius ``spent a lot of time on the ground,'' said Ward in a 
telephone interview. ``This is the first time that we see evidence 
of that in the fossil record of apes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He called this ``a very important finding'' in understanding the  
evolutionary steps leading eventually to modern primates that spend 
almost no time in trees and are able to walk upright. 
</P>
<P>
	Equatorius is not thought to be a direct ancestor of humans or  
of modern apes, said Ward. The animal probably was an evolutionary 
dead end, a species that disappeared after about 1 1/2 million years, 
but it provides important evidence of a poorly understood era that 
Ward calls ``the golden age of ape evolution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a large group of primitive apes that appeared in  
East Africa sometime before 23 million years ago,'' said Ward. 
``They exploded in an evolutionary sense into many, many genera and 
species.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Equatorius, said Ward, was a late representative of that era and  
was probably among the first to abandon the tree top home of 
earlier apes species. 
</P>
<P>
	Ape species around 10 to 14 million years ago moved from Africa  
into Europe and Asia where they initially thrived, but eventually 
most became extinct. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains of Equatorius were found in 1993 by a fossil hunter  
who discovered a single tooth projecting from a solid rock wall in 
the Tugen Hills of north central Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	Careful excavation of the site uncovered a jaw with more teeth,  
along with bones from the spine, arms, shoulders, wrists, fingers 
and hand. Ward said the specimen is the most complete ape skeleton 
yet found from a critical era of ape evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	Equatorius was about the size of an adult male baboon. Its arms  
and legs were of about equal length. Powerful gripping hands and 
feet suggest that although it spent much of its life on the ground, 
it was also adept at tree-climbing, said Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	At first it was thought the Equatorius specimen belonged in the  
genus of another ancient ape called Kenyapithecus. There are only 
small collections of fossils for this genus and experts thought it 
contained two species, K. wickeri and K. Africanus. 
</P>
<P>
	The sparse fossils from the two species were ``a mixed bag'',  
said Ward, and ``garbled the signals we were getting from the 
bones'' about that era of ape evolution. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said a comparison of the more complete skeleton of  
Equatorius makes it clear that K. Africanus really belongs in the 
new genus of Equatorius. 
</P>
<P>
	``By recognizing Equatorius for what it is, it helps us to  
understand a lot about the early ape evolution,'' said Ward. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now clear, Ward said, that Equatorius is more primitive  
and preceded K. Wickeri in evolutionary history by 1 to 1 1/2 million 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other paleontologists praised the new finding, but some are not  
ready to accept that Equatorius is in a different genus than 
Kenyapithecus. 
</P>
<P>
	``This discovery tells us much more about the diversity of  
animals from that period of ape evolution,'' said Eric Delson, a 
paleontology professor at Lehman College in New York and a 
researcher at the American Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	Delson said Equatorius is the most complete fossil collection to  
indicate that apes of that era lived on the ground. There have been 
suggestions from other fossils, but that evidence was only 
``fragmentary,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Delson said he is not persuaded that Kenyapithecus and  
Equatorius belong in separate genera. And, in any case, it is not 
clear if either of these ancient apes are part of the evolutionary 
lineage that led eventually to humans and modern apes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many theorists believe the primate lineage that eventually  
evolved into humans and modern apes arose from an unknown common 
ape ancestor sometime around 6 1/2 to 7 1/2 million years ago in Africa. 
However, very few African primate fossils have been found for the 
period from 14 million to 6 million years ago, a time Ward calls 
the ``Miocene gap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are the key fossils that we need to find,'' Ward said.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Death of 12-Year-Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- A man has been charged with murdering a  
12-year-old girl whose body parts were discovered by bicyclists 
last week in a drainage ditch on a rural island. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hefelfinger, 36, was charged Wednesday in the slaying of  
Shanna McIntyre, who had been reported missing Aug. 11 from her 
Norfolk home. He was being held pending an arraignment today. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors said Hefelfinger was a friend of the victim's family  
and a business partner with the girl's mother, Diane Taggart. 
</P>
<P>
	Police believe the girl was killed in Norfolk at least five days  
before pieces of her corpse were found. She disappeared early last 
Friday while her mother was out delivering newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cyclists found parts of the girl's body last Friday on Knott's  
Island, a Virginia Beach community of about 2,000 that straddles 
the North Carolina line. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery destroyed the serenity of the island, which has  
not been the scene of a murder in two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are shocked,'' resident John Cason said before the  
arrest. ``We've never locked our doors until this past weekend.''

<HEADLINE> Wis. Probes Convict's Job Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A murderer and child rapist known as the  
``Halloween Killer'' may have been discriminated against by a 
garbage hauling company that refused to hire him, a state labor 
official concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald Turner served 19 years of a 38-year sentence for the 1973  
murder and sexual assault of a 9-year-old Fond du Lac girl. She was 
snatched while trick-or-treating. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner filed a complaint with the state after he was rejected  
for a job sorting recyclables at a Waste Management center where 
children are given tours. Turner, 49, is unemployed and living at a 
state-run halfway house. 
</P>
<P>
	An investigator in July found there was enough evidence of  
potential discrimination to warrant a hearing before an 
administrative law judge. The hearing is scheduled for Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do the rights of a convicted murderer take precedence over  
those of a law-abiding business?'' said state Rep. Scott Walker. 
``The state should not force hiring decisions that belie the best 
interests of the employer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections spokesman Bill Clausius declined to comment on  
Turner, but said working is an important part of rehabilitating 
parolees. 
</P>
<P>
	``A job is important in stabilizing an offender, and it helps us  
keep track of where they are,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin is one of 10 states that bars employers from  
considering convictions when hiring, unless the crime is 
substantially related to the job -- so a child molester could be 
denied a job as a school bus driver, state spokeswoman Heidi Kafura 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the state investigation, Waste Management officials said that  
students and scout troops regularly tour the plant, and that the 
job would give Turner access to ``dangerous materials and weapons, 
used hypodermic needles, and BB guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But investigator Charles Phelan wrote in his report that Waste  
Management employs other people who had been convicted of battery, 
robbery and disorderly conduct who have access to the same 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
	Waste Management officials on Thursday would not discuss the  
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner's parole after half his sentence was served inspired the  
state's sexual predator law, which can extend sex offenders prison 
terms if there is a ``substantial probability'' they will commit 
another crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner was unavailable for comment Thursday. His attorney did  
not return telephone calls seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau would like to join the San Diego  
offense. He was impressive on the last day of Chargers training 
camp and turned in some of the best receptions. 
</P>
<P>
	On one, Seau, who is looking to play tight end this season,  
reached up for the ball Wednesday while falling backward and 
smacked his head on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Wideout Jeff Graham, a newcomer, and tight end Freddie Jones  
also had some nice grabs, ``but you'd like to put somebody else's 
name in there,'' coach Mike Riley said. ``We need some guys to step 
up. That's not a negative. We've made progress, but that's got to 
continue to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers wanted to improve their receiving corps during  
camp. In fact, that was the second part of their plan right behind 
cleaning up the mess at quarterback left by Ryan Leaf last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Things got worse when wide receiver Charlie Jones dislocated his  
left hip in an exhibition loss to San Francisco on Aug. 12. He's 
sidelined for eight weeks, meaning he'll miss at least the first 
four games. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers had said that Seau probably wouldn't make his tight  
end debut until the opener at Cincinnati on Sept. 19. The Chargers 
are off during the NFL's opening weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Seau might be lining up on offense in the final  
exhibition game at home against AFC West rival Kansas City on Sept. 
3. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, I'm getting some pressure from the inside on that,'' Riley  
said. ``He wants to play a little bit in the last game. I 
understand that. We'll make a decision on that later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seau isn't expected to play in Saturday night's game at St.  
Louis because it's on turf and he's been nursing an Achilles' 
tendon injury most of camp. The Chargers also expect to hold out 
running back Natrone Means. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Saints    	
</P>
<P>
	Tight end Cam Cleeland plans to miss all or part of the upcoming  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	An examination in Seattle showed some flakes left over from  
offseason bone-spur surgery, Cleeland said. Those flakes are 
causing swelling and irritation in his Achilles' tendon. 
</P>
<P>
	One recommendation has the Saints resting him until their off  
week the third weekend of the season and then making a decision on 
season-ending surgery. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Chiefs    	
</P>
<P>
	Offensive tackle John Tait, the 14th overall pick, might sit out  
the season and re-enter the draft next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait, who left BYU after his junior year, told The Salt Lake  
Tribune he would rather miss the 1999 season than sign a deal he 
considers undesirable. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas City reportedly has offered a five-year contract but Tait  
wants the right to cancel the final season if he meets incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Tait is one of two unsigned first-round picks. The other is  
tackle L.J. Shelton of Eastern Michigan, drafted 21st by Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
                            *Cardinals    	
</P>
<P>
	The Arizona Cardinals gave offensive lineman Ernest Dye a  
reserve non-football-injury classification. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals spokesman Paul Jensen said the team, while under no  
obligation, would continue to pay Dye's medical benefits, although 
it would no longer pay his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye and two teammates were returning to training camp Aug. 16 	
when they were injured in an auto accident. Dye's right arm was 
nearly torn off in the rollover and he may never regain full use of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Lions 	
</P>
<P>
	In another blow to the Detroit Lions' injury-riddled offensive  
line, tackle Aaron Gibson will have season-ending surgery on his 
left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. James Andrews, an Alabama-based orthopedist, evaluated  
Gibson after the Lions put the 6-foot-4, 380-pound rookie through 
two weeks of rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to have surgery,'' coach Bobby Ross said. ``He's  
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's believed that Gibson injured the shoulder prior to being  
drafted out of Wisconsin in April. Surgery is scheduled next week. 
</P>
<P>
                              *Giants    	
</P>
<P>
	Left guard Lance Scott is going have to wait 4-6 weeks before  
doctors decide whether he needs surgery on his sprained right knee. 
</P>
<P>
	An MRI showed that Scott partially tore the medial collateral  
ligament in practice on Tuesday, and stretched the anterior 
cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, who also was the Giants snapper, will rehabilitate the  
knee over the next 4-6 weeks. He will be examined by Dr. Russell 
Warren, the Giants orthopedic surgeon, after that to see if the ACL 
needs to be repaired.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Replaces Fabregas With Castro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Florida Marlins released catcher Jorge Fabregas  
on Thursday and replaced him with Ramon Castro, who will make his 
major league debut Friday at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Fabregas hit .206 with three home runs and 21 RBIs in 82 games.  
Castro was recalled from Triple-A Calgary, where he hit .258 with 
15 homers and 61 RBIs in 97 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro, 23, is considered a potential everyday catcher next  
season. He was acquired last year from Houston in a trade that sent 
reliever Jay Powell to the Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to see Castro,'' manager John Boles said. ``I want to  
find out if he can be a major league catcher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Castro will start the second game of Friday's doubleheader at  
the Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to look to next year,'' Boles said. ``We're  
going to be doing some other things, and this is the start. From 
now to the end of the season is one big audition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fabregas, a Miami native and a six-year major-league veteran,  
declined to comment on his release. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was shocked, and rightfully so,'' Boles said.

<HEADLINE> Rite Aid May Merge or Downsize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The rumored merger or downsizing of Rite Aid  
Corp. may be just the prescription the ailing pharmacy chain needs 
after a year of disappointing earnings and overaggressive growth, 
some analysts said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's third-largest pharmacy chain, whose stock soared 17  
percent Wednesday amid such rumors, has said it is discussing 
``possible corporate transactions that, if consummated, would be 
material.'' Rite Aid also postponed its analyst meeting to Sept. 22 
from Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Thursday, the stock closed down $1.50 at $21.37 1/2 on  
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been a lot of surprises on the negative side in the  
last year,'' said Philip Muldoon of Cleveland-based McDonald 
Investments. ``The earnings have been lower than people thought, 
and there have been questions about whether there was more to 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rite Aid has been shaken in the past year by disappointing  
financial performance. In March, it reported a 39 percent drop in 
fourth-quarter earnings -- from $119.7 million to $73 million -- that 
it attributed to a store-opening spree. The Camp Hill, Pa.-based 
company has more than 4,000 store locations in 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. lowered its ratings on Rite  
Aid's debt, because of declining profits and ``weak operating 
results.'' That came even though the company's first-quarter 
earnings increased 3.5 percent and were in line with analyst 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	And also in June, Rite Aid restated its earnings downward 9  
percent for the year ended Feb. 27, decreasing net income to $143.7 
million from $158 million. The decline reflected expenses not fully 
accounted for, relating to recent acquisitions, store openings and 
the closing of smaller stores. 
</P>
<P>
	The restated earnings also came as Frank Bergonzi, Rite Aid's  
senior vice president and chief financial officer, said he would 
retire this fall after 29 years with the company. Rite Aid did not 
offer a reason for his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have to do something, it's obvious,'' said Eric Bosshard,  
an analyst at Cleveland-based Midwest Research. ``This year they 
have seen a shortfall versus the earnings expected. They have a 
group of stores on the West Coast underperforming. So that's what 
the speculation is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rumors have included a possible merger with companies  
ranging from Walgreens, CVS, and Eckerd, pharmacy chains which rank 
in the top four nationwide, to more general merchandise stores such 
as Wal-Mart, Sears or Safeway, analysts said. Such mergers would 
probably face regulatory scrutiny and are less likely to happen, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very unlikely they're going to sell the whole company,''  
said Steven Valiquette, an analyst with Warburg Dillon Read. ``They 
are one of the three largest drug chains, so I don't think they 
will throw that away and try and do something different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Rite Aid will probably sell several hundred of its  
stores on the West Coast, a move which the company has hinted at in 
the past, Muldoon said. The spacious 30,000 square-foot stores were 
acquired from Thrifty Payless for $2.5 billion in 1996, and sales 
since then have been flat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Traditionally, the unit they operate is the traditional  
drugstore, about 12,000 square feet,'' Muldoon said. ``The West 
Coast version of a drugstore is significantly different. It's a 
bigger merchandise mix, more grocery-like in character. So you've 
got more dependence on the front-end, the non-pharmacy part of the 
business, and they've had problems with that.''

<HEADLINE>  Reno Promises To Find Truth on Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Upset and frustrated, Attorney General Janet  
Reno pledged Thursday that a new investigation of the Waco, Texas, 
siege will ``get to the bottom'' of how FBI agents used potentially 
flammable tear gas grenades against her wishes and why the bureau 
took six years to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no reason at this point to believe the FBI is  
responsible for the deaths of those people,'' Reno said of Branch 
Davidian cult leader David Koresh and some 80 followers who died 
during a fire that broke out as FBI tanks pumped tear gas into 
their compound outside Waco on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire episode -- which began 51 days earlier with a deadly  
shootout as federal agents tried to arrest Koresh on weapons 
charges -- has become a rallying cry for anti-government and militia 
movements across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno described herself as ``very, very troubled,'' ``very, very  
frustrated,'' and ``very, very upset'' by the FBI's admission 
Wednesday night that such devices probably were used nearby earlier 
that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno -- who learned about the use of the military-type tear gas  
grenades this week -- and other top FBI and Justice officials had 
denied such use for six years. 
</P>
<P>
	She ordered the new investigation late Wednesday, and FBI  
Director Louis Freeh assigned 40 FBI agents to re-interview 
everyone who was at the scene. Reno planned to discuss with Freeh, 
who is on vacation, whether an outsider should supervise their 
probe. Freeh became FBI director some four months after the siege 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	With Republicans in Congress moving toward new hearings on the  
siege, Reno told her weekly news conference, ``It is absolutely 
critical that we do everything humanly possible to learn all the 
facts as accurately as possible and make them available to the 
Congress and public.... I will not stop until I get to the bottom 
of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the probe would range beyond the use of pyrotechnic  
tear gas canisters and whether their use was covered up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will pursue any issue in question,'' including whether Army  
commandos played an improper role and, possibly, old allegations 
that agents fired shots, Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI's final assault to end the siege came just five weeks  
after Reno, a former state prosecutor in Miami, took office. Her 
national image and early popularity emerged from her plainspoken 
admission on television that day that she was personally 
responsible for ordering the assault that ended in so many deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she thought the FBI's reversal harmed her credibility,  
Reno replied, ``I don't think it's very good for my credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not embarrassed. I'm very, very upset,'' she said, but  
added, ``Anybody that says they never ... rely on information that 
proves to be inaccurate, I'd like to meet them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before I approved the plan, I made inquiry as to whether the  
gas or the devices used for conveying the gas were incendiary, and 
I was told they were not,'' Reno said. ``I was concerned about the 
possibility of fire started by such devices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As of Thursday, Reno said, ``All indications are that the  
(pyrotechnic) devices were not directed at the main wooden 
compound, were discharged several hours before the fire started and 
were not the cause of the fire.'' Independent investigators 
concluded cult members set the fires. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal law enforcement official who interviewed agents  
involved in firing the military-type tear gas said two shells were 
fired at the roof of a concrete bunker 30 to 40 yards from the main 
building and they bounced off it into an open field. An agent fired 
the two shells almost 180 degrees away from the wooden, main 
building and six hours before the fire began, said the official, 
who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Only nonpyrotechnic, civilian tear gas was fired into the main  
building, this law enforcement official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The information about the military-type shells came to light  
Tuesday when former assistant deputy FBI director Danny Coulson 
mentioned them to The Dallas Morning News. 
</P>
<P>
	Waco survivors and relatives had contended in damage suits  
against the government that flammable devices had been used. 
</P>
<P>
	The law enforcement official said Coulson's remarks prompted the  
FBI to check its files, and it found that some hostage rescue team 
members had confirmed the use of the military-type shells when 
asked by the FBI general counsel to respond to the lawsuits' 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	The general counsel got some of these answers as early as 1996  
or 1997, a Justice official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ricks, the FBI's chief spokesman during the siege, said  
Thursday he was shocked by the revelations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's inconsistent with the press statements that were made by  
myself and others,'' said Ricks, now Oklahoma's Commissioner of 
Public Safety. ``It looks like on its face they were trying to 
withhold something,'' he said of people in the FBI who provided him 
with information. 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin  
Hatch, R-Utah, said his panel ``will conduct an independent 
examination of this matter, and it is my expectation that hearings 
will be necessary.... The credibility of this Justice Department is 
at an all-time low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the House side, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the  
Government Reform Committee, said, ``No one is going to be 
satisfied with an internal Justice Department investigation.... 
Congress is going to have to conduct a thorough investigation.'' 
And House Judiciary Committee aides were reviewing the records from 
10 days of televised hearings in 1995 to determine whether more 
congressional investigation is necessary, spokesman Sam Stratman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Department of Public Safety Chairman James B. Francis told  
The Dallas Morning News that federal officials need to explain why 
members of the Army's secret Delta Force anti-terrorism squad were 
at the scene April 19. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Pentagon official said Army special operations officers  
early on offered advice on an FBI plan to end the standoff. Later, 
three military observers watched the final assault but had ``no 
operational involvement,'' said the official, who requested 
anonymity.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Examine Meteorite Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A rock that fell from the sky to land in a  
West Texas yard contained a remarkable surprise -- water from the 
far reaches of space. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers who opened the meteorite discovered tiny pockets  
of briny water, providing the first close look at water not 
originating on earth, according to an article in the journal 
Science. 
</P>
<P>
	``The existence of a water-soluble salt in this meteorite is  
astonishing,'' wrote R. N. Clayton of the University of Chicago, 
who was not involved the research on the meteorite. 
</P>
<P>
	While astronomers have long thought that water flowed through  
asteroids and other bodies formed at the beginning of the solar 
system, the meteorite's liquid cargo offered the first chance to 
actually study it in a lab. 
</P>
<P>
	The meteorite burned through the sky last year and was spotted  
by a group of boys in Monahans, Texas, who alerted scientists from 
NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	When the NASA team, including asteroid specialist Michael  
Zolensky, cracked open part of the meteorite at their lab, they 
found purple crystals of halite -- or rock salt -- that contained 
minuscule pockets of water with bubbles, which indicated that water 
flowed on whatever parent body spawned the meteorite. 
</P>
<P>
	Chondrite meteorites, such as the one found in Monahans, are  
thought to comprise some of the most primitive ingredients from the 
early period of the solar system, and the water in the crystals 
could date as far back as 4.5 billion years.

<HEADLINE> $100M Settlement in Wis. Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Five companies and two individuals will pay $100  
million to settle a lawsuit arising from a highway accident near 
Milwaukee that took the lives of six young siblings, the family's 
attorneys aid. 
</P>
<P>
	The children were killed when their minivan was torn open by a  
piece of truck metal on a Wisconsin interstate and caught fire. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Duane and Janet Willis alleged negligence and sued the  
truck driver, the trucking company that employed him, the 
manufacturer of their minivan and several other companies involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heartache will always be there, but we have the joy of the  
Lord -- and 15 grandchildren,'' Willis said Thursday as he held 
hands with his wife 
</P>
<P>
	after the settlement was announced.  
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago family was headed for a birthday party Nov. 8, 1994,  
when a mudflap-taillight assembly fell off a tractor-trailer in 
front of them and became lodged in the minivan's gas tank. Sparks 
from the assembly banging against the pavement touched off the 
gasoline, and flames engulfed the van, killing all six children. 
The oldest was 13. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the companies admitted fault under the settlement  
reached with seven of the nine defendants Thursday, Chicago 
attorney Joseph Power said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that the evidence that we gathered in this case and  
the experts that we hired were going to show a rather convincing 
case of misconduct on the part of the defendants,'' Power said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Guzman, the truck driver, has not been charged with  
wrongdoing in the accident. His insurers agreed to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those agreeing to the settlement was Chrysler Corp., which  
manufactured the family's 1994 Plymouth Grand Voyager. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other defendants -- Hanjin Shipping Co. and M&AMP;S Transport  
Inc. -- declined to take part in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a tragedy for the Willis family, and we express our  
sympathy to them, but there really isn't much you can say in a case 
like this,'' said Warren Marwedel, attorney for Transamerica 
Leasing Inc., a defendant.

<HEADLINE> Williams To Miss Time, Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- While injuries might be expensive when you're  
one of the NFL's No. 1 draft picks, that doesn't seem to bother New 
Orleans Saints running back Ricky Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams will miss Saturday's preseason game against Green Bay  
with what doctors call a ``high left ankle sprain'' suffered Aug. 
13 against Miami. Coach Mike Ditka said he expects Williams to be 
ready for the regular season opener on Sept. 12 against Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	But even if he isn't healthy for that game, Williams said  
Wednesday that he wasn't worried about his chances of meeting the 
goals in his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not at all,'' Williams said. ``Fourteen games, 16 games, it  
doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Heisman Trophy winner got an $8.8 million signing  
bonus, but earning the bulk of the $68.4 million available in his 
seven-year contract will require seven outstanding seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	This year alone, he would have to rush for more than 1,600 yards  
and score 24 touchdowns -- half rushing, half receiving. He would 
have to average 4.5 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's not all. The contract has 25 other performance  
targets worth $50,000 each, up to a $500,000 cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Rushing for 1,601 yards would earn Williams $1 million. That  
plateau has only been reached nine times in the NFL in this decade 
by five players -- Terrell Davis, Jamal Anderson, Barry Sanders, 
Emmitt Smith and Barry Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams owns 20 NCAA rushing records, including most rushing  
yards (6,279), all-purpose yards (7,206), highest average (6.2) and 
rushing touchdowns (72). He had 11 games in which he gained 200 
yards, and scored a touchdown in 33 games. But he may find life in 
the NFL tougher than his days at Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, only six NFL running backs averaged 4.5 yards rushing  
and only four had more than nine touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	If Williams plays in all 16 games, he will face five teams this  
season that allowed less than 100 yards a game rushing last season, 
including Atlanta, which had the second best run defense in the 
league. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints are the only team in the NFL that has not had a  
1,000-yard rusher in a decade. They had the worst running game in 
the league last year. 
</P>
<P>
	You might think Williams' early injury would give him and his  
agent, Leland Hardy, second thoughts about the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``The contract was done with the full knowledge that injuries  
happen,'' Hardy said. ``Ricky got best of both worlds with almost 
$9 million up front. That should hold him for a little while. Even 
if he never ran another down he's well-heeled at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Saints officials believe Williams will return to practice next  
week, and not miss any regular season games because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints finish the preseason game with Tennessee on Sept. 2,  
and open the regular season against the Carolina Panthers on Sept. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll start running next week,'' Ditka said. ``He'll probably  
play the Carolina game, not the Tennessee game. That's the 
timetable we have for him right now with the trainer and the 
doctor.''

<HEADLINE> Toys R Us CEO Resigns Abruptly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three months before the start of the  
all-important holiday shopping season, Toys R Us Inc. is looking 
for a new top executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Nakasone abruptly resigned Thursday as chief executive  
officer, effective immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Paramus, N.J.-based toy retailer named chairman Michael  
Goldstein as acting chief executive. Goldstein preceded Nakasone as 
the company's CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise announcement came eight days after the company  
reported disappointing second-quarter earnings and lost a major 
backer of its struggling Internet subsidiary, toysrus.com. 
Nakasone's departure also comes right before the kickoff of the 
Christmas season, the most important time of the year for toy 
retailers. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein said in a statement that Nakasone's decision was based  
on ``differing views regarding the direction of the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All I want to say is it's amicable,'' Goldstein said in an  
interview. Nakasone has not said what he plans for his future, 
Goldstein added. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's board of directors has organized search committee,  
which will immediately begin working with the executive recruitment 
firm Levy/Kerson to find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal is to have someone in place before the end of the  
year,'' Goldstein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company will continue implementing strategies developed  
under Nakasone, including the redesign of stores, retraining of 
employees to improve customer service -- a longtime complaint, 
Goldstein acknowledged -- and to establish itself on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of stumbles, there's no question about it,''  
Goldstein said. ``But our business is good and soon we will start 
to show some results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goldstein joined Toys R Us in 1983 as senior vice president and  
was named chief executive officer in 1994. He held that position 
until being named chairman in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Toys R Us said second-quarter earnings fell  
14 percent compared with the same period a year ago. The company 
pointed to costs associated with the development of toysrus.com. 
</P>
<P>
	The company had second-quarter earnings of $12 million, or 5  
cents a share, a penny short of analysts' expectations. Sales 
increased to $2.2 billion from $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's troubles were punctuated by its unseating last  
year as the nation's biggest toy chain by discounter Wal-Mart, 
which sells toys at cheaper prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to have a direction for the future, not for  
the past,'' said Jim Silver, publisher of The Toy Book, a New 
York-based trade publication. ``The way Toys R Us operated five 
years ago doesn't work in today's marketplace because of 
discounters like Wal-Mart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us is in the middle of a vast renovation of its stores,  
creating a brighter layout that is easier to navigate and adding 
more electronics and sporting goods items. The company said it 
remodeled about 80 stores in the second quarter and expects to have 
about 170 stores operating under the new format by the upcoming 
holiday selling season. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the retailer may have not gotten the new format,  
shepherded by Nakasone, off the ground as quickly as it needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I'm a board member, maybe I grew increasingly concerned  
about when I was going to start to get some signs of progress,'' 
said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst at Gerard Klauer &AMP; Mattison. 
</P>
<P>
	McGowan said Nakasone's departure was probably most related to  
the company's failure to develop a competitive strategy for its 
Internet business, toysrus.com. The retailer hasn't done much to 
distinguish itself online, such as offering discounted prices, and 
it hasn't dumped the same effort into marketing its site as its 
online rivals Amazon.com and eToys. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Toysrus.com lost its backing from Benchmark  
Capital, a Silicon Valley venture capital firm that helped bankroll 
such Internet successes as the online auction house eBay. 
</P>
<P>
	It also had to choose another executive to head the unit after  
University Games founder and CEO Robert Moog backed out of the job. 
The company has tapped veteran toy industry executive John Barbour, 
who officially starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toys R Us operates 1,472 stores; 705 toy stores in the United  
States, 438 international toy stores, including franchise stores, 
211 Kids R Us children's clothing stores and 118 Babies R Us 
stores.

<HEADLINE> Elvis Memorabilia on Display </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For all those Elvis lovers who didn't get a  
chance to tear at the King's clothes in person, an auction of his 
memorabilia will give them another opportunity for a piece of the 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
	A one-day preview was unveiled Wednesday, showcasing the bizarre  
(an ankle-length cape with studs) to the mundane (personal checks 
signed ``E.A. Presley''). 
</P>
<P>
	The treasures include olive-drab fatigues from Elvis' two-year  
tour in the Army, a black jumpsuit with lime-green leather yoke, 
and a 1956 white Lincoln Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	There's even a 6th grade report card showing ``A's'' in music,  
``D's'' in math and geography. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Tupelo, Miss., in 1935, Elvis Aaron Presley went on to  
record 130 albums or singles that went gold, platinum or 
multi-platinum. His hits included ``Heartbreak Hotel,'' ``Love Me 
Tender,'' ``Jailhouse Rock,'' and ``Blue Suede Shoes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But don't look for those shoes at auction.  
</P>
<P>
	The most valuable (and noteworthy) possessions remain safely  
ensconced at Graceland, Presley's mansion in Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	The auction begins next month on the Web site  
www.icollector.com, when the public can begin making bids. The live 
version in Las Vegas will be previewed beginning Sept. 28, and the 
auction is slated for Oct. 8-10. 
</P>
<P>
	Proceeds benefit Elvis Presley Enterprises, which will use the  
money to build housing for the homeless in Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Elvis -- who died Aug. 16, 1977, at age 42 -- was  
discovered, the Presley family lived for several years in a federal 
housing project in Memphis.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Brings Voice To Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) -- Several hundred South Carolinians sat in  
a stuffy warehouse, gobbling down mustard-based barbecue, hash and 
cole slaw and listening to an appeal to patriotism and military 
pride. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many Vietnam veterans here?'' state Rep. Jim Klauber asked  
as he introduced GOP presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain, a 
former Vietnam prisoner of war. ``How many Korean War veterans? 
World War II veterans? How many POWs? Please stand up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as the Iowa caucuses make farm policy loom larger in  
presidential politics than otherwise would happen, South Carolina 
brings concerns of its own to the campaign. Among them, in a state 
with more than 400,000 veterans, is military honor. 
</P>
<P>
	And the state's increasing role in picking presidential  
candidates is ensuring that those concerns get heard. South 
Carolina's GOP primary is positioned strategically after Iowa's 
caucuses and the New Hampshire primary and before the March 7 
cluster of caucuses and primaries, including New York and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's strategy for the GOP presidential nomination hinges  
heavily on gaining support from veterans and conservatives in South 
Carolina en route to the state's primary Feb. 19. The theory is 
that such a finish could derail Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republican candidates also have their eyes on South  
Carolina, mindful that its recent role as ``the gateway to the 
South'' has been expanded as primaries were jammed closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now it's the gateway to the whole ball of wax,'' said John  
Cavanaugh, a political scientist at the University of South 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	While most analysts see Bush as the favorite in the primary,  
some say his cautious stance on issues may leave an opening. Bush 
was finishing a two-day campaign swing in South Carolina Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush portrays himself as a compassionate conservative,'' said  
Ellie Litts, a GOP veteran in the state who attended the barbecue 
late last month. ``South Carolina people are concerned about the 
issues, the Second Amendment (protecting gun ownership) and 
pro-life, pro-family issues are very strong. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bush will neither take a position or waffles on positions that  
are important to the South Carolinians that I deal with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recent history in South Carolina would seem to favor Bush, whose  
father won here twice and who has the support of much of the 
Republican establishment, including Strom Thurmond, the senior U.S. 
senator. The four Republicans in the U.S. House delegation are 
split between McCain and Bush and some GOP state officials are 
backing other candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	While McCain is mounting a determined bid, veteran Republican  
organizer Warren Tompkins of Columbia says rallying South Carolina 
Republicans for Bush has been easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not seen the level of enthusiasm, not had the easy task  
of organizing for a candidate since Ronald Reagan in 1980,'' he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	If South Carolina was once key to a Southern strategy, it is now  
a key to national strategy because so many states, including big 
ones like California and New York, have primaries jammed together 
on March 7, Tompkins says. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with the Steve Forbes and Elizabeth Dole campaigns say  
they are paying attention to Southern states, but their efforts are 
more dictated by the primary calendar than by region. By the time a 
handful of Southern states hold primaries March 14, the nomination 
may be wrapped up. 
</P>
<P>
	In South Carolina, Bush draws not only from the GOP  
establishment but from those who have positive feelings about his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``His family background is a plus for him,'' said Ellen Davis,  
55, who works in a textile office near Greenville. ``There seems to 
be a steadfastness in how they live.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dole, the former Cabinet member and head of the Red Cross, has  
been in the state several times and her aides remind people that 
``she doesn't need a translator'' when talking to them. The native 
of neighboring North Carolina placed a respectable third in the 
Iowa straw poll Aug. 14. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina landed the South's leadoff primary before the  
1980 election when the late GOP consultant Lee Atwater and other 
state Republicans engineered the move to give a head start to 
Reagan. State Republicans have jealously guarded that early spot 
since then. 
</P>
<P>
	Some say it's appropriate for South Carolina, a relatively small  
state of almost 4 million, to lead the way for the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started the Civil War,'' said Rick Rockwood, 57, an  
engineer from Greer in South Carolina's upstate. ``Politics has 
always been a real strong interest in South Carolina.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chance for a jump start to the national ``Super Tuesday'' on  
March 7 is why McCain endured the scorching midsummer weather 
during his ninth campaign trip to the state. His bus crisscrossed 
the state past tobacco and soybean fields so he could appeal to the 
pride of veterans at packed lodges and American Legion halls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have a fight here,'' said GOP activist Litts, ``and  
it's not all sewed up.''

<HEADLINE> Arista To Release Prince Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just call him the artist who formerly shunned  
major recording labels. 
</P>
<P>
	Arista Records announced Wednesday that it will issue a new  
single from The Artist Formerly Known as Prince in late September. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Greatest Romance Ever Sold,'' will be followed by a new  
album in early November, called ``Rave Un2 The Joy Fantastic.'' It 
will be The Artist's first studio album affiliated with a major 
label since 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe I had to get out of the recording industry for  
awhile so that I could reclaim my artistry and become empowered by 
it again,'' the Artist said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The singer got out of a contract with Warner Brothers in 1995  
and after a brief period with EMI, began producing music on his own 
label, NPG Records.

<HEADLINE> Cunningham Faces Original Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Randall Cunningham faces his original team  
for the first time tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	And he's doing it as the starter for Minnesota after leaving  
Philadelphia in 1995 as Rodney Peete's backup. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham, who spent 11 seasons with the Eagles, sat out in  
1996 and returned to the NFL as Brad Johnson's backup a year later. 
When Johnson got hurt last year, Cunningham produced his best 
season ever, guiding the Vikings to the NFC championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smart and mature, that's my approach as the starter,''  
Cunningham said. ``I don't overwork myself because I'm 36 years 
old.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham may be the starter, but backup Jeff George is turning  
heads at Winter Park. In two exhibition games, he has completed 
15-of-16 passes for three touchdowns and no interceptions, running 
the offense to near perfection. 
</P>
<P>
	George's passer rating is 157.3 -- the highest possible rating is  
158.3. 
</P>
<P>
	But both men insist there's none of the animosity that's usually  
present between an incumbent quarterback and his ambitious backup. 
</P>
<P>
	``He should be starting somewhere in the NFL,'' Cunningham said.  
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Cunningham will do his best to see that doesn't happen in  
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham was 11-of-12 for 124 yards against Cleveland last  
week after a sputtering start against the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll play most of the first half against the Eagles, who seem  
just as excited about the reunion as Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randall can still move around back there and make things  
happen,'' Eagles cornerback Troy Vincent said. ``He's still very 
much of a threat and he has some great weapons to work with. The 
Vikings are going to look to light up the scoreboard. They have 
great receivers, a great running game and a big offensive line. We 
have to play well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia cornerback Al Harris said he's eager to test  
Cunningham and his tall trio of targets: Cris Carter, Randy Moss 
and Jake Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to playing against them. They have size  
and can really go up and get the ball,'' Harris said. ``They like 
to be physical, which is the way I like to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Eagles coach Andy Reid, whose team lost 10-7 to Baltimore  
and 10-9 to the New York Jets, agrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like playing a team like the Vikings,'' Reid said. ``They're  
a team that you like to measure yourself against. That's fine with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reid's quarterback rotation has Doug Pederson starting, top  
draft pick Donovan McNabb backing him up and Koy Detmer at No. 3 
now that Bobby Hoying has been sent to Oakland for a draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Cunningham will see a different defensive backfield than the one  
Reid normally employs. 
</P>
<P>
	With starting cornerback Bobby Taylor (ankle) out, free safety  
Brian Dawkins will start at nickel back in place of 5-foot-8 Allen 
Rossum, who isn't big enough to cover Minnesota's big receivers. Al 
Harris will start for Taylor and T.J. Cunningham will play free 
safety when Dawkins moves over. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green said Vikings right cornerback Jimmy Hitchcock  
(shoulder) will return to the lineup with Ramos McDonald moving 
back to the left side. Also, guard David Dixon, who had an 
offseason knee operation, will see his first game action along with 
Reed and receiver Robert Tate, both of whom separated shoulders in 
an Aug. 6 scrimmage.

<HEADLINE> Census Count May Have Missed Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The 1990 Census overlooked 4.5 percent of the  
children in Texas and more than 4 percent in several other states, 
costing those communities billions in federal aid, a youth advocacy 
group said Thursday. It is urging special emphasis on counting 
youngsters in Census 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids were missed at about twice the rate of adults'' in 1990,  
with minority children even more likely to have been overlooked, 
said William P. O'Hare of the Annie E. Casey Foundation's Kids 
Count Project. 
</P>
<P>
	The undercount rate was 4.5 percent in Texas, Florida, Louisiana  
and Mississippi, the worst in the nation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	His figures indicate Rhode Island came closest to counting all  
its youngsters, missing just 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Census Bureau earlier reported that about half of the  
4 million people missed nationwide in 1990 were children, O'Hare 
refined bureau data to calculate the rate for each state. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationally, the 1990 undercount was 1.6 percent for all ages,  
3.2 percent for those 17 and under. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau expects it to be even more difficult to count  
children next year because the population includes more minorities, 
more foster children, more children in unstable living arrangements 
and more non-English-speaking families, O'Hare said. 
</P>
<P>
	Census numbers are used to determine how much federal money each  
state should get for a variety of programs. O'Hare noted that the 
General Accounting Office -- an investigative agency of Congress -- 
has estimated that the undercount cost Texas $1 billion and 
California perhaps $2 billion over the course of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare noted that in 1998, Census data were used in distributing  
$3.7 billion for foster care programs, $3 billion in women's 
infants and children's food programs, $3.2 billion for special 
education and $1 billion in block grants for child care 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	Also affected are funds for such things as school lunch  
programs, Head Start classes, school construction, hiring teachers, 
establishing local day care and public transit programs for 
parents, said Jacqueline J. Byers, director of research for the 
National Association of Counties. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the children are missed, how will we know they're there so  
we can target the programs?'' asked Byers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Henderson of the National Education Association said  
failing to count children results in overcrowded classrooms: ``If 
we don't know how many children live in a community, we cannot 
provide adequate school facilities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both urged parents, teachers and others to stress the need for  
cooperation with next year's Census so everyone, including 
children, will be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	The bottom line, said Terri Ann Lowenthal of the Census 2000  
Initiative, is that because of the undercount, billions of dollars 
are misdirected away from states and communities that need it. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Hare, whose group advocates for children, said there are many  
reasons children are missed more often that adults. Foster children 
may not be listed on a temporary caregiver's census form, divorced 
parents may each think the other listed the children on their 
census form, grandparents may not include children staying with 
them, many immigrant families fear providing information to the 
government and many worry the landlord will learn how many people 
are in one apartment. 
</P>
<P>
	Census day is next April 1 and the project has been mired in  
political wrangling over how it will be done. The Supreme Court 
ruled in January that a direct count must be conducted for purposes 
of redistributing seats in the House of Representatives among the 
states, but said modern statistical methods should be used to 
produce more accurate counts for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
	That means there will be two sets of numbers produced, boosting  
the count's cost from the previous estimate of $4 billion to as 
much as $6 billion, Census officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Establishment of some 500 local offices is already under way, as  
are recruiting efforts for the estimated 860,000 temporary workers 
who will be hired to make the count.

<HEADLINE> Rain Stops Commuters in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of commuters found it  
nearly impossible to get anywhere Thursday morning after a 
rush-hour rainstorm deluged highways, subways and walkways. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was like a river running by the train. The rails were  
covered,'' said Tom MacDonald, who was stuck in the Bronx six hours 
after having stepped on the train in Darien, Conn. for his job in 
Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	The commute usually takes about 45 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wasted day,'' MacDonald said. ``I'll go home and pick  
up my work day at home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Commuter rail service to suburbs north of the city came to a  
standstill at about 8:30 a.m., the height of rush hour. Some 
service was restored at 3:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Only about half of the Metro North railroad's 125 morning rush  
hour trains, which carry about 105,000 people a day, made it into 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the mercy of mother nature,'' Metro North spokesman  
Dan Brucker said. ``The full-moon has brought the high tides and 
flooded the Harlem and Bronx rivers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some trains got stuck in up to 4 feet of water in the Bronx;  
diesel engines were sent to tow them to the nearest stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The wait was just as bad from Grand Central station in Manhattan  
on Thursday night. One family spent their time playing cards on the 
marble floor of the station's main waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just waiting to hear if it's going,'' said Margie Long,  
who was with her two nephews and a niece. Moments later, their 
train was announced and they grabbed up their knapsacks and headed 
for home. 
</P>
<P>
	The Long Island Rail Road, which has elevated tracks on many of  
its lines, reported no delays. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had three inches of rain and millions of people could not  
get to work on time at all. Unbelievable,'' groused City Council 
Speaker Peter Vallone. ``The largest city in the nation with the 
largest subway system in the world cannot handle three inches of 
rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Subway service was especially hard-hit. Water cascaded into  
tunnels, slowing or stopping subway trains. 
</P>
<P>
	Diane Miller was near tears at 72nd Street and Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't know what to do,'' she said. ``I tried getting on  
the bus but it was too crowded and the driver turned me away. And 
there's no cabs to be found.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Londoners Becky Hanks and her mother Liz were dismayed to find  
cabs all full after being unable to get to Pennsylvania Station by 
subway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not as impressed by New York's transportation as we  
thought we would be.''

<HEADLINE> Sampras Finds Trouble Early At Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Almost every move Pete Sampras makes these days  
goes into the record book. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old right-hander is the No. 1 seed at the U.S Open  
for a fifth time, tying the Open Era record set by John McEnroe 
from 1981-85. 
</P>
<P>
	He is seeking his fifth title at the National Tennis Center,  
which would tie him with Jimmy Connors, two behind a trio of 
players, including Bill Tilden. 
</P>
<P>
	And a victory in the century's last Grand Slam tournament, the  
12th of his career, would break the record Sampras shares with 
former Australian star Roy Emerson for most Grand Slam men's 
singles titles. He tied Emerson in July when he won his sixth 
Wimbledon crown. 
</P>
<P>
	The road to the record book, however, could be a little rough.  
</P>
<P>
	In Wednesday's draw, Marat Safin, a young Russian with a big  
serve, was selected to play Sampras in the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
	Also in Sampras' bracket is two-time finalist Jim Courier,  
Frenchman Fabrice Santoro and 16th-seeded Nicolas Lapentti of 
Ecuador, who won the RCA Championships in Indianapolis last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis, the top-seeded player in the women's field, will  
face Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic in her opening match. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsay Davenport, seeded No. 2, will begin the defense of her  
women's singles title against fellow American Corina Morariu. 
Davenport, somewhat of a surprise when she won a year ago, added 
the Wimbledon crown earlier this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Williams sisters -- third-seeded Venus and No. 7 Serena -- are  
playing in opposite halves of the draw and could meet in the title 
match, as they did earlier this year in Key Biscayne, Fla. Venus, 
who has never lost to her younger sister, opens against a 
qualifier, while Serena will play Kimberly Po, who won their only 
other meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sampras is seeded No. 1, Australian Pat Rafter has won the  
last two men's singles titles on the hard courts at Arthur Ashe 
Stadium. Seeded fourth this year, Rafter also could have his hands 
full with his first opponent, Cedric Pioline of France. Pioline 
reached the U.S. Open final in 1993 and the Wimbledon title match 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeded second is Andre Agassi, winner of the French Open in June  
and runnerup to Sampras at Wimbledon. He begins the chase for his 
second U.S. Open crown against Sweden's Nicklas Kulti. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-4 Safin made headlines last year when, in the  
decisive fifth Davis Cup match between Russia and the United 
States, he battled Courier for five sets before falling. He then 
made his Grand Slam tournament debut at the French Open in 1998, 
where reached the fourth round, then duplicated that showing at the 
U.S. Open a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras skipped the early part of the year after a late push saw  
him end 1998 as No. 1 for a record sixth straight year. He lost 
early at the French Open, the one Grand Slam tournament that has 
eluded his winning ways, before beginning a 24-match winning streak 
that was broken when he retired from a match last week in 
Indianapolis with a strained hip flexor. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter is also coming into the Open after being sidelined with  
an injury. He retired from his match in Indianapolis and pulled out 
of a tournament this week with tendinitis in his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Third-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Safin's Davis Cup teammate who  
won the Australian Open in January, will take on Alberto Martin of 
Spain in his opener. After a stretch in which he lost seven 
consecutive matches, Kafelnikov has regained the all-court game 
that took him to No. 1 in the world, albeit briefly. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras and Agassi are seeded to meet in the U.S. Open final,  
which would be the third time they have battled for the crown in 
Flushing Meadows. They also met in the Wimbledon final in July and 
in the Australian Open title match in 1995. Agassi won Down Under, 
with Sampras capturing their other three battles with a Grand Slam 
title on the line. 
</P>
<P>
	If the seedings hold, fourth-round pairings would pit Sampras  
against 16th-seeded Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador, No. 7 Todd Martin 
against No. 9 Greg Rusedski of Britain, Rafter against No. 14 Tommy 
Haas of Germany, No. 5 Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil against No. 11 
Mark Philippoussis of Australia, No. 6 Tim Henman of Britain 
against No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, Kafelnikov 
against No. 13 Alex Corretja of Spain, No. 8 Carlos Moya of Spain 
against No. 10 Marcelo Rios of Chile, and Agassi against No. 15 
Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	In the women's draw, fourth-round pairings could pit Hingis  
against No. 10 Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain, No. 8 Jana Novotna 
of the Czech Republic against No. 15 Amelie Mauresmo of France,

<HEADLINE> Tests Can Treat Infants Hearing Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's a scene popping up in hospital nurseries  
around the country: A nurse slips soft, earphone-like probes into 
the ears of a soundly sleeping newborn. 
</P>
<P>
	In just a few minutes, this simple-looking gadget -- totally  
painless -- can detect signs of hearing loss in the baby's first 
hours to days of life. 
</P>
<P>
	If the day of birth seems a little soon to worry about hearing,  
consider this: Babies whose hearing loss isn't detected and treated 
before 6 months of age can suffer serious problems, particularly in 
speech and emotional development. But if they are treated, they 
learn and develop normally. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet most hearing loss in American children is not detected until  
age 2 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	A parent may notice profound deafness in a few months, but other  
degrees of hearing loss are harder to spot -- and once worried 
parents conclude there is a problem, they then must convince often 
skeptical doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not good for the baby, it's not conducive for maternal  
bonding, and it doesn't need to be this way anymore,'' says Texas 
audiologist Terese Finitzo, who chairs the Joint Commission on 
Infant Hearing, which is writing national guidelines on baby 
hearing tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, babies just a month old can get hearing aids, sign  
language can be taught early and cochlear implants provided by age 
18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is treatment by age 6 months so crucial? That's when babies  
begin moving from instinctive cooing to trying to imitate sounds, 
the first step in speech, explains audiologist Paul Kileny of the 
University of Michigan. If they can't hear, speech stops cold. 
</P>
<P>
	So testing newborns is gaining steam: Twenty states have passed  
laws requiring newborn hearing screening. Similar legislation is 
pending in five more states, and Congress is considering funding to 
help start more testing programs -- and ensure that all babies with 
hearing problems get appropriate followup care. 
</P>
<P>
	Out of every 1,000 babies, two or three will be born with  
hearing loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Some babies are at much higher risk, such as those whose  
relatives were born with hearing loss, or babies deprived of oxygen 
during birth, who have neonatal infections or facial abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
	Kileny studied more than 2,100 high-risk babies at the  
University of Michigan, and found six out of every 100 had hearing 
loss in one or both ears. He concluded that hospitals facing cost 
pressures could do the most good by testing high-risk babies 
instead of everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 40 percent of all hearing-impaired babies have no  
detectable risk factor, so other audiologists insist everyone must 
be tested. 
</P>
<P>
	But while screening tests are very accurate in spotting a  
problem, they're not perfect -- and they cannot tell just how bad 
hearing loss is. So hospitals must ensure that a newborn who fails 
that test promptly gets more sensitive diagnostic testing, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	And parents must be put in touch with the appropriate  
specialists -- to get a hearing aid or sign language training, and 
to access programs that help educate disabled children. Not every 
state is mandating such followup care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is this easy? No,'' says Finitzo, whose pilot testing project  
in Texas concluded it takes hospital training, educating new 
parents -- and sometimes boils down to money. Texas provides free 
hearing aids to poor babies, but all states don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it makes good sense as a nation,'' she says.  
</P>
<P>
	While states grapple with the issue, what should a new mom know?  
</P>
<P>
	Ask your hospital about hearing screening, experts advise. The  
new laws vary on when hospitals must start offering it. The test 
costs $25 to $35; some states require insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	If your baby fails the hearing test and you're not promptly  
referred to an audiologist or other services, the American 
Speech-Language-Hearing Association offers consumer information at 
1-800-638-8255. 
</P>
<P>
	And parents should watch for early signs of hearing loss, Kileny  
advises: 
</P>
<P>
	--From birth to 4 months, infants should watch your face while  
you speak. 
</P>
<P>
	--From 4-6 months, your baby should react -- even if only subtly --  
to changes in your tone of voice, a doorbell or a dog barking, and 
should babble or coo. 
</P>
<P>
	--From 6-7 months, your baby should be using simple sounds, and  
often can recognize some words. Closer to 12 months, they should be 
using a few words. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Russia To Sell Part of Gazprom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian government will sell 3.37 percent of  
Gazprom, the world's largest natural gas producer and the country's 
biggest of tax revenue, an official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as the government won an extra seat on  
Gazprom's board, after an extraordinary general meeting in which 
shareholders disbanded the board of directors and elected a new 
one. 
</P>
<P>
	Several Russian media outlets had reported in recent weeks that  
a group of Kremlin advisers known as ``The Family,'' said to have 
strong influence over President Boris Yeltsin, was seeking to win 
control over Gazprom's billion-dollar cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now has five of 11 seats on the board of Gazprom.  
The remaining six seats are controlled by Gazprom executives and 
allies of the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Former prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, a Yeltsin ally,  
retained his position as chairman of the Gazprom board. Rem 
Vyakhirev, who oversees 35 percent of the company on behalf of the 
government, also retained his seat. 
</P>
<P>
	The government currently owns 38.37 percent of the company,  
which contributed a fifth of the government's tax income revenue 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin signed a decree in July fixing government ownership at  
35 percent. State Property Minister Farit Gazizulin announced 
Thursday that the government is planning to sell the other 3.37 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Gazizulin, one of the government's representatives on the  
Gazprom board, provided no further information about the sale, such 
as whether foreign investors will be allowed to bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The government will remain the company's largest shareholder.  
The rest of the shares are held by Gazprom itself and by private 
investors. German gas giant Rurhgas is the largest foreign 
shareholder, with 4 percent of Gazprom stock.

<HEADLINE> Cisco Said To Buy Cerent for $6.9B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Cisco Systems Inc. reportedly has agreed to  
acquire closely-held networking startup Cerent Corp. for $6.9 
billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinod Khosla, Cerent's chairman and a prominent Silicon Valley  
venture capitalist, told The Wall Street Journal the deal appears 
to be the largest ever involving a private technology company. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco planned to announce the purchase, it's costliest to date,  
on Thursday, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cerent, based in Petaluma, Calif., makes equipment that eases  
communications bottlenecks by routing telephone calls and Internet 
traffic on and off fiber-optic lines. The company has posted only 
$10 million in sales in its 2 1/2 years in business and has never 
turned a profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is unbelievable, and unprecedented,'' Greg Rossmann, a  
managing director of the technology investment banking firm 
Broadview International, told the newspaper. ``It is truly 
reflective of the expectations for how the Internet infrastructure 
is going to be forced to evolve to support the demands of 
e-commerce.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco, a San Jose, Calif.-based network equipment maker, already  
holds an 8 percent stake in Cerent. Among Cerent's clientele: 
including Frontier Corp., Williams Communications Group Inc. and 
Qwest Communications International Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate deal, Cisco planned to announce it will buy  
Monterey Networks Inc., a Richardson, Texas, networking concern, 
for about $450 million in stock, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two purchases are expected to boost Cisco's sales to  
telecommunictions companies, Cisco's fastest-growing sector, the 
Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco expects to close both acquisitions by the end of October.  
</P>
<P>
	Cisco executives said the Cerent deal was so expensive because  
the impending Cerent IPO required them to value the company in 
comparison to other young networking companies whose stocks have 
soared since going public earlier this year, according to the 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco said it expects to take a charge of 7 cents to 11 cents a  
share in the fiscal first quarter ending in October for costs 
associated with the Monterey deal.

<HEADLINE> Armstrong Drops Out of Bike Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STEAMBOAT SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Tour de France winner Lance  
Armstrong dropped out of the Mercury Tour mountain bike race 
Thursday after bruising his left knee, tour officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong crashed a couple of times during the first 26.5-mile  
stage of the race, tour spokeswoman Jolene Aubel said. He was able 
to come down the mountain on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, his agent said he'll be icing his knee,'' Aubel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's stage started on top of Rabbit Ears Pass, followed  
the Continental Divide and ended with a 4,000-foot descent into the 
Steamboat ski area. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong dropped out of the race after falling more than eight  
minutes behind the pack of 47 cyclists, Aubel said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texan was the 1993 world road race champion and winner of  
two stages of the Tour de France in 1993 and 1995 before learning 
he had testicular cancer. He overcame his illness and won the Tour 
de France in July. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time defending Mercury Tour champion Jerome Chiotti of  
France, the 1996 world champion and current national champion of 
France, leads the Mercury Tour bike race after one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Every stage of the four-day race takes place between elevations  
of 8,000 feet and 11,000 feet in the mountains of north-central 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong will spend time in Vail before heading home to Austin,  
Texas, Aubel said.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Allowed To Suspend Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Creditor banks are letting Daewoo  
Group suspend debt payments for three months to prevent 12 of the 
ailing conglomerate's subsidiaries from going bankrupt while 
restructuring, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement marked the second time in two months that lenders  
have let Daewoo delay payments on billions of dollars in maturing 
bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Daewoo has $48 billion in debts and $65 billion in assets. Last  
week, the South Korean company agreed to sell all but six 
automobile-related units of its 25 affiliates by the end of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12 units covered by Thursday's announcement include Daewoo's  
flagship trading arm, Daewoo Corp., shipbuilder Daewoo Heavy 
Industries Ltd., home appliance maker Daewoo Electronics Co., and 
Daewoo Motor Co., the nations' second-largest carmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	To make those units more attractive to potential buyers or  
investors, Daewoo's 102 domestic creditor banks will also send new 
management, inject funds and convert some of their loans into stock 
to reduce the debt-to-equity ratio of the companies, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Daewoo and creditors have no disagreement on the decision.  
This measure is being taken to carry out restructuring more 
efficiently,'' said Lee Hun-jai, head of the Financial Supervisory 
Commission, the government's watchdog for corporate restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the move was inevitable.  
</P>
<P>
	``Daewoo subsidiaries have been suffering from a lack of  
short-term funds for months. Without the measure, some of them 
would have gone bankrupt, hindering the group's restructuring,'' 
said Kim Jung-hwan, an analyst at LG Securities Co.

<HEADLINE> Reno Promises To Find Truth on Waco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno pledged today to  
``get to the bottom'' of why it took the FBI six years to admit 
that its agents may have fired potentially flammable tear gas 
canisters on the final day of their standoff with the Branch 
Davidian cult near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no reason at this point to believe the FBI is  
responsible for the deaths of those people,'' Reno told her weekly 
news conference at the Justice Department. But she said she was 
``very, very frustrated'' that six years after categorical denials 
by the FBI there were news reports about the possible use of 
flammable devices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is absolutely critical that we do everything humanly  
possible to learn all the facts as accurately as possible and make 
them available to the Congress and public,'' said Reno, who, along 
with FBI Director Louis Freeh, has ordered a fresh investigation of 
what transpired on April 19, 1993, at the Branch Davidian compound. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Reno and Freeh ordered 40 FBI agents led by an FBI  
inspector to re-interview everyone who was at the Waco scene. FBI 
spokesman John Collingwood said Wednesday night that the agents are 
to report ``within weeks'' on all aspects of the use of 
military-type tear gas and why it took so long to be admitted 
publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno said she had gone over in her mind many times the events of  
that fiery day and had many times asked herself how the government 
might have handled it differently. 
</P>
<P>
	Had no stand been taken that day, she said, ``We don't know if  
(cult leader) David Koresh would have done it two weeks later on 
his own, without any provocation, and the federal government would 
have been blamed for not acting sooner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety  
told The Dallas Morning News that federal officials need to explain 
why members of the Army's secret Delta Force anti-terrorism squad 
were at the scene the day the compound burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone involved knows they were there. If there is an issue,  
it was what was their role at the time,'' said James B. Francis of 
Dallas. ``Some of the evidence that I have reviewed and been made 
aware of is very problematical as to the role of Delta Force at the 
siege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the new FBI investigation would address questions  
about the Delta Force, Reno replied: ``We will pursue any issue in 
question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The News cited a Defense Department document obtained under the  
Freedom of Information Act that confirms that the Special Forces 
unit was on the scene when the FBI hostage rescue unit used tanks 
to assault the compound with tear gas on April 19, 1993. The U.S. 
military is barred from domestic police work. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress made clear they would reopen hearings  
into the 51-day siege. The standoff ended with the death of Koresh 
and about 80 followers during a fire that erupted after the tear 
gas assault on their wooden headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Reno today described herself as ``very troubled'' by the  
developments and said she had been consistently told that no 
incendiary devices were used at the compound. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will continue to pursue this matter to get to the truth,''  
she told reporters. ``I intend the results of the review to be made 
public and I will not stop until I get to the bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she planned to discuss the issue with Freeh by phone  
later today and said it was likely they would discuss whether an 
outside investigation should be undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if she thought the reversal of position had harmed her  
credibility, Reno replied, ``I don't think it's very good for my 
credibility, and that's why I am going to pursue it until I get to 
the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she said of the turn of events: ``I'm not embarrassed.  
I'm very, very upset. ... If anybody says they've never relied on 
information that proves to be inaccurate, I'd like to meet them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House  
Government Reform Committee, said, ``I am deeply concerned by these 
inconsistencies. ... I intend for the committee to get to the 
bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs a subcommittee that  
oversees the FBI, said, ``This is a serious development in terms of 
further erosion of the FBI's credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collingwood said: ``The FBI may have used a very limited number  
of military-type CS gas canisters on the morning of April 19 in an 
attempt to penetrate the roof of an underground bunker 30 to 40 
yards away from the main Branch Davidian compound,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the civilian tear gas used later, ``the military  
canisters may have contained a substance that is designed to 
disperse the gas using a pyrotechnic mixture,'' Collingwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said two military tear gas canisters were fired just  
after 6 a.m., six hours before the fire began. The canisters 
bounced off the roof of the concrete bunker and landed in an open 
field, according to these officials, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonpyrotechnic tear gas canisters had not penetrated the bunker,  
which was linked to the main building by tunnels, the officials 
said. The FBI wanted to clear out anyone hiding there. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials suggested word of the military canisters might not  
have been relayed to top FBI and Justice officials earlier because 
original inquiries focused on the fire in the main building and the 
military canisters had been fired almost 180 degrees away from that 
building and hours before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent investigators concluded the fire began  
simultaneously in three places. FBI bugs recorded Davidians 
discussing spreading fuel and planning a fire hours before the 
compound burned. Arson investigators found that gasoline, charcoal 
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the 
compound.

<HEADLINE> Russians Order Bank Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian investigators are joining a rapidly  
expanding probe into allegations that Russian mobsters funneled 
billions of dollars through the Bank of New York in a vast money 
laundering operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Russian officials had been conspicuously silent since  
news of the affair broke a week ago in New York, and the reports 
have caused barely a ripple among Russians citizens inured to 
revelations of corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	But with U.S. congressional hearings on the matter now planned  
for next month, Vladimir Ustinov, Russia's acting prosecutor 
general, called Thursday for investigators to look into the reports 
that up to $15 billion may have passed through the bank. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British law enforcement officials are already  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	The scheme is the latest of several major Russian financial  
scandals, and has been portrayed as potentially one of the biggest 
money laundering operations ever uncovered in the United States. So 
far no one has been charged with wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. authorities have seized about $20 million at the Bank of  
New York along with bank records believed to be linked to the 
scheme, a U.S. law enforcement source said on condition of 
anonymity. The seizure, first reported in The New York Times, was 
made by the Russian Organized Crime Task Force, a joint operation 
of the FBI and New York City police. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering and capital flight have been major problems for  
Russia throughout this decade, with tens of billions of dollars 
pouring out of the country. Many wealthy Russians, particularly 
those who made their fortunes illegally, have sought to hide their 
money overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Money laundering is a legal term describing the passing of  
illegal profits through different bank accounts to make them appear 
to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York suspended two Russian-born senior officers  
last week as news of the federal investigation surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the executives, Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, is a senior  
vice president of Bank of New York who supervised its East European 
division out of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Her husband is Konstantin Kagalovsky, Russia's representative to  
the International Monetary Fund from 1992 to 1995. He has been a 
private businessman for the past few years, and is now vice 
president of Yukos, one of Russia's largest oil companies, though 
his current whereabouts were not known. 
</P>
<P>
	The other suspended banker is Lucy Edwards, who worked in the  
bank's London office and is the wife of Russian businessman Peter 
Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of New York said it is cooperating with U.S.  
authorities, but noted that it has not been accused of any 
wrongdoing. The bank on Thursday declined to make the executives 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports in The Wall Street Journal and USA Today have said the  
laundered money may have included funds sent by the IMF as aid to 
shore up Russia's faltering economy. The IMF has said it is taking 
the allegations seriously and is looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has been involved in several major financial scandals in  
recent years, but investigations have routinely fizzled out, 
producing no arrests or prosecutions. Russian law enforcement 
agencies have failed to combat massive organized crime and are 
regarded as inefficient and corrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	USA Today, quoting Russian and British investigators, reported  
Thursday that several current and former members of Yeltsin's 
government are being investigated in connection with the money 
laundering operation, including Yeltsin's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	A reputed Russian mob leader, Semyon Mogilevich, who is based in  
Budapest, Hungary, also has been linked to the alleged scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Bank of New York scandal was generating less  
attention than a separate set of accusations that have been leveled 
at the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra reported Wednesday  
that the Swiss firm Mabetex, which renovated the Kremlin, provided 
more than $1 million to Yeltsin and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper alleged that Mabetex routed the money to a foreign  
bank account controlled by Kremlin manager Pavel Borodin, who in 
turn made it available to Yeltsin. The Kremlin denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Borodin, as well as his wife and members of Yeltsin's  
administration, are also targets of a Swiss criminal investigation 
into alleged money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Swiss prosecutors have asked Swiss banks to freeze assets  
allegedly belonging to Borodin and 21 others, according to Swiss 
media reports. Borodin has denied that he has any Swiss bank 
accounts.

<HEADLINE> Publishers Clearing Settles Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Publishers Clearing House will offer millions of  
dollars in refunds and revise its sweepstakes mailings to settle a 
class-action lawsuit concerning its advertising and marketing 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claimed the company duped people into buying  
magazines and books by falsely leading them to believe that they 
would increase their chances of winning. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the agreement, the company is required to send  
notices of the settlement to about 40 million households, according 
to documents filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in East St. 
Louis. The settlement was approved on June 30 by U.S. District 
Judge Patrick Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
	Subscribers to magazines through Publishers Clearing House will  
get a chance to cancel their subscriptions and get a refund. Those 
who bought merchandise can return the goods and get a refund. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who sent in entries also will be offered at least three  
automatic entries in future sweepstakes. 
</P>
<P>
	Publishers Clearing House attorney Bill Low said in a statement  
that the company admits no wrongdoing and settled to avoid extended 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're pleased that we could reach a fair settlement and  
resolve the concerns being expressed,'' Low said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sweepstakes industry has been under close scrutiny in recent  
months. The U.S. Senate earlier this month voted to put new 
restrictions on sweepstakes, saying too many people think that 
buying unwanted magazines and other items will help them win big 
prizes. 
</P>
<P>
	The House has not yet acted on similar legislation.

<HEADLINE> Bared Breasts Launch Mass. Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- By most accounts, Gov. Paul Celluci's  
administration had been sailing along smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came Aug. 17, when a stunt actress named Gidget bared her  
breasts to a newspaper photographer while aboard a taxpayer-funded 
booze cruise. Even Cellucci conceded, ``that was a bad thing to 
do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it seems Celluci has had to defend himself almost  
daily against allegations ranging from cronyism to abuse of power 
to uncontrolled spending within his administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports surfaced Wednesday that a recent Cellucci appointee had  
approved a state contract for his recently disbarred divorce 
lawyer, and another appointee had been found to have sexually 
harassed an underling. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellucci said he is undisturbed by all the turmoil.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got over 60,000 people working for us,'' he said. ``So  
will there be problems occasionally? Sure. It's our job to deal 
with those problems. That's what we're doing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pandora's box of trouble apparently was opened during the  
boozy Boston Harbor cruise chartered by Massachusetts Port 
Authority director Peter Blute, a former congressman. He was 
accompanied by a controversial GOP fund-raiser and a number of 
young women, including Gidget Churchill, who lifted her top after 
spotting a Boston Herald photographer waiting on shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Blute resigned hours after the photos hit newsstands, but that  
was just the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, David Shagoury, chief of staff for state Economic  
Development Director Carolyn Boviard, resigned amid allegations 
that he and Ms. Boviard were having an affair. The 33-year-old 
Shagoury -- immediately nicknamed ``Shagadelic'' by a local 
columnist -- had reportedly threatened to punish employees who 
gossiped about the alleged affair, which Ms. Boviard, 44, denies. 
</P>
<P>
	Celluci said an investigation found no evidence that Ms. Boviard  
had misused public funds or her office, and he expected her to stay 
on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Wait, there's more. The same Friday that the affair allegations  
arose, Nancy Evans quit her job as planning director for the 
Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. The Republican 
appointee said she could no longer tolerate cost overruns that ran 
into hundreds of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Cellucci appointed his chief of staff, 33-year-old  
Virginia Buckingham, to the top Massport post, immediately drawing 
criticism that she is far from qualified for the position. 
</P>
<P>
	He was also criticized for his choice of replacement for Ms.  
Buckingham as chief of staff -- Stephen O'Neill, a Cellucci aide who 
had been his driver as recently as 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've always got a shortage of qualified Republicans, but  
they're reaching down really low,'' said Dan Payne, a Democratic 
consultant. ``Cellucci has not distinguished himself with strong 
people around him. There are no adults he can turn to and say, `Get 
this class in order.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Corruption is nothing new in Massachusetts and certainly not  
limited to Republicans, said John Sears, a Republican political 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Massachusetts' congressional delegation has a couple of very  
black eyes from its own past that might be deemed more serious than 
booze cruises or love affairs in the office,'' said Sears, 
referring to the Chappaquiddick tragedy that doomed Sen. Edward M. 
Kennedy's shot at the presidency and Rep. Barney Frank's admission 
he improperly used his congressional office to aid a male 
prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, gleeful Democrats say they've seen the scandals  
coming for a long time -- ever since Republican Gov. William Weld 
strayed from his campaign promise in 1990 not to hire any political 
hacks, or ``walruses,'' as he called them. 
</P>
<P>
	Six years later, it was revealed Weld's patronage appointees  
called themselves the ``walrus club,'' and the administration kept 
a priority list of job candidates who had supported Weld or the 
GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Cellucci had been Weld's lieutenant governor until July 1997,  
when he became acting governor after Weld resigned for an 
unsuccessful pursuit of the ambassadorship to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no one in the business of politics in Massachusetts,  
Republican, Democrat, Independent, reporter, official or 
independent observer, who was surprised by this,'' said Michael 
Goldman, a Democratic political consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fairly or unfairly, they've had such a good run, and now it's  
turned. That's the way it works in this business.''

<HEADLINE> Amateur Champion Says Pros Can Wait  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN (AP) -- David Gossett can wait for professional prize  
money and endorsement contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Amateur champion is content going to class, playing  
college golf and spending his Saturdays watching football games. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20-year-old University of Texas sophomore said Wednesday  
he'll stay in school for another year before entertaining thoughts 
of turning pro. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just going to take it one year at a time,'' Gossett said.  
``Playing well at the U.S. Amateur has given me a lot of 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just want to enjoy my second year at Texas,'' he said. ``I  
just love the enthusiasm here with the football game Saturday. 
There's just so many positive people here at Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett won the U.S. Amateur last week with a dominating 9-and-8  
final round victory over Korean high school junior Sung Yoon Kim. 
</P>
<P>
	He now has goals of winning the NCAA team and individual titles.  
He also wants to see how he'll play in three professional majors 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	As the U.S. Amateur champion, Gossett can play in the Masters,  
U.S. Open and British Open next year if he remains an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett has received congratulations and well wishes from  
several former Longhorns, including Justin Leonard, the 1992 
champion, Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw and Tom Kite, with whom he 
has played practice rounds in Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett said he thought of Kite during his semifinal round at  
the U.S. Amateur against Ohio's Ben Curtis. Sitting on a three-hole 
lead on No. 15, Gossett had to punch back onto the fairway after 
his drive found the rough. Curtis then chipped onto the green 
within 10 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to get up and down from 65 yards. I was thinking how we  
had practiced wedge shots. I said, `OK Tom, here we go,' and got it 
to within three feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's that kind of cool on the course that prompts questions of  
when he'll turn pro. 
</P>
<P>
	The college all-American experienced the pressures of the  
professional tour when he shot a first-round 66 in the 1998 FedEx 
St. Jude Classic. He played there again this year, but missed the 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	He also has friends in the professional ranks, including Spanish  
teenage sensation Sergio Garcia. The two played junior golf 
together. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Gossett's few mistakes last week was dropping the lid of  
the trophy after winning the U.S. Amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	``How about that? In front of the world,'' Gossett said. ``I  
just called it a bogey and laughed at it. Oh well, nice problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Texas golf coach John Fields likes the fact his star player is  
sticking around. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got a lot of opportunities that he's going to have to  
look at over the course of the next few years. I know sitting here 
at the University of Texas, I sure wouldn't want him anywhere else 
right now,'' Fields said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gossett will play next month in the Walker Cup in Scotland  
against amateurs from Great Britain and Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
	And then it's back to the books instead of the potential big  
money on the pro tours. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another year to mature and another year to work on my  
golf game,'' Gossett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's also another year of education and maybe a better  
vocabulary when I answer these questions.''

<HEADLINE> Dutch Financial Giant Profits Soar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Dutch banking and insurance  
company ING Groep NV posted a 90 percent rise in first-half net 
profit, largely from the sale of its holdings in De Nationale 
Investeringsbank and mobile phone company Libertel. 
</P>
<P>
	ING said Thursday it earned 3.31 billion euros ($3.48 billion),  
or 3.46 euros per share, for the first six months of 1999, 
including a one-time gain of 1.69 billion euros. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those one-off gains, operating profits rose 20 percent  
to 1.62 billion euros, boosted by improved results in both banking 
and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	ING also presented an upbeat outlook for the rest of 1999,  
saying it expects profits from continuing operations to show a 40 
percent jump from the prior year.

<HEADLINE> Ground Broken at Nashville Speedway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEBANON, Tenn. (AP) -- Sterling Marlin drove a ``pace car'' that  
led three bulldozers breaking ground Thursday at the site of the 
Nashville Superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	The $125 million complex about 27 miles east of Nashville is set  
for completion in summer 2001. It will be set on 1,265 acres, and 
will feature a 1.33 mile oval track with grandstand seating for 
50,000. Also planned are four other tracks including a drag strip 
with seating for 15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nashville has always been a hotbed of racing,'' Marlin said.  
``Once they build it and fill it up with fans, they'll get a 
(Winston Cup) date in two or three years. That's what they're 
building it for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also on hand were drivers Bobby Hamilton, Casey Atwood and Coo  
Coo Marlin, a retired driver and Sterling Marlin's father. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think Nashville is a major market for NASCAR, and we're  
going to build a major facility to accommodate that market,'' said 
Denis McGlynn, president of Dover Downs Entertainment Inc., the 
Dover, Del.-based company that is building the superspeedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to run a couple of events and demonstrate to NASCAR we  
have big crowds, enthusiastic crowds and we can handle them 
efficiently operationally. Then we can sit down and start the hard 
lobbying to convince them to bring a Winston Cup race here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the current Winston Cup race sites would have to give up  
a race in order for Nashville to get one. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Triplett, director of operations for NASCAR, said the  
sanctioning body knows Nashville is a good market for racing. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in this day and time, our policy is anyone has a right to  
build or develop, but we wait and see one before we make a 
commitment (for a Winston Cup race).'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nashville Superspeedway has landed a Busch series race,  
which McGlynn speculated might soon rise in prestige enough to 
equal Winston Cup racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville had Winston Cup racing until 1984 when NASCAR pulled  
out because of the deteriorating condition of the Nashville 
Speedway near downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	That 5/8-mile oval has had stock car racing for more than 40  
years. It now holds one Busch, one Craftsman Truck Series and one 
Slim Jim Pro Series event each year.

<HEADLINE>  Hijacking Ends Peacefully in Spain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARCELONA, Spain (AP) -- A 45-year-old Moroccan who used a fake  
pistol to hijack an airliner to Spain surrendered peacefully today 
after releasing all 92 passengers and crew unharmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-hour ordeal began late Wednesday in skies over North  
Africa. The Royal Air Maroc Boeing 737-400 had taken off from 
Casablanca, Morocco, on a flight to Tunis, Tunisia. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacker, whose name was not released, demanded to be flown  
to Germany. The plane was diverted to Barcelona, landing at El Prat 
airport about 11 p.m., where it was immediately surrounded by 
national police and Civil Guards. 
</P>
<P>
	The hijacker insisted that the plane be refueled for the trip to  
Germany, but was convinced by a special team of police and 
psychologists, working in the control tower through a 
French-speaking interpreter, to give himself up. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers filed out the back of the plane into two waiting  
buses, while the hijacker waited with the pilot in the cockpit for 
police. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities initially questioned the hijacker in the airport  
police station. They have 72 hours to bring him before a judge, 
police spokesman Carlos Carbonell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was described as ``mentally unstable'' by David Bonet,  
the Interior Ministry's second-ranking official in Catalonia, the 
northeast region bordering France of which Barcelona is the 
capital. Bonet said the hijacker's only motive appeared to be a 
desire to emigrate to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Bonet said police confirmed the man was acting alone and used a  
fake pistol. He did not say whether it was a toy. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the passengers included 24 Tunisians, 32  
Moroccans and the nine-member Moroccan crew. The remainder were 
from Europe and other African countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The passengers spent the remainder of the night in the airport  
departure lounge before continuing their journey to Tunisia on 
another Royal Air Maroc flight at 9:40 a.m., Carbonell said. The 
crew remained in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the 15th hijacking or attempted hijacking involving  
Spanish airports or planes since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	In June 1998, a 43-year-old Spaniard seized an Iberia plane with  
130 people aboard during a flight from Seville, Spain, to 
Barcelona. He forced the plane to land in the eastern city of 
Valencia. 
</P>
<P>
	A handheld device he said was a detonator for an explosive in  
the hold turned out to be television remote control, and he 
surrendered a few hours after talking with his psychiatrist on the 
telephone.

Thoroughbred racing coverage on Sunday, Aug. 29, in the Pacific 
Classic, to be televised live from Del Mar, Calif., from 5:00-6:00 
p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1 million Pacific Classic is the final race in NTRA  
Champions on FOX, an 11-race series broadcast on FOX and FOX Sports 
Net. Kenny Albert will host the Pacific Classic telecast with 
analysts Jay Privman and Ron Ellis and reporter Caton Bredar. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, the series has been blessed with compelling stories,  
competitive racing and exciting finishes,'' said Basil V. DeVito 
Jr., NTRA senior vice president - television and sponsorship. 
``It's been very good television and FOX's unique approach to the 
telecasts and their insightful, behind-the-scenes features have 
contributed immensely. NTRA Champions on FOX has given our older 
horses a chance to shine in the national spotlight like never 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Highlights from the FOX telecasts include use of FOX football  
talent like Terry Bradshaw, Howie Long, James Brown and John 
Madden; an Austin Powers spoof with Bob Baffert dressed as the 
``shagadelic'' movie character; and fans in full-body paint, 
sporting the colors of their favorite horse's silks, during the 
Whitney Handicap from Saratoga. The Whitney also produced the 
series' signature moment on the racetrack when Victory Gallop nosed 
out series leader Behrens in a dramatic stretch duel. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the FOX point of view, the series has been successful,''  
said Lou D'Ermilio, vice president of communications for FOX 
Sports. ``The ratings have been where we projected, and the shows 
have been competitive with sports programming that receive s much 
more mainstream promotion.'' The four races on the FOX network have 
averaged a 1.3 rating. 
</P>
<P>
	Horses who accumulate NTRA Champions on FOX bonus points during  
the series can turn those points into cash in the Pacific Classic, 
collecting $5,000 per point for running first, $4,000 for second, 
$3,000 for third, $2,000 for fourth and $1,000 for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the likely Pacific Classic starters who have earned bonus  
points earlier in the series are Catienus with 12 points and the 
Richard Mandella-trained Malek, with eight points. Since there are 
20 more points at stake for winning the Pacific Classic, Malek will 
be running for $140,000 in bonus money and Catienus for $160,000 
(number of points at $5,000 per point) on top of the winner's share 
of $600,000. Among the foes for Malek and Catienus are two 
promising charges from the barn of trainer Bob Baffert. He will 
saddle the three-year-old Santa Anita Derby winner General 
Challenge and seven-year-old River Keen. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-place finisher in the Pacific Classic receives 12  
bonus points and the third-place runner gets eight bonus points.

 *DERBY WINNER STRIKE THE GOLD OK AFTER EARTHQUAKE IN TURKEY   	
</P>
<P>
	The 1991 Kentucky Derby winner Strike the Gold was not injured  
following the devastating earthquake that killed an estimated 
12,500 people in Turkey on Aug. 17, according to a report in The 
Blood-Horse magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Strike the Gold, who was purchased in 1988 by the Turkish Jockey  
Club to stand at stud, was stabled at the nation's stud farm, 
located approximately 20 miles from Izmit, the city where the 
earthquake was centered. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the other stallions at the stud farm, including multiple  
Grade I winner River Special, was injured. According to a 
spokesperson, the nine Thoroughbred stallions sent to Turkey since 
1996 have been popular, with each attracting books of 40-50 mares.

</P>
<P>
	Charismatic, winner of this year's Kentucky Derby and Preakness  
Stakes, will be honored by VISA USA in a ceremony at the National 
Museum of Racing on Friday to commemorate his victory in the VISA 
Three-Year-Old Championship Series. Charismatic's trainer D. Wayne 
Lukas will also receive a plaque for winning the trainer's title in

at Saratoga Racecourse in Saratoga Springs, N.Y, which is also home 
to the Museum of Racing. The ceremony will begin at 11:00 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Charismatic earned 57 points in the series. Lukas dominated the  
trainers' standings with 134 points. The jockey title will go down

traditionally great sport and an economically significant 
industry.''

<HEADLINE> Mortgages Rates Edge Down / National Mortgage Survey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The average interest rate on 30-year  
fixed-rate mortgages edged down to 7.80 percent this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The average was down from 7.93 percent last week, according to a  
weekly survey released Thursday by Freddie Mac, the mortgage 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mortgages rates have been on an upward climb. So far this year,  
average rates on a 30-year mortgage have hit a low of 6.74 percent 
set at the end of January and a high of 8.15 percent two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifteen-year mortgages, a popular option for refinancing,  
averaged 7.43 percent this week, down from the average of 7.53 
percent last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On one-year adjustable-rate mortgages, lenders were asking an  
average initial rate of 6.22 percent this week, up from 6.18 
percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	The rates do not include add-on fees known as points, which  
averaged at or just over 1 percent of the loan amount for all three 
types of mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, the Mortgage Bankers Association said that mortgage  
loan applications for the week ending Aug. 20 were down 1.9 percent 
from the previous week and down 22.5 percent compared to the same 
week last year.

<HEADLINE> Former Colts QB Faces New Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Indianapolis Colts quarterback Art  
Schlichter is facing charges of placing bets with a Las Vegas 
bookie while serving time in prison on other gambling charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, in legal trouble since 1983 for gambling-related  
activities, admitted to an Indiana State police investigator that 
he ``had a relapse and needed help,'' according to a report in 
Thursday's editions of The Herald Bulletin of Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter, 39, allegedly was wagering while jailed at the  
Correctional Industrial Facility in Pendleton last November. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison County prosecutor Rodney Cummings said warrants were  
issued Wednesday on four misdemeanor counts of illegal gambling 
stemming from incidents at the jail on Nov. 29, 1998. The case will 
be heard in Anderson City Court. 
</P>
<P>
	The four charges carry a maximum sentence of 180 days and a  
maximum $1,000 fine. Cummings said if Schlichter is convicted, the 
former quarterback could be ordered to serve consecutive sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Cummings said the investigation began after Department of  
Correction guards noticed Schlichter making an extraordinary amount 
of calls on the inmate telephone. He said Schlichter was calling a 
bookie in Las Vegas and placing hefty bets on football and hockey 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the month of November, he (Schlichter) placed 2,029 collect  
telephone calls,'' Cummings told The Herald Bulletin. ``Of that 
total, 676 were accepted and 107 were to the Las Vegas area code.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter was sentenced in 1997 in Marion County to four years  
on charges of theft, forgery and fraud in connection with the theft 
of $800,000 to support his gambling habit. Instead of beginning his 
Indiana prison term, Schlichter began serving a federal sentence in 
Kentucky for a probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter turned himself in in Indiana on Jan. 26, 1998 and is  
scheduled to be released Sept. 3. He'll then be transferred to 
Madison County to face the new charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter played at Ohio State from 1978-81 and led the  
Buckeyes to two Big Ten championships. He was drafted by the 
then-Baltimore Colts as the fourth player overall in the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL suspended Schlichter for one year in 1983 when it was  
learned that bookies threatened him over $150,000 in gambling 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlichter returned to the Indianapolis Colts in 1984 and was  
released following the 1985 season.

<HEADLINE> Maloney Wins Gymnastics Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Kristen Maloney stood at the end of  
the vault runway, calmly sipping a cup of water and trying to focus 
on the two jumps that stood between her and a second straight 
national all-around gymnastics title. 
</P>
<P>
	She then cleanly completed both vaults, and faced the toughest  
part of her Thursday night -- running a gauntlet of five coaches, 
all waiting for hugs from the champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney, 18, edged Vanessa Atler for the second straight year at  
the U.S. Gymnastics Championships, scoring 38.687 points to Atler's 
38.312. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to relax. I was trying to calm down, to  
relax like I do in the gym,'' Maloney said of her final two vaults. 
``I wasn't trying to play it safe at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Atler led by a slim margin going into the final round of  
competition, but fell on the uneven bars -- the second straight year 
a fall on that apparatus has cost her a shot at a national title. 
</P>
<P>
	Atler, 17, also fell on the uneven bars in 1997 when she tied  
Kristy Powell for the national title. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a thing I keep doing. People keep telling me to  
change my bars routine, but that's not the problem, it's just me,'' 
she said. ``I make it all the time in practice, it's just when I go 
into meets that it's harder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jennie Thompson placed third in Thursday's all-around  
competition with a score of 38.112. Alyssa Beckerman was fourth 
with 38.012 points and Jamie Dantzscher was fifth with 37.750. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 14 women in the all-around competition qualify for the  
World Championships team trials, to be held Sept. 15-18 in Kansas 
City, Mo. That event will help choose the American squad for the 
World Gymnastics Championships from Oct. 8-16 in Tianjin, China. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristie Phillips, the national champion as a 15-year-old in 1987  
who quit the sport after failing to make the U.S. Olympic team in 
1988, fell off the uneven bars and struggled throughout the evening 
to place 23rd out of the 29 competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips, 27, who is trying to return to competitive gymnastics  
after pursuing an acting career for the past decade, nevertheless 
was the crowd favorite. She received a standing ovation after her 
floor exercise, along with cries of ``We Love You, Kristie!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a blast. It was so emotional,'' Phillips said. ``I would  
have loved to be on the national team, but that was better just 
knowing I had brought people to their feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arco Arena, which holds 11,000 for gymnastics, was only about  
half full for the first night of women's competition. Only a few 
hundred spectators were on hand Wednesday night for the first round 
of men's competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships lost some of their appeal when Dominique  
Moceanu and Amy Chow, two members of the U.S. team that won gold at 
the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, dropped out because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, John Roethlisberger finished his floor exercise  
and punched the air with his right fist. 
</P>
<P>
	A year after reconstructive knee surgery, the two-time Olympian  
wore a leg brace and a huge smile as he made a dramatic return at 
the U.S. Gymnastics Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Jason Gatson and Blaine Wilson were atop the standings,  
the happiest gymnast was the guy who was in third place in the 
all-around event after Wednesday's preliminary competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Roethlisberger, who won four national titles in the early 1990s,  
also won the pommel horse Wednesday with a score of 9.95. He had 
been sidelined for months after blowing out his right knee at the 
national championships last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is by far the biggest accomplishment I've had in my  
career,'' he said, choking up. ``I'm a 29-year-old gymnast with a 
reconstructed knee, and I'm real proud to be where I am. I'm 
prouder of this than anything I've done before. Forget the national 
championships and the Olympics, this is it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gatson took a slim lead over Wilson after Wednesday's events,  
which count for 20 percent of the men's all-around competition. The 
finals are Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson is seeking an unprecedented fourth straight national  
title. Gatson finished second to Wilson at the national 
championships in 1996 and '98. He was third in 1997, behind Wilson 
and Roethlisberger. 
</P>
<P>
	But Roethlisberger was the star Wednesday night with his  
performance, and with his obvious pleasure at being able to compete 
at such a high level again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to say, `Wow!''' he said. ``I wondered if I  
could still hang with these guys. And to be third? I didn't expect 
that. I didn't care if it was first, third or 30th. I was just 
psyched to be able to perform again.''

<P>
	BASEL, Switzerland (AP) -- Profit rose 5 percent at the Swiss  
pharmaceutical giant Novartis in the first half of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis said Thursday it had a profit of $2.45 billion in the  
first six months of 1999, up from $2.40 billion in the same period 
last year. Last month, it reported first-half sales up 1 percent to 
$10.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said it expects profits for the full year to exceed  
last year's $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher sales of drugs and consumer goods offset a downturn in  
its agricultural products, Novartis said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices fell Thursday, snapping a four-day  
winning streak that had pushed long-term yields to the lowest level 
in three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 23/32  
point, or $7.18 3/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, rose to 5.90 percent from 5.85 percent 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasurys were weighed down Thursday by a number of corporate  
bond offerings coming to market. 
</P>
<P>
	Tyco International is expected to price a $1.5 billion deal in  
short maturities. Fannie Mae has a $3 billion offering of new 
10-year securities that is expected to be priced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond prices had soared in the past week on expectations that the  
Federal Reserve would let interest rates stabilize for the rest of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed on Tuesday raised short-term rates for a second time  
this summer in a pre-emptive strike against inflation. Higher 
interest rates push down prices for bonds, which pay a fixed rate 
of return, but investors had already anticipated the Fed's move. 
Instead, traders focused on hopes that the rate hikes since June 
may be all that is needed to slow down the economy and keep 
inflation at bay for now. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
fell 5/32 point to 7/32 point, and intermediate maturities fell 
11/32 point to 7/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.91 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 4.78 percent. Six-month 
yields were 5.04 percent, as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 4.85 percent. One-year yields were 5.16 percent as the 
discount rose 0.04 percentage point from late Wednesday to 4.90 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.31 1/4 percent from 5.25 percent late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 17/32 point to 114 9/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.76 percent from 5.79 percent late 
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Triple-A Team Heads to Portland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Calgary's Triple-A baseball team will be  
moved to Portland for the 2001 season, according to investors who 
announced purchase of the club on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Class AAA team left in 1994 for Salt Lake City and  
the city since has had a club in the short-season Northwest League. 
That team would likely move in 2001, possibly to Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Triple-A team would reportedly join the PCL's  
four-team North Division, joining Edmonton, Tacoma and Salt Lake 
City. 
</P>
<P>
	Affiliated with the Florida Marlins, the Cannons currently are  
in last place in the North Division. 
</P>
<P>
	PFE, a partnership of 16 investors headed by Marshall Glickman,  
is finalizing a deal with the city to take over management of 
73-year-old Civic Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	``The team was for sale, and we neeeded a club to play in this  
building,'' Mike Higgins, general manager of PFE, said. 
</P>
<P>
	PFE did not disclosed the price tag of the Cannons, but it's  
believed to be about $10 million. Cannons owner Russ Parker bought 
the team in 1984 for $1.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the proposed Civic Stadium deal, PFE would  
acquire baseball and soccer franchises and assume exclusive 
responsibility for stadium operations. The city would retain 
ownership of the stadium and pay for about 90 percent of a $37 
million renovation project to be completed by spring 2001.

	CONCORD, Calif. (AP) -- Officials want Whitney Houston to  
reimburse the city for the $100,000 spent preparing for a concert 
she canceled 15 minutes before show time. 
</P>
<P>
	Houston said she bowed out of an Aug. 1 concert at the  
public-owned Concord Pavilion because she was ill. About 5,000 fans

	OFFUTT AIR FORCE BASE, Neb. (AP) -- An Air Force captain pleaded  
guilty Thursday to having sex with two enlisted women, including 
one he later married. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Douglas M. Bass also admitted to lying to an investigator  
and disobeying orders to end his relationship with Krystal Carr,

<P>
	Bass pleaded guilty to nine counts of violating military law. He  
could face up to 28 years in prison and a dishonorable discharge 
when sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	Bass was the commanding officer over Carr and her first husband  
when their affair started in 1998, shortly after Carr's husband was 
deployed to Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	Military officials learned about the affair in February 1999 and  
ordered Bass to end it, but he denied the relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	No disciplinary action has been taken against Carr.  
</P>
<P>
	Bass also had a relationship with an unidentified staff sergeant  
at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, before he met Carr. The 
woman wasn't under his command.

<HEADLINE> A-10 Bomb Search Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE, Colo. (AP) -- A search team hoping to locate four missing  
500-pound bombs from the suicide crash of an Air Force warplane two 
years ago found an old unexploded mortar shell, but no sign of the 
bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The site was at an elevation of 11,500 feet on a 40-degree slope  
high in the central Rocky Mountains where a hiker had spotted an 
object with a protruding tailfin. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Craig Button's A-10 attack jet was carrying four 500-pound  
bombs from a base in Tucson, Ariz., when he broke formation with 
two other planes on April 2, 1997. For three hours, he flew an 
erratic 500-mile course that ended when he crashed into the 
13,000-foot Gold Dust Peak. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force investigators concluded he committed suicide. The  
wreckage was found after an 18-day search, but there was no trace 
of the bombs, despite a 72-day search. 
</P>
<P>
	The search team, including the hiker, an Air Force officer, a  
civilian engineer and a forest ranger, hiked to the remote spot 
Wednesday before returning by nightfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The military closed the area until the mortar shell can be  
disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	The shell was believed to be a relic from World War II-era  
training, said sheriff's Deputy John O'Sullivan. The region was 
declared a wilderness area in 1980, and since then there has been 
no military training.

<HEADLINE> Societe Generale Asks for Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- French bank Societe Generale has accused Banque  
Nationale de Paris of violating banking procedures in its efforts 
to garner more support among Societe Generale's stockholders in a 
takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Societe Generale said in a statement Thursday that it has asked  
French stock market authorities to investigate BNP's claims that it 
now controls more than 40 percent of its rival. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest maneuver in the six-month-old banking war came as  
French bank regulators prepared for a meeting Friday that could 
lead to a decision on whether BNP can keep its stake in Societe 
Generale. 
</P>
<P>
	If the regulators rule in BNP's favor, Societe Generale will  
lose much of its independence. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP launched a two-pronged, $37 billion hostile takeover for  
Societe Generale and Paribas in March in a bid to create Europe's 
largest bank in terms of assets. 
</P>
<P>
	But while it won control of Paribas, it initially garnered just  
a 37 percent stake in Societe Generale, leaving the final outcome 
with regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP claims that some Societe Generale shareholders were unable  
to tender their bids for technical reasons and, therefore, its 
share is actually higher. 
</P>
<P>
	BNP claims it has enough shares for effective control over  
Societe Generale. But Societe Generale contends BNP has only enough 
shares to block decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Paribas and Societe Generale had hoped to merge, but their plan  
was foiled when BNP launched its bid for both. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, French stock market authorities confiscated  
some 3.6 million shares in Societe Generale bought up by British 
insurance group CGU PLC because of concerns over the way the shares 
were acquired.

<HEADLINE> Congo Rebels To Sign Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Congolese rebels said today they will sign  
a peace accord next week aimed at ending the yearlong war in Congo, 
concluding a month of wrangling over whose names will appear on the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Squabbling kept rival rebel factions from approving the fragile  
accord July 10, when it was signed by Congolese President Laurent 
Kabila and the heads of five other countries involved in the 
rebellion that broke out Aug. 2, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is important is that on Tuesday at 10 a.m. the agreement  
will be signed,'' said Moise Nyarugabo, an official of the rebel 
group, called the Congolese Rally for Democracy. Nyarugabo, 
speaking on a satellite telephone from the rebel headquarters in 
Goma in eastern Congo, said the signing would take place in Lusaka, 
Zambia. 
</P>
<P>
	Nyarugabo said the date was set during talks in Goma on  
Wednesday with Eric Silwamba, a Zambian government minister who has 
been mediating the peace talks. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing would end a stalemate that emerged when former rebel  
leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, insisted on signing the agreement 
even though he had been deposed in May. That angered the new 
leadership, which refused to sign if Wamba did. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue was resolved earlier this week when the rebels  
accepted a proposal drafted by southern African leaders that all 51 
founding members of the rebel group sign. That would include both 
Wamba and the new leader, Emile Ilunga. 
</P>
<P>
	The signing will set the stage for an immediate cease-fire and  
further discussions on Congo's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Pressing problems include the need to disarm Congo's various  
armed bands, among them the rebels and Rwandan Hutu gunmen who took 
part in the 1994 genocide of minority Tutsis in Rwanda. Negotiators 
also must hammer out details of an international peacekeeping force 
whose composition has yet to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel split raised tensions between Rwanda, which backs the  
new rebel leadership, and Uganda, which offered Wamba refuge in the 
northeastern Congolese city of Kisangani. The city was the site of 
a pitched battle last week between Rwandan and Ugandan troops and 
the Congolese rebels affiliated with each side. 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan and Rwandan leaders met Aug. 16-17 to resolve their  
differences and halt hostilities. Further meetings were ongoing, 
Nyarugabo said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Close Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stock prices fell sharply today as the yen's  
strength battered export-oriented shares. The dollar dipped against 
the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 188.87 points,  
or 1.06 percent, to finish the day at 17,666.29. On Wednesday, the 
average closed down 240.25 points, or 1.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 111.06 yen in the late afternoon, down 0.26  
yen from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 111.14 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, export issues hurt by a resurgent yen led a  
steep tumble on the main index. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts companies with large markets abroad because  
it tends to make Japanese goods more expensive overseas and lowers 
the value of their dollar earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York on Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average  
finished at a record high 11,326.04 points, up 42.74, or 0.4 
percent. U.S. stocks shot up on investor confidence that the 
American economy can continue to grow without high inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 13.72 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,481.08. 
The TOPIX closed down 12.27 points, or 0.81 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 549.80 million shares, down from 650.14 million shares 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 837 to 355 on the first  
section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, while 123 issues were 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar started higher from its New  
York level after an overnight rally in U.S. Treasury bonds and the 
robust showing Wednesday on Wall Street attracted investor interest 
in the greenback. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greenback slipped again as investors remained bullish  
about the prospects for a Japanese economic rebound. The dollar was 
supported by the Nikkei's turn into negative territory, but dealers 
said the trend of overseas investment in Japanese stocks hasn't 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 110.76 yen and 111.23 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 115.72 yen, down  
from 116.84 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.9450 percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.9950 
percent, driving its price up to 99.62 yen from 99.20 yen.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Congress Readies for Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Setting the stage for a constitutional  
showdown, Venezuelan lawmakers vowed Thursday to resist a 
constitutional assembly's order that virtually shut down Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders said they would cut short their summer  
recess and reconvene Friday in a last-ditch effort to save their 
institution. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the assembly, which is dominated by supporters of  
President Hugo Chavez, banned the opposition-controlled Congress 
from passing laws and limited its duties. That ban came barely a 
week after the assembly also gave itself sweeping new judicial 
powers. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics warned that one of Latin America's oldest democracies  
was in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is nothing more than the continuation of a coup d'etat,''  
Jorge Olavarria, one of only six opposition delegates in the 
131-seat constitutional assembly, told The Associated Press. 
``Today there is no constitution, there is no Supreme Court, there 
is no Congress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez's supporters, however, say they simply are cleaning up  
some of the worst political corruption in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly president Luis Miquilena warned that lawmakers would be  
blocked from reconvening Congress, though he didn't say how. 
</P>
<P>
	Congressmen said they feared the National Guard would surround  
the Congress building or Chavez supporters would mass outside to 
keep the lawmakers from entering. If that happens, opposition Sen. 
Timoteo Zambrano said Congress will meet elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. State Department expressed concern Thursday that  
Venezuela's democracy may be threatened by the curbs placed on its 
Congress. Speaking in Washington, spokesman James B. Foley called 
for preserving the ``checks and balances'' among independent 
branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Supreme Court President Cecilia Sosa resigned after  
the court backed an assembly decree giving itself sweeping new 
powers to fire judges and overhaul the justice system. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembly members said they would prevent Congress from meeting  
Friday because it planned to pass laws aimed at obstructing the 
assembly's work. Congressional leaders denied that. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has allowed the assembly to use its building since the  
assembly started meeting three weeks ago to write a new 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, a former paratrooper who staged a failed coup attempt in  
1992, says a major shake-up of Venezuela's institutions is 
necessary to root out decades of bad government. Well over half the 
country's 23 million people live in poverty even though the country 
sits on more petroleum than any nation outside the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Venezuela, democracy is being born. Venezuela is coming out  
of tyranny. The entire world should recognize that,'' Chavez said 
in a speech Thursday at the Miraflores presidential palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez supporters, including his wife, brother and five of his  
former Cabinet ministers, captured 121 of the assembly's 131 seats 
in national elections last month. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a Supreme Court ruling in April to the contrary, Chavez  
contends that, as the nation's supreme power, the assembly can 
intervene in the other branches of government. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez says he is carrying out a ``peaceful revolution'' to  
replace corruption-riddled institutions with new, more democratic 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chavez has also come under fire for concentrating power in  
his own hands and giving the army a bigger, more political role in 
society -- appointing soldiers to top government posts, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	``Venezuela is marching definitively toward an authoritarian and  
absolutely totalitarian regime,'' Zambrano said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Chavez and Venezuela's financial sector announced an  
agreement Thursday to lower average lending rates two percentage 
points to between 35 percent and 38 percent. Banks will also 
increase deposit rates by one percentage point to between 6 percent 
and 12 percent and finance a $400 million program for small and 
medium-sized businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's economy went into a tailspin after prices for oil,  
its main export, hit a 12-year low last year. Oil prices have since 
rebounded, but the economy remains depressed and unemployment is 
estimated at up to 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Just Like Mike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	By now, most people know the story of how a young Tiger Woods  
taped a list of Jack Nicklaus' accomplishments to his wall to 
measure of his own progress in golf. Considering the way his TV 
commercials are taking off, Tiger might want to tape a list of 
Michael Jordan's sales figures alongside it. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday found Woods playing the opening round at the NEC  
Invitational, the second of three World Golf Championship events 
with a $5 million purse, But proving just how big he's become, 
Woods also turned up at the center of a tug-of-war between industry 
giants Nike and Titleist to see who would pay him how much to 
endorse what for how long. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Golf World magazine reported that Nike and  
Woods have begun renegotiating his original five-year, $40 million 
deal. Even though that contract has two more years to run, the 
magazine quoted sources saying his new deal would be worth between 
$80 million and $90 million in the next five-year span. It also 
said Titleist would cut in half its $4 million-per-year deal to 
have Woods endorse its clubs and ball. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the report at the NEC, Woods first replied, ``I  
can't say anything, because obviously if I did, I'd probably be in 
a lawsuit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But in response to another question, he said, ``It's not a done  
deal. And those numbers are awfully nice. I wish the numbers were 
that high. It would be nice. It definitely would be nice. But we'll 
see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Nike, which is paying Woods to endorse a line of  
golf apparel and shoes, have disputed the figures in the magazine 
report. But the company refuses to provide any specifics, citing 
the ongoing negotiations. Ditto for Mark Steinberg, Woods' agent at 
International Management, and officials at Titleist. 
</P>
<P>
	The one thing everybody agrees on, though, is that the impetus  
for this latest round of dealmaking was provided by two Nike 
commercials released this summer to a still-growing buzz. In one, 
he inspires a chorus of hackers at a driving range to hit drives 
beyond the 300-yard barrier; in the second, he bounces a ball on 
the face of a club -- between his legs and behind his back -- for 
nearly 30 seconds before whacking it, like a baseball player, into 
the distance. 
</P>
<P>
	Those ads became the basis for a lawsuit filed by Titleist,  
alleging false advertising and contract interference. Though 
company officials grouse in private about ``ambush advertising,'' 
what Titleist boss Wally Uihlein told Golf World was: ``What I do 
know is that I am continuing to pay out dollars to watch Nike use 
Tiger to sell their golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It comes as small consolation, but Nike golf spokesman Mike  
Kelly confirmed Thursday that Woods uses Titleist golf balls in 
both ads. And while Kelly is loathe to speculate on what Woods' new 
agreement with Nike would cover, he added, ``If we sign Tiger for a 
number of years, it could include product lines he doesn't 
currently endorse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No matter what the dollar figure in the contract Woods signs  
this time around, it will still leave him well short of Jordan's 
best season as an endorser. When he left the NBA last season, 
between selling to the suits and hanging on as a hero with the Hip 
Hop Nation, Jordan earned nearly $50 million off the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Impressive as that sounds, he was even more impressive over the  
long haul. Last June, Fortune magazine totaled what it called ``The 
Jordan Effect.'' It put his impact on the economy, since joining 
the NBA in 1984, at $10 billion. More than half that number, the 
magazine calculated wound up lining Nike's pockets. The company 
sold $2.6 billion in Jordan-related products and as the embodiment 
of the image Nike sought to promote, Forbes put his worth at twice 
actual sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was like the rising tide,'' Stephen Greyser, professor of  
marketing at Harvard Business School, told the magazine, ``raising 
all boats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever else comes out of the negotiations, it's clear that  
Nike intends to position Woods at the head of that fleet. Though he 
performed up to -- and perhaps beyond -- the company's expectations 
on the course, Tiger's first go-round in the stores was a major 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
	Nike has reorganized its golf division and redesigned its Tiger  
Woods line, and all of the publicity being stirred up by this 
latest controversy can only help push product. But with sales of 
golf apparel and shoes totaling $200 million last year, the 
likelihood is that Nike is aiming at a larger horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Jordan's sneakers, kids won't ever be wearing golf shoes  
to school. But the most recent national Golf Foundation survey, 
based on 1998 figures, put consumer spending on golf balls at $870 
million. And golfers spent another $3.6 billion on clubs, something 
Nike doesn't sell but might consider given what they've spent on 
Woods already. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has qualities that companies like to associate themselves  
with -- excellence, dominance in his sport and character. But the 
best thing about him,'' said Steinberg, who is paid to make Tiger's 
case, ``is that he's 23 and still growing every day.''

<HEADLINE> Double Murderer Gets Life Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In a bizarre case that drew national attention to  
the practices of bounty hunters, a man has been given two life 
prison sentences for killing a couple during a bogus bust two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sanders, 42, was sentenced Wednesday. There is no  
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of five masked and heavily armed men who burst into a  
Phoenix home in the dead of night on Aug. 31, 1997, and fatally 
shot a young couple in bed. The men claimed to be bounty hunters 
looking for a California bail jumper. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors later determined the story was a ruse, and the  
suspects were actually looking to ransack 25-year-old Christopher 
Foote's house in search of drugs and money. 
</P>
<P>
	Three suspects still await trial. A fourth pleaded guilty to  
second-degree murder in a plea agreement that required him to 
testify against Sanders, who was convicted of murder last October 
in a case that led to a new Arizona law governing bounty hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	The case took another strange twist when public defender Carmen  
Fischer was accused of having a jailhouse affair with Sanders. She 
has acknowledged only a ``personal relationship'' with him. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge removed Fischer from the case over conflict-of-interest  
concern and she could face disbarment. Sanders' family rehired her 
for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law was pretty clear that this wasn't a death penalty  
case, but the emotions ran very high in this case,'' Fischer said. 
``You never know until the final words are spoken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Gregory Martin said several circumstances  
did not allow for the death penalty, including evidence that the 
shooting was not planned beforehand and Foote apparently shot 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing, Sanders told the court he was haunted by the  
deaths of Foote and his girlfriend, Spring Wright, but blamed it on 
a shootout that Foote prompted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Chris several times to put his hands down and put the  
gun down. Instead, he shot me,'' Sanders said. ``Only then did I 
return fire because I was in fear for my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new state law, bounty hunters no longer can kick in  
doors to collar bail jumpers; they must first get permission to 
enter. Felons can't be bounty hunters, and wearing clothing or 
badges that gives the impression that a bounty hunter is a cop is 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the law could actually lure bail jumpers to  
Arizona.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland School Vouchers in Limbo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Sheila Bolek took the first call before 7 a.m.  
and then spent the rest of the morning trying to calm other furious 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is upset. They're in limbo. To find out one day you  
have a school and the next day you might not is very difficult,'' 
said Bolek, principal of Our Lady of Peace School. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of parents jammed school phone lines Wednesday, trying  
to sort out the confusion created by a federal judge's injunction 
against a school voucher program in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old pilot program, the only one of its kind in Ohio,  
allowed 4,000 students from kindergarten through sixth grade to 
receive up to $2,500 in tuition vouchers so they can attend private 
or religious schools at taxpayer expense. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. on Tuesday suspended the  
program until a trial determines whether it violates the 
constitutional separation of church and state. He said it appeared 
to have the ``primary effect of advancing religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parents and educators said the timing of the ruling -- during the  
week almost all schools started classes -- could not have been 
worse. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't start bothering me until today, the reality of my  
budget and how it would affect me. I'm pretty upset now,'' said Ivy 
Chambers, who uses voucher money to send two children to Bolek's 
private Roman Catholic school. 
</P>
<P>
	Our Lady of Peace is a defendant in a lawsuit that challenges  
Ohio's voucher program, which was one of the first in the nation. 
Milwaukee has had vouchers since 1990, and Florida began a 
statewide program this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleveland's Roman Catholic diocese, which could lose up to $3  
million in voucher money this school year, said Wednesday it would 
continue to accept voucher students pending an appeal of the 
decision by the state. 
</P>
<P>
	And the public school district told parents to wait before  
enrolling their children who receive vouchers in the 77,000-student 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	Private schools and pro-voucher groups vowed to find the $11.2  
million that the state has budgeted for the program this school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Luther Memorial School, which has more than half of its 130  
students in the voucher program, was considering asking church and 
community members to pick up student tuition as part of an ``adopt 
a student'' program, said principal Bill Ronschke. 
</P>
<P>
	The Institute for Justice, a pro-voucher group based in  
Washington, D.C., also said it will try to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
	And the New York-based Children's Scholarship Fund, which  
awarded 40,000 scholarships to low-income families nationwide in 
April to allow children to pay private school tuition, said it 
would help. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Kitchen, the legal guardian of her goddaughter's five  
children, said she spends about $8,000 a year on tuition. Only 
8-year-old Toshika is young enough to get voucher money to attend 
St. John Lutheran School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finally I have a chance to give my children hope of succeeding  
in the school system and they try to take it away,'' she said. ``I 
have no intention of putting my kids back in public schools. I'll 
get a loan or another job to keep the kids where they are.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Risk Low From Colo. Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A study on cancer risks stemming from secret  
radioactive and chemical releases at the former Rocky Flats nuclear 
weapons plant found few dangers, though warned of new risks caused 
by the ongoing cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-year study, released Thursday, is the most exhaustive  
examination of public risks from releases in the 1950s and 60s, but 
details remain unknown because of poor oversight by federal 
regulators and the defense industry's secrecy, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is the risks at Rocky Flats were low and the  
public was lucky that this was the case,'' said James LaVelle, a 
consulting toxicologist on the study. ``Many of the releases and 
risks could have been much worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	People with the highest risk of developing cancer from the  
releases were working outside the plant when smoke from a 1957 fire 
spread plutonium, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The risk was estimated from as high as one case in 10,000 to as  
low as one in 25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1957 fire was kept secret until 1969, the same year another  
fire released plutonium into the environment. Also, between 1,000 
and 5,000 tons of a chemical solvent leaked through air vents and 
waste barrels during the 1960s, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant, about 16 miles northwest of downtown Denver, began  
producing plutonium bombs and bomb parts in 1952. State officials 
in the 1980s raised concerns about potential health hazards, and 
the plant was closed after the FBI raided it in 1989 to investigate 
allegations of environmental crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the state advisory panel that oversaw the study  
cautioned there are still potential risks because of the $7 billion 
state and federal cleanup, estimated to take 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The citizens around the site are not out of the woods with  
regard to Rocky Flats,'' said John Till, president of Radiological 
Assessments Corp., which helped conduct the study. ``Something 
still could happen. The public needs to be aware of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Data for the study was incomplete. The gaps were the result of  
the defense industry's secrecy and lack of government oversight, 
particularly in the early years of the Cold War, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even know where all the stuff is. We don't have a  
record of where they buried some of the barrels,'' said Niels 
Schonbeck, a panel member and biochemistry professor at 
Metropolitan State College in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	After the FBI raid, a federal grand jury in 1992 returned  
indictments against key officials for plant manager Rockwell Corp. 
and the Energy Department, but then-U.S. Attorney Mike Norton 
refused to sign the indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	Some jurors denounced the government's failure to issue  
indictments, putting out a scathing report on its investigation. 
But the report was sealed. An edited version later became public. 
</P>
<P>
	The case ended with a controversial plea bargain that led  
Rockwell to pay $18.5 million in federal fines, but no individuals 
were charged.

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Raymond Vernon, an internationally  
renowned business expert whose specialties ranged from foreign 
trade to chocolate candy, has died. He was 85.

his tenure, the company successfully developed M&AMP;Ms 
chocolate-covered peanuts, and Vernon was dubbed ``the man who put 
the crunch in M&AMP;Ms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's relationship to M&AMP;Ms maker Mars Inc. was not  
clear. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Vernon was the Clarence Dillon  
professor on International Affairs Emeritus at Harvard University's 
John F. Kennedy School of Government. He was a former Herbert F. 
Johnson Professor of International Business Management Emeritus at 
Harvard Business School. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ray Vernon was one of the most influential scholars of his  
generation, a true pioneer in the study of multinational 
corporations and the international economy,'' said Harvard Business 
School Dean Kim Clark. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon was born in New York City on September 1, 1913. He  
received his bachelor's degree in 1933 from the College of the City 
of New York. He earned a doctorate in economics from Columbia 
University in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	He spent 24 years in the Securities and Exchange Commission and  
the Department of State working on the postwar recovery of Japan 
and Europe, before leaving for Hawley and Hoops. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon became a member of the Harvard faculty in 1959 and joined  
the Kennedy School in 1981. During his tenure there, he wrote 
several books, including ``In the Hurricane's Eye: The Troubled 
Prospects of Multinational Enterprises'' in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon is survived by two daughters, four grandchildren, and  
seven great-grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Doughnut Co. Buys Site for Gripes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMDEN, Conn. (AP) -- Dunkin' Donuts has purchased a Web site  
created to give customers a place to complain about everything from 
poor service to stale crullers. 
</P>
<P>
	David Felton, 25, ran the gripe site called dunkindonuts.org for  
two years until the company decided to purchase it. Felton said he 
cannot disclose the price as part of the June 30 agreement, but 
added that negotiations started at $1,070 and went up from there. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said in a statement Thursday that it ``encourages  
its customers to continue to send their feedback to 
www.dunkindonuts.org.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It all started when Felton couldn't get skim milk for his coffee  
at a Dunkin' Donuts' store in West Hartford. He posted the 
complaint on his personal Web site and began getting e-mail 
messages from other customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Visitors to my personal Web site began e-mailing me with their  
thoughts about Dunkin' Donuts, hoping I could work some sort of 
magic and force Dunkin' Donuts Inc. to listen to them,'' he said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum eventually attracted the attention of the doughnut  
company, which didn't have a similar feature on its own site, 
dunkindonuts.com. The company told Felton to stop using its name in 
his Web address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dunkin' Donuts did not want anything except for me to go  
away,'' Felton said. ``So I said, `OK, purchase my Web site.'''

<HEADLINE> Cardinals' Lineman Dye Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Arizona Cardinals gave offensive lineman  
Ernest Dye a reserve non-football-injury classification on Thursday 
while trimming the roster by five players. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardinals spokesman Paul Jensen said the team, while under no  
obligation, would continue to pay Dye's medical benefits, although 
it would no longer pay his salary. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye and two teammates were returning to training camp Aug. 16  
when they were injured in an auto accident. Dye's right arm was 
nearly torn off in the rollover and he may never regain full use of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who saved his arm by restoring blood vessels in one  
operation and grafting in nerves from his leg in another said 
Wednesday it will be months before any feeling returns. 
</P>
<P>
	He will be hospitalized at least two more weeks in Flagstaff,  
where the Cardinals train. 
</P>
<P>
	Dye, whose once-promising NFL career was limited to 50 games,  
including 23 starts, played with the Cardinals through 1996 and 
spent 1997 with the St. Louis Rams. 
</P>
<P>
	He was out of football last season, joining the Cardinals for a  
second tour on April 29. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Dye signed a ``split'' contract, common with  
players trying to restart a career. 
</P>
<P>
	The non-guaranteed agreement offered him $187,000 to start, but  
his salary would have risen to $400,000 -- the minimum for a 
five-year veteran -- had he made the 53-man final roster. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinals also waived four undrafted rookies -- former New  
Mexico State fullback Joey Dozier, Oklahoma State safety Ricky 
Thompson, UNLV wide receiver Damon Williams and Rutgers tight end 
Billy Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves reduced the Cardinals' active roster to 77 and left  
them with nine more cuts to make by Tuesday. Arizona has three 
World League exemptions and can carry 68 players until the final 
cut on Sept. 5.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Teen Meets E-Mail Pal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Her poignant e-mail messages from Kosovo  
chronicled her family's desperate situation much in the same way 
that Anne Frank's diaries put a human face on the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the girl's real name and face are no longer a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	``Adona,'' a 16-year-old ethnic Albanian whose Internet missives  
were read to thousands of listeners over National Public Radio, 
flew Wednesday to meet her e-mail pen pal from Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Kujtesa Bejtullahu kept her identity secret while her family hid  
from Serbians in the Kosovo capital of Pristina. She shared her 
thoughts and fears by e-mail with Finnegan Hamill, a 16-year-old 
Berkeley High School student and Youth Radio reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence began in January after a peace worker who had  
just returned from Kosovo visited Hamill's church and gave him the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejtullahu's messages often were filled with disturbing and  
violent accounts of the war. The girl said she regularly saw people 
being killed, routed from their homes and moved from place to place 
as they tried to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-March, the messages suddenly ceased, presumably because  
the electricity at her family's home had been cut off. Hamill kept 
a worried vigil as reports of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamill was able to make contact with Adona a few days later over  
the phone. She told him her family was huddled in their home with 
little food or water. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night, Hamill said he had butterflies in his stomach  
as he met her face-to-face with flowers and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejtullahu came to the United States along with three other  
teens from Pristina to complete her high school education. She is 
part of a group known as the PostPessimists, which campaigns 
against ethnic rivalry. While in Berkeley, Bejtullahu will stay 
with Gretchen Carlson, who heard the girl's messages on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel differently about Kujtesa, because I heard her words on  
NPR,'' Carlson said. ``I don't think any woman alive, especially a 
mother, didn't feel a helplessness at not being able to protect a 
child in circumstances like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The First Congregational Church of Berkeley has raised $25,000  
to support the teens during their stay, but $50,000 more is needed 
for tuition, clothing and health insurance.

	Conviction in 'Jenny Jones' Trial  
</P>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man who killed a gay acquaintance who  
had revealed a crush on him during a taping of ``The Jenny Jones 
Show'' was convicted today of second-degree murder for a second 
time. Jonathan Schmitz could be sentenced to life in prison for the 
March 1995 death of Scott Amedure, which occurred three days after 
the two taped a segment for the talk show. The episode never aired. 
Sentencing is scheduled for Sept. 14. Schmitz's attorney had sought 
a lesser verdict of manslaughter. Schmitz was found guilty of 
second-degree murder in 1996, but the verdict was thrown out on 
appeal due to errors in jury selection.

	Downpour Cripples NYC Rush Hour  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An early morning downpour today filled city  
streets with rainwater, crippled subways and commuter trains, and 
turned the rush hour into a slow, sodden slog. High water stranded 
drivers and forced pedestrians had to wade through intersections. 
Water cascaded into subway tunnels in Manhattan, cutting power on 
some lines when it washed over the tracks. The Harlem, Hudson and 
New Haven lines of the Metro-North railroad, which serves the 
city's northern suburbs, were halted at about 8:30 a.m. Some trains 
were stranded between stations.

century with Milosevic at its head, I will resign my Democratic 
Party post and will retire from political life,'' Zoran Djindjic

``get to the bottom'' of why it took the FBI six years to admit 
that its agents may have fired potentially flammable tear gas 
canisters on the final day of their standoff with the Branch 
Davidian cult near Waco, Texas. ``I have no reason at this point to 
believe the FBI is responsible for the deaths of those people,'' 
Reno told her weekly news conference at the Justice Department. But 
she said she was ``very, very frustrated'' that six years after 
categorical denials by the FBI there are news reports about the 
possible use of flammable devices.

	OLMSTED FALLS, Ohio (AP) -- A man stabbed three people aboard an  
Amtrak train outside Cleveland early today, then was wounded 
himself as passengers wrested the knife from him, police said. The 
man went through three cars of the Lakeshore Limited, stabbing 
people. Two of the victims were conductors. Police said the 
attacker apparently didn't know any of the victims. Two men are in 
stable condition at Cleveland MetroHealth Medical Center and two 
more people are at St. John West Shore Hospital. One of those taken 
to St. John is believed to be the suspect, whose left hand was

<HEADLINE> Burger King Ends West Bank Outlet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Burger King Corp. announced Thursday it has  
canceled the rights of an Israeli company to operate a 
controversial franchise in the West Bank and ordered the restaurant 
to remove the Burger King brand from the site immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami-based restaurant company said the franchisee, Rikamor  
Ltd., had violated an agreement by falsely stating the restaurant 
would be located in Israel. Burger King said it had made clear that 
it would not approve Rikamor opening restaurants in the West Bank 
at a sensitive time in the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Burger King regrets that its name and reputation have become  
entangled in matters that have nothing to do with providing quality 
food and service to its customers,'' said David Williams, president 
of Burger King in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Burger King said its decision was purely commercial and that it  
does not take sides in the Arab-Israeli peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	American-Arab and American-Muslim groups called last week for a  
worldwide boycott of Burger King for opening the restaurant in 
Maale Adumim, a settlement of 25,000 Jews just east of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish settlements, which are located throughout the West Bank,  
are at the center of the Middle East conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians hope to establish an independent country that  
includes the West Bank, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle 
East War. Muslim and Arab groups had said opening the Maale Adumim 
restaurant amounts to supporting Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are glad that Burger King came to realize that its  
participation in Israeli settlement activity was irresponsible and 
must end,'' said Hala Maksoud, president of the American-Arab 
Anti-Discrimination Committee in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``No respectable business should involve itself in any way with  
these illegal and immoral activities and we are delighted that 
Burger King has seen the light,'' Maksoud said. 
</P>
<P>
	But a leading Jewish civil rights group, the Anti-Defamation  
League, criticized Burger King. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to the company, ADL national director Abraham H.  
Foxman said the decision ``represents a blatant capitulation ... to 
American Arab and American Muslim organizations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are saddened by Burger King's clear surrender to the  
outrageous guerilla tactics employed by American Arab and American 
Muslim groups,'' Foxman added. 
</P>
<P>
	Yossi Hoffman, night manager at the Maale Adumim Burger King,  
said he had not heard of the decision to close the shop, although 
there had been rumors. He said he was not allowed to discuss the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Rikamor officials were not immediately available for comment  
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burger King operates more than 10,500 franchises around the  
world, including more than 40 in Israel. The company also has 80 
restaurants in the Gulf states of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman 
and the United Arab Emirates. It plans to open restaurants in 
Jordan, Bahrain, Egypt and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Firefighters Battle Western Blazes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Thousands of firefighters are battling  
blazes across the West, where lightning, wind, 100-degree heat and 
low humidity have fueled the flames as vacationers head to the 
forests for late-summer camping. 
</P>
<P>
	About 300 wildfires, mostly caused by lightning, were raging in  
California, Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Idaho. The blazes have burned 
at least 40,000 acres of brush and trees and are blamed for at 
least one death. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of residents of the Antelope Valley in Nevada, 10 miles  
north of Reno, and in Butte County in northeastern California, were 
evacuated for up to a day. All had returned to their homes by 
Wednesday. Firefighters saved virtually all threatened structures. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the blazes have been in Northern California, where  
National Weather Service forecasts worried firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're predicting some very serious conditions for what's  
going on now,'' said Karen Terrill of the California Department of 
Forestry, which has deployed 75 percent of its 6,700 firefighters. 
``It's supposed to remain hot and dry. And a new weather system is 
coming in that will include lightning with very little rain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Federal firefighters have requested help from as far away as  
North Dakota and Tennessee, U.S. Forest Service spokeswoman Katy 
Coulter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Expecting a surge of late-summer campers, forest officials  
warned vacationers that campfires are banned in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, one of four grass and sagebrush fires threatened  
about 60 ranch homes in the Antelope Valley. The 4,500-acre fire 
was 80 percent contained Wednesday and residents were allowed to 
return. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oregon, a wildfire charred 5,000 acres of grass and brush on  
the Sheldon-Hart National Wildlife Refuge and an 1,100-acre fire 
was burning brush on federal land near Prineville. 
</P>
<P>
	In Northern California, heavy smoke from approximately 100  
blazes drifted through the Central Valley, adding a choking haze to 
triple-digit heat in Sacramento. Michelle Bruno, 36, of Oroville 
was found burned to death in a vehicle Tuesday along a dirt road 
near Lake Oroville. 
</P>
<P>
	In California's Stanislaus National Forest, about 700  
firefighters carved a bare-earth control line around half of a 
3,320-acre brush and timber blaze, which was 50 percent contained 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightning also caused fires that burned nearly 6,000 acres in  
two wilderness areas of Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	A 700-acre fire sparked by a car crash in the Angeles National  
Forest, about 45 miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles, was 
reported 25 percent contained today. Firefighters fought back the 
flames as they surged toward communications towers.

<HEADLINE> Three Stabbed on Amtrak Train </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OLMSTED FALLS, Ohio (AP) -- A man stabbed and wounded two  
conductors and a passenger aboard an Amtrak train outside Cleveland 
early today, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	A suspect was arrested when a passenger, in a crowd leaving the  
stopped train, told police, ``That's him. That's him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect stabbed a conductor, then started slashing at people  
within his reach, wounding the two other victims, Olmsted Township 
police Chief Dennis McCafferty said. The suspect was wounded in a 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	The three victims and the suspect were hospitalized, as was a  
fifth person who complained of chest pains. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said there was no apparent motive, adding they didn't  
believe the suspect knew the victims. An 8-inch knife was found in 
the suspect's pants. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrolman Kim Kort, a crime scene technician, said it appeared  
the attack began in a dining car. It wasn't immediately clear 
whether some of the victims were stabbed in other cars, but police 
found heavy blood in two other cars and blood trails through four. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Franz, 17, of Detroit, was asleep when a wounded  
conductor stumbled into her compartment and fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was such a shock,'' said Franz, who was on her way to  
school at Smith College in Massachusetts. ``I'm just glad it's 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lake Shore Limited, which runs daily between Chicago and New  
York, was approaching Cleveland with 330 people aboard when the 
attacks began at about 1 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	A conductor stopped the train in Olmsted Falls, 14 miles  
southwest of Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``When officers got on the scene there was a lot of pandemonium.  
People were pouring out of the train,'' McCafferty said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCafferty said he could not verify an earlier report that the  
suspect apparently was wounded as passengers wrested the knife from 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect and victims were not identified. The other  
passengers were taken on buses to Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	One stabbing victim, a man in his mid-30s, was likely to have  
surgery for wounds to his cheek and jaw, said Patrick Garmone, a 
spokesman at St. John West Shore in suburban Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
	A woman in her mid-50s who complained of chest pains and anxiety  
was in stable condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 52-year-old man stabbed in the head was in surgery at  
Cleveland MetroHealth Medical Center, spokesman Kelly Goodale said. 
A 26-year-old man stabbed in the shoulder and chin was in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodale said the 41-year-old suspect was in stable condition.  
</P>
<P>
	Jackie Mallory, 50, of Chicago, was still shaking when she  
stepped off the train for the bus trip into Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a long night,'' she said.

	While about 60,000 shares were involved in the trades, there  
wasn't enough volume to match up most buyers and sellers as more 
than 1,000 orders went unfilled. And it was a drop in the bucket 
when compared with the 1.8 billion shares traded during the day on 
the major exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, organizers of the new exchange were pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	The new session from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. EDT is being offered  
Monday through Thursday for customers of Discover Brokerage and 
Dreyfus Brokerage Services on an electronic exchange named 
MarketXT. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to tell you the launch was successful,'' MarketXT  
chief executive Michael Sanderson said Wednesday night. ``The 
system is working as planned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Software giant Microsoft grabbed top honors as the most active  
issue for the session -- though with just 5,500 shares changing 
hands, the term ``most active'' was a bit of a stretch. The 
software maker finished the MarketXT session at $95.56 1/4 a share, a 
gain of 25 cents from the closing Nasdaq quote. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch of MarketXT, formerly named Eclipse Trading, comes  
amid a suddenly fierce scramble to roll out extended hours for 
individual investors as the stock market hits new highs. The Dow 
Jones industrial average set another record on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have already demonstrated an appetite for making  
portfolio decisions at home, where they have more privacy and time 
to think. An estimated 20 percent to 25 percent of online trades 
are placed outside normal hours, and then executed when regular 
trading resumes in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	While other brokerages and alternative markets have announced  
plans to extend their trading hours in the coming months, only the 
discount broker Datek Online had launched an after-hours session 
before Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	MarketXT takes after-hours trading a step forward because the  
late session on Datek's Island ECN exchange only runs for an hour 
and fifteen minutes after the regular 4 p.m. EDT close of the New 
York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Hurricanes Planning Tough Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- Miami Hurricanes assistant coach Greg  
Schiano uses one word -- actually, three words -- to describe his 
defensive scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attack, attack, attack,'' he says.  
</P>
<P>
	Schiano is the Hurricanes' new defensive coordinator, and he'll  
unveil his approach in Sunday's season opener against ninth-ranked 
Ohio State in the Kickoff Classic. The game is a stiff test for a 
defense that has often been the Hurricanes' downfall in recent 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Miami gave up 24 rushing touchdowns, a school record.  
In 1998, the Hurricanes allowed 20 passing touchdowns, another 
school record. Last year, they finished last in the Big East 
Conference in pass defense and gave up 111 points in the final two 
regular-season games against Syracuse (a 66-13 loss) and UCLA (a 
49-45 victory). 
</P>
<P>
	When defensive coordinator Bill Miller departed for Michigan  
State, Hurricanes coach Butch Davis hired Schiano, 33. The new 
coordinator plans a more aggressive scheme, with tighter pass 
coverage and linemen intent on penetration. 
</P>
<P>
	Such an approach can be risky against a team like the Buckeyes,  
who return 1,235-yard rusher Michael Wiley and a trio of three-year 
starters in the offensive line. On the other hand, the Hurricanes 
may be able to force sophomore Austin Moherman into mistakes in his 
first start at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants to talk about the scheme,'' Schiano says. ``But  
the biggest thing we've talked about is consistency. We have to 
stop the run, win third down and come up with the deep ball when we 
have the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schiano (pronounced She-AH-no) was a defensive backfield coach  
for Joe Paterno at Penn State from 1990-96. He spent the past three 
seasons as a defensive assistant with the Chicago Bears under coach 
Dave Wannstedt, now assistant head coach of the Miami Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	That's a lot of experience for someone Schiano's age.  
</P>
<P>
	``Greg is probably as conscientious and smart as any young coach  
I've been around,'' Wannstedt says. ``I don't know how much talent 
Miami has, but he'll get the most out of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schiano is considered a coach on the rise, and a return to the  
NFL could be in his future. But for now, he's focused on bonding 
with his young Hurricanes players. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids have to believe what they're doing is the right thing,''  
he says. ``You can have a one-man rush, and if they believe it's 
the right thing, they'll do it well. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to see how you can help them get better. It's more  
prevalent in the NFL, but if a guy sees you as someone who can help 
them get better, they'll listen to every word you say. If they see 
you as someone who's full of it, they're not going to listen to you 
and they're not going to respect you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis says the players are listening to Schiano.  
</P>
<P>
	``The kids know he's honest and fair, and his work ethic is  
unquestioned,'' Davis says. ``He's creative, energetic, 
enthusiastic and passionate about the way he wants his players to 
play. He's a great addition to the staff.''

<HEADLINE> Jarrett Knows Bristol's Challenge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRISTOL, Tenn. (AP) -- Recent history suggests Bristol Motor  
Speedway will play an important role in deciding the 1999 Winston 
Cup championship. 
</P>
<P>
	In four of the previous five years, the driver who captured the  
title did so after winning a race on Bristol's high-banked concrete 
oval earlier in the season. Dale Jarrett hopes to continue that 
trend in 1999 with a victory in the Goody's 500 on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``After winning at Bristol, a lot of other places seem easier to  
conquer,'' said Jarrett, who won the Goody's 500 two years ago. 
``The driver has to be in good shape and ready to run 500 tough 
laps and use his head for all 500 of those laps. All of those 
characteristics and qualities are what make our champions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett was understandably cautious as he prepared for today's  
practice and first-round qualifying on Bristol's .533-mile layout. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 12 events left on this year's schedule, the ones at  
Bristol and Talladega, Ala., could pose the biggest threat to 
Jarrett's 314-point lead in the season standings. Both tracks have 
a well-deserved reputation for spawning multicar wrecks, the kind 
that can create substantial shifts in points chases. 
</P>
<P>
	At Talladega, where the circuit heads in October, the culprits  
are carburetor restrictor plates, which help bunch up cars and lead 
to chaos when a wreck occurs. At Bristol, the culprits are the 
36-degree banked turns, which help cars record lap times in the 
15-second range, creating conditions where a driver can roar up on 
the scene of a wreck before he has time to take evasive action. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you sit down and look, anywhere can get you,'' Jarrett  
said, ``but if you look at two of the tracks we have left on the 
schedule, Bristol and Talladega are the ones that are 
unpredictable. You can be running along in good shape, and then 
from nowhere something happens and you don't have time to react.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett, who finished third when the circuit stopped at Bristol  
in April, is one of several drivers to have experienced recent 
success on the tricky track in the northeast Tennessee foothills. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Martin, the driver closest to Jarrett in the 1999  
standings, has 14 top-five finishes at Bristol, including three 
victories. He was second in the April race after winning last 
year's Goody's 500. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in last August's night race was his first following  
the death of his father, Julian, in a plane crash, and it left 
Martin in tears in Victory Lane. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of emotion a year ago for me,'' Martin said.  
``I felt that there were a lot of people pulling for me to win 
because of the loss I had just experienced, and I felt there was a 
lot of additional emotion from the fans as well as from me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rusty Wallace got the first of his 49 Winston Cup victories at  
Bristol in 1986 and has won six more times on the track since then, 
including a dominating performance in April. He started on the pole 
after setting a new track qualifying record of 125.142 mph, and he 
went on to lead 425 of the race's 500 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	But the car Wallace used that day was destroyed in a crash at  
Long Pond, Pa., in June, and his team is bringing a new Ford to 
Bristol this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did it in the spring,'' Wallace said, ``and we can do it  
again this weekend.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Gordon has won races at Bristol in each of the last four  
years, but all have come in the spring race. He could enhance his 
bid for a third consecutive Winston Cup title with a victory under 
the lights at Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon is staging a late-season push, finishing in the top three  
in eight of the last 11 races, moving him from sixth to fourth in 
the standings. Nonetheless, Gordon is still 467 points off 
Jarrett's lead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bristol has been a good track for us. When we've been able to  
avoid the wrecks, we've finished up front,'' Gordon said. ``On 
Friday we'll concentrate on having a good qualifying run and 
establish good track position from the beginning.''

<HEADLINE> US Ends Permanent Presence in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Nearly five years after sending  
thousands of troops into Haiti to restore democracy, the United 
States is replacing its permanent military presence with temporary 
missions, U.S. officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington says the move will allow it to target areas of the  
impoverished Caribbean nation that need the most support. 
</P>
<P>
	But some Haitians fear the change, coupled with the impending  
end of a United Nations mission, could encourage enemies of an 
already dysfunctional democracy -- even though in recent years the 
small U.S. force has played only a humanitarian role. 
</P>
<P>
	``International support for our fragile democracy remains  
indispensable,'' said Jean-Claude Bajeux, a human rights activist. 
``In the back of everybody's mind is the fear of anarchy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns seem to be widely shared.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any change in U.S. policy to Haiti scares us,'' said Jeanine  
Pierre-Louis, a 20-year-old student in Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative politician Hubert Deronceray agreed: ``No lucid  
Haitian wants the United States to drop Haiti from its agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In September 1994, President Clinton ordered 20,000 U.S. troops  
into Haiti to end three years of bloody military-backed rule, 
restore a democratically-elected government, and stem the flow of 
Haitian boat people to Florida shores. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States passed the baton to the United Nations in  
March 1995, and the world body's mission turned to helping train a 
new Haitian police force that replaced the demobilized Haitian 
army. 
</P>
<P>
	Since March 1996, the 450-member U.S. Support Group has had  
non-combat military personnel drill wells, build bridges, roads and 
schools, and run a field hospital in Port-au-Prince. Its operations 
cost $20 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	That mission will likely end by January, said Navy Lt. Jane  
Campbell, spokeswoman for the U.S. Southern Command in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a program in effect elsewhere in Latin America, Southern  
Command will deploy National Guard and reservist units to Haiti on 
a routine basis. The numbers will depend on individual missions, 
Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart confirmed plans to ``move  
from a permanent force that's there under this configuration and 
replace it with rotational assistance teams.'' But he stressed: 
``The U.S. military is not withdrawing from Haiti.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti's government had no formal reaction to the changeover. But  
many Haitian politicians have called for the withdrawal of all the 
U.S. troops, saying their presence is an affront to national 
sovereignty. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. military presence in Haiti also has drawn fire from  
Republicans in Congress who claim the Clinton administration failed 
to restore democracy in Haiti and that there is a security threat 
to the U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Southern Command chief Gen. Charles Wilhelm  
recommended the withdrawal of the U.S. Support Group because of 
increased political turmoil in Haiti. Campbell said she was unaware 
of any threats directed at the U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Paralyzed by political stalemate, Haiti had no effective  
government from June 1997, when Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to 
protest rigged elections, until this year, when President Rene 
Preval dismissed Parliament and appointed a new premier and 
electoral council by decree. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti had planned a new round of legislative and municipal  
elections for November, but problems organizing the vote could 
delay the ballot until December. 
</P>
<P>
	Haiti also continues to be plagued by crime, corruption,  
allegations of police brutality and an ineffective judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the U.S. Support Group phaseout, the U.N. police  
mission is scheduled to leave Haiti on Nov. 30. U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan said Wednesday the U.N. departure had 
raised security concerns and suggested some form of a U.N. presence 
should remain in the Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Support Group, which made tens of thousands of health  
calls in Port-au-Prince slums, will close its base near the 
international airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Horizons training exercises will take place throughout  
the country. Training units will come frequently, stay for short 
periods, and camp on their field of operation.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Lawyers Must Pay $153,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge ordered Latrell Sprewell's  
lawyers to pay $153,000 for arguing a lawsuit that challenged the 
basketball star's 68-game suspension for choking his coach. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker first dismissed the suit in  
July 1998, gave Sprewell another chance to remedy its defects, then 
dismissed it again last March. He said the suit was virtually 
identical to the previous, meritless case, and called it a misuse 
of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Walker told the lawyers to pay $113,000 to the  
NBA's lawyers for their costs of defending against the suit, 
$35,000 to the Golden State Warriors' lawyers for defense costs, 
and $5,000 to the court for ``this waste of judicial resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell argued with Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo during a  
practice in December 1997, then grabbed him around the neck and 
threatened to kill him, according to witnesses at his arbitration 
hearing. After they were separated and Sprewell left the floor to 
shower and change, he returned and, according to witnesses, punched 
Carlesimo and threatened him again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Warriors initially suspended him for 10 games, then  
terminated the last three years and $24 million of his contract. 
The league increased the suspension to a year. But an arbitrator 
ruled the punishment excessive and ordered Sprewell reinstated in 
July 1998, reducing his salary loss to $6.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He was then traded to the New York Knicks and led them to the  
NBA finals, where they lost to San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell's lawsuit said his punishment was not authorized by the  
league's union agreement. He also claimed racial discrimination, 
saying white players had been treated more leniently for physical 
attacks and also alleging that the Warriors had insisted on broader 
rights to terminate his contract than they had demanded in white 
players' contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Walker's ruling in March said the punishment was authorized and  
the evidence Sprewell cited, even if proven, would not show his 
treatment was racially motivated.

<HEADLINE> NASA Says New Telescope Works Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Crystal clear images of an exploding star  
confirmed that NASA's new $1 billion X-ray telescope is performing 
as expected, space agency officials and scientists said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The orbiting telescope, called the Chandra X-ray Observatory,  
captured as its first view an image of the Cassiopeia A supernova, 
a star in the Milky Way galaxy that exploded about 300 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The image contains such detail of the explosion and its  
surrounding cloud that scientists say they have detected evidence 
of what may be a black hole near its center, a National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration announcement said. 
</P>
<P>
	A second image released Thursday shows an X-ray jet streaming  
some 200,000 light years into intergalactic space from a quasar 
some 6 billion light years away. 
</P>
<P>
	Quasars are distant, very energetic stellar objects that may  
spew forth X-rays and visible light equal to the total brightness 
of trillions of stars. A light year is the distance light travels 
across space in a year, about 6 trillion miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, the world's largest and most sensitive X-ray telescope,  
was launched July 23, and is still undergoing orbital checkout and 
calibration tests. But officials said the initial images show that 
the space telescope ``is in excellent health,'' a NASA statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were astounded by these images,'' Harvey Tananbaum,  
director of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory's Chandra 
X-ray Center in Cambridge, Mass., said in a statement. He said the 
images show in detail the shock wave racing away from the supernova 
center at millions of miles an hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``This observatory is ready to take its place in the history of  
spectacular scientific achievements,'' Martin Weisskopf, the 
Chandra Project Scientist, said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Kirshner, a Harvard University astronomer, said in a NASA  
statement that Chandra's ability to make high quality X-ray images 
of the universe ``will have an impact on virtually every area of 
astronomy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra joins NASA's fleet of orbiting observatories that  
include the Hubble Space Telescope, which collects images in 
visible light, and the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, which studies 
gamma ray emissions in the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra operates from a high orbit, ranging from 6,000 to 86,400  
miles above the Earth. It detects X-rays, an invisible radiation 
that spews out from stars and fields of hot gas, such as those that 
might surround a black hole. Heated heavy elements in space give 
off X-rays of specific intensities. Chandra will be able to measure 
those intensities and identify specific elements, shedding new 
light on fundamental processes in the universe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra was named in honor of Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, a  
pioneer astronomer at the University of Chicago and a winner of the 
Nobel Prize.

<HEADLINE> Rain Helping Drought in East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Rain has turned the grass green again and  
produced buds on trees along the parched East Coast, but a lot more 
is needed to end the drought that has stunted crops, turned lawns 
brown and led to restrictions on water use. 
</P>
<P>
	``A drought is not something that we can say, `Hey, it's rained,  
now its over,''' said meteorologist Mark Tobin of AccuWeather. ``A 
drought is a big, huge monster that slowly develops over time and 
slowly goes away over time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four to 6 inches of rain helped fill ponds and reservoirs in  
North Carolina on Wednesday. Parched sections of Maryland have 
received up to 7 inches since Wednesday. A drenching Thursday in 
New York City dumped 3 inches in about two hours in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
	However, most of the mid-Atlantic region still has a rainfall  
deficit of up to 13 inches. And Hurricane Dennis might not make 
make much difference even if it pushes some wet weather through 
Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania in the coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's helping, but a lot of the damage has been done. It's a  
little late,'' said Abe Harpster, whose corn crop is supposed to 
feed a 2,000-cow dairy herd in south-central Pennsylvania. 
Harpster's farm got more than 3 1/2 inches last week, plus another 
inch in a half-hour Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy storms in New Jersey have led state officials to consider  
easing water restrictions, which include a ban using lawn 
sprinklers. 
</P>
<P>
	The drought has been building for nearly a year, with lack of  
precipitation through the winter combined with a dry spring and hot 
summer. Only months of above-average rain can replace lost 
moisture, said Melody Paschetag, a hydrologist for the National 
Weather Service in Sterling, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, people can't help but notice the spring-like colors  
returning to the landscape. 
</P>
<P>
	Marci Smit, who lives in Columbia, Md., said her family has done  
its part to conserve, letting the lawn turn brown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We enjoy our yard,'' Ms. Smit said. ``We understand that we  
have to do our part. We only water our plants with a hose. It's 
been looking pretty sad, but I've noticed in the last week, it has 
started to green up a bit with the little rain we've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the drought, North Carolina was declared a disaster  
area by the federal government Thursday, joining Kentucky, West 
Virginia, Delaware, Massachusetts and South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> Okla. School Bus Crash Kills One </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IDABEL, Okla. (AP) -- When Sheilah Hankins saw a wreck on her way  
to work at Forest Grove School, she turned off the highway before 
getting close enough to recognize the overturned school bus. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher's assistant didn't realize that one of her school's  
students had been killed in the accident Wednesday morning or that 
19 other children and the driver were injured when a logging truck 
slammed into the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never dreamed it was the school bus,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hankins soon learned her mistake, and her first thought was  
of her daughter, 9-year-old Amberly Bean, a passenger on the bus. 
Ms. Hankins drove back to the scene and searched frantically, 
eventually finding the child sitting on the grass surrounded by 
students on stretchers. Her daughter's only injury was a skinned 
knee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling so lucky that my kid is OK,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The child who died was identified as 13-year-old Johnny Valdez.  
Five of the other 20 children on the bus and school Superintendent 
Wes Watson, who was driving, remained hospitalized early today. 
</P>
<P>
	The others students, ranging in age from 5 to 14, were treated  
and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The 125-student school, which serves a mostly rural area near  
Idabel, in southeastern Oklahoma, canceled classes after 
Wednesday's accident. 
</P>
<P>
	State Highway Patrol officials said Watson had stopped at a stop  
sign, then pulled out into the path of the logging truck. The bus 
almost made it across, but was struck in the right rear corner and 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	Idabel firefighter Jimmy Davis said emergency workers pulled  
children from the rear emergency exit and began treating their 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were kids everywhere,'' he said. ``They were screaming  
and hollering. Then there were people driving up and screaming that 
their children were on the bus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators said it appeared truck driver Gary Westbrook tried  
to steer around the bus.

<HEADLINE> Michael Johnson Breaks 400m Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Michael Johnson smashed the  
longest-standing men's track record tonight, winning his fourth 
straight 400-meter gold medal at the World Championships with a 
clocking of 43.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson destroyed the field at Seville's Estadio Olimpico to  
shave 0.11 seconds off the 11-year-old mark of fellow American 
Butch Reynolds, who ran 43.29 in Zurich on Aug. 17, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	It was an electrifying performance reminiscent of Johnson's  
spectacular record-setting 19.32 seconds in the 200 meters at the 
1996 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the opportunity was there to get the world record  
because I'm in great shape,'' Johnson said. ``It's a world 
championships and the motivation was there. I just wanted to make 
sure I didn't mess up the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson said he can run even faster.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can do better, you know,'' he said. ``But it's a world  
record. I broke the world record in the 200 and then shattered it. 
I think I can do the same thing in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of shape I'm in, I know I can run 42 seconds. I  
refuse to believe I can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second time in 31 years that the 400 record has  
been broken. Lee Evans' record of 43.86, set at the 1968 Mexico 
Olympics, stood for 20 years before Reynolds broke it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he started thinking about breaking the 400 record  
when he was in college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always wanted this record,'' he said. ``This completes  
the circle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's split time after 100 meters was 10.9, 21.0 after 200,  
and 31.3 after 300. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson blazed down the final straight, legs churning in his  
upright style, accelerating more than 10 meters ahead of the field. 
As soon as he crossed the line and saw his time, he threw up his 
arms in triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson posed for photos next to the scoreboard flashing his  
time. Then he sprawled on his back on the track before grabbing an 
American flag and taking a victory lap, slapping hands with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was handed a hand-painted sign saying, ``Record -- 43.18,  
Johnson,'' and he held it up to the crowd as he jogged around the 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	``That time is unbelievable,'' said British runner Jamie Baulch,  
who finished eighth. ``This is the first time I've ever spoken to 
him. I just had to give him a hug. I just told him he was 
unbelievable. That's on a par with 19.32.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The second-place finisher, Brazil's Sanderlei Parrela, was more  
than a second behind Johnson in 44.29. Mexico's Alejandro Cardenas 
took the bronze in 44.31, while American Jerome Young settled for 
fourth in 44.36. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had been chasing Reynolds' 400 title throughout the  
1990s. He had come close three times, with clockings of 43.39, 
43.44 and 43.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson has dominated the 400 for a full decade and had an  
undefeated streak from 1989 to 1997. But over the past few years, 
he has been troubled by injuries in the hip and pelvis areas. 
</P>
<P>
	But the 31-year-old Texan had declared that he planned to go for  
the record in Seville, and he proved true to his word. 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell over the crowd as Johnson, wearing black and gold  
shoes, settled into the starting blocks on a clear, warm evening 
that offered perfect conditions for his record attempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The near capacity crowd in the 60,000-seat stadium roared  
throughout the one-lap race, with the noise getting louder as 
Johnson surged further in front and was clearly poised to smash the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken at these championships,  
coming on the sixth day of the nine-day event. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Cathy Freeman of Australia surged ahead in the final 50  
meters to retain her title in the women's 400. She clocked 49.67 
seconds, the second fastest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's pole vault, Maxim Tarasov of Russia succeeded  
Sergei Bubka as world champion, vaulting 19 feet, 9 inches to 
defeat Dmitriy Markov of Australia and Aleksandr Averbukh of 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	Gete Wami of Ethiopia won the women's 10,000 meters, coming from  
behind in the last lap to overcome the favorite, Britain's Paula 
Radcliffe, in a championship record time of 30 minutes, 24.56 
seconds. Tegla Loroupe of Kenya took the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, Marion Jones withdrew from the World Championships, a  
day after pulling up with a back injury in the semifinals of the 
200 meters. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's out of the championships,'' said her agent, Charlie  
Wells. ``She's still walking around and we're evaulating her. She 
still has muscle spasms in her lower back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Jones would be out the rest of the season, Wells  
said, ``We still need a couple of days to make that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, the sport's top female star, came to the championships  
seeking a record four gold medals. 
</P>
<P>
	She won the 100 meters Sunday in a season's best 10.70 seconds  
but settled for bronze Monday in the long jump. In addition to the 
200, she had planned to run in one of the relays. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jones' championships ended in agony Wednesday night when she  
crumbled onto the track during her 200 semifinal and was carried 
off on a gurney. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by USA Track and Field said, ``Marion is in  
good spririts but is still experiencing back pain and occasional 
spasms. Her medical team continues to assess the nature of her 
injury and provide treatment.' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' husband, shot put champion C.J. Hunter, refused to  
comment when approached at his Seville hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-time champion Ludmila Engquist continued her amazing  
comeback from breast cancer by winning her quarterfinal heat in the 
100-meter hurdles in 12.65 seconds. The Russian-born Swede was 
diagnosed with cancer in March, had her right breast removed in 
April, and has been undergoing chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	American Gail Devers clocked the fastest time in the four heats  
(12.53), a personal season's best. Nigeria's Glory Alozie and world 
indoor champion Olga Shishigina won the other two heats. 
</P>
<P>
	Heptathlon champion Eunice Barber of France failed to qualify  
for the hurdles semfinals, finishing sixth in her heat in 13.09. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had intended to use the Seville championships as a dress  
rehearsal for next year's Sydney Olympics and a bid for an 
unprecedented five gold medals.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Addicts Getting Scholarships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Four years ago, Adrian Corral sat in a  
dank prison, wracked by convulsions from cocaine withdrawal and 
filled with thoughts of hanging himself with a bedsheet. He 
survived his four-year sentence for drug dealing only because he 
lacked the nerve to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
	Now Corral, 34, is going to college under a program at Texas  
Tech University that gives recovering addicts scholarships for 
staying clean, getting good grades and attending recovery meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	It may be the first program of its kind in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
	The addicts-to-scholars program, started four years ago at the  
Texas Tech Center for Addiction Studies, rewards participants 
regardless of their previous academic careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Corral, who had only a high school education, is getting a  
bachelor's degree and hopes to attend medical school and become a 
pathologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be a part of law enforcement and I realize that I  
can't do that because of my history,'' he said. ``But at least this 
way I can be a part of the process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Andersen, director of the center and himself a recovering  
alcoholic, founded the program. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a situation where you've got someone in charge who  
doesn't know what he is dealing with,'' said Andersen, who carries 
in his pocket a golden medallion inscribed ``16'' for the number of 
years he has been sober. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was going to lose my wife and family and everything that  
meant anything to me,'' he said. ``Now I'm giving others the chance 
to save their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get in, participants must show that they have been in drug or  
alcohol rehab for at least a year. That, a high school diploma or 
equivalency degree and Andersen's faith are the only requirements 
for acceptance into the program, which admits around 100 
undergraduates each year. 
</P>
<P>
	The scholarship money comes from private sources, including  
rehabilitation groups and former students who are in recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never heard of a program like that and I like the idea,''  
said Dr. Herbert Klebert, former U.S. deputy drug czar and director 
of Columbia University's Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse. 
Officials at the National Association of Colleges were also unaware 
of any similar rehab program. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of money a student gets depends on the participant's  
grades: a 4.0 grade-point average earns $2,000 per semester, a 3.5 
is worth $1,500, a 3.0 gets $1,000 for a 3.0, and a 2.5 earns $500. 
Participants have to pay the rest of their expenses. Tuition and 
fees at Texas Tech are typically $2,500 per semester. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything less than a 2.5 GPA and students can be kicked out of  
the program. They also can be removed for poor attendance at class 
or recovery meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have deans sometimes tell me that I'm being too hard on  
students,'' Andersen said. ``But one of the first signs of a 
reversion back to a substance is tardiness or absence from 
scheduled events.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen said only 5 percent of participants have reverted to  
drug or alcohol abuse. The National Substance Abuse Institute says 
54 percent of all abusers in recovery programs nationwide 
backslide. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly as impressive is the participants' overall GPA of 3.67,  
compared with a 3.42 for Tech undergraduates. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Weiner, spokesman for White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey,  
called the program ``enlightened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The program keeps them out of crime,'' Weiner said. ``Programs  
like these are in the public interest. How can anyone be against 
that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	University officials call Andersen ``cutting-edge'' and  
``visionary.'' But Andersen said the president of the university at 
the time laughed when he first proposed the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	``He funneled a bunch of people my way that said stuff like,  
'I've got a son who has never touched a drug in his life and he 
can't get scholarship money,''' Andersen recalled. ```Why should we 
give it to someone who has been snorting cocaine? And do we really 
want people like that on campus?''' Andersen acknowledged: ``I live 
in horrible fear that one day, one of these students will do 
something to embarrass or bring down the program.'' After all, many 
of the 600 students who have been in the program have prison 
records, some for violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the opportunity to give addicts a second chance is  
worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to help people build something that is worth not  
destroying,'' Andersen said. ``These aren't people who are dumb or 
don't have a brain. They've just burned every possible bridge and 
won't be able to break the cycle unless someone, somewhere takes a 
chance on them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because none of Andersen's students has gotten into serious  
trouble -- most, in fact, are older than 25 and live off campus -- 
many parents are unaware of the program. Several Tech students said 
they have no problem with recovering addicts getting scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	``The truth is that at Tech, many students are Christian and  
believe in giving a person another chance,'' said Brent Jacobs, 19. 
``There but for the grace of God go I.''

<HEADLINE> FBI Begins New Waco Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI is launching an internal inquiry into  
why it took six years to admit that agents may have fired 
potentially flammable tear gas canisters on the final day of the 
1993 standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	As the bureau reversed six years of categorical public denials  
that flammable devices were used, Attorney General Janet Reno and 
FBI Director Louis Freeh ordered 40 FBI agents led by an FBI 
inspector to re-interview everyone who was at the Waco scene. 
</P>
<P>
	They are to report ``within weeks'' on all aspects of the use of  
military-type tear gas and why it took so long to be admitted 
publicly, FBI spokesman John Collingwood said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, the chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety  
told The Dallas Morning News that federal officials need to explain 
why members of the Army's secret Delta Force anti-terrorism squad 
were at the scene the day the compound burned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone involved knows they were there. If there is an issue,  
it was what was their role at the time,'' said James B. Francis of 
Dallas. ``Some of the evidence that I have reviewed and been made 
aware of is very problematical as to the role of Delta Force at the 
siege.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The News cited a Defense Department document obtained under the  
Freedom of Information Act that confirms that the Special Forces 
unit was on the scene when the FBI hostage rescue unit used tanks 
to assault the compound with tear gas on April 19, 1993. The U.S. 
military is barred from domestic police work. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans in Congress made clear they would reopen hearings  
into the 51-day siege. The standoff ended with the death of cult 
leader David Koresh and many followers during a fire that erupted 
after the tear gas assault on their wooden headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to believe that law enforcement did not start the  
fire,'' Collingwood said. ``Freeh is deeply concerned that prior 
congressional testimony and public statements (about the use of 
flammable devices) may prove to be inaccurate, a possibility we 
sincerely would regret.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although questions remain, Collingwood said, ``all available  
indications are that those rounds were not directed at the main, 
wooden compound. The rounds did not land near the wooden compound, 
and they were discharged several hours before the fire started.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Capitol Hill, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House  
Government Reform Committee, said, ``I am deeply concerned by these 
inconsistencies. ... I intend for the committee to get to the 
bottom of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, who chairs a subcommittee that  
oversees the FBI, said, ``This is a serious development in terms of 
further erosion of the FBI's credibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collingwood said answers recently prepared by the FBI's Hostage  
Rescue Team to questions from lawyers for Waco families and 
survivors suing the government ``suggest pyrotechnic devices may 
have been used in the early morning of April 19, 1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The FBI may have used a very limited number of military-type  
CS gas canisters on the morning of April 19 in an attempt to 
penetrate the roof of an underground bunker 30 to 40 yards away 
from the main Branch Davidian compound,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the civilian tear gas used later, ``the military  
canisters may have contained a substance that is designed to 
disperse the gas using a pyrotechnic mixture,'' Collingwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said two military tear gas canisters were fired just  
after 6 a.m., six hours before the fire began. The canisters 
bounced off the roof of the concrete bunker and landed in an open 
field, according to these officials, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonpyrotechnic tear gas canisters had not penetrated the bunker,  
which was linked to the main building by tunnels, the officials 
said. The FBI wanted to clear out anyone hiding there. 
</P>
<P>
	For six years, FBI and Justice Department officials have  
insisted no incendiary devices were used when the FBI ended the 
siege by agents trying to arrest Koresh on firearms charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, former assistant deputy FBI director Danny  
Coulson acknowledged for the first time to The Dallas Morning News 
that the two canisters were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, several drafts of the statement read Wednesday by  
Collingwood were reviewed inside the FBI and by Justice Department 
officials, who privately expressed anger that the FBI had allowed 
Reno and other officials to issue categorical public denials for 
years. Some officials said the incident would harm the credibility 
of federal law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Two officials suggested word of the military canisters might not  
have been relayed to top FBI and Justice officials earlier because 
original inquiries focused on the fire in the main building and the 
military canisters had been fired almost 180 degrees away from that 
building and hours before the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent investigators concluded the fire began  
simultaneously in three places. FBI bugs recorded Davidians 
discussing spreading fuel and planning a fire hours before the 
compound burned. Arson investigators found that gasoline, charcoal 
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the 
compound.

<HEADLINE> Martin Deliberations in Third Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Tony Martin isn't showing any signs of anxiety  
while waiting for a jury to decide his fate. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the Miami Dolphins receiver could be seen snoozing in  
an overstuffed blue chair Wednesday outside the federal courtroom 
where he was tried on charges of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors began a third day of deliberations this morning, having  
already spent about 12 hours discussing the case. The panel of 
eight women and four men went back into session at 8:30 a.m., 
following slightly more than six hours of talks Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't call it difficult,'' Martin said of the vigil.  
``I've just got to wait and see what happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was tried with Rickey Brownlee, who spent seven years in  
prison for two 1980s drug convictions, in a case largely focusing 
on Brownlee's alleged narcotics activities from 1994 to 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Bowl receiver is charged with four counts of laundering  
drug profits and one of conspiracy to hide drug money. He faces a 
prison term of three to five years if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin divided his time Wednesday either huddled with his  
lawyers or out in the waiting area with his parents, girlfriend and 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	After lawyers passed along word that the jury was going home,  
Martin signed an autograph for 15-year-old Wilson Louis of Miami. 
Underneath his signature, Martin wrote: ``Good luck in life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He looks innocent to me,'' said the teen-ager, who said he  
came to the courthouse because he wants to become a reporter. 
``This is just wasting his time for nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, is accused of leasing three cars in his name on  
behalf of Brownlee, who repaid him with cash. He also is accused of 
taking $100,000 in cash to reimburse a check written to Brownlee's 
first lawyer, though he later stopped payment on the check and 
returned the money. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is whether Martin, who has known Brownlee since  
childhood and calls him his uncle, knowingly accepted drug money.

<HEADLINE> Hispanics in Calif. Favor Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore has a 2-1 lead over  
Texas Gov. George W. Bush among Hispanics in California, but the 
two candidates split Hispanic support in Texas, a new poll 
suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found Gore with a 49-24 lead over Bush among Hispanics  
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll was conducted by the William C. Velasquez Institute of  
San Antonio, Texas, formed in 1985 to promote voting by Hispanics.

	In Texas, Bush had 41 percent while Gore had 39 percent. The  
phone survey of 514 registered Hispanic voters in Texas and 504 in 
California was taken from July 23 to Aug. 8 and had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	``While it is still very early in the campaign season, the  
relative closeness of Gore and Bush within the Latino community 
indicates there will be greater competition for the Latino vote in 
2000 than in 1996,'' said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the 
institute.

<HEADLINE> West Coast Longshoreman OK Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- West Coast longshore workers have  
overwhelmingly approved a new contract that includes a nearly 8 
percent pay hike and provisions designed to avoid strife as ports 
modernize. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract was approved by 82.5 percent of the nearly 10,000  
dockworkers eligible to vote on the three-year agreement with the 
Pacific Management Association, which represents shipping companies 
and terminal operators in all major ports from Seattle to Long 
Beach, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows the membership knew what they wanted and got it,''  
said Jim Spinosa, who headed the union's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
	The PMA is expected to ratify the contract at its Sept. 2  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Western ports handle more than half the containerized cargo  
moving in and out of the United States every year. Last year's 
cargo was valued at $266 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The voting began Aug. 4 and was tallied on Wednesday, with the  
results announced Thursday. It followed a brief walkout at the Port 
of Oakland, which virtually closed the facility to its 33 shipping 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Pay for union members in 1998 averaged $99,000 for dock workers,  
$117,617 for clerks and $156,251 for foremen. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement includes a 7.8 percent wage increase over the  
three-year life of the contact, according to union president Brian 
McWilliams. 
</P>
<P>
	The labor pact would ``set new standards for the reliable  
handling and movement of goods at West Coast ports,'' said Joseph 
Miniace, president of the Pacific Management Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Management wants to introduce new technology without provoking  
labor disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to association spokeswoman Joey Parr, a delegation of  
management and union officials already visited Europe to see how 
ports there handled advanced equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things in the pact, the union would agree to set up  
a committee to deal with technology and job security.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Police Sell Over 7,000 Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	might have been ended up back on streets  
</P>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Some of the more than 7,000 guns sold by the  
Detroit Police Department to a wholesaler may have ended up in the 
city's gun shops -- which are being sued by the city for the 
proliferation of illegal weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6,659 handguns, .38-caliber police revolvers, and 777  
shotguns were sold between 1992 and 1999 under a contract with 
Century International Arms in Vermont, Chief Benny Napoleon said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The sales earned about $800,000 toward the purchase of new  
weapons for the 4,000-member department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you burn them and throw away almost a million dollars of  
city property? You have a city that's strapped for money, and you 
have to purchase new firearms for the safety of the officers,'' 
Napoleon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Napoleon said the now-expired contract carried no restrictions  
or conditions that would have prevented the guns from being resold 
to dealers in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Two dealers named in the city's $800 million lawsuit said they  
have purchased weapons from Century and it is very possible they 
bought some of the old police weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilwoman Brenda Scott said she wants police to melt the  
guns, something it does with weapons taken from suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we are doing is self-defeating,'' Ms. Scott said. ``Who  
is to say those guns don't wind up back on the streets of the city 
of Detroit?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit and surrounding Wayne County are suing more than 30  
companies, accusing them of knowingly allowing firearms to get into 
the hands of felons and underage buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	A growing number of cities nationwide are suing gun makers and  
dealers in lawsuits patterned after those taking on the tobacco 
industry.

<HEADLINE> Battery Enters History Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An early model of the small alkaline batteries  
that went on to power everything from flashlights to portable 
radios is now in the National Museum of American History alongside 
the work of pioneers Benjamin Franklin and Thomas A. Edison. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernard Finn, curator of the museum's electrical collections,  
said Wednesday it is vital not only to create an invention but to 
make it practical. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing the light bulb, he explained that the first one required  
a filament made of precious platinum; it was only when Edison 
developed a cheap carbon filament that it became an everyday 
household item. 
</P>
<P>
	Finn credited Lew Urry, 72, with doing something similar 40  
years ago for the Eveready Battery Co. in developing the small 
alkaline battery at its laboratory at Parma, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're talking about here,'' he said, ``is not discovering  
a scientific principle, because this is known. It's how do you put 
that into a package, into a form that produces something that is 
useful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alkaline batteries last five to eight times as long as  
zinc-carbon cells, their predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
	Eveready is contributing $25,000 to help the museum update and  
expand it's 20-year-old electrical exhibits.

<HEADLINE> Dow Falls 127.59 to 11,198.45 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors who drove blue-chip stocks to record  
highs this week paused to take profits Thursday, knocking the Dow 
Jones industrial average down more than 120 points. Technology 
stocks once again outperformed the rest of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 127.59 to close at 11,198.45. The Standard &AMP; Poor's  
500 fell 19.78 to 1,362.01, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 
30.98 to 2,774.62. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a big run from some big names,'' said Charles White,  
portfolio manager at Avatar Associates. ``Some of the stocks that 
have run the farthest are correcting the most today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer goods stocks that posted strong gains in recent  
sessions fell back as investors collected their gains. Procter &AMP; 
Gamble dropped 2 3/8 to 100 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks contributed most heavily to the weakness in the Dow  
and the S&AMP;P 500. Crude oil prices tumbled Wednesday after inventory 
figures showed unexpectedly weak gasoline consumption as the peak 
summer driving season winds down. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices recovered slightly Thursday, but tropical storms forming  
in the Gulf of Mexico kept traders on guard. Dow component Chevron 
fell 2 3/8 to 92 11/16 and Royal Dutch/Shell fell 2 5/8 to 61 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Major gains by selected Internet stocks kept the Nasdaq's losses  
fairly narrow. Priceline.com., which allows customers to bid on 
prices for airline tickets, rose 7 7/16 to 72 5/8. Net2Phone, which 
has signed several distribution deals in recent days, gained 5 
13/16 to 75 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Paper stocks were mostly higher after Merrill Lynch raised its  
rating on Georgia-Pacific, which rose 2 1/2 to 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Without any fundamental change in market conditions, traders  
said investors were stepping back after the Dow reached a new 
record close of 11,326.04 on Wednesday. Stocks rose after the 
Federal Reserve raised interest rates Tuesday and suggested that 
inflation now appears to be on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commerce Department offered additional evidence Thursday  
that the growth of the U.S. economy has not escalated too sharply. 
The revised gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and 
services -- grew at a substantially slower annual rate of 1.8 
percent in the second quarter, reflecting the drag from a bloated 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Another portion of the report showed profits of U.S. companies  
decreased at an annual rate of $9.2 billion in the second quarter. 
That marked the biggest drop since the end of 1997. In the first 
quarter of the year, profits rose at a $47.1 billion rate. 
</P>
<P>
	That figure surprised economists who have watched many U.S.  
companies tally strong profit growth. 
</P>
<P>
	``Earnings releases from many corporations suggested a fine  
profit performance, but the aggregate results were less than 
stellar,'' said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities 
America Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	White said some market participants remain unconvinced that the  
Fed will leave interest rates untouched for the rest of the year. 
In 1998, the Fed cut rates three times to help stimulate the 
economy and lift Asian economies out of their financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's perfectly logical to believe that the Fed might want to  
undo all three of those rate cuts,'' he said. The central bank also 
raised rates June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond yields edged slightly higher, to 5.88 percent from 5.86  
percent late Wednesday. A rally in bond prices after the Fed's 
meeting helped stocks gain ground Tuesday and Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume totaled 866.33 
million shares, compared with 1.04 billion the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	Storms that knocked out service on some New York subways and  
commuter train lines may have contributed to the low volume, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.84 to 436.02.  
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.1 percent.  
Germany's DAX index fell 0.2 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 rose 0.2 
percent, and France's CAC-40 ended flat.

<HEADLINE> Seattle's High-Speed Ferry Slows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BREMERTON, Wash. (AP) -- One of the biggest things to happen to  
commuting in the Seattle area since the travel coffee mug has lost 
a little of its excitement. 
</P>
<P>
	A new high-speed ferry that whisks commuters to and from Seattle  
has been forced by a judge to throttle back its four 650-horsepower 
waterjets to a pokey 14 mph along one stretch because of complaints 
from well-to-do homeowners that the boat's wake is tearing up the 
exquisite shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the thousands of commuters who were thrilled with the  
speed and convenience of the Chinook are fuming. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're being held hostage by a handful of residents -- a whole  
county,'' grumbled Bob Sawade, who commutes from Bremerton to 
Seattle, where he works at a printing company. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger-only Chinook, which debuted more than a year ago,  
is the $9.5 million star of the state's fleet and represents a big 
improvement over the 26 other ferries, many of which are crowded 
and occasionally break down as they lumber through western 
Washington's network of islands, inlets and channels at 20 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Operating at a top speed of 39 mph, the Chinook was a nautical  
hotrod, shaving almost an hour off what was a two-hour round-trip 
journey on the heavily used Bremerton-Seattle route. And the 
Chinook did it in style: The twin-hulled, 143-foot vessel is a 
sleek, gleaming-white craft with plush upholstery and ample 
legroom. It carries 350 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	But about 60 Kitsap County shoreline residents complained the  
Chinook produced a bigger, harsher wake that battered their beaches 
to bits. 
</P>
<P>
	``When its waves hit the bulkhead it sounds like someone's  
hitting it with a baseball bat,'' said Jackie Rossworn, who lives 
along Rich Passage, a channel that at its narrowest point separates 
Bainbridge Island from the Kitsap Peninsula by only three-quarter 
of a mile. Homes along the Bainbridge Island side of the passage 
start at half a million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rossworn and four other property owners filed a  
class-action lawsuit against the state ferry system last spring. 
Superior Court Judge Glenna Hall ruled in their favor Aug. 13, 
marking the first time a vessel was made subject to the state 
Environmental Policy Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hall ordered the Chinook to slow from 39 mph to 14 mph  
through Rich Passage -- a six-mile segment of its 16-mile route -- 
until an environmental review is conducted. The one-way trip now 
takes 15 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, because the Chinook has to go more slowly, it can make  
only 11 one-way runs a day, instead of 17. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost half an hour's wage today,'' Sawade complained. He said  
he thought was doing his part as a citizen by using mass transit, 
and ``the minute they scream environmental impact, it stops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to get up earlier, and I have to shift my whole  
schedule. And in order to get everything done, I have to work at 
home,'' groused Bill Thaete, who works at Intel in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The ferry system filed an emergency request with the state  
Supreme Court for a stay of Ms. Hall's ruling but was turned down 
on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling could mean up to two years of slower service while  
the environmental review is conducted, said Patricia Patterson, 
spokesman for Washington State Ferries. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Rossworn, 51, said the 15-minute slowdown is a small price  
to protect the beach, which is framed by towering conifers and the 
Olympic mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	A photo of Mrs. Rossworn's property from the late 1980s shows a  
sandy strip fringed with pebbles and seaweed. Now the sand is just 
about gone, and the beach is mostly rocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beaches do change a bit. That's the nature of things,'' Mrs.  
Rossworn said. ``But the crabs were leaving, shellfish and little 
shrimp and those types of things, and kelp beds were getting 
buried.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Homeowners wrote to the ferry system last summer about the  
problem but were told the Chinook was not the culprit. Bill 
Williams, a lawyer for the ferry system, said an engineer hired by 
the state concluded the erosion was probably due to natural 
phenomena. 
</P>
<P>
	Another high-speed ferry, the Snohomish, will join the Chinook  
on the run this fall. But it could be months before it gets to open 
the throttle wide, if ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The ferry system is hoping new technology, such as foils that  
lift the ferry higher in the water and produce less of a wake, will 
provide a quicker solution.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Out of Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- The Marion Jones Show in Seville is  
officially over. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's top female star pulled out of the World Track and  
Field Championships on Thursday, her bid for multiple gold medals 
cut short by a back injury during her 200-meter semifinal the night 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's out of the championships,'' said her agent, Charlie  
Wells. ``She's still walking around and we're evaluating her. She 
still has muscle spasms in her lower back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones came to southern Spain with an ambitious, and  
unprecedented goal world titles in the 100, 200, long jump and a 
relay. She leaves with the 100-meter gold, won in a 
championships-record 10.70 seconds, a bronze from the long jump -- 
and new questions about whether her stated aim of five golds at 
next year's Sydney Olympics is realistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was in action every day since Saturday's start of the  
championships. She indicated Tuesday, after the first round of the 
200, that her schedule's grind and the 90-degree heat were starting 
to wear on her. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone thinks she's invincible -- she's not,'' said fellow  
American sprinter Inger Miller. ``I've been telling people that. 
People just are not invincible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said Thursday he does not know the exact nature of Jones'  
injury. ``We're still waiting,'' he said. ``She's resting at the 
hotel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was not taken to the hospital, Wells said, because her  
condition ``is nothing as serious as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether Jones' season is done, Wells said, ``We still need  
a couple of days to make that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones' husband, shot put world champion C.J. Hunter, refused to  
comment when approached at their Seville hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones's exit is a real body blow to the event.  
</P>
<P>
	She is undefeated in finals for the 100 and 200 since 1997, and  
her engaging smile and easy manner make her a prime ambassador for 
the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was heavily favored in the 200, but her bid for a rare  
sprint double disintegrated about midway through her semifinal. 
Jones, already trailing, slowed considerably coming through the 
curve and started to pull up. 
</P>
<P>
	She crumbled to the track about 50 meters from the finish,  
grabbing her lower left back and grimacing in agony, and was 
removed on a gurney. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top athletes were stunned.  
</P>
<P>
	Miller, the silver medalist behind Jones in the 100 and now the  
favorite to win the title at 200 meters, watched Jones' semifinal 
from trackside after winning the first semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Normally she's first out of the curve, so I was saying, `Where  
is she? What lane is she in?''' Miller said. ``It's shocking. It's 
sad that Marion had to get hurt. I looked forward to competing 
against her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also watching Jones' race was men's 100-meter champion Maurice  
Greene, waiting to run immediately afterward in his 200 semifinal 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very nervous,'' he said. ``My event was next. You get  
scared seeing an athlete go down like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones had not yet announced which relay she would run here, the  
400 or the 1,600. She did not plan to run in the heats, only the 
final. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 Jones has proven durable in her brief, but  
brilliant, career. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, only the second since she dedicated herself full time  
to the sport, she became the first woman since Stella Walsh in 1948 
to sweep the 100, 200 and long jump at the U.S. Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Greene thinks Jones could still take a crack at history at the  
2000 Olympic Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Marion was trying too much for her,'' he said,  
``just something she's never tried before.''

<HEADLINE> S.D. Beating Said Result of Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTIN, S.D. (AP) -- The brutal beating of a white man was the  
result of alcohol and an argument, not racial animosity, according 
to relatives of the victim and one of the three American Indian 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Young, 21, remained in critical condition today. He was  
beaten, kicked in the head and left for dead with a rope around his 
neck early Saturday on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in 
southwest South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI and federal prosecutors said it was too early to term  
the assault a hate crime, though they're not ruling it out. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis Means and Byron Bissonette, both 18, pleaded innocent  
Wednesday to federal charges of assault resulting in serious bodily 
injury. The charges are federal because the incident happened on 
the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	A 17-year-old juvenile also was taken into custody.  
</P>
<P>
	Young's aunt, Nancy Neuharth, said she doubts the assault was  
race related. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brad was well-liked by Indians and whites,'' she said. ``They  
were out doing things they shouldn't have been doing. It's the 
times. Kids are out doing things they shouldn't do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three had been drinking and got into an argument, said  
Bissonette's uncle, Arthur Has No Horses, who said he talked to his 
nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said it all started from an argument over Brad's wife,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The four had driven to an abandoned house to party, according to  
a statement by William Grode, an FBI special agent in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Means told tribal police that he, Bissonette and the juvenile  
had beaten Young, ``dragged him across a field, thrown him into a 
house crawlspace, dragged him out and then kicked him numerous 
times in the head,'' according to the FBI statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Young's mother, Carol Bucholz of Lexington, Neb., said her son's  
left ear was almost torn off and his right ear badly damaged. She 
said that he suffered head injuries but that there was no sign of 
brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Local newspapers and TV reported that Sheriff Russel Waterbury  
said the crime was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he told a radio station he had been misunderstood.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've got a lot of calls on that, and that was my opinion, to  
do something that horrible to somebody else,'' he told KWSN on 
Wednesday. ``I didn't mean the actual hate crime, so I don't know 
where they come up with where I was quoted as saying that. But that 
was my opinion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waterbury did not return calls Wednesday to The Associated  
Press.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Teen Meets E-Mail Pal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Her poignant e-mail messages from Kosovo  
chronicled her family's desperate situation much in the same way 
that Anne Frank's diaries put a human face on the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the girl's real name and face are no longer a mystery.  
</P>
<P>
	``Adona,'' a 16-year-old ethnic Albanian whose Internet missives  
were read to thousands of listeners over National Public Radio, 
flew Wednesday to meet her e-mail pen pal from Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
	Kujtesa Bejtullahu kept her identity secret while her family hid  
from Serbians in the Kosovo capital of Pristina. She shared her 
thoughts and fears by e-mail with Finnegan Hamill, a 16-year-old 
Berkeley High School student and Youth Radio reporter. 
</P>
<P>
	The correspondence began in January after a peace worker who had  
just returned from Kosovo visited Hamill's church and gave him the 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejtullahu's messages often were filled with disturbing and  
violent accounts of the war. The girl said she regularly saw people 
being killed, routed from their homes and moved from place to place 
as they tried to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
	In mid-March, the messages suddenly ceased, presumably because  
the electricity at her family's home had been cut off. Hamill kept 
a worried vigil as reports of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo increased. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamill was able to make contact with Adona a few days later over  
the phone. She told him her family was huddled in their home with 
little food or water. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday night, Hamill said he had butterflies in his stomach  
as he met her face-to-face with flowers and a hug. 
</P>
<P>
	Bejtullahu came to the United States along with three other  
teens from Pristina to complete her high school education. She is 
part of a group known as the PostPessimists, which campaigns 
against ethnic rivalry. While in Berkeley, Bejtullahu will stay 
with Gretchen Carlson, who heard the girl's messages on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel differently about Kujtesa, because I heard her words on  
NPR,'' Carlson said. ``I don't think any woman alive, especially a 
mother, didn't feel a helplessness at not being able to protect a 
child in circumstances like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The First Congregational Church of Berkeley has raised $25,000  
to support the teens during their stay, but $50,000 more is needed 
for tuition, clothing and health insurance.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Is Mixed in Listless Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar lost ground to the euro Wednesday but  
rose against the Japanese yen in a quiet trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0445, up  
slightly from $1.0425 late Wednesday. The dollar also was quoted at 
111.54 yen, up from 111.14 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no major surprises,'' said John Schein, vice  
president in foreign exchange at Fortis Financial Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar regained ground lost to the euro early in Thursday's  
session but still traded in a fairly narrow range, Schein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar found support against the yen, which earlier this  
week hit a seven-month high, as Japanese stocks fell again. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar did not receive help from the U.S. stock market,  
which saw sharp declines Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average 
closed down 127.59 at 11,198.45 after setting a new record 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5331 Swiss francs, down from  
1.5366, and 1.5008 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4940. The British 
pound rose to $1.5873 from $1.5853. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8721 German 
marks, down from 1.8762; 6.2788 French francs, down from 6.2922; 
and 1,854 Italian lire, down from 1,857.

<HEADLINE> Big Stakes at Saratoga </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- The stakes will be much bigger for  
Menifee, Cat Thief and Lemon Drop Kid at Saratoga on Saturday than 
they were when the three colts ran against each other at the track 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	They were rookies when they ran for a $17,000 purse in a  
seven-furlong allowance race, won by Menifee, with Cat Thief second 
and Lemon Drop Kid third. 
</P>
<P>
	They return as veterans of top-level stakes competition for  
Saturday's Grade I Travers over 1 1/4 miles. The winner will get 
$600,000 from a $1 million purse. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, the Kentucky Derby-Preakness runner-up, was made the  
9-5 early favorite when eight 3-year-olds were entered Thursday for 
the 130th Travers. He is trained by Elliott Walden, who also will 
try to win the Travers with Ecton Park, the 7-2 third choice behind 
3-1 Cat Thief and ahead of 9-2 Lemon Drop Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both horses are doing extremely well,'' Walden said. ``Both  
are coming off wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee rebounded from a disappointing eighth-place finish in  
the 1 1/2-mile Belmont Stakes, won by Lemon Drop Kid, to win the 
1 1/8-mile Haskell Invitational Handicap Aug. 8 at Monmouth Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecton Park followed his 12th-place finish in the 1 1/4-mile  
Kentucky Derby with a close second in the 1 1/8-mile Ohio Derby and a 
win on a sloppy track in the 1 1/8-mile Jim Dandy on Aug. 8 at 
Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if the rain helped him or not,'' Walden said. ``I  
really don't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One who has no doubt that the sloppy track helped Ecton Park is  
Scotty Schulhofer, trainer of Lemon Drop Kid, who was second, 5 1/4 
lengths back, in the Jim Dandy in his first start since his win in 
the Belmont Stakes on June 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``Menifee is the horse to beat, but if it comes up sloppy then  
he's got his other horse,'' Schulhofer said. ``If there's a fast 
trace track, it's going to be a great race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No rain is forecast for Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, who scored his only win in nine starts this year in  
the 1!-mile Swaps on July 18 at Hollywood Park, finished second, a 
half-length behind Menifee in the Haskell. The D. Wayne 
Lukas-trained colt also has three seconds and three thirds, and his 
last eight starts have been in Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
	When Menifee won that allowance race on Aug. 21, 1998, at  
Saratoga his margin was three lengths. The margin figures to be 
even slimmer in the Travers, no matter who wins. 
</P>
<P>
	Also entered were Vision and Verse, second by a head in the  
Belmont and sixth in the Jim Dandy; Unbridled Jet, fourth in the 
Haskell; Best of Luck, fourth in both the Belmont and Haskell, and 
Badger Gold, claimed by Flying Zee Stable for $100,000 two races 
ago, who finished third in the Jim Dandy. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Vision and Verse and Unbridled Jet, trained by Bill  
Mott, nor Walden's two colts will run as an entry because of 
different owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Each starter will carry 126 pounds. Post time is 5:12 p.m. EDT,  
and ESPN will televise.

<HEADLINE> Thai Vets Work on Wounded Elephant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAMPANG, Thailand (AP) -- Veterinarians used a crane and harness  
system Thursday to treat an elephant that stepped on a land mine, 
trying to ease pressure on her three intact feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Worakorn Jitlang, chief veterinarian at the Lampang Elephant  
Hospital, said Motola's three feet were getting increasingly sore 
from supporting her three-ton weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Motola's left front foot was destroyed by a land mine explosion  
nearly two weeks ago as she foraged for food at a logging camp 
along the Myanmar-Thai border, scene of a half-century of 
insurgencies. 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived at an elephant hospital in northern Thailand three  
days later. Since then, she has been holding up her shredded foot 
and supporting herself with a crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
	A crane loaned by the Electricity Generating Authority of  
Thailand has been called into service to help Motola. She is 
showing signs of fatigue and lying down more and more often. 
</P>
<P>
	Technicians are trying to rig up a harness made of strong but  
supple woven canvas that they hope will not damage the elephant's 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinarians are preparing for an operation to help her walk  
again. Experts are arriving from around Thailand to give advice and 
the surgery may be conducted over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Worakorn said Wednesday that a radical amputation at the knee  
had been ruled out and they hope to save as much of the foot as 
possible, fitting her with a prosthesis. At least two thirds of the 
flesh is shredded and 10 bones have been destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Billions Slashed in GM Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When a jury socked General Motors with a  
record $4.9 billion penalty after the explosion of a Chevrolet 
Malibu, legal analysts predicted the figure wouldn't hold up under 
judicial scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	They were right. And the case isn't over yet.  
</P>
<P>
	Just one month after a jury issued what was believed to be the  
biggest product-liability award in U.S. history, a judge on 
Thursday shaved the punitive damages assessed against GM to $1.09 
billion, calling the initial award excessive. 
</P>
<P>
	However, a lawyer for the automaker said the company would  
appeal to have the award knocked down even more or thrown out 
entirely because the new amount remains ``way outside of any 
ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If this award is not over the line, then there is no line,''  
said GM attorney David Heilbron. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves the explosion of a 1979 Malibu on Christmas  
Eve 1993. Patricia Anderson, her four children and family friend Jo 
Tigner were severely burned when the gas tank of the car erupted in 
a collision with a drunken driver. 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Ernest Williams reduced the jury award, but  
said punitive damages were warranted to punish GM for designing a 
fuel tank ``in order to maximum profits, to the disregard of public 
safety.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also let stand the $107 million in compensatory damages the  
jury awarded to the plaintiffs, saying the award was justified 
because the victims' ``injuries were so horrendous that a trial 
judge in good conscience could not say that the compensatory 
damages were excessive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This action involves four children and two adults who  
sustained horrible burns beyond description,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The victims renewed an offer to reduce the punitive damages to  
$300 million if GM recalls similar vehicles made from 1978-83 to 
replace what they said were defective gas tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	GM rejected that offer, saying there was nothing wrong with the  
vehicles' gas-tank design. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no reason to recall the vehicle. It is safe,'' said  
Louis Lindeman Jr., a product-liability attorney for GM. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Anderson, who said half of the damages she might receive  
would go to help burn victims, said she would rather see most of 
the money go toward preventing similar accidents in those vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they recall the cars, I'd be happy,'' Ms. Anderson  
said. ``I don't want this to happen to anybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Panish, an attorney for the victims, said GM chose to  
place the gas tank behind the axle and close to the rear bumper to 
save money, rather than position it in a safer spot above the axle. 
The alternate design would have cost a few dollars for each 
vehicle, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people didn't know they had a defective gas tank, and  
they're paying the price,'' Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing its case before Williams earlier in the day, GM said it  
was denied a fair trial because critical evidence was excluded 
about the Malibu's safety record and the drunken driver whose 
vehicle struck Ms. Anderson's Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
	GM engineers determined in the 1970s that placing the gas tank  
behind the axle was safer because a fuel tank over the axle was 
more likely to cause fires in the passenger area, Heilbron said. 
</P>
<P>
	Heilbron said the Malibu was one of the safest cars built in  
that time and that sole blame for the injuries lay with the drunken 
driver. 
</P>
<P>
	But Panish said the victims would have walked away with  
relatively minor injuries if not for the vehicle's faulty fuel 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Defective gas tanks don't discriminate between drunk or sober  
drivers,'' Panish said. 
</P>
<P>
	The automaker's attorneys also said the plaintiffs were allowed  
to play to jurors' passions by depicting GM as a negligent 
corporation that cared only about profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge disagreed, saying the ``court finds no sympathy,  
passion or prejudice on the part of the jurors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the jury reached its decision in July, Tom Harrison,  
publisher of Lawyers Weekly USA, said the GM award was the largest 
product-liability and the largest personal-injury verdict in the 
nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	But he and other analysts predicted that the punitive award was  
unlikely to stand on appeal.

<HEADLINE> SEC Charges 9 Firms on Y2K Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators have charged five money  
management firms and four securities transfer agents with failing 
to meet deadlines for fully disclosing their computer systems' 
readiness for the Year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the money management firms agreed to settle the civil  
charges announced Thursday by the Securities and Exchange 
Commission by paying five-figure fines and promising to refrain 
from future violations. Two of the transfer agents also reached 
settlements with the market watchdog agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The other five companies are contesting the charges. Hearings  
will be held before an administrative law judge at the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
	Including the latest actions, the SEC so far has filed similar  
Year 2000 charges against 13 money management firms, 15 transfer 
agents and 37 brokerage firms, all relatively small companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency recently said it would go to federal court starting  
Dec. 1 to shut down brokerage firms and transfer agents that aren't 
ready for the date change. The SEC estimates that only 1 percent or 
so of the 3,900 brokerage firms and 600 securities transfer agents 
nationwide won't be ready by Aug. 31 for the millennial date 
change. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC also requires mutual fund companies and publicly traded  
corporations to disclose their readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We place great importance on full and fair Y2K disclosure by  
those we regulate,'' SEC Enforcement Director Richard Walker said 
in a statement. ``With only four months left to the millennium, it 
is vital that both investors and regulators be given a current 
report card by each firm as to their state of readiness. We are 
pleased that, with few exceptions, firms made the required 
filings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five money management firms named by the SEC are Amervest  
Co. Inc., Los Angeles; KMI Realty Advisors Inc., Indianapolis; 
Huber Hogan Consulting Inc., Red Bank, N.J.; Russon Financial 
Services Inc., Woodland Hills, Calif.; and Robert Sears, 
Northampton, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	Amervest and KMI agreed in settlements to be censured, refrain  
from future violations, and pay civil fines of $22,500 and $15,000, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	The four transfer agents are Peachtree Stock Transfer, Memphis,  
Tenn.; Robert J. Crain Jr., Memphis; Bassett Furniture Industries 
Inc., Bassett, Va.; and Thermal Energy Storage Inc., San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Bassett and Thermal Energy agreed to be censured and refrain  
from future violations. Bassett agreed to pay a $5,000 fine, but 
Thermal Energy was not fined because it had demonstrated it was 
unable to do so, the SEC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities transfer agents are responsible for keeping records  
of shareholders of corporations and for issuing or canceling stock 
certificates when shares are bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has said failure of transfer agents to anticipate and  
fix Year 2000 computer problems could seriously disrupt 
corporations' dividend payments and other transactions with their 
shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	The Year 2000 problem -- also called Y2K and the millennium bug --  
occurs because some computer programs, especially older ones, might 
fail when the date changes to 2000. Because the programs were 
written to recognize only the last two digits of a year, such 
programs could read the digits ``00'' as 1900 instead of 2000.

<HEADLINE> Youth Unemployment At 30-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's robust economy means more jobs  
for more kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Significant disparity persists, however, between the  
unemployment rates for young black and white Americans. The 
unemployment rate this summer for young whites was 8.1 percent; for 
blacks it was 21.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Labor Department, summertime unemployment among  
Americans ages 16 to 24 is at its lowest level in 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The youth unemployment rate in July -- normally the peak month  
for young people to be working or seeking jobs because of school 
vacations and recent graduations -- was 10.1 percent, the department 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the lowest since the summer of 1969, when the rate was  
9.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The unemployment rate was still too high for our black  
youth,'' said Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. ``More than one in 
five black youth seeking a job this summer remained unemployed -- 
more than double the unemployment rate of white youth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 2.5 million young people actively looking for jobs  
could not find them in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The summertime unemployment rate for youth has been falling  
gradually since 1992, when it hit 14.5 percent. Last summer, youth 
unemployment was 10.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's unemployment rate for people of all ages has held  
near a 29-year low for more than a year now. At the latest 
calculation, in June, it was 4.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> McCain Ends Calif. Campaign Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- GOP presidential candidate John McCain ended a  
10-day California campaign swing Thursday by listening to social 
workers describe the burdens on new military enlistees whose low 
pay forces some to take second jobs, steal or sell belongings to 
support families. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, an Arizona senator who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam  
for 5 1/2 years, told the group he would seek congressional hearings 
on poverty in the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a disgrace,'' McCain said after the meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	The senator noted that Congress has just passed a 4.8 percent  
pay increase for the military, but it still lacks the signature of 
President Clinton. McCain said he would support further legislation 
to increase benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain arrived in California two weeks ago and made appearances  
in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento. Along the way, he 
said he has expanded his organization in the voter-rich state by 
``hundreds of volunteers'' and raised more than $100,000 at four 
fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
	A Field Poll released earlier this week suggested McCain would  
receive about 8 percent of the vote by Republicans likely to cast 
ballots in the California March primary, far behind George W. Bush 
at 49 percent. McCain dismissed the results as premature. 
</P>
<P>
	He focused on military poverty in San Diego because of the  
city's high cost of living and its three major bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Social workers from private agencies such as the Armed Services  
YMCA and Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society said the financial 
troubles of military families have increased with rising rents, low 
apartment vacancy rates and increased overseas deployments, which 
make it harder for them to keep second jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	First-year Marine enlistees at Camp Pendleton, for example, make  
a gross base salary of $11,500 before taxes, according to military 
records. That's about the same as a full-time fast-food worker 
making minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Kellenbarger, director of an outreach program run by a  
Presbyterian church, described a young Marine who was caught 
stealing items from a base store so he could sell them to buy food 
for his baby. ``He was desperate,'' she said. ``This was the only 
thing he could see to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Military authorities later found that the Marine had to live 60  
miles from the base to find affordable housing and had almost no 
furniture in his house, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An active duty sailor told McCain about his struggle to pay  
bills by working a second job delivering pizzas. He declined to 
give his name because his commanding officer doesn't know about his 
moonlighting. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're always just juggling the bills,'' he said. ``It's only  
been 1 1/2 years since getting to San Diego that everything is paid 
off and the creditors have stopped calling.''

<HEADLINE> 6 Countries Won't Be Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and at least five other  
countries do not expect to finish fixing their Year 2000 computer 
bugs until just weeks before the new year, an international survey 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other countries, Slovakia and Bolivia, do not believe they  
will finish until next year, meaning problems could occur after 
midnight strikes on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce McConnell, director of the International Y2K Cooperation  
Center, said the late completion dates are not necessarily reason 
to expect catastrophe. Rather, he said, the survey points to areas 
in which to intensify contingency planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K readiness is of greatest concern in developed countries such  
as the United States because they are the most dependent on 
information technology, Y2K planners say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers were originally programmed to recognize only the  
last two digits of the year, so some might not be able to 
differentiate between 2000 and 1900. Unless they are reprogrammed 
in time, computers could malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States listed a December completion date for  
computers in the health care industry. Health care has been 
particularly troublesome because doctors, hospitals and payment 
systems are so decentralized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The health sector is the one that everyone is further behind  
in, so it's not surprising that the U.S. is also getting finished 
in health later,'' McConnell said. ``I think it's a cause for 
action, a cause for more attention to be given to making sure the 
health sector is ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. health care industry leaders have insisted that they will  
be ready for Jan. 1, although a recent congressional study said 
that assurances from industry groups have been based on surveys 
that may be unreliable because of low response rates. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's Y2K czar, John Koskinen, said in an Aug. 5  
report that although many health-care organizations have made 
progress, ``serious concerns still exist'' among those that started 
planning late or have yet to take significant remedial steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contingency planning will be critical for these organizations  
as we move into the fall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries not expected to finish until December are:  
Pakistan and Macedonia, for air transportation; Bulgaria, for 
health; Bolivia, for government services; Colombia, for customs, 
and Angola, for sea and land transportation, customs and health. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolivia also would not be ready with its customs systems until  
the new year, while Slovakia does not expect to complete its health

	The International Y2K Cooperation Center, a clearinghouse set up

implementing 90 percent of the fixes.

<HEADLINE> Gene Study: Eat Less, Live Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genes that play a key role in aging tend to  
stay vigorous in response to a low-calorie diet, says a study that 
may help explain why animals that eat less often live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas A. Prolla and Richard Weindruch, both of the University of  
Wisconsin, Madison, said their genetic analysis of mice showed that 
genes that normally deteriorate with age tended to continue 
functioning in a youthful way when the mice were underfed. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the study, to be published in the journal Science on  
Friday, may explain why a reduced-calorie diet can cause mice to 
live up to 50 percent longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weindruch said it is not scientifically appropriate yet to  
recommend that people of normal weight go on calorie-restricted 
diets in order to prolong life, but he added: ``This line of 
research bears watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the research could lead to drugs that would help  
slow the aging process in humans, although there have been no 
definitive studies proving that a reduced-calorie diet in humans 
will extend life. 
</P>
<P>
	What is clear, Weindruch said, is that obesity damages health  
and that one reason for this might be changes in genes linked to 
aging. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been studies in monkeys that show a low calorie diet  
does lower blood pressure and raise levels of ``good'' cholesterol, 
both signs of improved health that suggest a longer life. Those 
studies, however, did not examine the fundamental genetic changes 
that occur as a part of the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is quite important because it breaks new ground in  
giving us an understanding of what happens to gene expression with 
age,'' said Dr. Raj Sohal, a professor of biological sciences at 
Southern Methodist University. Although the study was with mice, he 
said it suggests that ``if you overeat, you are accelerating the 
aging process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This study has analyzed more genes with regard to aging than  
all previous studies combined,'' said Prolla. He said 5 to 10 
percent of the entire mouse genome was examined. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wisconsin laboratory study, the researchers fed one group  
of mice a regular diet while restricting by 24 percent the calories 
in the food given to another group. The diets all contained 
healthful levels of vitamins, minerals and proteins. Only the 
calories were reduced. This creates a condition of undernutrition, 
but not malnutrition, Weindruch said. 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 months, muscles were taken from the animals and the  
activity of 6,347 genes was analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose muscle for analysis because it is an important target  
for the effects of aging,'' said Weindruch. ``Muscle is lost 
routinely with old age and contributes to physical frailty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that more than 100 genes either increased  
or decreased their activity with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the molecular level, normal aging looks like a state of  
chronic injury in muscle,'' said Prolla. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for mice fed the restricted diet, about 84 percent of  
the genetic alterations associated with aging were completely or 
partially suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the molecular level,'' the study found,  
``calorie-restricted mice appear to be biologically younger than 
animals receiving the control diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly suggests that the reduction of calorie intake not  
only increases lifespan in mice, but seems to affect a broad 
spectrum of age-associated changes at the gene expression level,'' 
said Weindruch. He said these genetic changes clearly play a role 
in extending life in those animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the genes affected by aging are those that help the body  
rid itself of oxygen radicals, chemicals produced during the 
process of metabolizing calories in cells. Oxygen radicals are 
known to be damaging to DNA, the body's genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice fed the full-calorie diet tended to lose the benefit of  
these oxygen radical control genes with age. The genes continued to 
work vigorously, however, in mice fed the calorie restricted genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the study evaluated muscles, Weindruch said that similar  
molecular effects may occur in the brain and in the heart, both of 
which tend to show the effects of the aging process.

<HEADLINE> Kaiser Talks With Union Break Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- The latest effort to end an 11-month labor  
dispute between nearly 3,000 workers represented by United 
Steelworkers and Kaiser Aluminum &AMP; Chemical Corp. ended Thursday 
without an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	No additional talks were scheduled.  
</P>
<P>
	Union officials said this week's negotiations in San Francisco  
stalled over Kaiser's demands that 239 jobs be shifted to 
businesses outside the union's jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser contends such outsourcing is necessary to achieve  
productivity goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``The union's proposal would not only make outsourcing more  
difficult in the future, it could also force the company to hire up 
to 50 additional full-time employees,'' Kaiser negotiator Jeremy 
Sherman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Stafford, president of Steelworkers Local 5702 in  
Gramercy, La., said Kaiser is trying to eliminate 8 percent of the 
union jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our local union presidents are unanimous in rejecting Kaiser's  
approach to stealing our jobs and then giving the work to the 
lowest bidder in the community,'' Stafford said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute affects about 2,100 Steelworkers at two Spokane-area  
plants, along with about 300 at a Tacoma, Wash., smelter. An 
additional 600 are affected at plants in Gramercy, La., and Newark, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelworkers struck Sept. 30 over wages, proposed workforce  
reductions, retirement benefits and such issues as contracting out 
work. A lockout began Jan. 13, when the company rejected a union 
offer to return to work while talks continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaiser is seeking to contract out the jobs of carpenters,  
machinists, janitors, truck drivers, security guards and other 
employees, the union contends. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides began talks Monday in San Francisco, just 10 days  
after they concluded five days of negotiations in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this month's talks, the two sides last met in May.

<HEADLINE> Mulholland a Boost for Braves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Terry Mulholland is agreeable to just about  
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Start the game? Sure, no problem. Middle relief? That's OK, too.  
The final inning? Consider it done. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Atlanta Braves traded for Mulholland just before the  
July 31 trade deadline, they got a rubber-armed pitcher who can 
seemingly handle any role at a moment's notice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every opportunity I have to get on the mound, face hitters and  
have a chance to get someone out, I relish that,'' said Mulholland, 
who was acquired from the Chicago Cubs along with Jose Hernandez. 
``I've never really thought of it any other way. Heck, if you're 
going to have a game, you might as well play. It's no fun sitting 
on the bench.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Mulholland's overall numbers with the Cubs and Braves  
(7-7, 4.84 ERA, one save) are not very impressive, his value to 
Atlanta has been demonstrated over the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	On Aug. 14, he pitched 1 2-3 innings of relief against Los  
Angeles. Three days later, he started against Colorado and allowed 
only three runs in seven innings at Coors Field. Two days after 
that, he was back on the mound against the Rockies, pitching the 
14th inning to pick up a save. Finally, he started on two days rest 
against San Diego, giving up just two runs in eight innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got Terry, everyone in here realized the importance of  
it, though I'm not sure people outside the clubhouse realized,'' 
Braves starter Tom Glavine said. ``The guy is very versatile. He 
seemingly has a rubber arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many of his younger teammates have to attach a bulky bag  
of ice to their pitching arm after every appearance, the 
36-year-old Mulholland never seems flustered, never seems tired, 
never seems sore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I show up, make my relief appearance or make my start, take my  
shower and go home,'' he said with a shrug. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland has been on the disabled list only twice in his  
13-year career -- the first coming in 1988 when his forearm was 
broken by a line drive from Atlanta's Gerald Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of hard to pitch with a broken forearm,'' Mulholland  
joked. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in 1995, he needed surgery to remove bone spurs from his  
left elbow. Even then, he was only out four weeks, a period that 
included two rehabilitation starts in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland's durability and versatility have come in quite handy  
for the injury plagued Braves, who acquired him shortly after 
losing fifth starter Odalis Perez for the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Maddux cracked a bone in his wrist last weekend, forcing  
him to miss Friday night's scheduled start at St. Louis. 
Mulholland, of course, will step in, anxious to get back on the 
mound after four full days of rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland also provides insurance behind John Smoltz, pitching  
with a tenuous elbow that already has landed him on the DL twice 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Braves general manager John Schuerholz insisted that Mulholland  
be part of the deal with the Cubs, who didn't want to give him up 
since he still has another year on his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Versatility was an attraction, but it wasn't the primary  
attraction,'' Schuerholz said. ``What was most important to our 
scouts was they thought he was a real competitive guy, a real 
warrior. When things get tough in a pennant race, you want to have 
a guy like Terry Mulholland on your team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mulholland has fit right in with the first-place Braves, though  
he admits to being a little surprised about the transition. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I used to be in the visitor's dugout here, I would look  
across the field and see these guys winning and doing it with a 
business-as-usual approach,'' Mulholland recalled. ``You get a 
little bit envious of that, a little jealous, a little disgusted 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The view is much different from the Braves clubhouse.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a 180-degree turn,'' Mulholland said. ``It's great  
to be in a clubhouse where you can go up to a Greg Maddux or a Tom 
Glavine or a John Smoltz and exchange ideas. I pick their brain, 
they pick my brain a little bit. It's like a think tank. It's great 
to be invited into that.''

<HEADLINE> 6 Countries Won't Be Y2K Ready </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and at least five other  
countries do not expect to finish fixing their Year 2000 computer 
bugs until just weeks before the new year, an international survey 
reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other countries, Slovakia and Bolivia, do not believe they  
will finish until next year, meaning problems could occur after 
midnight strikes on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce McConnell, director of the International Y2K Cooperation  
Center, said the late completion dates are not necessarily reason 
to expect catastrophe. Rather, he said, the survey points to areas 
in which to intensify contingency planning. 
</P>
<P>
	Y2K readiness is of greatest concern in developed countries such  
as the United States because they are the most dependent on 
information technology, Y2K planners say. 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers were originally programmed to recognize only the  
last two digits of the year, so some might not be able to 
differentiate between 2000 and 1900. Unless they are reprogrammed 
in time, computers could malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States listed a December completion date for  
computers in the health care industry. Health care has been 
particularly troublesome because doctors, hospitals and payment 
systems are so decentralized. 
</P>
<P>
	``The health sector is the one that everyone is further behind  
in, so it's not surprising that the U.S. is also getting finished 
in health later,'' McConnell said. ``I think it's a cause for 
action, a cause for more attention to be given to making sure the 
health sector is ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. health care industry leaders have insisted that they will  
be ready for Jan. 1, although a recent congressional study said 
that assurances from industry groups have been based on surveys 
that may be unreliable because of low response rates. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's Y2K czar, John Koskinen, said in an Aug. 5  
report that although many health-care organizations have made 
progress, ``serious concerns still exist'' among those that started 
planning late or have yet to take significant remedial steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Contingency planning will be critical for these organizations  
as we move into the fall,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other countries not expected to finish until December are:  
Pakistan and Macedonia, for air transportation; Bulgaria, for 
health; Bolivia, for government services; Colombia, for customs, 
and Angola, for sea and land transportation, customs and health. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolivia also would not be ready with its customs systems until  
the new year, while Slovakia does not expect to complete its health 
systems this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Y2K Cooperation Center, a clearinghouse set up  
by the United Nations and the World Bank, received responses from 
72 of 195 countries. The completion dates were self-reported by the 
national Y2K coordinator of each country. Completion was defined as 
implementing 90 percent of the fixes. 
</P>
<P>
	``No country in the world will get all of the systems fixed by  
January 1, but for those with lots of systems left to be fixed, it 
heightens the importance of knowing what they are going to do to 
continue delivery of essential services,'' McConnell said.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Approaches the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis crept toward the Bahamas  
and the Carolinas early today, but forecasters expected a weather 
system sweeping east across the United States to help protect much 
of the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forecast will take the storm near or just east of the  
Bahamas and possibly toward the Carolinas,'' said hurricane 
specialist Jack Beven of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was upgraded to a hurricane with 75 mph winds late  
Wednesday off the southern Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Beven said Dennis might spin out to sea, but it was too early to  
predict. He urged people on the southeast coast of the United 
States, primarily North and South Carolina, to closely monitor 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Bahamian meteorologist Tony Smith said the storm might skirt the  
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	``The path we have suggests it's not going to hit any of the  
islands directly,'' Smith said. Dennis was expected to come closest 
to Eleuthera island, passing about 40 miles away from it Friday 
morning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, Dennis was about 40 miles east-northeast of San  
Salvador and 210 miles east-southeast of Nassau, the capital. The 
hurricane was moving west-northwest around 7 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With top winds of 74 mph, Dennis was barely a hurricane, but  
forecasters predicted the storm would strengthen. Hurricane force 
winds extended 45 miles from its center. 
</P>
<P>
	The tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas and  
Turks and Caicos Islands was discontinued. But Bahamian authorities 
announced a hurricane warning for the central Bahamas, including 
Nassau, and a hurricane watch for the northwest Bahamian islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Dennis reached hurricane strength, residents of  
North Carolina began taking precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some water stockpiled,'' said Scott Garner, assistant  
fire marshal in Brunswick County. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had been watching the interaction between Tropical  
Storm Emily and Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cindy has taken a bit more of a turn to the north than we  
expected,'' Beven said, explaining that the storms were now too far 
apart to affect one another. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cindy was no threat to land, forecasters cautioned people  
in the Lesser Antilles of the eastern Caribbean to keep an eye on 
Emily. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. EDT, Emily was about 275 miles east of Dominica. The  
small storm was traveling northwest at about 8 mph. Its top winds 
were 45 mph, and forecasters said they expected no change in its 
strength over the next 24 hours.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Sosa Hits 53rd Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit his major league-leading 53rd home  
run Thursday, moving him two ahead of Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa connected on a 1-1 pitch from San Francisco's Livan  
Hernandez with one out in the fifth inning, sending it just inside 
the left-field foul pole. Sosa has homered in two consecutive games 
and has 10 in his last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa hit his 53rd homer in the Cubs' 126th game. Last year, he

<HEADLINE> Double Murderer Gets Life Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- In a bizarre case that drew national attention to  
the practices of bounty hunters, a man has been given two life 
prison sentences for killing a couple during a bogus bust two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Sanders, 42, was sentenced Wednesday. There is no  
possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of five masked and heavily armed men who burst into a  
Phoenix home in the dead of night on Aug. 31, 1997, and fatally 
shot a young couple in bed. The men claimed to be bounty hunters 
looking for a California bail jumper. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors later determined the story was a ruse, and the  
suspects were actually looking to ransack 25-year-old Christopher 
Foote's house in search of drugs and money. 
</P>
<P>
	Three suspects still await trial. A fourth pleaded guilty to  
second-degree murder in a plea agreement that required him to 
testify against Sanders, who was convicted of murder last October 
in a case that led to a new Arizona law governing bounty hunters. 
</P>
<P>
	The case took another strange twist when public defender Carmen  
Fischer was accused of having a jailhouse affair with Sanders. She 
has acknowledged only a ``personal relationship'' with him. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge removed Fischer from the case over conflict-of-interest  
concern and she could face disbarment. Sanders' family rehired her 
for the defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law was pretty clear that this wasn't a death penalty  
case, but the emotions ran very high in this case,'' Fischer said. 
``You never know until the final words are spoken.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Superior Court Judge Gregory Martin said several circumstances  
did not allow for the death penalty, including evidence that the 
shooting was not planned beforehand and Foote apparently shot 
first. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sentencing, Sanders told the court he was haunted by the  
deaths of Foote and his girlfriend, Spring Wright, but blamed it on 
a shootout that Foote prompted. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Chris several times to put his hands down and put the  
gun down. Instead, he shot me,'' Sanders said. ``Only then did I 
return fire because I was in fear for my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new state law, bounty hunters no longer can kick in  
doors to collar bail jumpers; they must first get permission to 
enter. Felons can't be bounty hunters, and wearing clothing or 
badges that gives the impression that a bounty hunter is a cop is 
banned. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the law could actually lure bail jumpers to  
Arizona.

<HEADLINE>  Clashes Kill Three in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Militiamen today clashed with supporters  
of independence for East Timor, leaving three people dead and many 
others wounded, days before a vote on the troubled territory's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	After an anti-independence rally in Dili's main sports stadium,  
militiamen fired shots at pro-independence activists in the eastern 
part of the capital. Militiamen later roamed Dili's deserted 
streets and Indonesian police sealed off large sections of the town 
as frightened residents stayed indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor is due to vote Monday in a U.N.-supervised referendum  
that will offer its 800,000 people a choice between independence 
and remaining part of Indonesia as an autonomous province. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said at least two people were killed when militiamen  
fired shots and hurled bombs at groups of rock-throwing 
separatists. Another was shot to death by Indonesian police, 
accused by witnesses of doing little to prevent attacks by 
militiamen. Unconfirmed reports said the death toll was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people sustained gunshot wounds and many more were stabbed  
or hit by rocks and bottles. Blasts from homemade explosives 
repeatedly rocked the area. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indonesian presidential spokesman announced that jailed East  
Timorese rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao will be 
released in about three weeks. Gusmao, who is under house arrest in 
Jakarta, is revered by many East Timorese and is widely expected to 
become the province's president if it gains independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has already twice postponed the independence  
ballot because of violence. When asked whether the latest outbreak 
might force yet another delay, Ian Martin, head of the U.N. mission 
in East Timor, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The world body has repeatedly said the ballot must be conducted  
in an atmosphere free of violence and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, triggering decades of

human rights organizations say authorities have organized and armed

colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's trouble erupted after more than 15,000 anti-independence  
supporters staged a rally in Dili's streets and the stadium.

<P>
	At the rally, anti-independence leaders warned that civil war  
would erupt if the vote is for independence. ``If East Timor

<HEADLINE> Russia Probes Money Launder Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's top prosecutor has ordered an  
investigation into an alleged money laundering scheme linking 
Russian businessmen to billions of dollars that flowed through the 
Bank of New York, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials had said little about the scandal since it  
broke a week ago, saying it had nothing to do with the Russian 
government. But acting Prosecutor General Vladimir Ustinov has now 
called for the Federal Security Service to ``check the facts cited 
in the Russian and foreign press reports on the scandal around the 
Bank of New York,'' according to a statement from Ustinov's office. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. newspaper reports have cited American investigators saying  
as much as $15 billion was laundered through U.S. banks, including 
the Bank of New York. Some $4.2 billion passed through a single 
Bank of New York account in more than 10,000 transactions between 
October and March, The New York Times reported last week, citing 
unidentified investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times reported today that authorities have seized about $20  
million in two Bank of New York accounts linked to the alleged 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	In money laundering, illicit profits from criminal activities  
often are moved through a series of bank accounts to make them 
appear to be legitimate business proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will check all the facts ... although today newspapers  
write anything,'' the statement from Ustinov's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the people reportedly under investigation is Konstantin  
Kagalovsky, Russia's representative to the International Monetary 
Fund from 1992 to 1995. He now is vice president of Russia's oil 
giant Yukos. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal reported today that U.S. and  
international investigators are looking into whether Kagalovsky 
helped construct a byzantine network of offshore corporations that 
politically connected or mob-linked Russians may have used to 
siphon hundreds of millions of dollars out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Kagalovsky is married to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, a senior  
vice president of the Bank of New York who supervised its East 
European division out of New York City. She is one of two 
Russian-born senior officers suspended by the bank last week as 
news of the U.S. investigation surfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, no one has been charged in Russia or the United States.  
</P>
<P>
	The money-laundering case is only one of several financial  
scandals currently linked to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian newspaper Corriere della Serra reported Wednesday  
that Swiss and Russian prosecutors investigating the Russian mob 
uncovered payments of more than $1 million to President Boris 
Yeltsin and his daughters. The newspaper alleged that the Mabetex 
construction company routed the money to Kremlin manager Pavel 
Borodin, who in turn made it available to Yeltsin and his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to the report, the Kremlin said today that Yeltsin  
and his family have never had a foreign bank account and have 
always abided by the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``This campaign has been unleashed in order to discredit me and  
the state leaders,'' Borodin told the Interfax news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Borodin, as well as his wife and members of Yeltsin's  
administration, are targets of a Swiss criminal investigation into 
alleged money laundering in Russia. Swiss prosecutors have asked 
Swiss banks to freeze assets allegedly belonging to Borodin and 21 
others, according to Swiss media reports. Borodin has denied that 
he has any Swiss bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the Mabetex firm also denied the newspaper report in  
remarks published in the Russian daily Segodnya. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another attempt to blacken me, to cast a shadow on  
Borodin and to slander the Russian president,'' Bahgjet Pacolli 
told the Russian paper.

<HEADLINE>  Clashes Kill Three in East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DILI, Indonesia (AP) -- Militiamen today clashed with supporters  
of independence for East Timor, leaving three people dead and many 
others wounded, days before a vote on the troubled territory's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	After an anti-independence rally in Dili's main sports stadium,  
militiamen fired shots at pro-independence activists in the eastern 
part of the capital. Militiamen later roamed Dili's deserted 
streets and Indonesian police sealed off large sections of the town 
as frightened residents stayed indoors. 
</P>
<P>
	East Timor is due to vote Monday in a U.N.-supervised referendum  
that will offer its 800,000 people a choice between independence 
and remaining part of Indonesia as an autonomous province. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said at least two people were killed when militiamen  
fired shots and hurled bombs at groups of rock-throwing 
separatists. Another was shot to death by Indonesian police, 
accused by witnesses of doing little to prevent attacks by 
militiamen. Unconfirmed reports said the death toll was higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Three people sustained gunshot wounds and many more were stabbed  
or hit by rocks and bottles. Blasts from homemade explosives 
repeatedly rocked the area. 
</P>
<P>
	An Indonesian presidential spokesman announced that jailed East  
Timorese rebel leader Jose Alexandre ``Xanana'' Gusmao will be 
released in about three weeks. Gusmao, who is under house arrest in 
Jakarta, is revered by many East Timorese and is widely expected to 
become the province's president if it gains independence. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations has already twice postponed the independence  
ballot because of violence. When asked whether the latest outbreak 
might force yet another delay, Ian Martin, head of the U.N. mission 
in East Timor, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The world body has repeatedly said the ballot must be conducted  
in an atmosphere free of violence and intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975, triggering decades of  
civil strife and human rights abuses by the military. The U.N. and 
human rights organizations say authorities have organized and armed 
militants, who have terrorized voters in the former Portuguese 
colony. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's trouble erupted after more than 15,000 anti-independence

<HEADLINE> Johnson May Be Saving His Best </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Michael Johnson's world record is  
unbelievable, but maybe his best hasn't been seen yet. 
</P>
<P>
	That was the reaction to Johnson's scintillating performance on  
Thursday at the World Championships after he set a mark of 43.18, 
eclipsing fellow American Butch Reynolds' 11-year old mark by .11 
of a second. 
</P>
<P>
	``No words can explain him,'' said U.S. triple jumper Erick  
Walder. ``He's superhuman. He's phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Britain's Jamie Baulch, who was dead-last in the eight-man final  
in 45.18, sought Johnson out after the race to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``That time is unbelievable,'' Baulch said. ``This is the first  
time I've ever spoken to him. I just had to give him a hug. I just 
told him he was unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's on a par with 19.32,'' he added, referring to Johnson's  
world-record time at 200 meters set in the '96 Atlanta Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Olympic triple-jump gold-medalist Mike Conley picked  
Johnson to go even faster and break the 43-second barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's going to go in the 90s (42.90s),'' Conley said.  
``I think he will go 90-something this year. You get a meet where 
you don't have rounds, he can run at a certain speed for a long 
time. He picks a speed and he stays there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde Hart, his coach since 1986, also expects more.  
</P>
<P>
	``He broke this record by a little bit more than I thought he  
would the first time he broke it,'' Hart said. ``Now that he's 
broken it, I think he'll do it again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did that in the 200. It just might not be this year. It  
might be next year at the Olympics -- that's a pretty big setting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how fast Johnson might run, the Texan drawled: ``Faster  
than the other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We never mentioned the world record before the race at the  
warm-up track,'' he said. ``I just told Michael to go out and run 
what I knew he was capable of. It was an opportunity and we don't 
know how often those opportunities are going to be there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Primo Nebiolo, the Italian who heads the world governing body of  
track and field, called Johnson a ``fantastic athlete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great publicity for athletics,'' he said. ``He's a  
hero for us. I have great appreciation for him, as an athlete and 
also as a man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nebiolo, as he presented Johnson the gold medal, asked him when  
he knew he would break the mark. ``He said, `Yesterday when I ran 
(43.95) in the semifinals.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was also lauded by the silver and bronze medalists in  
the race: Sanderlei Parrela of Brazil (44.29) and Mexico's 
Alejandro Cardenas (44.31). They were over a second behind Johnson 
but have only one goal in mind: beating him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Johnson is a monster, a phenom,'' the Brazilian said. ``But I  
can run better and I can overtake him soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Michael embraced me,'' Cardenas said. ``We live only one hour  
apart from Texas to Sonora.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm waiting for Sydney to attack Michael Johnson there.  
Michael Johnson is my hero. I admire his skill of running with a 
mixture of relaxing and a minimum of effort.''

<HEADLINE> Michael Johnson Breaks 400m Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- With his churning legs a blur and his feet  
flashing gold, Michael Johnson did it again. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson shattered another world record Thursday night -- this  
time, breaking the 400-meter mark with a sensational clocking of 
43.18 seconds at the World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	In clipping .11 seconds off the record of 43.29 set by Butch  
Reynolds in 1988, the confident, highly focused Johnson gave a 
performance reminiscent of his 200-meter triumph at the 1996 
Olympics. With his all-gold shoes flashing on the Atlanta track, he 
clocked an astounding 19.32, cracking his 200 world record by .34 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the difference was not as huge this time, Johnson and his  
black-and-gold shoes still left his pursuers far behind, with 
runner-up Sanderlei Parrela of Brazil more than one second back at 
44.29. 
</P>
<P>
	But just like Atlanta, as Johnson crossed the finish line, he  
spread both hands out toward the crowd and smiled broadly. Then, he 
stood next to the field clock that showed his time. 
</P>
<P>
	After receiving congratulations from the other runners, he lay  
down on the track for a minute, soaking up the applause. He then 
rose and began his victory lap, carrying an American flag, by 
slapping hands with fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Johnson said he could run even faster.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can do better, but it's a world record. I broke the world  
record in the 200 and then shattered it,'' he said, referring first 
to his 19.66 at the 1996 U.S. championships at Atlanta. ``I think I 
can do the same thing in the 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the kind of shape I'm in, I know I can run 42 seconds. I  
refuse to believe I can't do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was only the second time in 31 years that the 400 record has  
been broken. Lee Evans' record of 43.86, set in the 1968 Mexico 
Olympics, stood for 20 years before Reynolds broke it. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is only the second runner to hold both long sprint  
records at the same time. The other was Tommie Smith, who owned the 
220-yard record from 1966-68 and the 440-yard mark from 1967-68. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Conley, the 1992 Olympic triple jump champion and now  
elite athlete coordinator for USA Track and Field, thinks Johnson 
can break the 43-second barrier -- and in the not too distant 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he'll go 42.90-something this year,'' Conley said.  
``You get a meet where he doesn't have to run rounds and he can do 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 400 record was one Johnson had been chasing nearly his  
entire career, and after overcoming health problems this year, 
including a misalignment of his hips, he ran it down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world record had been a long time in coming,'' Johnson  
said. ``This was the perfect setting. I wanted the medal, but I 
also wondered how many more times I would have to lower the 
record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson probably ranks as the most dominating track and field  
athlete of the 1990s. The record capped a remarkable decade in 
which he broke two records, became the first man to sweep the 200 
and 400 at the same Olympic Games (1996), and the first to sweep 
both long sprints at the World Championships (1995). He also won 
four consecutive world titles in the 400 and he won two 200 world 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's superhuman, he's phenomenal,'' U.S. long jumper Erick  
Walder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my hero,'' third-place finisher Alejandro Cardenas of  
Mexico said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was so confident that he felt he would be running alone  
near the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt like running 21 flat for 200,'' he said. ``I didn't  
feel like any of the other guys were going to do that. I knew I was 
going to have a lead. I had to make sure I didn't panic having that 
kind of lead and back off. I had to trust in my ability to finish 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That he did, powering away from the field down the final  
straightaway as the crowd of 41,515 stood and cheered. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's splits for each 100 were approximately 10.9, 10.1,  
11.3 and 11.9. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and his coach of 14 years, Clyde Hart, had planned to  
chase Reynolds' mark this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``My coach and I sat down at the beginning of the year and he  
asked me what I wanted to do,'' Johnson said. '' I said, `I want to 
break the world record in the 400.' 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew the opportunity was there to get the world record  
because I'm in great shape. It's a World Championships and the 
motivation was there, I just wanted to make sure I didn't mess up 
the opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first world record broken at the championships and  
earned Johnson a $100,000 bonus, on top of the $60,000 for the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
	In winning, Johnson also tied Carl Lewis for the most gold  
medals at the championships with eight. He can break that record 
Sunday as the anchor on the United States' 1,600-meter relay team 
in the final event. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's other three finals produced two championship records.  
</P>
<P>
	Maksim Tarasov extended Russia's domination of the men's pole  
vault -- Sergei Bubka won the event at the first six championships -- 
by winning at 19 feet, 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia's Gete Wami, the 1996 Olympic bronze medalist in the  
women's 10,000 meters, took 16 seconds off the championship record, 
beating Britain's Paula Radcliffe by more than two seconds at 
30:24.56. 
</P>
<P>
	In Thursday's other final, Australia's Cathy Freeman, who in  
1997 became the first aboriginal to win a world title, won the 
women's 400 again at 49.67, the second-fastest in the world this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Marion Jones, the women's 100-meter gold medalist and  
long jump bronze medalist, was declared out of the championships 
one day after pulling up in the semifinals of the 200 with back 
pain and spasms. Jones, who had declared her intention of winning 
an unprecedented four golds, was to have been a member of one of 
the U.S. relay teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones was still being re-evaluated Thursday and her  
participation again this season is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Devers, the 1993 and 1995 world champion in the women's 100  
hurdles, blazed through her quarterfinal heat in 12.53, her 
season's best and the fastest among those advancing to the 
semifinals. Sweden's Ludmila Engquist, the defending champion and 
Olympic gold medalist who is competing despite being in the middle 
of chemotherapy treatment for breast cancer, won her heat in 12.65.

<HEADLINE> Gang Member's Cars Impounded in Ill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Town President Betty Loren-Maltese doesn't  
mince words in her zeal to rid this blue-collar Chicago suburb of 
its street gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These punks are not going to beat us, even if we have setbacks  
on certain things,'' she said. ``There's more than one way to skin 
a cat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Town Board approved a revised anti-gang plan Tuesday that  
allows police to impound the car of anyone under 17 caught out 
after curfew -- between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. on weekdays and 10 p.m. 
and 6 a.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
	The original plan, announced in June, would have given officers  
authority to seize the cars of suspected gang members. But 
Loren-Maltese withdrew the plan after the American Civil Liberties 
Union filed a lawsuit to block its enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The town has been known since the gangster era as a haven for  
organized crime. Federal prosecutors have brought corruption 
charges against eight former Cicero officials and police officers 
over the last year, according to the U.S. Attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren-Maltese, however, has focused on street gangs. In April,  
she led an effort to pass an ordinance designed to exile gang 
members from Cicero. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the law, believed to be the first of its kind in the  
nation, those involved in illegal gang activity must promise not to 
do it again. If they refuse or go back on their word, they have 60 
days to leave town or face a $500-a-day fine. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has not decided whether to challenge the impound law,  
said spokesman Ed Yohnka. But he said the group is generally 
opposed to curfew ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that the matter of what time a child is out or a  
minor is out ought to be left between her and her parents,'' he 
said. ``There's no reason for the government to insinuate itself 
into the matter.''

<HEADLINE> Guerrero Hitting Streak at 31 Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero hit a two-run homer in his  
second at-bat Thursday night to extend his hitting streak to 31 
games, the longest streak in the majors since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrero drove the first pitch he saw in the fourth inning from  
Cincinnati's Juan Guzman over the wall in right center for his 32nd 
homer. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the longest streak in the majors since San Diego's Benito  
Santiago had a 34-gamer from Aug. 25-Oct. 2, 1987. Paul Molitor had 
a 39-game streak earlier the same season, the longest streak since 
Pete Rose tied Wee Willie Keeler's NL mark with a 44-game streak in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's Luis Gonzalez had a 30-game streak earlier this  
season, as did Baltimore's Eric Davis in 1998 and Boston's Nomar

<HEADLINE> Gene Study: Eat Less, Live Longer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genes that play a key role in aging tend to  
stay vigorous in response to a low-calorie diet, says a study that 
may help explain why animals that eat less often live longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomas A. Prolla and Richard Weindruch, both of the University of  
Wisconsin, Madison, said their genetic analysis of mice showed that 
genes that normally deteriorate with age tended to continue 
functioning in a youthful way when the mice were underfed.

	They said the study, to be published in the journal Science on  
Friday, may explain why a reduced-calorie diet can cause mice to 
live up to 50 percent longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Weindruch said it is not scientifically appropriate yet to  
recommend that people of normal weight go on calorie-restricted 
diets in order to prolong life, but he added: ``This line of 
research bears watching.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also said the research could lead to drugs that would help  
slow the aging process in humans, although there have been no 
definitive studies proving that a reduced-calorie diet in humans 
will extend life. 
</P>
<P>
	What is clear, Weindruch said, is that obesity damages health  
and that one reason for this might be changes in genes linked to 
aging. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been studies in monkeys that show a low calorie diet  
does lower blood pressure and raise levels of ``good'' cholesterol, 
both signs of improved health that suggest a longer life. Those 
studies, however, did not examine the fundamental genetic changes 
that occur as a part of the aging process. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study is quite important because it breaks new ground in  
giving us an understanding of what happens to gene expression with 
age,'' said Dr. Raj Sohal, a professor of biological sciences at 
Southern Methodist University. Although the study was with mice, he 
said it suggests that ``if you overeat, you are accelerating the 
aging process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This study has analyzed more genes with regard to aging than  
all previous studies combined,'' said Prolla. He said 5 to 10 
percent of the entire mouse genome was examined. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Wisconsin laboratory study, the researchers fed one group  
of mice a regular diet while restricting by 24 percent the calories 
in the food given to another group. The diets all contained 
healthful levels of vitamins, minerals and proteins. Only the 
calories were reduced. This creates a condition of undernutrition, 
but not malnutrition, Weindruch said. 
</P>
<P>
	After 30 months, muscles were taken from the animals and the  
activity of 6,347 genes was analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We chose muscle for analysis because it is an important target  
for the effects of aging,'' said Weindruch. ``Muscle is lost 
routinely with old age and contributes to physical frailty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that more than 100 genes either increased  
or decreased their activity with age. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the molecular level, normal aging looks like a state of  
chronic injury in muscle,'' said Prolla. 
</P>
<P>
	However, for mice fed the restricted diet, about 84 percent of  
the genetic alterations associated with aging were completely or 
partially suppressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the molecular level,'' the study found,  
``calorie-restricted mice appear to be biologically younger than 
animals receiving the control diet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This clearly suggests that the reduction of calorie intake not  
only increases lifespan in mice, but seems to affect a broad 
spectrum of age-associated changes at the gene expression level,'' 
said Weindruch. He said these genetic changes clearly play a role 
in extending life in those animals. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the genes affected by aging are those that help the body  
rid itself of oxygen radicals, chemicals produced during the 
process of metabolizing calories in cells. Oxygen radicals are 
known to be damaging to DNA, the body's genetic material. 
</P>
<P>
	Mice fed the full-calorie diet tended to lose the benefit of  
these oxygen radical control genes with age. The genes continued to 
work vigorously, however, in mice fed the calorie restricted genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the study evaluated muscles, Weindruch said that similar  
molecular effects may occur in the brain and in the heart, both of 
which tend to show the effects of the aging process.

<HEADLINE> Heyns Breaks 200m Breaststroke Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- South African swimmer Penny Heyns  
continued her world-record rampage today, breaking her own mark in 
the 200-meter breaststroke semifinals at the Pan Pacific 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her sixth record in an amazing five-week run during which  
she has lowered both the 100 and 200 three times each. 
</P>
<P>
	Her latest record was the eighth of the PanPacs in five days of  
competition, and her second of the meet. She also lowered the 
100-meter mark in the preliminary heats. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest I was really uptight about it all last night,''  
Heyns said. ``I have to say this morning I felt it was time to go 
home. I was really tired of racing, but I thought that's not why I 
swim. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sooner or later I'm going to retire and I only have `x' amount  
of swims left so I must enjoy every one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heyns broke four world records last month in Los Angeles, two in  
each event, and her 2:24.42 Wednesday was .9 seconds under her 
2:24.51 on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	American Mary T. Meagher's 18-year-old swimming record survived  
the record rush as Australian Susie O'Neill missed her chance in 
the 200 butterfly. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old O'Neill was under record pace at 150 meters but  
could not finish it off. She finished with a time of 2:06.60, the 
same as her best before her 2:06.53 Wednesday. She was unable to 
topple Meagher's 2:05.96 set Aug. 13, 1981 at Brown Deer, 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill faced enormous pressure before the race and even  
Meagher, now Mary Plant, said she hoped O'Neill would break 
swimming's longest standing record -- men's or women's. 
</P>
<P>
	``One day, hopefully, maybe, I can do it,'' O'Neill said. ``I  
want to keep swimming until I do. Maybe I'll be around at 35 at 
this rate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jenny Thompson, who broke Meagher's 100 butterfly world record  
Monday -- the second-oldest mark -- returned to action with the 
fastest qualifying time from the semis of the 100 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	She also won her 21st PanPac gold medal as the United States  
800-meter freestyle relay team set the second fastest time ever. 
Thompson, Lindsay Benko, Ellen Stonebraker and Cristina Teuscher 
finished at 7:57.61, beating the 1994 Chinese time of 7:57.96 but 
missing East Germany's record of 7:55.47 from 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's Michael Klim was under Alex Popov's world record  
pace halfway through the 100 freestyle final but was unable to 
sustain his pace. Klim managed to hold off American Neil Walker to 
get his third gold of the meet, but his 48.98 was slower than his 
best of 48.73 and Popov's 48.21. 
</P>
<P>
	Australian Simon Cowley wrapped up a breaststroke double when he  
added the 200 gold to the 100 title from earlier in the meet. 
Cowley was one-half length behind American Tom Wilkens with 50 to 
swim, but caught him halfway down the stretch to finish in a 
national record of 2:12.98. 
</P>
<P>
	American Lenny Krayzelburg, who broke the 100 backstroke world  
record Wednesday, tuned up for an attempt to break the 200 record 
by qualifying fastest through today's semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Krayzelburg, aiming to break Martin Lopez Zubero's 1991 mark of  
1:56.57, was a second under world record pace at the halfway mark. 
He stayed on target through 150 but eased down the stretch, saving 
energy for Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
	``That time was my goal and I'm looking forward to tomorrow  
night,'' said Krayzelburg.

<HEADLINE> Williams, Seles Advance At Pilot Pen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) -- Now appearing at the net: Venus  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-ager with the blistering serve is finding new ways to  
punish opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	She blended strength with touch Wednesday to breeze into the  
quarterfinals of the Pilot Pen with a 6-1, 6-1 victory over Maria 
Antonia Sanchez Lorenzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was making a lot of good shots. I was actually coming to the  
net. It's a rare appearance to see me at the net. I'm going to 
really try to keep coming,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 127-mph serve is still tops on the women's tour. She hit  
only one ace against Sanchez Lorenzo and instead carved up her 
opponent with a crisp serve-and-volley game, showing a deft touch 
at the net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just don't want to hold back. I just want to go out there  
and hit the ball. I got passed a couple times and I'm not afraid of 
it,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, 19, is seeded seventh and is looking for her fifth  
title of the year. She faces qualifier Magui Serna today. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Seles barely broke a sweat in her first set against Elena  
Likhovtseva, then had to hang on against the Russian for a 6-0, 7-6 
(8-6) second-round victory. She'll take on fifth-seeded Amanda 
Coetzer in a quarterfinal today. 
</P>
<P>
	The 25-year-old Seles needed just 12 minutes to win the first  
set. But Likhovtseva found her touch and her legs in the second 
match, running down Seles' crosscourt returns and scoring on 
several drop shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Elena is a fighter. I knew she would come out,'' Seles  
said. ``We could have gone to three sets very easily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seles, seeded third and ranked fifth in the world, said her  
biggest advantage was ``not getting really frustrated when I let 
her back in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without a permanent coach since her father, Karolj, died last  
year, Seles has turned to several people to work on her game. The 
most recent is former pro Jimmy Arias, who lives about 25 minutes 
from Seles in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can relate to a lot of things,'' she said. ``As a player,  
he knows so much about the game. He also knows how my dad worked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania beat fourth-seeded  
Jana Novotna 7-6 (7-5), 6-0; Amelie Mauresmo of France beat 
sixth-seeded countrywoman Julie Halard-Decugis 6-1, 6-2; Coetzer 
advanced when Sabine Applemans retired because of a stomach virus; 
and eighth-seeded Sandrine Testude beat Barbara Schwartz 6-4, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Novotna has had few matches since the French Open, in which she  
sprained her right ankle. She attributed Tuesday's loss to a lack 
of matches, limited movement and ``a very poor variety of shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I never gave her the opportunity to make a mistake,'' Novotna  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dragomir saw things a bit differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good match, a lot of ups and downs,'' Dragomir said.  
``I think I won because I won all the important points.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Drops 31 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were slightly lower in early trading  
today as investors collected profits after blue chips reached new 
highs on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones  
industrial average was down 31.35 at 11,294.69. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500  
index was down 2.61 at 1,379.18, and the Nasdaq composite index was 
up 2.02 at 2,807.62. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow reached a new record close of 11,326.04 Wednesday as  
investors celebrated the Federal Reserve's decision to raise 
interest rates modestly. Wall Street was especially cheered by the 
Fed's suggestion that inflation now appears to be on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Commerce Department offered additional evidence that  
the growth of the U.S. economy has not escalated too sharply. The 
gross domestic product -- the total output of goods and services -- 
grew at a substantially slower annual rate of 1.8 percent in the 
second quarter, reflecting the drag from a bloated trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil company stocks were mostly lower today, following a steep  
dive in prices on Wednesday. Inventory figures showed unexpectedly 
weak gasoline consumption as the peak season winds down, pushing 
crude oil futures lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Chevron fell 1 7/8 to 93 3/16, and Texaco was down 1 1/8 at 63 7/16.  
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 92.4 million shares, 
behind Wednesday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.1 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.7 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Ford Wins Site Restraining Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. has won a temporary  
restraining order against the producer of an Internet site that the 
automaker says illegally reveals company secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The court order, issued Wednesday in Detroit by U.S. District  
Judge Nancy G. Edmunds, mandates that Robert Lane of Dearborn, 
Mich., stop publishing confidential documents provided by Ford 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford plans to seek a permanent ban on Lane's site,  
http://www.blueovalnews.com, at a hearing next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lane vowed to keep publishing the site as an exercise of  
free speech. He said he is trying to arm consumers with up-to-date 
information -- including confidential environmental tests, reports 
on assembly glitches and photos of future products -- so they can 
make informed decisions about Ford purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the court order, Lane must tell the court within 10  
days which Ford documents he has and who gave them to him. He also 
must stop displaying the automaker's trademark blue oval insignia 
on his site. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane, a Mustang collector, originally designed a site in  
February 1998 named www.fordworldnews.com that was dedicated to his 
favorite car. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Lane said, he began receiving complaints from  
Mustang owners, and then e-mail and anonymous documents from 
Mustang engineers. 
</P>
<P>
	Lane said Ford contacted him when he began posting the material  
on his site, telling him to erase the documents. He refused. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's attorneys demanded he change the site's name in  
October 1998. He complied, switching to the current name. 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't as if we were just trying to shut down a Web site  
that discusses Ford,'' said Ford spokesman Jim Cain, adding that 
Lane also tried to sell the documents on the Internet. ``Ford 
documents are copyrighted materials and the copying and 
dissemination of these documents is a copyright infringement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Free speech advocates are expected to watch the case closely.  
The outcome may help companies determine how they can police the 
Internet without violating the First Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will fight for the right to exist, to express our thoughts,  
beliefs and emotions,'' Lane wrote on the Web site.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinian Negotiators Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- With a Palestinian official reporting a  
breakthrough on an Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank, the top 
Palestinian negotiator met with his Israeli counterpart a final 
time today before leaving for a briefing with U.S. Secretary of 
State Madeleine Albright. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiator, Saeb Erekat, was originally scheduled to meet  
Albright in Washington today. Instead, he met with his counterpart, 
Gilead Sher, in Israel. He hoped to catch an early evening flight 
to Washington to see Albright on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The flurry of talks came as a Palestinian official, speaking on  
condition of anonymity, said an agreement had been reached on a 
timetable for Israel's withdrawal from the West Bank. A withdrawal 
plan had been outlined in the accords brokered by President Clinton 
at Wye River, Md., last October, but Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's 
prime minister at the time, froze the agreement a month later. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new agreement reported Wednesday by the Palestinian  
official, Israel's withdrawal from a portion of the territory would 
start at the beginning of September and be completed in 
mid-January. 
</P>
<P>
	The Palestinians had been demanding the withdrawal end earlier,  
but agreed to compromise in return for more land than had been 
promised in the Wye accords, the official told The Associated 
Press. Instead of receiving 5 percent of the West Bank in the first 
stage of the withdrawal, the Palestinians would receive 7 percent, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator, denied the leaked  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were unable to bridge any of the gaps,'' Erekat told The  
Associated Press after six hours of discussion Wednesday. 
``Tomorrow we hope to be in a position to finalize these two 
issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Erekat's decision to delay the U.S. briefing appeared to  
confirm reports that the sides were trying to come up with good 
news before Albright's planned arrival here on Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides are frustrated by leaks that often prove premature.  
Israel's morning papers were filled today with conflicting reports 
of progress -- or a lack thereof -- attributed to unnamed Palestinian 
sources. Two papers said there would be a withdrawal breakthrough; 
two papers said there was a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still no agreement on the other major deadlocked issue  
-- the release of jailed Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides had agreed that Israel would release 750 Palestinian  
prisoners. But they disagree on what kind of prisoners will be 
freed and whether Israel will release anyone jailed for 
anti-Israeli attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the sides achieved agreement on two important  
symbols of Palestinian sovereignty: a safe passage through Israel 
for Palestinians traveling between the West Bank and Gaza, and the 
building of a harbor in Gaza.

<HEADLINE> Dolphins' Tony Martin Found Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tony Martin, acquitted  
on all charges of money laundering, walked away from the federal 
courthouse Thursday vowing to clean up his life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to be more strict on myself and trust my family  
more,'' the Pro Bowl receiver said as dozens of friends and family 
members clustered behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors deliberated almost 17 hours over three days before  
finding Martin innocent on four counts of laundering drug money on 
behalf of longtime friend Rickey Brownlee and one count of 
conspiracy to hide drug proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 33, could have faced three to five years in prison if  
convicted, effectively ending his NFL career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was all or nothing, and my whole career was flashing before  
me as I sat there,'' Martin said. ``This is a lot of weight off my 
shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brownlee was found guilty on all five money laundering charges  
and one count each of possessing heroin or cocaine with the intent 
to distribute and conspiracy to possess and distribute. 
</P>
<P>
	With two prior drug convictions on his record, he faces life in  
prison when he is sentenced on Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors from the U.S. Attorney's Office would not comment  
after court was adjourned. Jurors also refused interview requests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's result leaves Martin free to join the Dolphins, who  
signed him to a four-year, $14.2 million contract in April. He 
promised to be at practice Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get ready for practice now,'' he said. ``Coach  
might make me run extra laps, but that's OK. I'm ready for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Jimmy Johnson and several Dolphins players sat through  
opening arguments to show their support for Martin, and quarterback 
Dan Marino took the stand as a character witness. 
</P>
<P>
	Some criticized the moves as a power play, but Martin was  
grateful for the turnout. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think that was inappropriate,'' he said. ``The guys  
have always been there for me. I'm happy they supported me. Dan 
Marino has known me 10 or 11 years. He knows the person I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson, speaking after practice, said he had no qualms about  
signing Martin despite the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here knew him because he is from here, he played  
for the Dolphins for a short time and everybody said he is a really 
good person,'' Johnson said. ``I called the league office and Tony 
has been in this league for 10 years and they said for 10 years he 
has been clean on everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dolphins receiver O.J. McDuffie said the trial has managed to  
bring the team closer together. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worried about him a lot,'' McDuffie said. ``Now that it's  
over with, I'm happy that we can get down to football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the criminal charges, the trial also put Martin's dismal  
financial history on display. Despite making some $9.1 million over 
his nine-year NFL career, the Miami native managed to spend nearly 
$11 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin filed for bankruptcy in March, owing creditors more than  
$1.8 million. With the acquittal, he can start collecting the 
remaining $3.15 million of his $3.3 million signing bonus from the 
Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daddy always told me to find the positive in things,'' said  
Hal Martin, Tony's father, who sat directly behind his son 
throughout the 3 1/2-week trial. ``If somebody can learn from this, 
that's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The receiver sat expressionless, almost in a daze as the  
verdicts were read, bowing his head when the final ``not guilty'' 
was heard. Lead attorney Howard Srebnick hugged the receiver and 
started to cry. Hal Martin shouted, ``Praise God.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Martin celebrated privately in a side room with his  
lawyers and family members. When he emerged to leave, he still wore 
a smile of amazement mixed with joy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't have any doubts, but anytime you get in that  
situation when you have 12 people judging you, you get queasy a 
little bit,'' he said. ``I never had any doubt. I just had 
butterflies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the government's case centered on Brownlee, who served  
seven years in prison for a pair of 1980s drug convictions and was 
known on the streets as the ``Mayor of Opa-locka'' for his Robin 
Hood image. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors alleged Martin leased three cars in his name on  
behalf of Brownlee, who paid him back with cash. Martin also was 
accused of taking $100,000 in cash to reimburse a check written to 
Brownlee's first lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Srebnick painted a scenario in which Martin, who has known  
Brownlee since childhood and calls him his uncle, simply was trying 
to help a friend who provided love and support when the receiver 
was growing up in Miami's inner city. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was two separate cases,'' Srebnick said afterward. ``It was  
a completely different case for Mr. Brownlee compared to Mr. 
Martin. The evidence against Mr. Martin was completely different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he walked to his car, Martin said he truly believed that  
Brownlee had put his drug past behind him when he opened a pair of 
restaurants in Opa-locka. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew he was (a drug dealer) in the past,'' the receiver  
said. ``But I thought he'd cleaned his life up. I thought that was 
clean money.''

<P>
	FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Former Gov. Brereton Jones is leading a  
private group to push public school teachings of religion's role in 
American history. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, Public Education and Religion in Kentucky (PERK),  
does not advocate teaching specific religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody has the right to teach their religion in the  
classroom,'' Jones said. ``But neither does anyone have the right 
to rewrite history and pretend that religion had no role in 
American history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, governor from 1991 to '95, said teachers unsure of what  
they can say about religion's role in such areas as literature, 
history and the arts skip the subject. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Jo Kemper, director of the Kentucky Council of Churches,  
said, ``Our children are not being fully educated if there is a 
void in teaching the role of religion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	PERK worked with a state representative of the American Civil  
Liberties Union to develop a brochure. The eight-page pamphlet, for 
teachers and school administrators throughout the state, makes 
general suggestions for teaching religion's role in Kentucky's 
history, and the nation's. 
</P>
<P>
	The brochure also recommends that school districts provide  
workshops for teachers, and that colleges and universities offer 
courses to prepare educators to discuss religion in history and 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
	PERK also has a Web site that includes links to historical  
documents that may be used to highlight religion's impact through 
the years. They include the Mayflower Compact, Declaration of 
Independence, Constitution, Bill of Rights and Gettysburg Address. 
There also are speeches and letters by Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin 
Franklin and James Madison, and prominent court cases that involved 
religion.

 *Lutherans reject stricter abortion policy    	
</P>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Delegates to the national assembly of the 5.2  
million-member Evangelical Lutheran Church in America 
overwhelmingly rejected a conservative bid to change its policy on 
abortion and issued a decree on the economy, combining concern for 
the poor with criticism of unbridled captialism. 
</P>
<P>
	The abortion proposal sought to limit justified abortion to  
cases of rape, incest and threat to the mother's life. It also 
urged support of Lutherans for Life and crisis pregnancy centers. 
The proposal was turned down by 83 percent of voting delegates. 
</P>
<P>
	Current church policy includes abortion of fetuses with ``lethal  
abnormalities'' and says abortions should be legal, and subsidized 
for poor women, unless the fetus can live outside the womb. 
</P>
<P>
	The nine-page economics decree won 87.6 percent approval. It  
acknowledged the power of market economies to produce material 
prosperity but denounced ``excessive accumulation and consumerism 
driven by greed, gross economic disparities, and the degradation of 
nature.'' It also faulted state-sponsored gambling as harmful to 
the poor.

 *Gay synagogue in 25th year    	
</P>
<P>
	OAKLAND PARK, Fla. (AP) -- For a quarter century the Congregation  
Etz Chaim has been serving the gay and lesbian Jewish community. 
</P>
<P>
	The synagogue first met in private homes in Miami-Dade County,  
then in an artist's studio, then a store front. Now its 250 member 
families share space with the Unitarian Universalist Church in 
Oakland Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really a welcoming place,'' Karen Dale Wolman said,  
adding that in a traditional synagogue she would be questioned 
about whether she had a husband or children. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a presumption of heterosexuality,'' she said. ``Here,  
you don't get those questions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The congregation is led by Greg Kanter, its first full-time  
rabbi who is gay. It is Reform, although it has Orthodox and 
Conservative members. But people don't choose the congregation for 
its affiliation. Rather, Mindy Zimmerman, a vice president of 
membership, said, it is ``a safe place to be yourself.''

 *Ecumenical aid rescues old church    	
</P>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Old Christ Church, built in 1832 and  
recognized as Florida's oldest Protestant church, has been restored 
with an ecumenical effort and $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Roman Catholic cathedral in St. Augustine, built in 1796, is  
the state's oldest church, and a chapel at the Spanish fort in St. 
Augustine dates to the 1740s. 
</P>
<P>
	Methodists, Baptists, Presbyterians and Episcopalians joined to  
form Christ Church in 1829. It survived scorched-earth tactics in 
the Civil War and vandalism during the Great Depression. It was 
deeded to the city in 1936 and served as a public library until 
1959. The Pensacola Historical Society then used it as a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	When faced with the task of restoration in 1996, the city  
returned the property to Christ Episcopal Church, which had moved 
out nearly a century before. Ownership passed to the Old Christ 
Church Foundation, an ecumenical group formed to raise money for 
the restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	The foundation now leases it for $1 a year to a state agency  
that manages Historic Pensacola Village. It is available for 
meetings, concerts, lectures and weddings and open to school groups 
and tourists visiting Historic Pensacola Village. 
</P>
<P>
	``This church was organized as an ecumenical effort,'' said the  
Rev. Matt Currin, who led the restoration drive. ``And now, again, 
it's an ecumenical venture.''

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Upgraded to Hurricane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis crept toward the Bahamas  
and the Carolinas early today, but forecasters expected a weather 
system sweeping east across the United States to help protect much 
of the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our forecast will take the storm near or just east of the  
Bahamas and possibly toward the Carolinas,'' said hurricane 
specialist Jack Beven of the National Hurricane Center in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis was upgraded to a hurricane with 75 mph winds late  
Wednesday off the southern Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Beven said Dennis might spin out to sea, but it was too early to  
predict. He urged people on the southeast coast of the United 
States, primarily North and South Carolina, to closely monitor 
Dennis. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Dennis was about 275 miles east-southeast of  
Nassau. The hurricane was moving west-northwest around 5 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	With top winds of 75 mph, Dennis was barely a hurricane, but  
forecasters predicted the storm would strengthen. Hurricane force 
winds extended 45 miles from its center. 
</P>
<P>
	The tropical storm warning for the southeastern Bahamas and  
Turks and Caicos Islands was discontinued. But a tropical storm 
warning remained in effect for the rest of the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Dennis reached hurricane strength, North Carolinians  
began taking precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have some water stockpiled,'' said Scott Garner, assistant  
fire marshal in Brunswick County. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters had been watching the interaction between Tropical  
Storm Emily and Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cindy has taken a bit more of a turn to the north than we  
expected,'' Beven said, explaining that the storms were now too far 
apart to affect one another. 
</P>
<P>
	While Cindy was no threat to land, forecasters cautioned people  
in the Lesser Antilles of the eastern Caribbean to keep an eye on 
Emily. 
</P>
<P>
	At 5 a.m. EDT, Emily was about 300 miles east of Martinique. The  
small storm was traveling northwest at about 7 mph. Its top winds 
were 45 mph, and forecasters said slight strengthening was possible 
today.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Creeps Toward the Bahamas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Hurricane Dennis strengthened as it crept  
up on the Bahamas Thursday, sending residents scurrying to grocery 
stores to stock up on supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday morning, Dennis was expected to come within 40 miles  
of the Bahamas' Eleuthera Island, a 110-mile-long strip of pink 
sand that 8,000 people call home. 
</P>
<P>
	``People still remember Hurricane Andrew here from 1992, so  
we're keeping an eye out for it,'' Eleuthera hotel owner Harcourt 
Cambridge said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bahamian capital, Nassau, boats were hauled out of the  
harbor, and the governor general's official residence was boarded 
up before a light rain started falling in the night. One resident, 
25-year-old Brian Deal, said he had bought lumber to cover his 
windows but was waiting to see how the storm would progress. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters expected a weather system moving east across the  
United States to force Dennis away from Florida. The National 
Hurricane Center in Miami said Dennis might never hit land. But it 
also could turn and strike near South Carolina as early as Sunday, 
when it could be packing winds up to 109 mph, said forecaster 
Robert Molleda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not letting anyone off the hook anywhere along the  
coast,'' said another meteorologist at the center, Todd Kimberlain. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis became a hurricane late Wednesday as its winds reached 75  
mph. At 11 p.m. EDT Thursday, Dennis was centered about 175 miles 
east of Nassau, the Bahamas capital. Its top winds had strengthened 
to 80 mph with hurricane-force winds extending 45 miles from its 
center. The strongest winds were in the northeast quadrant facing 
open seas. The hurricane had stalled for several hours off San 
Salvador island but resumed its west-northwest track at near 6 mph 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Forecasters said the storm could strengthen.  
</P>
<P>
	As Dennis advanced, Bahamian authorities put the central Bahamas  
and some northwest Bahamian islands on hurricane warning and the 
rest of the northwest on hurricane watch. Some officials said they 
feared residents were being complacent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Club Eleuthera Resort said it had decided against flying 180  
Italian guests to a Cuban resort and told them to prepare for the 
storm. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the guests are a little nervous because they've heard  
all the stories about hurricanes,'' said manager Shawna McCarthney. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other nearby storms posed little threat Thursday,  
forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cindy, upgraded to a hurricane again late Wednesday, was far out  
in the Atlantic. And Emily -- which sprang up at near-hurricane 
strength Tuesday -- began to lose strength and was downgraded to a 
tropical depression. 
</P>
<P>
	In the southeast Caribbean, though, two wooden houses in  
Barbados were torn down Thursday morning by winds that the Barbados 
Meteorological Office said could have been associated with Tropical 
Storm Emily, even though it was more than 200 miles away and likely 
to dissipate offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything in my house is damaged, my house flat on the  
ground,'' Etheline Forde, a farm laborer, said at the ruins of her 
Atlantic Oceanside home on eastern Peak Bay.

	Billions Slashed in GM Case  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge today slashed more than $3 billion  
from a $4.9 billion judgment against General Motors in a lawsuit 
over the explosion of a Chevrolet Malibu gas tank in a crash. 
Superior Court Judge Ernest Williams reduced the original $4.8 
billion punitive damages portion of the jury award to $1.09 
billion. He let stand $107 million in compensatory damages awarded 
to victims of the crash. GM said the new $1.09 billion punitive sum 
will be appealed.

	Reno Promises To Find Truth on Waco

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno today said she was  
``very troubled'' by the FBI's admission that its agents may have 
fired potentially flammable tear gas canisters on the final day of 
the standoff with the Branch Davidian cult near Waco, Texas. Reno 
said she had been consistently told that no incendiary devices were 
used at the compound. She ordered a new investigation into the 
siege and promised to ``get to the bottom'' of the use of 
pyrotechnic tear gas canisters during the episode and whether their 
use was covered up.

	Conviction in 'Jenny Jones' Trial

	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A man who killed a gay acquaintance who  
had revealed a crush on him during a ``Jenny Jones Show'' taping 
was convicted of murder today for the second time. The jury 
rejected 29-year-old Jonathan Schmitz's crime-of-passion defense. 
Three days after the taping in 1995, Schmitz shot Scott Amedure at 
his home and then called police and confessed. He could get life in 
prison at his sentencing Sept. 14. As the verdict was announced, 
Schmitz hung his head, stared down and clasped his hands under his 
chin.

through East Timor's capital today, leaving three people dead and 
raising fears that next week's sovereignty vote will be crippled by 
violence. The violence erupted four days before an Aug. 30 
referendum offering East Timor's 800,000 people a choice between 
independence and remaining part of Indonesia as an autonomous 
province. The leader of a militia group warned of ``massive 
fighting'' if his side lost, he told 15,000 people at an

	Chain Axes Endangered Wood Sales  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Home Depot, the nation's largest home-improvement  
retailer, today said it will stop selling wood from environmentally 
endangered areas. The chain said the phase-out of sales of 
so-called ``old-growth'' wood will take effect in 2002. Home Depot 
said the action also would cover the whole range of wood products,

in the Pacific Northwest and rain forests in South America and 
Southeast Asia. One environmental group called the move a ``great 
victory for the forests.''

<HEADLINE> Policeman Charged in Knight Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A state police sergeant faces internal  
charges that he improperly interviewed a witness and then disclosed 
that information to Bob Knight during a police investigation of a 
restaurant fight involving the Indiana coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Sgt. J.D. Maxwell, who is a friend of Knight and has refereed  
games at the coach's basketball camp for four years, will answer 
the charges at a disciplinary hearing Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Maxwell spoke at a news conference with Knight, who had  
been accused by another man of making racist remarks during dinner 
and then choking him during a confrontation in the restaurant 
parking lot. The county prosecutor declined to file charges, saying 
it appeared Knight had been provoked. 
</P>
<P>
	But state police this week notified Maxwell, an evidence  
technician at the Bloomington post, that he faces charges of 
insubordination, conduct unbecoming an officer and disclosing 
confidential information. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm surprised that the charges were levied against me, to be  
truthful,'' Maxwell said Thursday by telephone his post in 
Bloomington. ``As far as making any pertinent statements, I'm going 
to withhold my comments until after the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what's going to happen. This thing's been dragged  
out for a long time,'' the 18-year state police employee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The three charges, signed by state police Supt. Melvin Carraway,  
claim Maxwell interviewed a witness, disobeying an order by post 
commander Lt. Dave Schipp to limit his involvement in the case to 
his work as a technician; that during the investigation he had 
repeated contact with Knight, someone he knew was the subject of a 
criminal investigation; and that he told Knight what the witness 
had said. 
</P>
<P>
	Maxwell, who has been disciplined in the past, said he did not  
consider his actions in the Knight case to be improper. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just one of those things. I have to go ahead and go  
through the motions of the hearing and explain to the 
superintendent my side of the story,'' he said. ``Then he can make 
a determination on what should be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always say that those who don't do nothing usually don't  
get in trouble. I have had some run-ins before ... basically, just 
things within my job, nothing really bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, First Sgt. Dave Bursten of the state police public  
information office said Maxwell was suspended for five days in 1986 
for interfering with a criminal investigation; suspended two days 
in 1988 for destroying a traffic ticket; suspended 15 days in 1991 
for unauthorized use of deadly force; and suspended three other 
days in 1991 for insubordination. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight was out of town and could not be reached for comment.  
Indiana athletic director Clarence Doninger refused comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Chris Foster, a Bloomington guitar-maker, had accused Knight of  
making a racist remark while the two dined separately at the 
Ellettsville restaurant June 7. He said the coach started screaming 
at him and grabbed him by the neck when the two went outside 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Carl Salzmann, however, said the evidence did not  
support Foster's story and that it appeared Knight had been 
provoked into the confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	At the news conference an hour after Salzmann announced his  
decision, Knight criticized the prosecutor for letting the case 
drag on for nine days. Maxwell also spoke at the news conference, 
and said witnesses confirmed no profanity or racial slurs came from 
Knight's table at the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``As sure as there's a God in heaven, I know Bob Knight is not a  
racist,'' Maxwell said at that time. 
</P>
<P>
	Salzmann said Thursday he had just heard about the charges  
against Maxwell and refused comment.

<HEADLINE> Money Funds Fall in Latest Week / Money Market Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market  
mutual funds fell by $1.09 billion in the latest week to $888.87 
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell  
by $617.0 million to $737.96 billion for the week ended Wednesday, 
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund 
assets fell by $468.6 million to $150.91 billion.

taxable money market fund assets fell by $4.62 billion to $554.81 
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $419.0 million to 
$48.32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Total money market assets stood at $1.492 trillion for the week.  
</P>
<P>
	Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.498 trillion to  
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds 
reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds was  
4.53 percent in the week ended Tuesday, unchanged from the previous 
week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal published in 
Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day average yield 
rose to 4.51 percent from 4.49 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-day compounded yield rose to 4.64 percent from 4.63  
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to 
4.61 percent from 4.59 percent, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was  
56 days, unchanged from a week earlier, IBC Financial Data said. 
</P>
<P>
	The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading  
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks 
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage 
yield available on money market accounts rose to 2.07 percent as of 
Wednesday from 2.05 percent a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.  
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing 
checking accounts remained unchanged from a week earlier at 0.84 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.30 percent  
on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 4.29 percent the 
previous week. Yields were 4.66 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 4.65 
percent; 4.95 percent on 2 1/2-year CDs, up from 4.92 percent; and 
5.16 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 5.14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Settlement in Norplant Suit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The makers of Norplant have agreed to offer cash  
settlements to thousands of women who say the side effects of the 
contraceptive device were downplayed, The Dallas Morning News 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products Corp. could end up paying more than $50  
million to at least 36,000 women to end five years of litigation, 
the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyers say the women suffered from nausea,  
irregular menstrual bleeding, headaches and depression after using 
Norplant, which consists of six silicone rods injected into the arm 
to prevent pregnancy for about five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison, N.J.-based American Home Products and its subsidiary,  
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, consistently have denied wrongdoing and 
said the side effects were described in the product's labeling. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement offers $1,500 to each woman who filed suit before  
March 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Blair Hahn, a lawyer at a South Carolina firm that represents  
several thousand women in the legal battle, said he is recommending 
that most of its clients take the settlement offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the best deal most of them could get,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wyeth-Ayerst officials said the settlement ``was purely a  
business decision.'' The company has won three jury verdicts, 20 
pretrial judgments and the dismissal of 14,000 claims by lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our legal success has come at a steep price because lawsuits  
are time-consuming, expensive and have a chilling effect on 
research,'' said Joseph Mahady, president of Wyeth-Ayerst, North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now that the courts have found these cases to be without  
merit, we can turn our attention back to providing contraceptive 
options for American women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products still must contend with thousands of  
lawsuits by former users of the diet-drug combination fen-phen, 
which plaintiffs allege caused heart valve damage and a potentially 
fatal lung disorder.

<HEADLINE> Contraceptive Lawsuit Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The makers of Norplant have agreed to offer  
cash settlements to more than 36,000 women who charged that severe 
side effects from the contraceptive device were downplayed. 
</P>
<P>
	American Home Products Corp. said today its Wyeth-Ayerst  
Laboratories subsidiary will settle the claims of those women who 
said they suffered from nausea, irregular menstrual bleeding,

	``Settling these cases was purely a business decision,'' said  
Joseph M. Mahady, president of Wyeth-Ayerst, North America, in a 
statement dated Wednesday and released to The Associated Press 
today. 
</P>

	The statement did not specify how much would be paid to settle  
the claims by those who used the device, which consisted of six 
silicone rods injected into the arm to prevent pregnancy for about 
five years.

<HEADLINE>  Another Clemente in Pittsburgh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The number isn't quite the same -- it's 12, or  
21 turned backward -- but the name is: Clemente. In Pittsburgh, 
there is no more famous name in sports -- or a name more difficult 
to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
	Even for a visiting player. Even for Roberto Clemente's own  
nephew. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 27 years, a player named Clemente played  
major league baseball in Pittsburgh, catching fly balls in the very 
outfield where Roberto played, batting in the very batter's box 
where Roberto Clemente stood before getting his 3,000th hit nearly 
27 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	To rookie center fielder Edgard Clemente of the Colorado  
Rockies, playing this week in the city where his uncle is revered, 
in the stadium where his uncle played his final three seasons, was 
an ethereal, unforgettable experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw his statue outside the stadium, I walked across the  
bridge that is named after him,'' Clemente said. ``The park outside 
the stadium is named for him, too. He is still a hero in 
Pittsburgh. How many players have statues? To have a statue, you 
must be a big player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberto Clemente remains very big in Pittsburgh, where there  
were more ``Clemente 21'' jerseys in the stands for Thursday's 
Rockies-Pirates game than for any current Pirates player. 
</P>
<P>
	The statue. The bridge. The legacy. It's almost enough to make a  
promising young player who has yet to prove himself in the majors 
wish he had another name. Which Edgard Clemente might have next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	He dropped his father's last name, Velazquez, to go by his  
mother's maiden name in tribute to his uncle, who died three years 
before he was born. But he may go back to Velazquez next year, now 
that he has returned the name Clemente to major league baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe next year, maybe in two years, I will change back,''  
Clemente said. ``But I asked my aunt and my cousins if I could keep 
the name, and they said they didn't mind. As long as I want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemente asked permission from Vera Clemente, the late Roberto's  
wife, before changing his name last year in honor of the 25th 
anniversary of his uncle's Hall of Fame induction. Edgard's mother, 
Carmen, who was Roberto's sister, and Roberto Clemente's sons also 
embraced the change. Luis Clemente called Edgard in Pittsburgh this 
week to wish him well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little nervous, I was afraid that if I did not do well  
here that the fans might say something,'' Clemente said. ``But 
they've been good. When they see my name, they are always very 
friendly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Rockies teammate, pitcher Roberto Ramirez, didn't realize that  
Edgard Clemente was related to Roberto, thinking he chose the name 
at random because Roberto Clemente is so revered in Latin American 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought I took it like I might have taken the name McGwire  
or Sosa because they are popular now,'' Clemente said. ``Like I 
could have called myself Edgard Sosa.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Edgard, 23, is not the only Clemente in baseball; Roberto Jr. is  
a Spanish language broadcaster for the New York Yankees, the team 
his father helped defeat in the 1960 World Series. But Edgard is 
the first in the Clemente family to play in the majors since his 
uncle, who died in an airplane crash on Dec. 31, 1972, while 
transporting relief supplies to earthquake-stricken Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies are giving Edgard a 50-game trial in center field --  
not right field, where Roberto played -- and manager Jim Leyland 
likes what he sees so far: a live arm and a lively bat. Clemente 
was 2-for-4 in Colorado's 8-4 loss Thursday and has five homers 
since returning from the minors on Aug. 9 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll probably end up as a corner outfielder, not a center  
fielder, and he's a free swinger sometimes,'' Leyland said. ``But 
he can hit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Truly, he must be a Clemente.
