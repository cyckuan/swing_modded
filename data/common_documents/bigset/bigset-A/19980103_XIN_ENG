<HEADLINE> Report: Judiciary Chairman Defends Senate on Judgeship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Faced with criticism by the
president and the chief justice of the U.S. Supreme Court about
the Senate's slow pace in confirming federal judges, the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee defended the Senate's performance
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"There are many parties who have a role in these problems,"
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican, was quoted as saying in The New
York Times Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem happens to be activist judges who continue
to find laws that aren't there and expand the law beyond the
intent of Congress,"
</P>
<P>
Hatch disagreed with complaints about overworked judges,
saying, "There is little or no room to complain."
</P>
<P>
In the past year Democrats and Republicans spent much time
arguing over judicial nominations.
</P>
<P>
In his year-end report on the federal judiciary earlier this
week, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist blamed the Senate for
"serious delays in the appointment process."
</P>
<P>
Rehnquist said 82 of 846 federal judgeships remain vacant, and
26 of those vacancies have existed for 18 months or longer.
</P>
<P>
He said such a high level of vacancies cannot continue "without
eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been
associated with the federal judiciary."
</P>
<P>
The White House officials, citing the report, said the judicial
system is more important than "playing partisan politics."
</P>
<P>
But Hatch argued that the Republican-controlled Senate
confirmed 36 of the 47 judicial nominees it considered last year.
He blamed President Bill Clinton for being slow in naming
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Rehnquist's report, Hatch said Congress could
work to address the concerns and address the selection progress.

ATHENS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Emmanuel Fthenakis, chairman of
the board of Greece's national carrier Olympic Airways (OA),
submitted on Friday his resignation for not being supported by the
New Democracy (ND) members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Fthenakis, who was first appointed to the board in 1993 under

was approved recently for a second term by the relevant
parliamentary committee.
</P>
<P>
In his letter of resignation to Greek Transport and
Communications Minister Tassos Mantelis, Fthenakis said that he
decided to resign because the ND MPs on the relevant parliamentary
committee that approved his nomination had not voted for him, the
semi-official Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.

<P>
The new chairman of the board would be selected within this

<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A court in London cleared the way
early today for an Irish Republican Army (IRA) suspect to be
extradited to Germany on bombing charges.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Nicholas Evans ruled that 26-year-old Roisin
McAliskey await the decision of British Home Secretary Jack Straw
on whether she should be extradited to Germany.
</P>
<P>
"In the particular circumstances of this case, bearing in mind
McAliskey's state of health, I now commit her in her absence to
await the decision of the Secretary of State (Jack Straw) about
her extradition to Germany," Evans said.
</P>
<P>
McAliskey, who was arrested in November 1996, is being held in
a London psychiatric hospital with her baby daughter and
McAliskey's mother said her daughter has been too ill to attend
court hearings.
</P>
<P>
The German government has been demanding McAliskey's
extradition on suspicion of her involvement in a June 1996 IRA
bomb attack on a British Army Base at Osnabrueck, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Irish government, which made diplomatic
representations to Germany about the case, has called for her
release on humanitarian grounds.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Establishes Education Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A 12-member commmission tasked
with reviewing Zimbabwe's education and training system was sworn
in today by President Robert Mugabe at State House in Harare.
</P>
<P>
The commission, chaired by University of Zimbabwe professor
Caiphas Nziramasanga is the first to be appointed since the
country's independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
A review of Zimbabwe's education was last held in 1962 and
with the on-going technological advances coupled with changing
industry requirements, there is now need to check the system for
relevance.
</P>
<P>
Education, Sport and Culture Minister Gabriel Machinga said
education is dynamic, and it is important that it be reviewed
periodically to ensure it is in line with set goals.
</P>
<P>
''Consideration of the basic principles and philosophy of
Zimbabwe's educational and training needs and aspirations on the
eve of the 21st century, and having regard to the challenges of a
competitive global environment in the information age,'' the
terms of reference for the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The commission, comprising educationists, representatives of
industry and teachers' associations, is mandated with
establishing an appropriate framework for the organization and
management of the education and training systems.
</P>
<P>
The commission has two external members, Roy Pryke, an
international and comparative education consultant based in
Britain and Jacques Hallak of the Paris-based International
Institute of Educational planning.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Political parties and
organizations in Romania have reacted very strongly to a
restoration attempt by former King Mihai I.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Mihai's news office declared that he has chosen his
oldest daughter Margareta to "ascend the throne".
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic Party of Romania, the largest opposition,
condemned Mihai's move as against the will of more than 90 percent
of the Romanians who support a republican political system, while
the Agrarian Democratic Party urged the highest authorities to
decide quickly on Mihai's legal status.
</P>
<P>
To clear the situation, the ruling National Peasant's Party
announced that it would take its position on the matter as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Mihai, 76, has been in exile overseas since he gave up his
throne in 1947, but indicates that he plans to return to live in
Romania recently.

<HEADLINE> Water Borne Diseases Hit Flooded Areas in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Water borne diseases have
broken out in southern Somalia as the heavy rains are still
afflicting the areas neighboring the border lines between
Somalia, Kenya and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the southern town of Dhobley today said more than
40 people have died and dozens of others are in critical
condition from two major diseases that broke out in the town
early in the week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to a reliable source in Dhobley, 19 of
these people have died of a new unknown sickness.
</P>
<P>
The source said seven more people suffering from very high
fever and vomiting blood are still in the town which lacks all
medical services.
</P>
<P>
The town of Dhobley, about 250 km southwest of the port town
of Kismaio, remains isolated from the main towns following the
heavy rains and floods that ruined almost all of the roads since
October last year.
</P>
<P>
Muse Khalif Omar, a community leader also in Dhobley Town,
said that cholera has killed 21 people in the town in the past
five days.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the border town of Dhobley, there are other reports
of deaths for the mysterious disease in the town of Liboye also
close to the border with Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, more than 34 people have died so far
from blood vomiting and high fever in the past two weeks in the
region. Doctors in the town of Kismaio, 500 km south of
Mogadishu, confirmed nine cases of this new disease in the town
hospital.
</P>
<P>
The same mysterious disease still claimed lives in Jalalaqsi
town of Hiran region, 150 km north of the capital. The District
Commissioner of the town, Abdulkadir Arif Gure, said 39 people
have died of this unidentified sickness since December 25.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities in Somalia believe that this mysterious
disease has crossed the border from Kenya into Somalia. The first
area where the sickness was seen is the village of Torotorow, 115
km south of Mogadishu, where more than 45 people have died of the
disease.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Condemns Latest Massacre in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
secretary general of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
today strongly condemned the massacre of over 100 innocent people
in the outskirts of Bujumbura in Burundi on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the OAU said, Salim has learnt with
shock and deep regret of the tragic massacres of over 100
civilians including women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The OAU chief strongly condemned these brutal acts as totally
unacceptable. "No cause can justify these wanton killings," Salim
said.
</P>
<P>
The latest tragedy in Burundi is a grim reminder on the need
to intensify efforts at finding a just and lasting solution to
the conflict in that country, the release noted.
</P>
<P>
The new year should provide the opportunity to reinvigorate
the peace process in that country so that dialogue and
negotiations can be pursued more vigorously and an end be put to
the senseless and costly violence, the release added.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Police Chief Warns of More Bloodshed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Chief Constable
Ronnie Flanagan warned early today that Northern Ireland could
face more bloodshed after a series of killings over the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after holding crisis talks with British
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam, Flanagan said that the Royal
Ulster Constabulary is putting more police patrols in a bid to
prevent further attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We've had dreadful murders in recent days and sadly I cannot
say that that's the last murder that we're going to witness,"
Flanagan said.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mowlam has urged all sides to "keep
things in perspective" ahead of multi-party peace talks which are
due to reopen in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
However, Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble said that
the recent violence has cast deep doubts over the validity of the
Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
"There is a danger that the actions of the Loyalist Volunteer
Force will lead to a crumbling of the ceasefire," he said.
</P>
<P>
The latest escalation of Ulster violence began on Saturday with
the assassination of pro-British loyalist prisoner Billy Wright in
Belfast's high-security Maze prison.
</P>
<P>
In response, a pro-British group, the Loyalist Volunteer Force
(LVF), retaliated by killing two men including a hotel doorman, a
former Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerilla.

<HEADLINE> French Communist Party Calls for Referendum on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The French Communist Party (PCF)
National Secretary Robert Hue today called for a referendum on the
Amsterdam treaty, which predicts the construction of an integrated
Europe in political, social and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Hue also asked President Jacques Chirac to meet him on the
issue as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The PCF made the proposal after the French Constitutional
Council announced on Wednesday that the adoption of the Amsterdam
treaty needs a constitutional amendment beforehand.
</P>
<P>
"In France, it is the people, and they only, who carry out the
national sovereignty... It is natural that it comes back to the
people to declare through a universal suffrage," said Hue in a
published declaration.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac will either call for a referendum or a joint
congress of the two chambers of the parliament to vote for the
constitutional amendment in order to adopt the Amsterdam treaty.
</P>
<P>
It is more likely that Chirac, who himself is an advocate of
European integration, will choose a joint congress of parliament
deputies because both the National Assembly and the Senate have a
majority of deputies who support the Amsterdam treaty.
</P>
<P>
Former President Francois Mitterrand chose to hold a referendum
on September 20, 1992, to decide whether France should amend its
constitution to sign the Maastricht treaty, an earlier version of
Amsterdam treaty.
</P>
<P>
The PCF has already decided to organize a demonstration on
January 18 in Paris to urge a referendum on the European single
currency euro.
</P>
<P>
"Because it concerns the future of the Frenchmen and
Frenchwomen, we affirm that they should be really informed about
which is being prepared today far from them and without them,"
said Hue.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled that Chirac promised to organize a referendum
on European integration in November 1994, before the May 1995
presidential election.

Stenger blamed police for lack of efficiency in maintaining
public order, while Magner said that to prevent the riot, one

PARIS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- France today firmly condemned the
attack launched by Hutu rebels upon the Bujumbura airport in
Burundi on Thursday, in which more than 200 people, most of them
civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
"It appears more urgent than ever that a constructive dialogue
be installed between all the Burundian parties with a view for the
return of peace and national reconciliation of Burundi," said a
French Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that France supports the efforts by
President Pierre Buyoya of Burundi in favor of peace and
reconciliation, and appeals to Burundi's neighbors to create a
climate of peace and stability in the region.
</P>

Some 200,000 people, mostly civilians, have been killed in an
ethnic war in Burundi between the Hutu majority and
Tutsi-dominated military government, since the assassination of
President Melchior Ndadaye in October 1993.

<HEADLINE> Mowlam Says British Army to Patrol Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- British Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam announced here today that British army foot
patrols will return to Belfast in an effort to maintain social
order and prevent further violence.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam was quoted by the BBC radio as saying that the situation
in Northern Ireland was serious but not out of control.
</P>
<P>
She noted that increased security measures would include the
"return of foot patrols with the army in Belfast." Army foot
patrols were lifted only some weeks ago as an significant step of
building confidence.
</P>
<P>
Early today, Northern Ireland Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan
warned that Northern Ireland could face more bloodshed after a
series of killings over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
The latest escalation of Ulster violence began on Saturday with
the assassination of pro-British loyalist prisoner Billy Wright in
Belfast's high-security Maze prison.
</P>
<P>
In response, a pro-British group, the Loyalist Volunteer Force
(LVF), retaliated by killing two men including a hotel doorman, a
former Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerilla.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Does not Rule Out Compulsion Settlement in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Eduard
Shevardnadze stated on Friday that his country would not refuse to
use compulsion elements to settle the Abkhazian conflict, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported from Tbilisi, capital of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a New Year reception for Georgia Shevardnadze said
that "I remain adherent to peaceful settlement of the Abkhazian
conflict and solution of all problems through negotiations and a
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
"However, he noted, if there are no real and serious steps to
return refugees home and restore the Georgian territorial
integrity in the near future, the country's leadership plans to
raise the question of other variants to settle the conflict, for
instance a peace-making operation of the so called 'Bosnian format'
in Abkhazia."
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said the number of politicians, who call for using
compulsion elements to settle the Abkhazian and other conflicts,
is mounting in Georgia and some other countries.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that using of the so-called 'Bosnian
format' and compulsion elements to settle conflicts does not run
counter to the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
He noted the use of compulsion elements in Bosnia saved the
region and whole Europe from big troubles.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze hopes that the Abkhazian conflict will be settled
by 2000 and refugees will return home.

Investment
</P>
<P>
MAPUTO, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Privatization of state-owned
enterprises will bring about 210 million U.S. dollars in
investment for Mozambique in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Momad Juma, Head of the Technical Unit of Enterprise
Restructure of Mozambique (UTRE), said this in Maputo today,
quoted by the News Agency of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's privatization started in 1987. By early last
December, 846 out of the 1,254 registered state-owned enterprises
had been privatized.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, 17 large state-owned enterprises and all the medium
and small-sized enterprises are expected to be privatized, Juma
said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that with the help of the Commonwealth, the UTRE
is carrying out a study on the impact of privatization on
Mozambique's Gross Demostic Production, employment, tax and other
aspects of the social life.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican nationals have benefitted more
from the privatization than foreigners, as 90 percent of the
enterprises were sold to natives compared with 10 percent to
foreigners, Momad Juma said.

<HEADLINE> Christmas Holiday Road Deaths Cost S. Africa $41 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The death toll on South
African roads has risen to 729 since December 1, 1997, costing
the country about 200 million Rand (40.6 million U.S. Dollars),
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figures represented a sharp drop from the fatalities and
hence the cost in the same period last year, South Africa's
national road safety "Arrive Alive" campaign said. In December,
1996, 1,047 people died in traffic accidents, resulting in a cost
of 286 million Rand (59.6 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The majority of road users did a fantastic job so far this
year. Drivers displayed a much better attitude," the campaign's
spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Traffic was expected to start increasing countrywide from this
weekend, when many holiday-makers return to work from resorts.
The traffic flow will probably peak next weekend, on January 10
and 11.
</P>
<P>
The campaign attributed the accidents mainly to speeding and
alcohol abuse. It called on drivers to ensure they were rested
and their vehicles were roadworthy.

ADDIS ABABA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health
Ministry today called on the whole society to save cooperatively
the numerous children and youth who are endangered as a result of
being addicted to drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted Beyene Seile-Tsion, Head of

the Health Ministry as saying that protecting children and youth
who are abusing drugs is not the sole responsibility of the

<P>
Beyene said that drugs are harmful not only for the
individual, his family and the society as large but also for the
economic, political and social life of the whole population.
</P>
<P>
According to local press reports, when compared to the
developed world and other countries, the situation of drug abuse
and trafficking in Ethiopia is not so serious.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of drug abuse is increasing at an alarming
rate among the street children of the country, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Makes Efforts to Defuse Budget Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 2 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to defuse deepening
crisis over the state budget of 1998, Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said today that he planed to live up to his
promises to Foreign Minister David Levy on the budget.
</P>
<P>
At a reception in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu said that efforts had
been made to find funds to meet Levy's demands, which included
further aid by the government to development towns and
underprivileged neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
According to local media, Netanyahu also expressed confidence
today that he will be able to get the approval of the budget in
the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The Knesset is expected to reconvene on Monday to vote on the
second and third readings of both the budget and its accompanying
economic arrangements bill.
</P>
<P>
Levy threatened on Thursday to resign if his demands are not
met. A close confidant of his said today that he had already
written a letter of resignation and planed to submit it to the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
A report of Israel Radio said that Netanyahu would do all he
can in order not to lose Levy, whose five-member Gesher party is
crucial for the passage of the budget in the Knesset as well as
the coalition government.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office in a statement said the next two
days will be used to "arrive at a budget agreed upon by the prime
minister and the foreign minister."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Knesset Speaker Dan Tichon said the crisis over the
budget can be resolved very easily. He claimed that there are
budget reserves to meet Levy's demands since many ministries did
not spend their entire budget allocation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
But Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman threatened to resign if
Netanyahu gives in to Levy's demands, which he said could break
the current budget framework.
</P>
<P>
Neeman had promised that no tax be levied to meet coalition
parties' demands and the 1998 budget deficit be reduce to less
than 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 2 (Xinhua) -- An awaiting-trial prisoner
freed 24 of his colleagues Thursday night from a police cell in
South Africa's Mpumalanga Province, South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner, held at a cell near Marble Hall, some 150
kilometers northeast of Pretoria, made off with a policeman's
pistol and the cell keys at a shebeen.
</P>
<P>
None of the escapees have been re-arrested by this evening.
</P>
<P>
Police have launched a massive manhunt and an internal inquiry
into the escape of the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman Doep du Plooy said, a police sergeant at the
Kwa-Mhlanga police station took two prisoners from the cells at
about 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) to a nearby shebeen where they ate and
drank.
</P>
<P>
The exact circumstances in which the prisoner got hold of the
policeman's gun and the cell keys were not known.
</P>
<P>
The sergeant was arrested at his home this morning and an
urgent manhunt and internal investigation has been launched, said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Du Plooy said the policeman could face charges of aiding and
abetting the escape of a prisoner.
</P>
<P>
Prison escapes in South Africa are frequent, a large number of
which involved cooperation from wardens.
</P>
<P>
More than 900 prisoners escaped from police or court cells
last year.

<HEADLINE> ILO Sees Poverty as Top Cause for Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The International Labor
Organization (ILO) has identified poverty as the greatest single
cause that creates child labor.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty forces many children to work full time for their own
and their families's survival," the United Nations agency ILO
says in a document reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The document said, poverty, which is the acute need of many
households to keep family members working to ensure income
security, has made it nearly impossible for people to invest in
their children's education.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions, noted the ILO, have a key role to play in
combating the menace by carrying out their basic objectives of
negotiating increased wages, jobs and improved working conditions
as well as stop discriminations of any sort as far as employment
is concerned.
</P>
<P>
If these are done, it said, the effective means will be
achieved to realize the potentials in the struggle against child
labor.
</P>
<P>
The agency, however, adds that the capacity of the unions to
perceive and respond to the problem of child labor depends on
their level of organization, a major problem facing developing
countries, where much of child labor is found.
</P>
<P>
Countries including Nigeria, Kenya, Niger, Algeria, Brazil,
Italy and Cuba have child labor, according to the ILO.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Political Leaders Advised to Accept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Electoral Commission
today requested political leaders in the country to accept the
final results of the December 29-30 general elections to be
announced soon.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here, the commission asked Kenyan
leaders "not to adopt the attitude that they would support the
results only if they are going to win but reject the results if
they are likely to lose."
</P>
<P>
The commission today announced official results of the
presidential election in 126 out of 210 constituencies, saying
that incumbent President Daniel arap Moi has garnered 1,538,116
votes to be followed by Mwai Kibaki with 1,276,096 votes and
Raila Odinga with 456,946 votes.
</P>
<P>
Noting that voting in presidential and parliamentary elections
had been conducted in all parts of the country, the statement
said, "no single constituency has reported failing to proceed
with the elections."
</P>
<P>
The ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) today accused
opposition leaders of hypocrisy for threatening to reject the
results of the elections to be announced within a few days.
</P>
<P>
KANU Vice-Chairman George Saitoti said at a news conference
today that "the will of the people has been expressed through the
ballot, and all those concerned should accept the verdict of the
people."
</P>
<P>
"However, it is extremely regrettable that some opposition
party leaders have displayed remarkable hypocrisy by threatening
chaos even before the results are announced," he added.
</P>
<P>
Two leading opposition presidential candidates said today that
they rejected preliminary results which showed President Moi
would win the elections.
</P>
<P>
Raila Odinga of National Development Party and Mwai Kibaki of
Democratic Party said at a joint press conference here this
afternoon that they categorically rejected the provisional
results of the presidential elections and called for a new
election within 21 days.
</P>
<P>
Based on unofficial latest results from 188 out of 210
constituencies, Moi headed the poll with 2.226 million votes, to
be followed by Kibaki with 1.761 million votes and Odinga with
622,660 votes.

WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- New Houston Mayor Lee P.
Brown said Friday he is dedicating his administration to the
children of the nation's fourth largest city.
</P>
<P>
In his inaugural address today, the former national drug czar

<P>
Brown, who also served as police chief of Houston, New York and
Atlanta, is the first black mayor in Houston's history.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Issue Should Be Solved Peaceful: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot government spokesman
said here today that the Cyprus issue should be resolved
peacefully, adding, however, Cyprus is ready to confront Turkish
aggression in the framework of a defense pact with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides was
commenting on the possibility of an incident in the area as ties
between Turkey and Greece were strained after the European Union
(EU) decided last month to start accession negotiations in March
1998.
</P>
<P>
Six countries, including Cyprus, fall into the first group of
candidates for EU enlargement, but Turkey falls out.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the EU decision, the Turkey-backed Turkish Cypriot
regime in northern Cyprus decided to suspend bicommunal contacts
since last Saturday in reprisal.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said "each country has its own defense
authorities who say they are ready to face any possibility if
another country, in our case Turkey, opts for an unacceptable
offensive policy."
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore not an issue that depends on us but on
Turkey, if it choses to follow an aggressive policy," the
spokesman stressed.
</P>
<P>
"It is up to Turkey to take note of international reaction and
chose a policy that would secure its European course," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey sent its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> 44 Containers of Medicine Arrive in Iraq from UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A Cypriot container ship with 44
containers of medicines aboard arrived Thursday at Umm Al-Kasr
port, Basra in southern Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The medicines are the second batch of assistance from the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) to Iraq, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The consignment is a gift from Sheikh Muhammad Bin-Rashid
al-Maktoum, crown prince of Dubai and UAE minister of defense, to
the Iraqi people and children as a sign of solidarity between the
Iraqi and the UAE peoples in the face of the seven-year-old
U.N. embargoes on Iraq, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The first shipment of the UAE assistance arrived at the harbor
on December 6 with 31 containers of medicine on board.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, a team of UAE youths organized several direct
voyages to the harbor aboard "Al-Rahmah" (Grace) cruiser to
deliver a consignment of powdered milk and clothes to the Iraqi
children.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is still suffering from a severe shortage of foodstuffs
and medicines due to the U.N. sanctions imposed after its invasion
of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq was banned from exporting oil, its economic mainstay,
under the U.N. sanctions, which can not be lifted unless it is
certified to have destroyed all weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
today denied reports that it will hold joint military exercises
with Turkish Navy next week, UAE's Wam news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Wam quoted an official from the UAE's Defense Ministry as
saying that the reports by some foreign media on joint naval
exercises between the UAE Navy and a Turkish fleet, possibly to be
held next week in the Omani Sea, were "not true."
</P>
<P>
"The UAE Navy's program did not include any exercise or
war game with Turkish armed forces," the official said in a
statement to Wam.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that the reports came weeks after
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel's visit to the UAE earlier last
month.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and the UAE signed a military cooperation agreement in
1995. Demirel told reporters during his visit that the agreement
between the two countries had no difference with the military deal
Turkey clinched with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish-Israeli military agreement signed earlier last year
caused serious concerns among the Arab world. However, Turkey said
the military deal "is just a military training pact...and it is
not aimed at damaging the interests of any other state."
</P>
<P>
"Ankara has signed with 28 countries, including the UAE,
military cooperation deals and the agreement (with Israel) is
just one of them," Demirel had said.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Rights Activists Shocked by US Release of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIGALI, January 2 (Xinhua) -- "We were shocked to hear the
release of Pastor Elizaphan Ntakirutimana by a federal judge" in
the U.S., a Rwandan human rights activist told Rwanda News Agency
today.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Ntakirutimana is not a war criminal as reported in the
media," Josue kayijaho, chairman of CLADHO, the umbrella
organization regrouping local human rights NGOs, stressed here,
adding, "He is a genocidalist because it was not a war he was
involved in here, but genocide."
</P>
<P>
According to Kayijaho, Ntakirutimana was a ring-leader in the
bloodshed that claimed the lives of over 100,000 followers who
had fled to his Nugonero 7th Day Adventist church when the
massacre of Tutsis started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that this adventist clergyman was very much
trusted by people in western Rwanda's Kibuye region which was
inhabited by an estimated 250,000 Tutsis before the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
"Every body rushed to his church hoping to find protection
from marauding Hutu extremists," said a survivor who asked not to
be named.
</P>
<P>
The survivor noted that after three days of starvation in the
church where the pastor was himself residing, the displaced wrote
a letter asking him to provide them with relief food aid.
</P>
<P>
"In two hours," the pastor calmed the hungry people by saying,
"food aid will get to you."
</P>
<P>
According to various testimonies, after the said two hours,
pastor Ntakirutimana came back with his pick-up full of policemen
who started killing Tutsis at Mugonero Church.
</P>
<P>
It is further reported that on the first Sabbath that followed
the killings in his church, Ntakirutimana gathered the militiamen
and said, "Let 's pray because we have exterminated our enemies."
</P>
<P>
Among the killers was his own son, Gerard Ntakirutimana who,
during the genocide, was using a submachine-gun and kept an
important stock of ammunition for Hutu extremists provided by
Clement Kayishema, the former Governor of Kibuye. Both men are
currently detained in the U.N. Tribunal's prison in Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The pastor continued to abet and perpetrate massacres of
Tutsis who managed to seek refuge in Bisesero Hills where they
organized a staunch resistance against the former Rwandan
presidential guards, government soldiers, the police, and the
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
the massacres of up to 800,000 Tutsis were staged in
retaliation for the downing of an airplane that killed 10 Rwandan
and Burundi officials including the then Hutu President J.
Habyarimana, the chief of staff of the Rwandan armed forces and
the Burundi president.
</P>
<P>
Returning from a regional summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
the plane was fired on, above Kigali airport, and exploded on
landing. That touched off tribal killings in the small central
African country.
</P>
<P>
"Out of 60,000 people who reached Bisesero, only 1,300 were
rescued when the Rwandan Patriotic Army and the French soldiers
of the Turquoise Operation later arrived in the area," Kayijaho
said.
</P>
<P>
"No single woman, no child survived the vicious attacks on
Bisesero; only strong men resisted," he underlined, blaming the
tragedy on pastor Ntakirutimana.
</P>
<P>
Among the people who perished at Mugonero Church were over 30
adventist pastors, and Ntakirutimana's personal friends.
</P>
<P>
His release on December 17, 1997 by Judge Marcel Notzon of
Lardo, Texas in the U.S., where Ntakirutimana was detained, came
as a surprise as his transfer to the U.N. Tribunal in Arusha had
been announced.
</P>
<P>
Judge Notzon blasted charges of Ntakirutimana's involvement in
the genocide of Tutsis in Kibuye, and claimed that the federal
government had no right to extradite him to the U.N. Court.
</P>
<P>
"This judge is part of negationists found in many places and
who continue to deny that genocide took place in Rwanda,"
Kayijaho pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Well informed sources told Rwanda News Agency that there are
very powerful lobbies in the U.S. behind the release of the
wanted criminal.
</P>
<P>
It is said that these lobbies are manipulated by Eliel
Ntakirutimana, the pastor's son, who settled in the U.S. in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the U.S. administration to do all in its power
to have this genocide criminal brought to book for heinous crimes
he committed in Rwanda," kayijaho declared.

<HEADLINE> Dance Poem Presents Hong Kong's History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- "Fragrance: a Dance Poem on
Hong Kong" was staged here Saturday night, with some 400 dancers
presenting a 100-year chronicle of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The brainchild of 12 choreographers, the dance poem charted the
ups and downs of Hong Kong's fortune in eight scenes, featuring
significant aspects of Hong Kong's history such as Japanese
occupation, water rationing and the historic handover.
</P>
<P>
The dancers came from the Association of Hongkong Dance
Organizations, established in 1992 with 31 member organizations
and over 5,000 individual members.
</P>
<P>
Chan Hei-hing, chairman of the association, said, the idea of
creating a dance celebrating 1997, a very important year for Hong
Kong, was brewing in the association as early as 1995.
</P>
<P>
They had visited many sites across Hong Kong and gathered
information on local customs and traditions. "Finally, the theme
of the dance was set: that should be a testimony of the hard
working spirit and strife of the Hong Kong people over the last
century," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
It is called a dance poem because the dance is made up of a
succession of independent scenes without a central cast or a story
line.
</P>
<P>
Renowned composer Yip Shun-chi wrote the music for the
production but he passed away in September 1997 before the show
materialized on stage.
</P>
<P>
In parallel with the dance, presented on Saturday and Sunday at
the Hong Kong Cultural Center, a small exhibition entitled One
Hundred Faces in a Hong Kong Century -- a hundred-year chronicle
of Hong Kong fashion was held at the venue.

<HEADLINE> HK "Lifeline Express" Helps Inland Area Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 3 (Xinhua) -- A three-carriage hospital
train donated by the Hong Kong people has helped more than 600
blind people in China's remote areas restore eyesight since its
operation in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Nellie Fong, chairman of the Executive Committee of the
project, said this when announcing a charity show of a Golden
Harvest film -- a Jackie Chan movie "Who Am I" to raise funds for
the operation of the hospital train here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Dubbed as "Lifeline Express", the hospital train left Hong Kong
on July 1, last year on a special mission to provide free cataract
operations for the needy in those areas.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the hospital train to China's inland areas
was officiated by Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region on that day.
</P>
<P>
Fong noted that there are now millions of blind people in
China's inland areas due to cataracts, adding that the "Lifeline
Express" will make use of the railway system to shuttle amongst
China's remote areas to provide free treatment to them.
</P>
<P>
She urged more Hong Kong people to donate generously to support
this meaningful hospital train project.

<HEADLINE> Non-State Economy Becomes Active Element in Ningxia Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- With a boost from
foreign-funded and private enterprises in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the non-state economy has become
the most active element of the area's economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that private and foreign-funded enterprises
paid 310 million yuan in taxes to the government in 1996,
accounting for a quarter of the whole region's local revenue.
</P>
<P>
Lu Chongguang, a regional official, said the non-state economy
has developed rapidly since 1992. The number of private businesses
approached 100,000 at the end of last October, with an annual
increase of 30 percent in employees, registered capital, total
output value and sales revenue. Last year, the numbers and output
value of share-holding and foreign-funded enterprises were three
times that of 1992.
</P>
<P>
As China's only Muslim concentration, the Hui nationality
people, accounting for one third of the region's population, have
a long business tradition. Regional government issued regulations
and gave preferential policies to encourage self-employed laborers.
</P>
<P>
The region's government invested 100 million yuan in setting up
and expanding more than 130 trade fairs, which assisted 80 percent
of self-employed businessmen in entering markets directly.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the region has more than 120 private
enterprises involved in agriculture with an investment of 100
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region has 378 private enterprises with registered capital
of one million yuan each, 51 with more than five million yuan
each, and 21 with fixed assets of more than 10 million yuan each.
</P>
<P>
Private technology became an investment magnet. The region's
technology department approved and listed 315 private technology
enterprises in the annual plan in such fields as computers,
chemicals, agriculture and medicine. These enterprises generated
an annual revenue of 200 million yuan and 16 million yuan in
profits.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Make Holograms of Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have produced
holograms of cells by using a kind of X-ray as a light source and
putting the three-dimensional images of the holograms into
computers.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made at the University of Science and
Technology of China (USTC) which is based in Hefei, capital of
East China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found that X-rays with a wavelength between 2.3 and
4.4 nanometers can pass through the water in cells but fails to
penetrate other substances.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at USTC drew the X-ray, called a "soft" X-ray, from
a synchro-cyclotron and made holograms of cells from onions and
fly wings, in which they could clearly see the cell nucleus, walls
and intercellular spaces.
</P>
<P>
Similar research has been carried out in the United States,
France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
Xie Xingshu, the professor in charge of research, said that
"Soft X-ray holography" may help biologists realize their dream of
observing a living cell's internal structure and activities.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the experiment should be improved by keeping the cells
alive through making changes in their experimental environment and
raising the X-ray's brightness to shorten the exposure time.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at USTC are now trying to get more precise
holograms for microstructure in cells such as chromosomes.

<HEADLINE> Iran Earns 2 Billion Dollars in Non-Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran earned about 2.066 billion
U.S. dollars from non-oil exports in the eight months of the
current Iranian fiscal year (from March to November 1997), local
newspaper Etelaat said today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report from the Industries Ministry as
saying that 5.377 million tons of various non-oil goods were
exported during the period, showing a 16.3 percent increase in
weight and 2.3 percent increase in value from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
It said that export of industrial goods accounted for 39
percent of the country's total non-oil exports over the past eight
months, fetching some 814 million dollars, a 14.3 percent increase
from the same period of last Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
However, Iran's oil revenues registered 10 billion dollars in
the same period, far less than expected in the government budget,
Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh had announced.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that with the current trend continuing till
the end of this Iranian year (March 1998), the country would only
earn some 15 billion dollars from oil exports, about 15.25 percent
below the budget level.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita gross domestic
product (GDP) of residents in Shanghai is expected to top 5,000
U.S. dollars by the end of the century because of the city's rapid
economic development.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very practical target for Shanghai to increase its
per-capita GDP from the current 3,000 U.S. dollars to 5,000
U.S. dollars in three years," said Xu Kuangdi, Shanghai's mayor.
</P>
<P>
The city's average annual growth rate of GDP was 14.2 percent
during the 1992-1996 period, and is estimated to reach 13 percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his confidence in Shanghai's economy, Xu said,
"The macro-economic situation of Shanghai now is the best in
history, despite increasing pressure from market competition and
economic risks."
</P>
<P>
The city will adopt measures to speed up adjustments to its
industrial structure, reform its state-owned enterprises and
opening-up to bring Shanghai's economy to a new level, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's increasing social demands will support at least an
11 percent annual GDP growth rate, according to Han Zheng,
director of the Shanghai Municipal Planning Committee.
</P>
<P>
Partially as a result of expanding social demands, the service
industry should also continue its strong growth.
</P>
<P>
The city's pillar industries such as automotive, electronics
and telecommunications should develop rapidly, as well as local
non-state economies.
</P>
<P>
Economists estimate that Shanghai will invest 600 to 700
billion yuan in fixed assets in the next three years, and its
export volume should increase 10-to-12 percent annually through
the end of the century.

<P>
Expansion of the service sector, which now accounts for 45
percent of the city's total GDP (300 billion yuan in 1997), is one
of the major factors fueling rapid economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As part of its efforts to regain past glory as Asia's financial
center, Shanghai has established a comprehensive banking network
that involves financial institutions from home and abroad, trust
corporations and insurance firms.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has become a hub for commodities, capital, technology,
information and intellectuals. Burgeoning markets of production
materials and commodity exchanges stimulate circulation while the
stock market, inter-bank lending and the foreign exchange trading
center enjoy brisk business.
</P>
<P>
Through economic restructuring, the city has also nurtured six
technology-intensive pillar industries including automobiles and
telecommunications as well as burgeoning industries such as
electronics and biological engineering.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other parts of China, most of the financially troubled
state-owned firms in Shanghai have been rescued and have become
vigorous through the introduction of a modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
The continuous upsurge in overseas investment and an influx of
the world's leading conglomerates are also forces propelling rapid
growth. More than half of the top 100 multinational corporations
have offices in Shanghai.

<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Residents of Shanghai and
Guangzhou, two of China's largest cities, chose to start the new
year by showing care for others or enjoying themselves at scenic
resorts.
</P>
<P>
More than 10,000 volunteers in red caps took to the bustling
streets of Shanghai today to collect donations for those in
difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The activity, sponsored by the Shanghai Municipal Charity
Foundation, is aimed at helping poor families get a good start for
the new year, said Chen Tiedi, chairwoman of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen donation centers were set up throughout the city, and

"The donation move will foster a social tendency of assisting
the poor and those in need," Chen said, adding that the donated
money will be used to support 10,000 poor families before the
Chinese Lunar Year which falls on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
At the donation centers along Shanghai's downtown streets,
pedestrians were ready to drop money into donation-collecting bags.
</P>
<P>
"Most of my schoolmates have come to donate some pocket money,"
junior high school student Chen Zhao said. "We feel very happy to
show love for the poor families."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China Launches Activities to Care for Elderly, Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Activities urging people to show
respect for the aged and take good care of the young have been
launched across China as January, designated a "Special Month for
Caring for the Aged and the Young."
</P>
<P>
Free medical services and consultations for the elderly at the
China Women's Activities Center in the Chinese capital initiated
the special month today, which was launched by the All-China
Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
Doctors from Beijing's leading hospitals measured blood
pressure and blood sugar for senior citizens, while legal and
health experts consulted them on their legal rights, health care,
and family well-being. A lecture was presented on the prevention
of age-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
In another development, State Councillor Peng Peiyun, who is in
charge of the women's and children's work at the State Council,
paid a visit to Beijing No.1 Social Welfare House and Beijing
Children's Welfare House, sending greetings and presents to the
elderly people and children there.
</P>
<P>
Respect for the elderly and caring for the young are important
in traditional Chinese morals. In the Warring State period more
than 2,000 years ago, Mencius, one of the most respected scholars
in Chinese history, preached that one should respect other's
elders just as one does one's own, and love others' children in
the same way.
</P>
<P>
In modern society, with an aging population and the increase of
split families, the well-being of the elderly and the young has
become even more important.
</P>
<P>
Throughout January, women's federations across China will
launch a variety of activities, including cooperating with local
media to run special newspaper editions or programs on TV and
radio to reinforce the theme. Other activities include urging
young and middle-aged couples to take better care of their
parents, help divorcing couples prepare for and adjust to life
after the separation, and aid children from poor families to
continue their education.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Administrator on Failed Coup Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The alleged coup plot to
overthrow Nigeria's military regime was not uncovered by chance
but had been followed for at least one month before suspects were
arrested two weeks ago, a military administrator has revealed.
</P>
<P>
The government announced on December 21, 1997 the uncovery of
the coup plot and the arrest of 12 people involved, including the
country's number two person, Chief of General Staff Oladipo Diya
and two former ministers.
</P>
<P>
The coup plot was leaked by junior officers coopted into the
plan by the plotters about a month before the arrest, and the
government only tried to get more clues by delaying the action
till the day the coup was slated for execution, Oyo State
Administrator Ahmed Usman said.
</P>
<P>
The junior officers who leaked the coup plot were detained
afterwards to monitor the activities of the plotters closely and
record everything that transpired among them, he said, quoted by
the Daily Times today.
</P>
<P>
They at last submitted to the government 17 cassettes, both
audio and video, which showed the seriousness of the plot.
</P>
<P>
These electronic documentary materials have been shown to
military officers at the highest level, state administrators,
ministers and presentatives of traditional rulers across the
country.
</P>
<P>
These clips are expected to be available to the public, Usman
told members of the state council of Obas and top government
officials Friday in Ibadan, capital of the western state.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the plotters, confident that the arrangement
had not leaked, continued with the plans until the day of
execution when sporadic shooting began in some areas in the
capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers detailed to specific targets by the planners had
begun moving toward such targets when selected loyal officers
rounded them up, he said.
</P>
<P>
This shows it was not an attempted coup, it was at the
execution stage, he added.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the military touched on details of the
foiled coup attempt.
</P>
<P>
The administrator also dismissed claims that the alleged coup
plot has some ethnic background as most of the detainees are
Yorubas, people of one of the country's three main ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
It was only unfortunate that the present set largely consisted
of Yorubas from the west of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, solidarity with the federal government over the
alleged coup plot has being intensified and rallies staged in
support of the administration of general Sany Abacha in many
parts of Nigeria in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
And human rights groups and some foreign countries, including
the United States, have called for fair, open trial of the
suspects.
</P>
<P>
With preliminary investigations already completed, a 15-member
special investigation board has been set up by the government to
decide the involvement of each of the detainees.
</P>
<P>
The special panel, formed at the end of last month, has one
month to carry out its mission before verdict is expected to be
brought in at court marshal or military tribunal.

SEOUL, January 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has decided to shut
down the offices of military attaches in five countries due to
shortage of foreign currency caused by the current financial
crisis, the Defense Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The five countries are Venezuela, Greece, Austria, Myanmar and
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
The nation will also delay its plan to establish offices of
military attaches in Ukraine and South Africa until its foreign
exchange situation is improved, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been sustaining a serious financial crisis
caused by the failure of some conglomerates and bad loans of
financial institution since late 1997.
</P>
<P>
The nation's president-elect Kim Dae-jung, in his new year's
message on Thursday, appealed for national unity to overcome the
current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy, analysts said, could grind to halt
without speedy assistance from international financial
organizations and industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
However, the country, which is the 11th largest economy in the
world, has only received nine billion of the agreed rescue loans
totaling 57 billion U.S. dollars from the International Monetary
Fund.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, South Korea, with its foreign exchange reserve
reportedly standing at about nine billion U.S. dollars, has to pay
back roughly 25 billion U.S. dollars in foreign debts before
February. enditem

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's leading
industrial base, is on track to spearhead the country's economic
growth into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The vibrant metropolis' economy has been growing at an annual
rate of 13 percent for the last six years with per-capita gross
domestic product (GDP) hitting a record 3,000 U.S. dollars in
1997, according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The fast-moving economic train of Shanghai, the result of
restructuring and the market mechanism, has become a driving force
in powering the development of China's national economy which grew
8.8 percent in 1997 over the previous year, said Yao Xitang, a
research fellow with the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai long was an economic growth leader but lost steam in
the late 1970s through the 1980s because of strict state planning
under which the economic center contributed most of its revenues
and taxes to the national coffers.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, when China adopted a socialist market economy,
Shanghai regained its momentum as the country's economic
leader. During the last several years, the city quickened its pace
in reforming state-owned enterprises, optimizing economic
structures and building itself into an international financial
center.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The 85th Indian science
congress opened Saturday at the Osmania University in Hyderabad
city, 1991 km south of New Delhi, to take stock of the successes
and failures in science over the past 50 years since the country's
independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said in his inaugural speech
that top priority should be accorded to upgrading and extending
patents organizations to protect India's intellectual property
rights and meet stringent demands of the emerging world market.
</P>
<P>
Every technology denial by the West was converted into an
opportunity for Indian scientists. While meeting global
challenges, Indian scientists should also remember that there are
some problems typical to India like those of drinking water,
public hygiene, irrigation and optimum land use for habitation
which could only be solved by indigenous technologies, he said.
</P>
<P>
India should also participate in global research and
development programs to emerge as a global player, he further
said.
</P>
<P>
General president of the 85th Indian science congress Dr. P.
Rama Rao said that India needs several new measures and approaches
to revitalize its science infrastructure, including an increase in
annual research and development expenditure to two percent of
gross national product by the end of the ninth five-year plan
(1998-2002). Compared to global annual expenditure of 500 billion
US dollars on research and development, India's expenditure is
only 2.5 billion.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda's Party Wants Him Back to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former president Kenneth
Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP), the country's
biggest opposition party, wanted him back to prison because of
the "harsh conditions" that Kaunda has to meet under the current
house arrest.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Daily Mail today quoted Kaunda's Press Aide Muhabi
Lungu as claiming here Friday that the conditions at the former
leader's home following his release from prison are "terrible and
inhuaman".
</P>
<P>
He charged that the conditions at Kaunda's house were "worse"
than those in the Mukobeko Prison in Kabwe, 120 kilometers north
of the capital, and warned that if things did not improve in the
near future, UNIP would rather have their "indomitable lion " in
jail.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who was put into Mukobeko Prison last December for
allegedly having involving in last October's abortive military
coup. He was later released from Prison and tranferred to house
arrest under a presidential order signed last Wednesday by
President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda's house now is under heavy police care and is wire
fenced. He is banned to conduct political activities and to meet
the press.
</P>
<P>
During his detention in Mukobeko, said Lungu, Kaunda had all
sorts of visitors but now that he is at home, he can only be
allowed two visitors in a week and share 20 minutes with each
visitor. Only Kaunda's wife and grandchildren are allowed to live
with the "old man".
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 73, the father figure of the nation, led Zambia to
independence from the British colonial rule in 1964 and since
then he had ruled the country until 1991, when he was defeated by
incumbent President Chiluba in the country's general elections.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Hails French Attitude to Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General Sani
Abacha has commended the attitude of France toward Africa, saying
that it is deeply rooted in mutual respect and interest.
</P>
<P>
Abacha made the remarks Friday when French Ambassador Philippe Peltier
called on him in the State House, with a special message from
President Jacque Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The head of state appealed to France to use its influential
position in the European Union to canvass greater understanding and
appreciation of the events and developments in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In response, the ambassador said France hopes to strengthen
the existing cordial relations with Nigeria culturally and
economically.
</P>
<P>
To this end, an economic mission of 20 leading managers from France
interested in investing in Nigeria will visit the country this year.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Nigeria and France have been improved gradually
over the last few years. This is seen by observers as an encouragement
to the Nigerian government as it has been under sanctions imposed by
the European Union three years ago over alleged human rights abuse.
</P>
<P>
To further promote the bilateral relations, Nigeria has decided to
make the French language the second official language of the
English-speaking country.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government also contracted with a French company,
allowing it to carry out the maintenance work of one of its four
failed refineries.

<P>
BAGHDAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters of the United
Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq in Baghdad
was attacked Friday night by grenades, but nobody was injured,
according to local radio report today.
</P>
<P>
Two rocket-propelled grenades were fired late Friday at the
UNSCOM offices in Baghdad, the U.S. TV station Cable News Network
reported today.
</P>
<P>
No one was wounded in the attack and damage was minimal. A
grenade hit a wall and a window in the building's cafeteria was
shattered.
</P>
<P>
The guards at the UNSCOM headquarters' premises saw Friday
evening an explosion in the area facing the Canal Hotel where the
UNSCOM is based, the Iraqi News Agency quoted an Iraqi official as
saying today.
</P>
<P>
The guards inspected the site of the explosion but found no
damages.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities are investigating the incident to
identify the perpetrators of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official blamed the attack on hostile parties that
seek to undermine the Iraqi-UNSCOM relations.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the second on U.N. offices in Baghdad in three
months.
</P>
<P>
One of the U.N. offices in Baghdad was attacked last October
and the Iraqi authorities arrested a number of suspects and
accused Iran of sponsoring the attack.
</P>
<P>
The attack Friday night, for which no one has claimed
responsibility, follows two months of tension between Iraq and the
United Nations over the weapons inspections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has refused access of U.N. weapons inspectors to Iraqi
Presidential palaces that U.N. arms inspectors doubted as covers
for Iraq's biological and chemical weapon programs.
</P>
<P>
But the United Nations has demanded that the U.N. inspectors
have access to the sites throughout Iraq which Baghdad has
declared off limits.

TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian parliament member has
set conditions on the normalization of ties between Iran and the
United States, local newspaper Iran Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. wants to resume ties with Iran, it should release
our 20 billion dollars worth of assets, stop supporting Israel and
interfering in Iran's internal affairs," Mohammad Reza Faker said
at the prayers congregation Friday at Tehran University.
</P>
<P>
Faker blasted the U.S. for its anti-Iran policies, saying that
the superpower had never missed any opportunity to hurt Iran and
its revolution.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. was preoccupied with "seditious move against Iran, it
assisted Iraq in its war (from 1980 to 1988) against Iran, imposed
economic sanctions against our country and sank several of our
ships in the Persian Gulf," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian member of parliament made the remarks after the
recent statements aired both in Tehran and Washington for a
dialogue between the two belligerent countries.
</P>
<P>
On December 14 last year, Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
voiced Iran's readiness to have a dialogue with the "great
American people." In return, U.S. President Bill Clinton said that
he expected "nothing better than a dialogue" with Iran.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today denounced the attack
Friday night at the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
headquarters at the Canal Hotel in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi spokesman slammed the attack as a sabotage aimed at
subverting the Iraq-UNSCOM relationship.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that security guards at the Canal Hotel
entrance on Friday night saw an explosion with columns of fire
in the across-the-street area, where most UNSCOM staff are
residing.
</P>
<P>
He added that the security guards made firsthand checking of
the source of the fire, without noting unusual activities.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi authorities are investigating the incident to
identify the saboteurs, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UNSCOM officials found some components of two
unexploded shells, causing minimal damage to the parking lot and
shattering a window. So far no casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The UNSCOM is responsible for verifying the disarmament of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Until then will the
U.N. Security Council lift the crippling economic sanctions on
Iraq imposed in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The attack was the second on U.N. offices in Baghdad in three
months.

-- The accusation made by the public prosecutor of Strasbourg
against the city's police force after the riot on New Year's eve has
caused a dispute. The prosecutor, Magistrate Edmond Stenger, has
been summoned by the higher authorities, for blaming the police for
``catastrophic results in terms of questioning'' the rioters and for
questioning the ``efficiency of the measure of maintaining order''
by police. The Interior Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement has firmly
condemned the remarks by Stenger, while his predecessor Charles
Pasqua also judged the statement ``a little bit out of place.''
</P>
<P>
-- At a traditional ceremony of good wish giving at the Elysee
presidential palace on Friday, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin ensured
President Jacques Chirac that his government would be fully attached

<HEADLINE> More Prisoners May Get House Arrest in Los Angeles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD) is pushing forward with efforts to place
non-violent convicts on a house arrest program.
</P>
<P>
Police officials in this second largest U.S. city said they are
prepared to send up to 4,000 convicts home with electronic
monitoring bracelets, more than double the current number.
</P>
<P>
The measure is designed to free up jail beds and ensure that
more hardened convicts serve their full sentences behind bars.
</P>
<P>
Given the fact that the average cost of incarceration is
between 45 to 65 U.S. dollars a day, the LAPD is under court order
to reduce its inmate population to cut cost.
</P>
<P>
The department said it has no choice but to return some
non-violent convicts -- many of them white-collar criminals -- to
the community through monitoring or work release.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 430 people out on work release and
about 1,500 on house arrest in the state of California, on the
U.S. west coast.
</P>
<P>
But critics question whether the police department has the
ability to adequately monitor activities of the inmates it places
on house arrest or work release.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, a Los Angeles municipal court judge ordered
the police department to put back behind bars a man sent home on
electronic monitoring after being convicted of stealing thousands
of dollars from business people who had sought his services.
</P>
<P>
The police department said it could take further steps to make
sure inmates stay out of trouble while on house arrest.
</P>
<P>
Since July, about 20 percent of the inmates placed on work
release have violated the terms of the program, compared to 9
percent placed on electronic monitoring. About two-thirds of the
violators in both programs have been returned to custody.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's fishing and aquiculture
industry grossed 755 million U.S. dollars in exports in 1997, 85
million U.S. dollars more than that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The ministry of fisheries attributed the growth to
market-oriented economic policies, the active participation of
businesses from different economic sectors in production and
exports, and the expansion of outlets.
</P>
<P>
Marine exports now account for one tenth of the whole country's
export value, ranking third after rice and crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Japan imported 65 percent of Vietnam's marine exports in 1996
but only 40.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a move to develop the industry, a denmark-funded three-year
(1996-99) project to help Vietnam fisheries improve the quality
of export sea products and expand outlets is being effectively
implemented.
</P>
<P>
The project also supports the establishment of a Vietnam sea
product processing and export association to promote cooperation
between businesses in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Year-ender: France Achieves Initial Economic Success in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Since the French Socialist Party
won the general elections at the end of May, the new government
led by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin has adopted a series of
economic measures with initial success achieved.
</P>
<P>
In the general elections, the Socialists, Communists and
Ecologists took power from the rightwing coalition of the Gaullist
Rally for Republic (RPR) headed by President Jacques Chirac and
the Union for French Democracy (UDF).
</P>
<P>
The resignation of the rightwing government was due to slow
economic recovery, increasing unemployed population, serious
social injustice and the lack of public confidence in the future,
which are also challenging the new leftwing government.
</P>
<P>
The top problems facing the new government are the launch of
the European single currency in 1999 and greater European
integration.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, only the country with the state
financial deficit less than three percent of its gross national
product (GNP) is qualified for joining the Euro.
</P>
<P>
As it tried to meet the criteria for joining the Euro by
tightening expenditures to control the budget deficit, the
leftwing government attached importance to social problems.
</P>
<P>
Pushed by the French initiatives, the Amsterdam Treaty signed
by the European Union in October, the ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty and the convocation of the Job Summit in
Luxembourg in November have promised to maintain public welfare
and protect national interest.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment and various social crises caused by injustice are
for the moment two major problems for the French government, whose
success mainly depends on its ability to address the woes with
creativity and confidence.
</P>
<P>
The new government has adopted an employment program for the
youth and the 35-hour work week plan, in addition to reforming the
tax system for social insurance.
</P>
<P>
It has also taken a series of measures to adjust the allocation
of government financial budget and increase the tax rate of
interest for big enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government has laid a foundation for solving the
unemployment problem by increasing state income and cutting
improper expenditures, so as to stimulate economic growth and
create job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said that the economic and social policies
adopted by the leftwing government have kept a balance between the
interests of enterprises and the public by stressing social
justice, while others criticized the government for lacking
creativity in curbing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, business representatives said that the increase of
tax revenues of enterprises and reduction of legal work hours of
employees would hurt the competitiveness of enterprises and even
hinder the development of the national economy.
</P>
<P>
In any case, the leftwing government has made some economic
achievements since it came to power more than half a year ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent statistics released by the French
Finance Ministry, the deficit in 1997 was estimated to have
dropped to 3.1 percent, close to the criteria set for joining the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
The rise of dollar and increasing demands in other countries
this year have also helped France achieve a favorable balance of
foreign trade and overall industrial development.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the government continued to carry out the policy of
low interest rate which stimulated the economic growth; thus, the
industrial investment and domestic consumption in France this year
are predicted to increase.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in France this year is expected to
increase one percentage point to 2.3 percent and the growth rate
in 1998 is likely to rise to about 3 percent, according to the
estimations of both the government and research institutions.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian political party
Freedom Movement of Iran (FMI) was accused of working for the
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), local newspaper Iran Daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Friday prayer aggregation on the campus of
Tehran University, Mohammad Reza Faker, a Majlis (parliament)
member, threatened to "expose political figures" working for the
CIA.
</P>
<P>
"In the future at a press conference I will expose the names
of CIA agents (inside) Iran whose membership cards were shown (to
us) by the ambassador of the former Soviet Union to Tehran,"
Faker told the worshippers.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that an Iranian parliament member
launched such a stinging attack on the FMI and those affiliated
to the political party since it was founded in 1961 by former
Iranian prime minister Mehdi Bazargan.
</P>
<P>
The FMI has not been granted formal permission to carry out
activities since the country announced to register political
parties and organizations in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Faker stressed that "liberals and the Freedom Movement of Iran
had been ousted from the political mainstream" by the late
Iranian supreme leader Imam Khomeini and should no be allowed to
come back.
</P>
<P>
However, a FMI member rejected the accusation today in a
telephone interview with Xinhua, saying that it was not the first
time that the FMI was charged of "unfounded crimes."
</P>
<P>
Faker should provide necessary evidences to prove his
accusation against a political party, he said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of Iran's Freedom Movement Ebrahim Yazdi
was arrested on December 14 on charges of "desecrating religious
sanctities," but released on bail after a 10-day imprisonment.

CANBERRA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- American yachtsman Dennis
Conner said on Saturday that New Zealand has damaged the famed
America's Cup competition by scheduling their defence in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The challenger series for the America's Cup will be held in

"The New Zealanders put it on hold and it's damaged the
contest, there's no question about it," said Conner, a three-time
America's Cup winner.
</P>
<P>
Conner was also the skipper on the two occasions the Auld Mug
was taken outside the United States by Australia in 1983 and New
Zealand in 1995.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar will mark
the 34th anniversary of revolution Tuesday which toppled the
sultanate regime, Daily News reported today.
</P>

The paper quoted sources from the Chief Minister's Office as
saying that the celebrations will start with cleaning the
environment and launching new projects.
</P>
<P>
The event will be held in Zanzibar and not in Pemba Island as

Ramadan.

Zanzibar, an archipelago made up of Pemba and Zanzibar
islands, along with roughly 50 smaller islands. Most of the
residents in the Indian isles are Moslem.
</P>

WUHAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The middle part of China has

<HEADLINE> East China Province Implements New Housing Reform Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- All departments and institutions
directly under the Shandong Provincial Government are not allowed
to distribute apartments as a form of welfare effective on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new housing reform measure will spread to more areas and,
by 1999, all institutions of the province will stop distributing
welfare apartments, according to local sources.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with this reform measure, welfare housing of
workers will be realized in the form of cash instead. Each
worker's monthly salary will rise in accordance with a certain
proportion effective January 1.
</P>
<P>
The increased sum of money, which is a form of housing subsidy
for individuals from the government, will be used to purchase or
build new housing apartments, make housing repairs and pay rent.
</P>
<P>
Local financial organizations will also offer mortgage loans to
encourage more wage earners to buy apartments, said local
officials.
</P>
<P>
Housing reform has been in practice in this east China province
for almost a decade. The province has practiced reform measures
such as marketing government-subsidized apartments and
establishing a public accumulative housing fund for wage earners.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shandong has pooled 4 billion yuan (482 million US
dollars)through the housing fund. The province has also sold
government-subsidized apartments with a combined floor space of 80
million square meters, making up 55 percent of the marketable
government-subsidized apartments.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Shaanxi Province recorded 540,000
overseas tourist arrivals and more than 25 million domestic
tourist arrivals in 1997. The number of trips by overseas visitors
represented an eight percent rise over 1996, and that of domestic
tourists was up 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
This northwest Chinese province, which is world-famous for its

yuan (807 million US dollars) through domestic tourism, a 10
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Among the tourists from overseas, Chinese compatriots from
Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao, and overseas Chinese registered the
biggest increases.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Malaysia's CPO, Tin, Rubber Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's markets of the
crude palm oil (CPO) physicals, tin and rubber closed the week
mixed.
</P>
<P>
On the CPO physicals market, this New Year holiday-shortened
week saw January South end 100 ringgit (25.6 U.S. dollars) better
at 2,150 ringgit (551.2 U.S. dollars) per ton.
</P>
<P>
The market is expected to maintain its upside potential next
week but this could be affected by intermittent technical
corrections, a dealer said, adding that the ringgit's movement
will continue to be a major factor in determining the cash
market's direction.
</P>
<P>
Buying activity is expected to intensify, if the ringgit
declines further after easing to 3.9250/50 against the U.S. dollar
on Friday, the dealer said.
</P>
<P>
It was expected that demand for crude palm oil would remain
favorable, evident from the expectation of higher export figures
estimated for December by private forecaster Caleb Brett.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the week, the Kuala Lumpur Tin Market (KLTM), which
was closed on Wednesday and Thursday for the New Year, also
closed higher with the metal gaining 14 sen to end at 20.24
ringgit (5.18 U.S. dollars) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Accumulated turnover was relatively high at 288 tons despite
trading for three days only this week against 249 tons last week
with European, local and Japanese traders accounting for the
week's transactions.
</P>
<P>
The price differential between the KLTM and that of the London
Metal Exchange (LME) was at a discount of 128 U.S. dollars per ton
on Friday against a premium of 30 U.S. dollars per ton previously.
</P>
<P>
The KLTM is expected to see higher tin prices on fresh buying
support next week as players return to the market after their long
vacation.
</P>
<P>
A dealer said demand should improve next week with the coming
back of foreign traditional buyers, especially from Europe, who
have abstained from the market since the tail-end of December.
</P>
<P>
But, the Malaysian rubber market this week was mixed. January
RSS One decreased three sen to 273.50 sen (70.1 U.S. cents) per kg
from last week's close at 276.50 sen (70.8 U.S. cents) while SMR
20 was up two sen at 274.00 sen (70.2 U.S. cents) per kg.
</P>
<P>
Sentiment on the local rubber market is expected to remain
mixed next week against a backdrop of poor fundamentals and an
absence of players who are still away for the New Year holidays.
</P>
<P>
The rubber market is only expected to pick up in February.

<HEADLINE> Shelter-forest Project Proves Fruitful  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The shelter-forest project in
north, northeast and northwest China has produced fruitful outcome
after some 20 years of construction.
</P>
<P>
In the northwestern, northern and northeastern regions of the
country, there are 1.49 million square meters of desert, the Gobi
desert and desertified land, making up 98 percent of the country's
total.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government launched a three-phase shelter-forest
project in these regions in 1978 to help improve the local
environment as well as living conditions for local residents. The
project was planned to be completed in the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
According to an official in charge of the project, more than 20
million hectares of trees have been planted, with the forest
coverage rate rising to 9 percent from 5.05 percent in 1977, the
year preceding the reform and opening-up was launched in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Twenty percent of desertified land in the regions is subjected
to grave threat by wind and sand storms. approximately 40 percent
of soil-eroded land in the Loess Plateau has now been improved. In
agricultural areas, 65 percent of farmland has been under the
protection by criss-crossed forest belts, and more than 50
counties have built a regional shelter-forest network.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some one million hectares of forest in the project
area guarantees a fuel supply for more than 6 million households
of farmers and herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
The project has not only improved the local environment, but
helps to increase grain production. In the Gansu Corridor of
northwest China's Gansu Province alone, 52,000 hectares of sandy
area have been turned into high-yield farmland, with the combined
grain output of 2.22 billion kilograms, an increase from 1.72
billion kg in 1978.

<P>
The Gansu Corridor, with less than 20 percent of the province's
arable land, produces 70 percent of Gansu's total commodity grain
output.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the shelter-forest project helps the development of
forestry and sideline industries in the project areas. Pengyang
County in northwestern Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region has helped
one-fifth of local farmers shake off poverty by planting apricot
trees.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province scored a net income of more than 10 billion yuan
(1.2 billion U.S. dollars) from forestry in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Timber reserves in the project regions exceed 200 million cubic
meters with an annual timber output of 8 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
By the end of the century, the forest coverage rate in the
afforested area in the north, northeast and northwest China
should exceed 10 percent, with 30 percent of the desertified land
improved, 50 percent of soil-eroded area under effective control,
and more than 80 percent of farmland brought under the protection
of criss-crossed shelter-forests.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Report on Kuala Lumpur Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kuala Lumpur Stock
Exchange (KLSE) closed the week stronger on Saturday due to what
dealers said year-end window dressing by local institutions.
</P>
<P>
The KLSE market saw some gains being made in the first three
days of the week prior to the New Year holiday on Thursday, but
the momentum was not sustained when the market reopened for
trading on Friday, the first trading day in the New Year, as
evident from the sharp decline in share prices.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the benchmark Composite Index rose 21 points
to end the week at 571.96 against 550.96 last week, the all Main
Board Emas Index gained 2.25 points to closed the week at 146.27
from last week's close at 144.02, the Industrial Index added 1.67
points to 1,093.33 while the Second Board Index lost 6.23 points
to 154.11.
</P>
<P>
Apart from interest on the usual blue-chip counters like
Telekom, Tenaga National and Maybank, which helped boost the
index, focus was also centered on finance stocks during the week.
</P>
<P>
Late on Friday, Gadek Capital announced that it had obtained
approval from the State Bank to negotiate a merger with Credit
Corporation (Malaysia) Bhd and EON Finance, two finance companies
within the DRB-HICOM group.
</P>
<P>
There were also rumors circulating in the market that
Malaysia's biggest bank, Malayan Banking Bhd may be merged with
Bank Bumiputera Malaysia Bhd.
</P>
<P>
The week's grand total turnover covering all markets stood at
830 million shares valued at 2,272.422 million ringgit (about
582.672 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the main board, the week's volume dropped to 554.892 million
shares valued at 1.426 billion ringgit (about 365.641 million
dollars) from 492.832 million stocks worth 1.023 billion ringgit
(about 262.307 million dollars) trade last week.
</P>
<P>
Consumer products accounted for 27.887 million shares traded on
the main board, industrial products 45.963 million shares,
construction 32.309 million shares, trade/services 123.882 million
shares, infrastructure 3.836 million shares, finance 161.665
million shares, hotels 2.722 million shares, properties 64.791
million shares, plantation 38.167 million shares, mining 3.799
million shares, trusts 1.712 million shares, closed/funds 882,000
shares, loans 19.805 million shares and TSR/warrants 27.472
million shares.
</P>
<P>
On the second board, volume declined to 55.281 million shares
valued at 129.970 million ringgit (about 33.325 million dollars)
from 64.114 million shares worth 119.083 million ringgit (about
30.534 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
Off-market deals, however, increased to 219.826 million shares
valued at 715.470 million ringgit (about 183.453 million dollars)
from 83.100 million shares worth 498.437 million ringgit (about
127.804 million dollars) last week.
</P>
<P>
The most active counter was Tenaga Nasional with 27.389 million
shares traded valued at 217.989 million ringgit (about 55.894
million dollars) and the counter gained 25 sen to end the week at
7.65 ringgit.
</P>
<P>
Other counters among the top ten this week included IOI
Corporation, MBf Capital, Telekom, Maybank, Commerce Assets, RHB
Capital, John Hancock, AMMB and Arab-Malaysian Finance - Foreign.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that no cheer or celebration was expected on the
KLSE, at least in the early part of next week, as the continuing
weak ringgit which ended at 3.95 ringgit against the U.S. dollar
on Friday and rising interest rates is envisaged to further dampen
the market's prevailing bearish sentiment.
</P>
<P>
State Bank's announcement that maximum base lending rate for
both commercial banks and finance companies will be raised to
10.45 percent and 12.3 percent respectively is also expected to
hurt finance stocks, they said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark 100-company Composite Index, is already showing
resistance at the 540 points level but if this hurdle is breached
the next strong support level could be pegged at the 500 points
level, the said.

BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan will meet Malaysian officials across the border on Monday
to seek assistance in Thailand's crackdown on terrorists,
according to the Nation newspaper on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Surin will seek Malaysia's cooperation in extraditing suspects
and will urge that caution be exercised in granting Malaysian
citizenship to Thai Muslims, the newspaper quoted Thai Interior
Minister Sanan Khachornprasart as saying.
</P>
<P>
Surin's visit comes in the wake of several bomb attacks in
three southern Thai provinces in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
Thai police believe that the incidents are linked to Muslim
separatist groups, members of which possibly take shelter or are
training in Malaysia. Some members are believed to be dual
citizens of Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
At a cabinet meeting early this week, Prime Minister Chuan
Leekpai ordered a more active approach in dealing with the
perennial problem of separatist violence in the south.

<HEADLINE> Two Million People Lose Jobs in Indonesia During </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- More than two million people
have lost their jobs since the monetary crisis began last July in
the country, according to estimates by the Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI).
</P>
<P>
ABRI spokesman Brig. Gen. A. Wahab Mokodongan said on Friday
that such a crisis could destabilize the country, especially when
people were easily provoked by speculation and rumors.
</P>
<P>
However, ABRI members are ready to crack down on any
"security-disturbing activities," Wahab said.
</P>
<P>
Now in the middle of the worst ever monetary crisis, the
country is preparing for the five-yearly general meeting of the
People's Consultative Assembly next March, which will elect a
president and a vice president and also endorse the State Policy
Guidelines for 1998/2003.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the accuracy of his estimations, Wahab said:
"It was based on reports that many companies and industries had
recently laid off their workers."
</P>
<P>
However, the head of the Jakarta Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, Julia Hasan, said last week that 2.4 million workers had
lost their jobs in Jakarta and the surrounding towns.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have warned that the unemployment rate would rise to
11 percent in 1997 from seven percent of the total 90
million-strong work force in the country in 1995 as companies
struggle with big debts in foreign currencies, despite a
multi-billion dollar economic rescue package put together by the
International Monetary Fund IMF).
</P>
<P>
At the end of last October, the IMF agreed to provide a 23
billion dollar long-term loan to Indonesia to help the country
overcome the current monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The value of the Indonesian rupiah has lost more than 100
percent against the U.S. dollar since early July last year. Many
small and medium-sized factories and companies, badly hit by the
currency crisis, have reduced their production and laid off
workers.

<HEADLINE> Panama's Tariff Cut Draws Criticism From Enterprisers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Panamanian
Industrialists Syndicate (SIP) reiterated here Friday that the
tariff cut implemented by the government will affect at least 71
percent of the country's enterprises in 1998.
</P>
<P>
If this continues, SIP members said, it is possible that many
local firms will be affected in four or five months.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government decreed January 1 a reduction of
tariffs. All the products formerly tariffed between 5.1 to 14.9
percent will now have a tax rate of 10 percent, and those above 15
percent will be lowered to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
The other tariff levels are 3 and 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dario Selles, president of the Panamanian Exporters
Association, said the new law will hit hard some of the country's
productive sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, "The law will not include dairy products,
whose tax rate was reduced from 50 percent to 40 percent, rice,
which saw its tariff down from 60 percent to 30 percent, and motor
vehicles, which go up from 15 percent to 20 percent."
</P>
<P>
This hasty drop in tariffs, Selles said, will simply create a
serious problem for the Panamanian industries, because
entrepreneurs will have no time to prepare for the sudden
changes.

<HEADLINE> Diverse Reactions to New Anti-Smoking Law in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The first day of the
introduction of the law which bans smoking in California's bars
and nightclubs ended with mixed reactions from the public.
</P>
<P>
The new anti-smoking law, the strongest in the United States,
went into effect in the small hours on January 1, 1998. The ban
stems from California's indoor workplace smoking prohibition that
started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to the new law, bar owners will be fined up to 100
U.S. dollars for the first offense and 7,000 dollars for the
second violation.
</P>
<P>
Reporters from local newspapers based in Los Angeles, San
Diego, San Francisco and other cities spent much time in New
Year's Day in bars which were packed with patrons to interview
with smokers, non-smokers, bar owners and policemen.
</P>
<P>
In some bars, smokers went right on smoking despite waitresses
had confiscated ashtrays at midnight. But in other bars, customers
got in their last puffs before midnight, and then the smoke
cleared.
</P>
<P>
An organization called Californians for Smokers' Rights issued
a statement on Thursday, calling for the repeal of the law.
</P>
<P>
The organization argued, "the law deprives smokers of the right
to consume a legal product within a private establishment."
</P>
<P>
But other smokers seem not so assured. Although complaining and
cursing the law, they smoked out of the bars. Some people also
said that they would quit smoking because of the new law.
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency urged
residents to embrace the law and report violations.
</P>
<P>
Anti-smoking activists were confident that people will become
accustomed to the law.
</P>
<P>
However, owners of bars and restaurants argued that the ban
would severely hurt their business.
</P>
<P>
California's Health Department hoped that most bar owners and
patrons would eventually comply with the new law.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economic Downturn Blamed for Rise in Court Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of civil and criminal
lawsuits in Thailand increased sharply last year, with many of
them related to the country's economic downturn, according to the
Nation newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The total number of civil cases reached 280,000 in 1997,
compared to 193,000 in the previous year, with 27 percent of the
cases related to loans and 24.3 percent to leases.
</P>
<P>
The remaining cases included bad checks, breaches of purchase
contracts and bankruptcy. There were about 3,000 bankruptcy cases
in 1997, compared to only 500 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Civil Court Chief Justice Pheng Phengniti said the figures
would rise this year as there are many expected breach-of-contract
cases where purchasers could not come up with payment for their
orders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, compared with 1996, criminal cases in 1997 increased
by nearly 10,000 per month to reach a total of 560,000. There were
443,500 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Crime is also likely to rise this year as a result of the
growing unemployment problem, the newspaper said, quoting criminal
court Chief Justice Pradit Ekmanee.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Reaffirms Sovereignty Over Malvinas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
Friday reaffirmed its unquestionable sovereignty over Islas
Malvinas (Falklands) and the surrounding waters.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released on the eve of 165th anniversary
of Britain's occupation of Islas Malvinas (Falklands), the
Argentine government said it is determined to regain its
sovereignty through peaceful negotiations in accordance with the
Constitution and international demands.
</P>
<P>
Argentina will seek a just and thorough settlement of the
dispute with Britain, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine government is committed to respect the life style
of Malvinas (Falklands) islanders and to promote the exchanges and
cooperation between the island and mainland residents, it added.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem, due to visit London later
this year, said recently that he would discuss with British
leaders the issue of shared Malvinas (Falklands) sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Menem will be the first Argentine president to visit Britain
since the Malvinas (Falklands) War in 1982.
</P>
<P>
However, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook later ruled out
the possibility of shared sovereignty without the agreement of
local residents.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Argentine Foreign Minister Guido Di Tella described
Cook's remarks as "no surprise," saying Britain "never hopes to
hold substantive negotiations" with Argentina on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Islas Malvinas (Falklands), located on the southern Atlantic
Ocean, was occupied by Britain on January 3, 1833.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Falls to 6,200 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Sustained corporate demand for
U.S. dollars brought the Indonesian rupiah down to 6,200 against
the greenback Friday, while share prices at the Jakarta Stock
Exchange rose by two percent, dealers and brokers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Currency dealers said corporate dollar buying to pay
dollar-denominated debts remained high in the market, pushing the
local currency further down on Friday, the first trading day of
the new year.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah was quoted at 6,000/6,200 at 6:00 p.m. local time,
the lowest since the currency was floated in August last year.
</P>
<P>
Many analysts blamed the indebted corporating for the sharp
depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar on Friday. The
rupiah has lost more than 100 percent of its value against the
dollar since last July.
</P>
<P>
The government has said Indonesia's private offshore debts
total 65 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 55 percent of the
country's total debts of 118 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
AS the rupiah weakened, stock prices on the Jakarta Stock
Exchange gained 2.07 percent, with the composite index rising 8.29
points to close at 410.01.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said the market opened 1998 trading with an
expectation of a better 1998-99 state budget to be announced by
President Soeharto on January 6.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing to Construct Center for 21st Century Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The trans-century goal for
Chongqing, China's youngest municipality, is to turn itself into
an economic center serving Southwest China and the upper reaches
of the Yangtze River by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Xu Zhongmin, Chongqing vice-mayor, said at a seminar on
investment and development in central and western part of China
that Chongqing, covering an area of 82,000 sq.km. and a population
of 30.2 million, boasts unique regional advantages and tremendous
potential for progress within the frame work of China's overall
economic development.
</P>
<P>
The seminar on Investment and Development in Central and
Western China was held in Wuhan, capital of Hubei Province
recently.
</P>
<P>
With the regional advantage of connecting to the country's east
and west, Chongqing itself is rich in resources like natural gas,
coal, electric power, hydropower and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The mammoth Three Gorges Project, the large hydro-electric
construction in the world has created a gargantuan demand for
investment and consumption, Xu noted. Meanwhile, infrastructure
with emphasis on transportation, telecommunication and energy has
begun to take shape.
</P>
<P>
As southwest China's communication hub and an inland port,
thanks to China's "golden waterway", the Yangtze River, the
municipality sends goods to foreign countries directly via the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the State has granted Chongqing special supports in
the spheres of finance, credit, investment projects and policies,
he noted. Its upgrading into a municipality directly under the
central government last March has given it a special position as
the vanguard in the development of central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
Xu went on to say that Chongqing will enter 21st century with
greater openness than ever before.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to give priority to agriculture and the three
backbone industries -- machinery, chemicals and metallurgy with
its machinery dominated by cars and motor cycles.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, special emphasis will also be placed on
such industries as electronic information, construction materials
and food processing.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the favorable policies foreign businessmen find in
coastal regions are available in Chongqing, Xu noted, adding that
the policies will be carefully implemented to provide good
services for investors in a freer environment.

<HEADLINE> Rural Population Reduced in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Currently, 71 percent of the
Chinese citizens are farmers, as against the formerly established
some 80 percent, due to industrialization in rural areas since the
country launched reforms in late 1970s, According to Beijing-based
"China Daily" today.
</P>
<P>
The result was based on a random survey on 40,576 rural
households across China.
</P>
<P>
Among agricultural families, 62.81 percent live on their land
and 30.57 percent have some income from outside agriculture. For
6.62 percent, farming is no longer the main source of income.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also found that the proportion of households
depending on agriculture is lowest in the coastal provinces,
greater in mid-China and highest in the land-locked western area.
</P>
<P>
During China's reform process, farmers began to diversify their
trades to enlarge their earnings. Township enterprises were one of
their best inventions.
</P>
<P>
These operations absorb most rural labour. There were 1,396,300
non-agricultural township enterprises by the end of 1996,
employing 52.96 million people. Over 55 percent of township
enterprises are located in eastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
Most of these firms specialize in industrial manufacturing,
construction, transportation, catering trade, retailing and other
service sectors.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Launch Campaign for Consumers' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will launch
a campaign aimed at educating Thai people about the rights of
consumers, the local press reported on Saturday, quoting deputy
prime minister Suvit Khunkitti.
</P>
<P>
Suvit said the government would also encourage students and
housewives to set up consumer protection groups in their campuses
and their respective communities, in line with Tuesday's cabinet
resolution declaring 1998-99 as years of consumer protection.
</P>
<P>
The responsibility for protecting consumer's rights should not
be left with the government alone, but should also be extended to
the consumers themselves, he said.
</P>
<P>
As Thailand is trying to gain a share of the tourism business
from other areas such as Hong Kong and Singapore, the campaign
would convince foreign tourists that they would not be cheated if
they buy products in Thailand, he said.

<HEADLINE> Deficit Ratio to GDP Falls to 2.7 percent in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Italy's deficit accounted for 2.7
percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, compared to
the 3 percent criteria required for the single European currency,
the Euro, the Treasury Ministry said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, the borrowing requirement for the
past year should come out at about 52.5 trillion lire (30 billion
U.S. dollars), compared with the government's projection of 68
trillion lire (38 billion U.S. dollars) and the previous year's
figure of 128.9 trillion lire (73 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
This will probably be the second time in 17 years that the
country's spending budget be respected. In 1986, the government's
spending cost was 750 billion lire (428 million dollars) below the
figure originally planned.
</P>
<P>
Though final figures for Italy's GDP in 1997 won't be available
until February, the International Monetary Fund also suggested
that Italy's deficit ratio to GDP would at best only scrape inside
the 3-percent limit.

CARACAS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela and Chile have signed
a trade agreement to lift all customs tariffs beginning in 1998 in
an effort to promote bilateral trades.
</P>
<P>
With the zero tariffs adopted on January 1 of this year, the
commercial integration between Venezuela and Chile is a reality,
Venezuelan authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement affected Venezuelan chemical and

Since 1993, Venezuela and Chile have put in force some free

was negotiated until the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The removal of all import duties will increase trade between
the two countries this year, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral trade volume reached 320 million U.S. dollars in
1996 and 360 million dollars in 1997, respectively, only a modest

<HEADLINE> Family Planners Build Insurance for Rural Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The China Family Planning
Association (CFPA), the country's largest non-governmental
organization, will expand social insurance benefits in rural areas
for households practising family planning.
</P>
<P>
The strategy is to maintain previous birth control achievements
and remove worries about how people will manage in their old age, a
CFPA official said yesterday in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Jin Hongmei, CFPA director of social insurance affairs, is
quoted by today's China Daily as saying that the association, with
support from some state departments, would take measures to ensure
social insurance benefits related to family planning be continued
steadily.
</P>
<P>
The insurances will be made an important component of
the country's family planning work, Jin noted.
</P>
<P>
First initiated in Liaoning and Fujian provinces in 1985, a
series of social insurance benefits have been set up in 31
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, said Jin.
</P>
<P>
They include health insurance for an only child and mother, and
pension insurance for rural parents with one boy or two
girls. Family planning workers receive life and property insurance.
</P>
<P>
Families benefited will shoulder only a small proportion of the
cost of the insurance service, with the majority shared by the
central and local government and local township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Children who are insured may get compensation for medical
charges when they are ill; with pension insurance, parents may get
a monthly payment to live on when they reach the age of 60.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Russia's defending world chess
champion Anatoly Karpov won the opening game against challenger
Viswanathan Anand in the World Chess Championship finals in
Lausanne, Switzerland, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Karpov, playing white pieces, battled more than six and a half
hours against his 28-year-old Indian opponent, who beat Michael
Adams of England in an eliminator in December to win the challenge
right.
</P>
<P>
Karpov somewhat surprised Anand in a theoretical novelty move
in the semi-slav defense, Meran variation, that involves a knight
sacrifice on move 17.
</P>
<P>
Six games are scheduled in the finals, organized by the
International Chess Federation (FIDE), with a possible tie-break
to decide the title on January 9.

MANILA, January 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso may go down
further to 45 against the U.S. dollar after it tumbled to a
historic low on Friday, dealers here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the peso plunged to a historic new low of 41.80 to
the dollar from 39.90 on the last day of trading in 1997 on
corporate dollar demand and continued pressure from the weakness
of regional currencies.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian ringgit was lower at 3.92/3.93 on Friday compared
with 3.86/3.87 on New Year's Eve, while the Indonesian rupiah was
weaker at 5,800/6,000 as against the previous 5,000/5,100.
</P>
<P>
"Our currency cannot remain strong when the others in the
region are sliding. Our exports cannot compete anymore. We just
have to go with the Asian currencies," the Manila Times quoted
Pedro Florecio, president of Foreign Exchange Association of the
Philippines, as saying on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It could go over 45. It would be new territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso has lost 36.8 percent of its value against
the dollar since it started to fall on July 11.
</P>
<P>
The pressure on the peso has remained even after the central
bank promised to make available non-deliverable forwards (NDFs)
this month.
</P>
<P>
The NDFs will provide those firms with unhedged foreign
exchange exposures an option to buy dollar without crowding the
spot foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
But bankers said clients may not use the NDF facility if the
pricing is expensive.
</P>
<P>
"It depends on the perception of clients whether the rate being
quoted is acceptable or not," said a dealer.

<HEADLINE> Alitalia to Court Singapore Airlines After KLM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Alitalia, the public-owned Italian
airline, is "looking with great interest" at Singapore Airlines as
a potential partner in Asia, Italian Transport Minister Claudio
Burlando said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
After Alitalia announced a strategic partnership on December 17
with the Dutch airline, KLM, its officials have said that the
conclusion of a deal with a European partner would be followed by
the search for a partner in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Roman daily, II Messaggero, Burlando
said the Asian partnership would be signed by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
He also said that, by the end of the year, the public stake in
the airline Alitalia should be reduced to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is currently under the umbrella of Iri, the public holding
company.
</P>
<P>
The December 17 deal combines Alitalia's strengths in Europe
and Latin America, including on the Milan-Rome route, one of
Europe's busiest, with KLM's wider range of international
destinations.

<HEADLINE> Homicide Rate Drops in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 2 (Xinhua) -- The number of reported
murders in Washington D.C. fell from 397 in 1996 to 301 in 1997,
the lowest figure in 10 years, a senior police officer said here
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a news conference, Sonya Proctor, the acting police
chief in the capital of the United States, attributed the drop of
the homicide rate to the strengthened police patrol on city
streets.
</P>
<P>
Proctor was appointed interim chief of the 3,800-officer
department after the unexpected resignation of Larry Soulsby in
November.
</P>
<P>
Proctor said there's no question that Washington D.C. has
become a better place for people to live and visit.
</P>
<P>
"Crime is down and is down by a significant percentage.
Homicides are down," she added.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said homicides were down last year from Los
Angeles to New York City as big cities across America put more
emphasis on high-profile neighborhood police patrols.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, the number of murders in Washington
reached the high of 489 in 1991 when the city was dubbed the
"murder capital of America."

<HEADLINE> Pupils Having Less Pressure with Their Exams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Some Beijing pupils are no
longer worried about taking their exams before the month-long
winter vacation starts in mid-January, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Homework and scores won't bother you any more," said Cai Fang,
a pupil at a primary school in Haidian District in northwest
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
It was an educational reform initiated September 1997 that has
made the exams less awe-inspiring for thousands of pupils in the
district.
</P>
<P>
The reform means abandoning the use of scores to define the
result of the exam. Instead, pupils' final achievements will be
graded as "excellent, good, pass and fail" with 40 percent based
on their exam scores and 60 percent on daily performance.
</P>
<P>
The reform replaced the 100-mark system which has been used for
about 40 years. Moreover, it has reduced homework by half.
</P>
<P>
About a quarter, or 106,000 of Beijing's pupils are among the
first to say goodbye to the old system.
</P>
<P>
Yet many parents do not like the present practice, worrying
that their children may become wild and lazy without the pressure
of scores.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Xu Xiuru, an expert form the National Institute of
Healthy Education, said: "Many parents have ignored the fact that
most things kids can do now, thanks to the reform, are related and
beneficial to their study, and, more importantly to the development
of their potential."
</P>
<P>
Educational departments were persuaded to try out the reform
package in Shanghai in 1991 by educators who maintain it is
necessary to free students from the grip of the score-oriented
100-system.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that the number of pupils who suffer form mental
problems due to the pressure of homework and fierce competition
under the 100-mark system has increased over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
So far, the reform has been introduced to primary schools in
Beijing, Tianjin, and the provinces of Shangdong, Jiangsu and
Liaoning.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Colombia closed 1997
with a 17.9 percent inflation compared to the 18 percent forecast

The inflation drop was attributed to the control of the prices

goods, and to the economic recession and its negative effects on
the demand, according to bank sources.

However, it will be difficult to achieve this year the control

<P>
SHANGHAI, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Wang Xiaoyuan, a 59-year-old
patient with mental problems, successfully had a tumor removed
from the right side of his face that was the size of a football.
</P>
<P>
"This was the biggest tumor I have ever seen," said Dr. Zhang
Mengyin, the surgeon in charge of the operation at the Shanghai
Huashan Hospital. Two surgeons and a psychiatrist assisted Zhang
with the operation.
</P>
<P>
The tumor, which weighed three kilograms, had plagued the
mental patient Wang for more than two decades. Because of the
patient's resistance to treatment, the tumor grew from egg-size to
as big as his head. The patient could not hold his head upright
and was confined to bed.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of the patient had asked for help from many hospitals
but were turned down repeatedly for the dangerous and complex
operation owing to the size of the tumor.
</P>
<P>
After the operation, the patient was seen holding his head
upright again and having some smiles. He is now recovering well.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, January 3 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a major industrial
base, has stepped up the building of its legal framework since it
was upgraded to China's fourth municipality in March 1997, in a
bid to promote a healthy development of its economy.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government's first working conference on legality
which ended recently revealed that the municipality aims to set up
an overall legal framework which centers on economic development.
</P>
<P>
An official with the municipal government said that Chongqing
is presently concentrating on legislation to reform state-owned
enterprises and the removal and settlement of residents originally
residing in the Three Gorges Dam areas.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government attaches great importance to the
building of a highly efficient law-enforcement troop, which is
essential to the municipality's image as a major industrial city
in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to an newly promulgated regulation, law-enforcement
personnel who did not receive professional training and undergo
appraisals cannot begin their work as officers.
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to improve supervision of law-enforcement
as part of an effort to make the municipality's investment
environment more attractive, the official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide mergers and
acquisitions surged 48 percent to a record value of 1.63 trillion
U.S. dollars in 1997, according to statistics of a private U.S.
research firm.
</P>
<P>
The figure for 1996 was 1.1 trillion dollars, said New
Jersey-based Securities Data Co. in its latest report.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mergers amounted to 919 billion dollars in 1997, compared
to 626 billion dollars in 1996, thanks to its strong economy and
favorable stock market.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 saw megadeals in financial services and
telecommunications such as the 25 billion dollar merger of the
U.S. Union Bank of Switzerland and Swiss Bank Corp., and the 37
billion dollar merger of WorldCom Inc. and MCI Communications
Corp. in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Analysts see the merger growth trend, which started six years
ago, to continue as a result of on-going globalization and
technological changes when corporations want to do big strategic
transactions.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street executives suggest that 1998 could be another
strong year to see new deals in financial services and
telecommunications sectors.

<HEADLINE> Action Urged to Deal With Kurdish Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Greece today urged Schengen
Treaty member states to coordinate their action in order to tackle
the growing illegal immigration of Kurds into western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Stelios Perrakis, secretary-general of the Greek Foreign
Ministry, said in statements that the rise in the flow of illegal
immigrants to Europe, particularly to the European Union (EU)
countries, had in the last few months caused concern and mobilized
the interest of EU organs and of Schengen.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the causes of the illegal immigration to the
"aggressive Turkish military activity in northern Iraq and
Turkey's policy not to control or restrict, and even tolerate the
flow of Iraqi refugees through its territory westwards."
</P>
<P>
The general-secretary stressed that the issue could not be
dealt with through increased police measures and stricter control
of external borders, but through coordinated action by Schengen
countries.
</P>
<P>
All Schengen countries must demand of Turkey the signing of an
agreement for re-entry, he added.
</P>
<P>
As for what action Greece will take to deal with the problem,
he said that on the one hand, Greece would tackle the refugees'
applications for asylum in the framework of its obligations
arising from the 1951 Geneva Convention on the status of refugees
and from the international law, and on the other hand, Greece
would take all necessary measures to control its external borders.
</P>
<P>
Greece has been watching closely the developments and has
increased patrols by coastguard and navy vessels to check the
ships transporting illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Foreign Ministry will also decide within this month
the additional measures in accordance with the Schengen Treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain, Brazil, Gabon,
Gambia and Slovenia have become new nonpermanent members of the
Security Council of the United Nations since the first day of
January 1998, a release from the spokesman's office said today.
</P>
<P>
The five new nonpermanent members, who will serve two-year
terms, replace Chile, Egypt, Guinea-Bissau, Poland and South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The five other nonpermanent members of the Security Council,
whose two-year terms expire at the end of 1998, are Costa Rica,
Japan, Kenya, Portugal and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The five permanent members of the Security Council, each with
veto power, are China, Britain, France, Russia and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, a 15-member body with five permanent
members and 10 nonpermanent members, is the most powerful body in
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Expansion of the Security Council will be on the agenda again
in late January 1998 although member states cannot get consensus
on how many seats should be added, how many should be permanent
and how many nonpermanent, and how they should be allotted.

<HEADLINE> Big Mergers Likely to Continue in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- Big company mergers and
acquisitions will continue to be caught in newspaper headlines in
1998 after a record 1.2023 trillion U.S. dollar worth of deals
were announced the past year.
</P>
<P>
The mergers and acquisitions involving U.S. firms last year
accounted for 915 billion U.S. dollars -- up almost 50 percent on
the previous record of 626 billion U.S. dollars in 1996, according
to newspaper reports here.
</P>
<P>
The increased amount helped adjust economic structures and
production layout of the world.
</P>
<P>
Mega-mergers catching the public attention included WorldCom's
pending 41.8 billion U.S. dollar purchase of MCI and Boeing's 16.3
billion U.S. dollars acquisition of McDonnell Douglas, are set to
continue.
</P>
<P>
Big mergers and acquisitions are powered by a need for
strategic partners to compete in the global economy, according to
analysts.
</P>
<P>
Plenty of action is still to come in financial services,
telecommunications, health care, defense and utility industries.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts regarded mergers and acquisitions as a cyclical
business, which can end overnight, as it did suddenly a few years
ago.

NEW YORK, January 2 (Xinhua) -- A late rally brought stocks on
Wall Street higher in the first session of 1998, helped by some
encouraging economic news that sent interest rates to a new 4-year

Advancers outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 366.20 million shares as

As bond prices rose, the yield on the 30-year Treasury fell to
5.84 percent, the lowest point since October 1993.
