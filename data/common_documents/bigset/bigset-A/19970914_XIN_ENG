<HEADLINE> Jordan Blames Israel for Peace Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today insisted that
Israel is to blame for the stalemate on all tracks of the
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the press, Jordan's Prime Minister Abdul-Salam
Majali affirmed that it would clarify its points of view to
visiting United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Albright, on her maiden trip to the region since taking office
earlier this year, is expected to arrive here tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Majali blamed Israel for the current overall deadlock of the
peace process and said that Jordan would make it known to Albright
during her trip, which he described as "important," Radio Jordan
reported.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's position was in complete harmony with that of Egypt,
added Majali, who signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 making
Jordan the second Arab country after Egypt to conceive peace with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Israel did not live up to its promises and in effect pushed the
peace process into a serious logjam, said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
All the parties concerned with the peace process should work
for the full implementation of all signed agreements as well as
fulfillment of promises about the future of peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
They all should work in the same direction until realizing a
comprehensive and lasting peace in this part of the world, he
emphasized.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Campaign Finance Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton Saturday once again called for overhauling the laws on
political contributions.
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing what I can within the executive branch," he said in
his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
He cited concrete action on reform, such as asking the Federal
Communications Commission to require free broadcast time for
candidates and requesting the Federal Election Commission to ban
unlimited contributions to political parties by businessmen,
unions and individuals.
</P>
<P>
"But there is no substitute for strong, bipartisan campaign
finance reform legislation passed by the Congress," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
He added that while he had backed such bills every year since
he took office, efforts were blocked by filibusters in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Clinton criticized "the opponents of reform" for gearing up to
keep legislation from coming to a vote at all.
</P>
<P>
"Let's be clear -- a vote to filibuster campaign reform is a
vote to keep special interest money and kill reform. A vote to
filibuster is a vote for the status quo," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, in a brief
interview, said he might consider revamping campaign finance laws
even before the completion of hearings on political fund-raising
abuses in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Until now, Lott had said that before the full Senate considers
changing the laws, he wants to wait for the end of hearings on
fund raising by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee so that
lawmakers would know if current laws were broken.
</P>
<P>
But Lott said Friday, "I don't know if that will be essential."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, he said such a plan should include a
Republican-sought provision, which would make it harder for unions
to use members' dues for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
In recent weeks, Democrats have pressured Republican
congressional leaders to schedule votes on a bipartisan measure,
the McCain-Feingold plan that would ban so-called soft money --
unlimited funds raised for party-wide activities like voter
turnout efforts.
</P>
<P>
It would also restrict donations by political action committees
and offer free or reduced-cost television advertising time to
candidates who voluntarily limit spending.
</P>
<P>
Plans to overhaul campaign finance laws have been obstructed
for years in Congress.

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of photographs,
models and products illustrating the rapid growth of Tianjin
municipality, an old industrial and commercial center in north
China, are on display in an ongoing one-month national exhibit.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is just one of the 30-odd province-level areas
represented at the show in the Beijing Exhibition Center, themed
"A Glorious Five Years -- An Exhibition on Achievements Made in
Economic Development and Social Ethical and Cultural Progress
since the 14th CPC National Congress held in 1992."
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, Tianjin municipality has regained its
vigor as an industrial base, witnessing a double-digit increase in
the gross domestic product for five consecutive years, while
keeping its price level low among the country's 35 large and
medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the municipality has pulled 65 percent of
its state-owned enterprises out of financial difficulty and helped
700,000 laid-off workers find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Sixty of the world's 100 top trans-national companies have
invested in the Binhai New Area, a hi-tech and export-oriented
modern economic zone,
</P>
<P>
The city has demolished 3.98 million sq.m. of run-down houses,
and built 10.05 sq.m. of housing since 1994, directly benefiting
500,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tianjin has also witnessed remarkable ethical and
cultural progress over the past five years. Its Heping District
has been set as a model by the State.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the port city has successfully hosted the 43rd
World Table Tennis Championship and China's first Beijing Opera
Festival and will host the 1999 World Gymnastics Championship.

<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Under a red banner
proclaiming "Jilin People Congratulate the Opening of the 15th CPC
National Congress," hundreds of photographs, models and products
show the economic and social progress achieved in northeast
China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
The display is part of the ongoing "Glorious Five Years"
national exhibit at the Beijing Exhibition Center, which showcases
the overall development in China since the convening of the 14th
CPC Naional Congress in 1992.
</P>
<P>
According to the display, grain output in Jilin increased from
18.4 million tons in 1992 to 23.26 million tons last year, and
among the country's top ten grain production counties, six are in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Automobile production, the petrochemicals industry,
pharmaceuticals and food processing have taken leads in local
economic growth. Last year, the China No.1 Auto Group, known as
the "cradle of China's auto industry", produced 233,000 cars,
bringing its sales volume up to 21.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Jilin Oilfield continued to produce 3.5 million tons of
crude oil or more yearly for the past few years, ranking eighth
among China's on-land oil and gas fields.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure construction has been well developed in the
region, with recent completion of a power plant with a total
installed capacity of 2.4 million kilowatt and a 133-km expressway.
</P>
<P>
Minority nationalities in the province get along well with the
Han people there, and one of its autonomous prefectures has been
designated by the State Council as a model of national unity.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government encourages its artists to produce
more outstanding works for Jilin residents, and 25 works have won
national awards since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Wang Daohan on Relations With Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The part dealing with
promoting peaceful reunification of the motherland in Jiang
Zemin's report made at the on-going 15th Party Congress is
explicit and has a big leeway, Wang Daohan, president of the
Association of Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang appealed, in his report, that the two sides of the
Straits can, as the first step, hold negotiations and reach an
agreement on officially ending the state of hostility between the
two sides in accordance with the principle that there is only one
China, Wang said this afternoon at a discussion attended by
delegates from Shanghai, China's largest industrial center.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also stated that on this basis the two sides can
undertake jointly to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial
integrity and work out plans for the future growth of their
relations, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
With the return of Hong Kong to the embrace of the motherland,
Wang said, China is confronted with the reunification between the
both sides of the Taiwan Straits, which is a complicated matter
owning to the interference of foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
But Jiang Zemin clearly stated in his report that China is to
achieve the reunification of motherland by peaceful means under
the condition that Taiwan will not seek independence, Wang added.
</P>
<P>
The reunification of the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is
China's internal affair and the people living on both sides are
Chinese, Wang said. "Hence, we should sit together for
negotiations," he added.

Wang said that Jiang's second point was the Chinese Communist
Party places hopes not only on the Taiwan authorities, but also on
the various circles there. If any political party wants to send a
delegation over to exchange views, they are welcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stated that the CPC also places hopes on the people of
Taiwan. It is necessary, he said, to help them understand that the
eventual reunification will not affect adversely their interests.
Cooperation between the two sides of the Straits will noly benefit
them with even better opportunities for development, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that some compatriots there were worried whether the
mainland would move against Taiwan militarily. "We have stated
repeatedly that the military exercises held last year were not
directed at the people of Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of "Taiwan independence," he said, "we will
adopt peaceful means to realize the reunificaiton of the
motherland. We have the patience and determination, and therefore
confidence. The overwhelming majority of the nations in the world
recognize that Taiwan is part of Chian and there is only one
China. This is norms of the international order."

JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) will meet at the end of this
month in Luanda to bring Angola's peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced today by SADC executive secretary
Kaire Mbuende in Gaborone, Botswana, the Southern African
Broadcasting Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of SADC's 14 member states will discuss the conflict
between the Angolan government and the former rebel movement, the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Mbuende said lack of committment by UNITA to take part fully
in the government of national unity and failure to demobilise its
troops remain a cause of concern.
</P>
<P>
UNITA, which fought 20 years of civil war against the ruling
MPLA party, is part of the government of national unity. But its
leader, Jonas Savimbi, refused to travel to Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council threatens to impose
sanctions against UNITA, unless it complies with the 1994 peace
protocol.

<HEADLINE> EU to Invest Heavily in SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Investment
Bank (EIB), the main financing institution of the European Union,
is prepared to provide more finance to technology-related and
high-growth small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
Sir Brian Unwin, head of the bank, told an informal meeting of
the EU finance ministers today that the Amsterdam Special Action
Program, formulated after the Amsterdam Treaty was signed in June
this year, was to become a new instrument to help finance SMEs.
</P>
<P>
The SMEs to get EIB financing are those most likely to expand,
remain competitive and create new and stable jobs as defined by
Unwin.
</P>
<P>
Yet the creation or development of such companies is often
hindered through unavailability of adequate capital funds, Unwin
said.
</P>
<P>
The bank is also discussing with the European Investment Fund
(EIF) the creation of a new European Technology Facility, with
funding from bank's surplus, to provide venture capital to SMEs in
the high-tech field.
</P>
<P>
The European Technology Facility is expected to gather up to
125 million ECUs of EIB funds for small and medium-sized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Unwin described technology related and high-growth SMEs as
capable of benefiting in future from risk-sharing or subordinated
loans as well as equity and venture capitals provided by the EIB
and EIF through other sound financial intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
The EIF is another major financing arm of the 15-nation union.

<HEADLINE> PLA to Hold High Banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's
Liberation Army (PLA) will hold higher the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory, rally more closely around the Central Committee
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and actively promote the
army's building and reform, thus providing strong and powerful
guarantee for the implementation of the cross-century goals, PLA
delegates said in the panel discussion today.
</P>
<P>
The participants in the panel discussion included Zhang Zhen,
Zhang Wannian and Chi Haotian.
</P>
<P>
The report delivered by Jiang Zemin incisively points out the
noble historical responsibilities upon the Party over the destiny
of the nation, said Zhang Zhen.
</P>
<P>
The report gives a systematic exposition on the historic status
and guiding role of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and clearly puts forward
the political program, grand blueprint and strategic plan for
leading the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics into the coming century, Zhang said, adding that
it reflects the wish of the whole Party and the entire Chinese
nation, and is thus an epoch-making programmatic document of
Marxism-Leninism, he said.
</P>
<P>
That holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory serves as
the soul of the congress has shown an adamant political stand and
outstanding leadership in the third generation of the CPC
leadership with Jiang Zemin at the core, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
For a Party of 50 million-strong membership, and for a country
of 1.2 billion people and 56 nationalities, the advance of such an
unprecedented cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics would be impossible without a strong leadership,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
All officers and men in the army should consciously
safeguard the authoritativeness of leadership of the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, he said.
</P>
<P>
The whole army should, whenever and wherever, be dedicated
heart and soul to the CPC Central Committee, and be in agreement
with the CPC Central Committee ideologically, politically and in
action. The whole army will firmly subject itself to the command
of the Party Central Committee and Central Military Commission
with Jiang Zemin at the core, Zhang Zhen said.

<P>
Zhang Wannian said the current Party congress has for the first
time defined the scientific concept of Deng Xiaoping Theory and
has written it down on the banner of the Communist Party of China
(CPC).
</P>
<P>
He said it has clearly stated that Deng Xiaoping Theory is the
guiding thought of the CPC and the spiritual support of the
Chinese nation as well as the great banner and guidance for
guiding China's reforms and opening-up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
The PLA is the people's armed forces under the leadership of
the CPC, and therefore, should hold high the great banner of
Deng Xiaoping Theory, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is the most important political entrust of Deng
Xiaoping in his lifetime to firmly support the Party Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core.
</P>
<P>
Practice has proved that Jiang Zemin has been a loyal, reliable
and promising successor to the cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics initiated by Deng Xiaoping, he said. And
the CPC Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core is
a sophisticated leading collective which can handle various
complicated situations and it has been highly trusted and
respected by the whole Party, the whole army and people from
various nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called on PLA officers and men to rally more
closely around the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at
the core and obey the instructions of the Party Central
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wannian urged the PLA officers to promote army building
and its reform and attach great importance to quality building in
line with Deng Xiaoping Theory and a series of instructions by
Jiang Zemin to advance along the road of fewer but better troops
with Chinese characteristics and provide strong security guarantee
for realizing the trans-century goals.

She told a press conference that her government will allow
prawn fishing to continue right up to the end of December, and
possible into January.

Chi Haotian said that Jiang Zemin's report, centering around
speeding up the economic development, taking into consideration
the global military development trend and China's actual
conditions and military development, sets new demands on
cross-century national defense and army building.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the Party Central Committe attaches great
importance to the army building and the improvement of the
strength of national defense, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So long as we hold high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping
Theory and take Deng Xiaping's military thinking as the guiding
principle, the objective of military modernization will surely be
achieved no matter what difficulties we may face," he said.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental political system of the Chinese army is to
persist in the principle of absolute leadership of the Party over
the army, he said.
</P>
<P>
To do this, he added, it is necessary to safeguard the
authority of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the
core. This was the most important political behest of Deng
Xiaoping, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We must treasure the hard-won situation, support the Party
Central Committee and obey orders of the Party Central
Committee and the Central Military Commission," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the whole army to implement the tasks on army building
set by the 15th Party Congress, readjust the establishment of the
army units, intensify scientific research on national defense and
raise the level of weaponry while serving and being subordinated

<HEADLINE> Iraq Allows Overseas Iranians to Visit Shiite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein has issued an instruction allowing the overseas Iranians
to visit Shiite Muslim holy shrines in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi News Agency reported today that the Interior Ministry and
other concerned government organs have been instructed to lift a
ban on the entry of Iranian passport holders who live outside Iran.
</P>
<P>
The move came after Iran brushed off an Iraqi decision to, for
the first time in 17 years, allow Iranian pilgrims to pay homage
to Shiite Mulism holy shrines in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government demanded that talks be held with the
Iraqi side to prepare for the visits of Iranian citizens but
the Iraqi government rejected the request.
</P>
<P>
Shiites and Sunnis are the two major factions of Islam. Iran is
the only Shiite Muslim-dominated country in the region and the
most important Shiite shrines are in neighboring rival - Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has decided that the Iranian expatriates
can come to Iraq through the Qadesia checkpoint on the
Iraqi-Jordanian border and El-Walid checkpoint on the Iraqi-Syrian
border.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians are permitted to stay no more than seven days (six
nights that can not be renewed or extended), and required to
maintain public order and respect laws and rules during their stay.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi tourism authority and Al-Hoda Company for Religions
Tourism have provided all the necessary means to transport the
Iranian visitors coming in batches or families, according to INA.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year war from 1980-88 and are
still at odds with each other.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Sensitized to Killer Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's education, sports
and culture deputy minister Kembo Mohadi today said there is need
to raise awareness in schools and communities about the killer
cancer disease.
</P>
<P>
Addressing people gathered to commemorate the Terry Fox
nine-kilometre fun run at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare,
Mohadi said sports should be used to raise cancer awareness
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"Physical education, sport and recreation provide meaningful
stimulating experience that enhances self-esteem of youths and
also provides them with opportunities to develop attitudes and
values, knowledge and physical skills which help to take care of
themselves and others in need of caring in the communities," said
Mohadi.
</P>
<P>
Harare Hospital superintendent Mohamed Ali, representing
health and child welfare minister Timothy Stamps said cancer
could be prevented if detected early.
</P>
<P>
He said a third of the cancer patients diagnosed in Zimbabwe
could prevent the disease with a change in lifestyle, such as
eating habits, drinking, smoking including sleeping.
</P>
<P>
Ali said another third of the cancer patients disgonised with
proper therapy could somehow be cured while another third
diagonised late could not be saved.
</P>
<P>
"We hope and encourage young people to follow lifestyle and
habits that prevent cancer," he said.
</P>
<P>
A young unfortunate cancer victim, Terry Fox started the race
in Canada. He lost a leg to cancer and had a dream that he would
raise from every Canadian a dollar by running on one leg.
</P>
<P>
Fox started in 1980 and managed to run about 26 miles per day
for 143 days before dying of cancer, now the event is a worldwide
event to raise awareness about cancer and funds for research and
the cancer society.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases American Jailed for Illegal Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Iran today released a black
American citizen who was arrested in April 1996 on charge of
illegal entry to the country.
</P>
<P>
This was announced was made by the Iranian Judiciary, which
said the freed U.S. citizen, Joseph Morris, was serving a sentence
of two years in prison for illegally entering Iran from Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"He would soon be deported from the country," said the
Judiciary's public relations office.
</P>
<P>
However, a source who had contact with Morris said the American
has been in detention in an Iranian prison for 16 months, instead
of eight months as the Iranian judicial authorities had claimed.
</P>
<P>
The source said on condition of anonymity that Morris, 38, has
been in detention since April 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that the American, who hails from New Orleans,
Louisiana, lied about his position in the U.S. army reserves when
he took part in U.S.-led operation Desert Storm to drive Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's forces out of Kuwait in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Morris told the Iranian authorities that he was an officer in
the army reserve whereas he was only a private first class and a
desk jockey, not a foot soldier," the source said.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Blames Kabila for Blocking UN Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A rival opposition has
accused President Laurent Kabila of Democratic Republic of Congo
of preventing a United Nations task team investigating human
rights atrocities in his country.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Union for Democracy and Social Progress, Mutombo
Kabundji, said in a statement issued here today that the UN team
was still bogged down in Kinshasa because the government "refused
to allow it to start its mission".
</P>
<P>
Kabundji said major compromises had been made to accommodate
Kabila's complaints following the appointment of the team.
</P>
<P>
It said one of the region's top experts had been dropped from
the team and the UN had acceded to Kabila's demand to extend the
inquiry beyond 1996.
</P>
<P>
This means the team cannot concentrate only on atrocities
which occurred in the latest seven-month war that left thousands
dead and millions displaced, claimed Kabundji.
</P>
<P>
He said he was convinced that Kabila's latest demands were
"clear signs that they are determined to block the UN inquiry
commission from getting the facts".
</P>
<P>
He called on South Africa to press Congo (K) into cooperation
fully with the UN team.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Zambia said here today that
it will not privatize at least in the near future the state-owned
Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Ronald Penza told a television program that
the government's immediate concern is making ZNBC more efficient.
</P>
<P>
What matters to the government is whether or not the
broadcasting corporation is achieving the goals for which it was
established, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the government's concern is to ensure that the
corporation, which also includes the television, informs,
educates and entertains the Zambians.
</P>
<P>
Penza said that governments even in liberal democracies own
media organizations to achieve non-commercial goals such as
public information and education.
</P>
<P>
From the remarks, it is clear that the Zambian government
intends ZNBC to provide a social service rather a commercial one.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Youths Urged to be Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Health and Child Welfare
Minister Timothy Stamps said Zimbabwean youths deserve special
attention in order to prepare them to be responsible future
leaders and parents.
</P>
<P>
Officially launching a six-month youth responsibility campaign
project in Mutare, east Zimbabwe Saturday, Stamps said young
people faced many challenges in their lives, forcing them into
alcohol abuse and early sexual activities.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of youth responsibility pilot projects was also
launched in two provinces. The projects seek to promote
responsible behavior among the youth in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
For the next six months, trained youth peer groups will be
visiting schools and youth centers to promote the concept of
behaving responsibly in order to fight HIV and sexually
transmitted infections.
</P>
<P>
Stamps said half of the young men aged 15 to 24 and a quarter
of the girls in the same age group were sexually active, exposing
themselves to the dangers of sexually transmitted infections and
unplanned pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
In the past 12 months, 408 children under the age of 14 were
treated for sexually transmitted diseases in Mutare while 172
youths were arrested for various criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
Executive director of Zimbabwe National Family Planning
Council Alex Zinanga said youths were the hope for the future and
they needed to be moulded.

<HEADLINE> PLC Supports Renewing Security Coop With Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) promised in Ramallah today to renew security
cooperation with Israel, Israeli Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Following U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit,
the PLC met in Ramallah today and discussed in detail about the
future security cooperation with Israel, the Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The PLC has expressed its support to security cooperation with
Israel, but at the same time said that it will accept neither
terrorism nor Israeli dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
During her three-day visit to Israel and Palestine which
concluded Friday, Albright stressed on several occasions the
importance of renewing security cooperation between Israel and
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), saying it is vital for
moving the Middle East peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
PNA and Israel have different explanations on security
cooperation. The Israeli side put much stress on PNA's fighting
against terrorism, while PNA asked Israel to implement the Oslo
accords and to discuss and solve practical issues between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat, during his talks with Albright in
Ramallah, promised to take strict actions against terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright arrived in Saudi Red Sea coastal city of Jeddah
today on the fifth leg of her Middle East tour aimed at reviving
the dying peace process.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency (Kuna) reported from Jeddah that Albright
would hold talks later with Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz on the
peace process and regional and international issues.
</P>
<P>
She would also meet with foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states who postponed their scheduled
meeting in Saudi Arabia by one day to talks with Albright in the
southern Saudi town of Abha.
</P>
<P>
Albright is expected to brief the Saudi leadership on the
outcome of her visit to Israel, Palestine, Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Cairo, Albright renewed a call to the Israelis and
Palestinians to live up to their commitments regarding the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Kuna said that the Saudi leaders would voice deep concern to
the secretary over the adverse developments in the process due to
Israel's obstinate stances and diversion from peace spirit and
signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albright's discussions with the GCC foreign
ministers are believed to focus on limiting the threatened boycott
of the fourth Middle East and North African economic summit
scheduled for mid-November in Doha, Qatar, which Israel will be
invited to attend.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, Bahrain,
Qatar, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Syria and Lebanon have already
announced to boycott the summit if Israel participates. Most of
the other Arab countries adopt a wait-and-see stance and stand by
an Arab League foreign ministers' meeting in Cairo on September
20-21.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Price Under Downward Pressure: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) - In spite of a record level of
physical demand, the gold price remained under constant downward
pressure through most of the first half of 1997, according to a
report released today by Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The London-based research company said this was due to an
equally dramatic increase in supply emanating from central bank
sales, producer hedging and short selling from funds and other
speculators, chiefly in North America.
</P>
<P>
All the major components of physical demand rose strongly
year-on-year in the first half, with both jewellery and
electronics fabrication reaching new record levels.
</P>
<P>
World jewellery fabrication rose year-on-year by 16% to 1,592
tons in the first half of 1997, comfortably exceeding the
previous first half record of 1,397 tons set in 1995. Total
fabrication also rose to a new record level of 1,857 tons.
</P>
<P>
This was accompanied by a robust recovery in bar hoarding to
167 tons, although some way behind the recent high of 172 tons set
in the first half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
On the supply side, the report said, in spite of the 12%
year-on year decline in the average dollar gold price in the
first half, mine production continued to increase, though by a
marginal 1.4%.

<HEADLINE> EU to Announce Euro Rate Next May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONDORF LES BAINS, Luxembourg, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The
European Union is to announce the rate between the euro and the
currencies of the participating countries next May, it was
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with European Commission President
Jacques Santer, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker,
whose country is serving the rotating presidency of the 15-nation
union, said the announcement will be made on the very day when the
list of the first batch of EU countries are chosen to join the
single currency.
</P>
<P>
EU's executive agency, the European Commission, is to sort out
the countries eligible to join the euro.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the announcement was believed to help prevent
speculative activities in the run-up to January 1, 1999, when the
euro is to be launched officially.
</P>
<P>
The press conference came after the end of an informal meeting
of EU finance ministers who discussed matters related to forging a
global approach toward a common taxation policy and taking
concrete measures to curtail harmful tax competition in the single
market.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at a Luxembourg town bordering France, was
presided over by Luxembourg which has made taxation one of its
main priorities during its six-month tenure of EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The finance ministers last met in April 1996 at Verona, Italy,
and a consensus has since emerged on the key challenges to EU's
taxation policies.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Talks on a treaty between
Moscow and the breakaway republic of Chechnya began today in
Dagomys, just outside Sochi on the Black Sea coast, according to
the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian security chief Ivan Rybkin during the talks once again
demanded that Chechnya correct the statement issued by
Vice-President Vakha Arsanov against Russian leadership before the
beginning of the talks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "whenever a high official in Moscow permits
himself a roughly-worded statement on Chechnya, he is immediately
corrected by the President of Russia. Judging from all
appearances, there is no one in Chechnya to correct Vice-President
Vakha Arsanov."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the transit of early Caspian oil via Chechen
territory, Rubkin said this question had been fully solved.
</P>
<P>
The talks were attended, on the Moscow side, by Security Council
secretary Ivan Rybkin, Vice-Premier of the Russian Federation
Ramazan Abdulatipov, State Duma leader Alexander Shokhin, Minister
for the Affairs of Nationalities and Federative Relations
Vyacheslav Mikhailov.

Chechnya was represented by First Vice-Premiers Movladi Udugov

The negotiating parties will set forth their respective

According to the press office of the Russian Security Council,
special attention of the talks will be given to human and civil
rights and freedoms and to interaction between the law-enforcement

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Albright's Visit to Damascus Makes No </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Syrian
President Hafez Al-Assad and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright here last night failed to make any substantial progress
except a verbal agreement on continuing contacts.
</P>
<P>
Soon after their talks, a spokesman for the Syrian presidency
said the two sides agreed on the continuation of contacts with a
view to establish peace between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit to Syria was part of her shuttle diplomacy in
the Middle East in an attempt to revive the dying peace process.
She was scheduled to visit Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
areas, Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, Al-Assad and Albright reviewed the efforts
to resume peace negotiations on all tracks and positions of the
concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Al-Assad reiterated his country's keenness on establishing a
just and comprehensive peace in the region on the basis of the
Madrid peace conference, the relevant U.N. Security Council
resolutions and the land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
He underlined the necessity of resuming the talks from where
they were left off and without pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Albright was briefed on the Syrian viewpoints on the peace
process and the extent of Syria's readiness for peace. However,
she did not bring Syria any new proposals from Israel to
facilitate a resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright's talks with the Syrian side failed, according to
diplomatic sources, to make a substantial progress on the Syrian
and Lebanese tracks.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the U.S. secretary of state focused on security for
Israel and refrained from putting pressures on Israel, leaving the
substantial and delicate issues in the Arab-Israeli conflict
intact.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent Israeli government insists on the precedence of
Israeli security over peace and rejects withdrawal of its troops
from the Syrian Golan Heights it occupied since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Syria urged Netanyahu's government to to comply with the
land-for-peace principle, implement its pledge to pull out its
troops from the Golan, and resume the talks from the point they
had reached at.
</P>
<P>
Albright's visit came as Syria and Israel trumpeted up media
threats as well as military buildup.
</P>
<P>
Accusing Syria of preparing for launching a chemical warfare,
Israel is massing up troops and conducting war games on the Golan
and escalating military confrontation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Unless the U.S. exerts pressure on Israel - its strategic ally
- and change its own unbalanced attitude, it seems impossible for
peace talks to resume and tensions in the region to defuse.

<HEADLINE> OAU Pays Tribute to ECOWAS Liberian Peace Effort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 13 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) today paid tribute to west African
countries for the efforts in resolving the conflict in Liberia,
thus contributing to the sub-regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to say that ECOWAS (The Economic Community of West
African States) and ECOMOG (peace-keeping force of ECOWAS) have
been perfect in the situation of Liberia," said OAU
Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim, quoted by the Nigerian
television authority.
</P>
<P>
Although mistakes were made, the ECOWAS member countries were
sincerely working for peace in Liberia when they sent the
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG to that country seven years
ago, according to Salim.
</P>
<P>
"The truth is that this was a very genuine attempt to resolve
an internal conflict without any particular benefit to the
Nigerians, Ghanaians, etc," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no perceived national interest. There is the
perceived continental interest," he said, adding that this
indicated that "Africa is prepared to attempt to solve some
problems."
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS countries have been working closely in the attempt to
restore peace in Liberia. ECOMOG has successfully disarmed and
demobilized the warring factions, and ensured environment
favorable to the elections in July which led to the establishment
of a new government in that war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
At present ECOMOG is also involved in the sub-regional effort
to resolve the crisis in Sierra Leone, where the legitimate
government was ousted in a coup four months ago.
</P>
<P>
OAU has aired its support to the ECOWAS efforts. Observers
noted that Salim's remarks may serve as encouragement to ECOWAS'
embargo on Sierra Leone, which has been enforced as a means to
force the junta out of power.
</P>
<P>
The junta in power has claimed that the embargo is an
intervention into the country's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
However, B.A.T. Balewa, special envoy of Nigeria's head of
state general Sani Abacha, has described the ECOWAS success in
Liberia as providing a model and justification for regional
intervention in political crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It shows the feasibility of regional mechanisms in conflict
management and resolution" by applying the sub-region's own
resources, he said, quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Delegates Endorse Party's Basic Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Deng Xiaoping Theory is the
guarantee to improve reform, development and stability in areas
inhabited by ethnic minorities, delegates of the Tibetan
nationality said here today.
</P>
<P>
The 22 delegates from the Tibet Autonomous Region, in southwest
China, shared the view that the principle of paying equal
importance to cultural and ethical progress and material progress
put forward by Deng Xiaoping is a guideline in their work.
</P>
<P>
"It is impossible to have an all-round development in the
region if it is unstable," a delegate said.
</P>
<P>
The delegates agreed that the region should wage a resolute
struggle against splittist activities by the Dalai Lama and
safeguard the sovereignty and reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the regional people's congress standing
committee, said the Party Central Committee has long been
attaching great importance to development in areas inhabited by
ethnic minorities and worked out a series of principles and
policies for development in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Thus far, Tibet has enjoyed unity between the army and the
people, rapid economic growth, brisk market and improved living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the regional people's government,
said, "We should stick to the Party's basic line, take economic
development as the central task and develop the productive forces
in the entire primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Though Tibet has scored great achievements since the economic
reform started in 1978, there is still a big gap in the
development between Tibet and other parts of China.
</P>
<P>
"It is more important for us to persist in the Party's basic
line in Tibet," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lobang Toinzaub, the regional Party committee secretary, said
all the achievements made in the region, which has entered
socialism from a feudal serfdom, are the result of the guiding
ideology of seeking truth from facts set by Deng Xiaoping, central
government's policies for Tibetan development and support from the
people of all nationalities in China.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Call for More Follow-up Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today
praised U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's visit to the
Middle East and called for more follow-up efforts to put the peace
process back on track.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said to this
effect at a joint news conference with Albright in Saudi mountain
resort of Abha near the Yemen border, according to reports from
Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the news conference, Albright met with foreign
ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states, who
postponed their conference in Abha for a day in order to talk with
the U.S. secretary of state. GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
Al-Faisal said Albright's visit constituted a good opportunity
to discuss the current difficulties concerning the peace process,
to reiterate keenness on cooperation and the joint will to end the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit came at a critical stage as Israel repeatedly
obstructed the peace process through its hardline policy and
"flagrant violations" of the principles of the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Albright's support of the "land for peace"
principle and the United Nations Security Council resolutions 242
and 338, in addition of her criticism of Tel Aviv's "unilateral
measures" such as the construction of a new Jewish settlement in
East Jerusalem which sparked off the current crisis and series of
violence.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed hope that more concrete measures will be
taken to press the right-wing Israeli government to come back on
the track of the "land for peace" formula.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Albright said she agreed with her GCC
counterparts on confidence-building steps in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
She said the GCC foreign ministers encouraged her to continue
her efforts to end the current deadlock in the talks between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
During her talks with the GCC ministers, Albright briefed them
on the outcome of her tour of Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
areas, Syria and Egypt in a bid to revive the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright reiterated that "the Palestinian (National) Authority
must do everything within its power to prevent and punish
terrorism and to deepen the irrevocable commitment it made at Oslo
to treat Israel not as adversary but as partners in peace."
</P>
<P>
She also said "Israeli leaders must refrain from unilateral
actions that undermine Palestinian confidence in their intentions
and should bear in mind that no nation has a greater stake than
Israel in helping Palestinians to prosper."
</P>
<P>
She said that the U.S. will continue to meet the
responsibility to support peace in the region "by supporting a
comprehensive peace consistent with the principles outlined in
U.N. Security Council resolutions 242 and 338, including the
land-for-peace" formula.
</P>
<P>
She called on Arab states to do their utmost to ensure that no
assistance of any kind reaches the extremists such as Hamas.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi foreign minister categorically denied at the press
conference that GCC states were extending support to the Islamic
Resistance Movement Hamas.
</P>
<P>
He saided that assistance was extended instead to the
Palestinian National Authority.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Highlights His Visit to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu said here today that China is a closed strategic
partner of Romania and such relations will be continued in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the Romanian national TV this evening about his
September 8-12 visit to China, Constantinescu said China, with
rapid economic development, will become the biggest economic
center in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said after his visit, the political and economic cooperation
between the two countries had been further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
As a European country, the realization of the European
integration will be Romania's first objective of its foreign
policy and the development of its relations with the Asia-Pacific
countries, especially with China, will be its second one, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's opening-up policy has provided great opportunities for
Romanian entrepreneurs to enter the Chinese market, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the president said the Romanian entrepreneurs will
have to make efforts to improve the quality of their products and
to lower the prices.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China had gave him a deep impression,
adding that after his visit to Hong Kong, "I can say the "one
country, two systems" principle works properly in Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
The five-day visit to China ended with the signing of a joint
communique calling for further developing bilateral relations in
all fields.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Peaceful Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- One of the important parts
for holding high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory is to
promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland under the
great concept of "one country, two systems", Qian Qichen,
vice-premier and foreign minister, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Qian, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Party Congress,
made the remark in the panel discussion of the delegation from the
northeast China province of Jilin.
</P>
<P>
He said: "One country, two systems" has reflected the matter of
principle of China to accomplish the reunification of the
motherland and safeguard China's sovereignty while taking into
account the historical and current situations of Taiwan, Hong Kong
and Macao. It constitutes a basic principle in promoting peaceful
reunification of the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
"One country, two systems" not only is a theory but a theory in
practice with Hong Kong's return to the motherland becoming a
hallmark of a great success of the concept. It will be another
grand occasion when Macao returns to the motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Qian said Jiang Zemin renewed his solemn appeal in his report
to the congress that the two sides of the Straits can hold
negotiations and reach an agreement on "officially ending the
state of hostility between the two sides in accordance with the
principle that there is only one China."
</P>
<P>
"On the premise that there is only on China, we are prepared to
talk about any matter. All opinions and proposals can be put
forward as long as they are in the interests of the reunification.
The question of the reunification of the motherland should be
solved by us Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan Straits," Qian
Qichen quoted Jiang Zemin as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined and confident and we can realize the
peaceful reunification of the motherland," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ministers on Reform of State Sector of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China has entered a critical
and final stage in the reform of state firms although the state
sector produced 2.2 percent more losses in the first half of this
year, said Wang Zhongyu, minister in charge of the State Economic
and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference this afternoon held for the
on-going 15th Party congress, Wang said the reason why many
state-owned enterprises are running in the red is that these
enterprises have lagged behind in operational ideas and many of
them are over-staffed and debt-ridden.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, about one third of China's schools
and hospitals are run by state firms, which means that the state
firms have to take care of their workers and their offsprings in
food, shelter and social services.
</P>
<P>
Wang made the above remarks with Chen Jinhua, minister in
charge of the State Planning Commission, and Zhang Haoruo,
vice-minister of the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economic Systems.
</P>
<P>
Wang said economic restructuring will benefit state-owned
enterprises in the long run but causes difficulties for them at
present for it takes time for these enterprises to adjust
themselves for the new changes.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economic conditions, he said, enterprises can
sell their products and make profits if they have production
capacities. However, the situation has changed with the
transformation from the sellers' market to the buyers' market.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the internationalization of China's domestic market
with the influx of foreign investment and import products has
fueled market competition in China.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the difficult situation for the state firms is the
result of accumulation of difficulties in the traditional economic
structure. And reform has made these problems more conspicuous.
</P>
<P>
China aims to introduce the mechanism described as "the
survival of the fittest" by establishing the socialist market
economy. Even if the modern enterprise system has been established
in China, there still exist debt-ridden state enterprises, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Expels 2 Indian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Just one day before the
start of a new round foreign secretary level talks between
Pakistan and India, Pakistan has asked two Indian diplomats to
leave the country by Wednesday, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan government has declared the two officials with
Indian High Commission, identified as J.S. Bisid and V. Gobalan,
here as "persona non grata", accusing that they have done
activities incompatible for their status, the official souses
said.
</P>
<P>
India last night expelled two staffers with the Pakistan High
Commission in New Delhi on charges of spying.
</P>
<P>
The trade of expulsions of diplomats between Pakistan and India
took place just days before the commencement of a critical new
round bilateral talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has agreed to attend the third round of the
Pakistan-Indian foreign secretary level talks scheduled for
September 15 to 18 in New Delhi, a Foreign Office spokesman
announced on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary level talks
in March after a suspense of more than three years amidst signs of
improved relations between the two arch rivals in South Asia. The
Pakistan-Indian foreign secretary level talks have broken down in
1994 due to their serious differences over Jammu and Kashmir
disputes.
</P>
<P>
During last round of such talks held here in June, the two
sides have agreed to set up eight working groups to solve all the
outstanding issues including Kashmir and peace and security
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since their independence in 1947, Pakistan and India have
fought three wars, two of which were over the Kashmir issue.

A statement by the GCC General Secretariat said Albright's

<HEADLINE> Polls Say Most Britons Back Changes to Monarchy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth's popularity
was believed to be at the lowest in her 45-year old reign as two
recent opinion polls found that most of the pollees support
changes to the British monarchy.
</P>
<P>
The royals have already suffered a dramatic drop in popularity
following the death of Princess Diana in a car crash in Paris two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
A poll for the Sunday Times conducted this week found more than
53 percent of the pollees want the queen to step down within the
next three years. The queen will be 75 in 2000.
</P>
<P>
The survey of 1073 people said today almost three in four
people (more than 70 percent) believe the queen is remote and out
of touch.
</P>
<P>
More than half of Labor MPs who responded to the survey want
the monarchy to be more open and accountable.
</P>
<P>
Another poll for the Observer suggests that 74 percent think
the monarchy should be modernized and should be more informal.
</P>
<P>
The royals came under attack from the media and the public in
the days following Diana's death. The queen in particular was
accused of aloofness for declining to appear in public and share

<TEXT>
<P>
Ni Zhenliang, secretary of Doudian Village Party Committee in
rural Beijing, said that the reason why they suffered in
developing the rural economy in the past few years was they
deviated from the actual conditions in rural China.
</P>
<P>
"The reason behind the success in rural economic restructuring
was the correct understanding of the primary stage of socialism
and our concentrated efforts to emancipate and develop productive
forces," he added.
</P>
<P>
Li Wenhai, president of People's University of China, said:
"Only by having a better understanding of national conditions and
grasping the basic features of the primary stage of socialism, can
we work out the correct principles and policies guiding economic
development and social progress."
</P>
<P>
Referring to some people saying that a century is too long for
the primary stage of socialism, Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of
the State Commission for Economic Restructuring, said, "we would
rather keep it longer. Otherwise, we would commit the mistake of
hastiness."
</P>
<P>
Lu Gongxun, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Shanxi
Provincial People's Congress, said one of the root causes for the
mistakes committed in building socialism prior to the Third
Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee in the late 1978
resulted in the fact that the policies we had made leaped over the
primary stage of socialism.
</P>
<P>
Wan Fumin, secretary of Haicheng City Party Committee in
Liaoning, said that different contradictions exist in China's
economy, politics, culture, social activities and other areas in
the primary stage of socialism. But the principal contradiction is
the one between the growing material and cultural needs of the
people and the backwardness of production.
</P>
<P>
This principal contradiction will remain throughout the primary
stage of socialism in China and in all aspects of social life.

<HEADLINE> Exposition on Primary Stage of Socialism Clears Up Misgivings (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the ongoing 15th
National Party Congress shared the same view that stressing the
primary stage of socialism provides a guarantee for China's reform
and opening-up has laid a foundation for solving various
contraditions and clearing up misgivings.
</P>
<P>
Xie Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the
Communist Party of China, said that "the birth of Deng Xiaoping
Theory was the fruit of emancipating the mind and seeking thuth
from facts."
</P>
<P>
"We should solve problems facing us from the actual conditions
which boil down that we are still in the primary stage of
socialism," he said, adding that "if we fail to do so, it would be
difficult for us crack the hard nuts in restructuring, such as
readjusting the structure of the ownership."
</P>
<P>
The diversified form of public ownership and the combination of
the distribution principle "to each according to one's work and
the basic means of production are also the result of emancipating
the mind and seeking truth from facts, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wan Yongxiang, Chinese ambassador to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, said the nine-feature exposition of the primary
stage of socialism in Jing Zemin's report to the five-yearly
congress illustrated the principle of seeking truth from facts.
</P>
<P>
Shi Dazhen, minister of Power Industry, said the report gives a
full account of the theory of the primary stage of socialism.
"Guided by the theory, we can avoid setbacks in reforms and
opening-up and big ups-and-downs in economic development," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaofeng, deputy secretary of the Hainan Provincial
Committee, said the theory on the primary stage of socialism, put
forward since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central
Committee, "is scientific and accords with the actual conditions
of China and the development of the history of the mankind."
</P>
<P>
This is because the productive forces should be developed stage
by stage, and the primary stage of socialism could not be leaped
over, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji Calls for Correct Understanding of Jiang's Report (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Zhu Rongji has described the
report delivered by Jiang Zemin at the opening session of the
15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) as
"epoch-making."
</P>
<P>
The report holds high the banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and
achieves progress in some respects, said Zhu in a panel discussion
with delegates from Shaanxi province on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the report has summarized the experience
accumulated in reforms and development over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed his sincere support to the report.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the issue of ownership, Zhu thought that the report
offers a distinct answer in this regard.
</P>
<P>
The report has upheld the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism
and solved new problems in the historical process, Zhu said. "This
is of great significance for creating a new situation in the cause
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for objective analysis of the fact that proportion
of the non-public sector to the national economy is increasing.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the public sector includes not only the state-
and collectively-owned sectors, but also the state- and
collectively-owned elements in the sector of mixed ownership.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also pointed out that there are state and
collectively-owned shares in all the joint ventures across the
country.

<P>
"To revitalize the state enterprises," Zhu said,"we still have
to stick to the principle of managing well large enterprises while
adopting a flexible policy toward small ones."
</P>
<P>
"If these 1,000 enterprises have good performance, the whole
country will promise high hopes of success," he said.
</P>
<P>
There are many ways to deal with small enterprises, one of
which is to introduce joint stock partnership, Zhu said. he also
called for support for the partnership.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever partnership is introduced, labor cooperation or
capital cooperation, once the small enterprises cooperate with one
another, they will be enlivened," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zhu said that support and correct guidance should be
given to joint stock partnership. He also cautioned people against
"rushing headlong into mass action," saying that the partnership
cannot be implemented through administrative orders or by forcing
workers to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that shareholding system is not a compulsory way in
state enterprises, nor is joint stock partnership the only way for
small enterprises. "I always have said shareholding is not a
panacea," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu called for correct and comprehensive understanding and
implementation of the report, which he described as "an integral
whole."
</P>
<P>
The urgent task for the national economy at present is to
accelerate the reform of state-owned enterprises, he said.

<P>
At present, Zhu said, joint ventures constitute the overwhelming
majority of the foreign-funded enterprises, while the number of
wholly foreign-funded enterprises is very small.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the state and collective have held the
controlling share in quite a number of joint ventures. Hence,
public ownership has retained its dominant position, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that enterprises like these obviously have the
characteristics of public ownership, and are favorable to
expanding the area of control by public capital.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises in this category cannot be considered completely
non-public enterprises," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The dominant role of the state sector of the economy is mainly
manifested in its controlling power," said Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Now that the state-owned sector still holds a firm grasp of
the economic lifelines of the country, Zhu said, and hence there
is no risk to develop the non-public sector.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why China should develop diverse forms ownership side
by side, Zhu said that China is currently in the primary stage of
socialism.
</P>
<P>
"Developing the non-public sector according to the principle of
'three favorables' brings about only benefits," he said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of profit and tax handed over by the 1,000
state-owned large-and-medium enterprises, which enjoyed
priority support from the government, currently take up 85
percent of total of the country, Zhu said, adding that this also
shows the dominant position of the state enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- About 150,000 public sector
workers in Israel staged partial strikes today following an
Israeli Trade Union decision to protest against the government
economic policy.
</P>
<P>
The strike paralyzed services provided by hospitals, courts,
Israeli Electric Company, National Insurance Institute and other
bodies for two hours.
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 workers in the Agriculture Ministry did not receive
the public, answer phone calls or process mail, nor did they issue
import or export permits or administer vaccinations to animals.
</P>
<P>
Stoppages by 30,000 workers of Clait Hospital caused
disruptions in clinics and administrative offices. And the
country's 1,250 firefighters handled only emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The union leaders met today to discuss spreading the
disruptions to other sectors of the economy throughout the public
sector. Negotiations between government workers and the Finance
Ministry on salaries, working conditions, pensions, and government
privatization plans have broken down.
</P>
<P>
The trade union is objecting to various elements of government
policy, including the proposed 2.3 billion shekel (about 657
million U.S. dollars) state budget cut for 1998, plans to
privatize many government companies and what it sees as ongoing
attacks on worker's rights throughout the public sector.

<HEADLINE> PNA Minister Unsure About Outcome of Albright's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 14 (Xinhua) - A senior Palestinian official
said here today that it was still early to say whether
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's trip to the region
was successful or not.
</P>
<P>
The outcome of her visit depended on what conclusion Albright
would submit to U.S. President Clinton, visiting Minister of
Local Government of Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Saeb
Erekat told reporters after briefing Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali and Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh on the
recent talks between Palestinian leadership and Albright.
</P>
<P>
It was premature to jump into conclusion about the outcome of
Albright's maiden trip to the region, Erekat said before the
U.S. secretary of state's scheduled visit to Amman this evening.
</P>
<P>
Amman is the last leg of her current trip which has already
taken her to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule areas, Syria, Egypt
and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister added, it would take more than one
visit by Albright to repair the damages inflicted on the peace
process by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinians and the U.S. could work together to
lay the foundation or mechanism to ensure the full implementation
of all the signed agreements between the Palestinians and Israel,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians cherished the U.S.'s efforts to help resume
the peace process, especially as the Middle East as a whole now
stood at a juncture, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He made the comments amid signs that the parties concerned
believed that Albright has failed to achieve her expectations to
revive the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Erekat arrived here this morning to convey a message to King
Hussein of Jordan from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat as part
of the ongoing coordination between the Palestinians and the
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state launched her trip to the Middle
East Wednesday in coincidence with the 4th anniversary of the
signing of the Oslo peace accords on September 13, 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to agreements between Israel and the Palestinians,
Israel should evacuate most areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip
at the beginning of this month, but Israel has not lived up to its
promises yet.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations have been stalled
since Israel started to build a controversial Jewish settlement in
Arab East Jerusalem in March.

<HEADLINE> Bahraini PM on Genuine Peace in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Bahraini Prime Minister Sheikh
Khalifa Ben Salman said a genuine peace in the Middle East should
be based on balance of power and restoration of legitimate rights
of all.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview published by Egyptian newspaper
"Al-Ahram" today, the prime minister pointed out that it is
impossible to achieve peace by putting pressure on one party in
favor of the other.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be optimistic about the future of the Middle East
peace process with regard to the existing volatile atmosphere and
the refusal by head of the Israeli government to honor his
obligations in accordance with the peace agreements concluded,"
Sheikh Khalifa Ben Salman said.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening at present is contrary to all the agreements
the Palestinians and Israelis have come to," he said. "Those
constant pressures exerted by the Israelis on both the Palestinian
National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian
people would not serve the peace process so much as they would
cause the situation to explode."
</P>
<P>
Stressing the importance of inter-Arab cooperation, Sheikh
Khalifa Ben Salman said that genuine Arab solidarity originates
from serious economic cooperation intended to achieve prosperity
for the Arab people.
</P>
<P>
He called on Arab states to scrap customs barriers between
them and to change their economic systems so as to make it
possible for an Arab common market to come into being.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Khalifa Ben Salman is due to visit Egypt heading a
high-ranking delegation on September 16.

<P>
TAIYUAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Three Chinese provinces in
the Yellow River Valley, the birthplace of the nation's culture
some 5,000 years ago, have joined in carrying out a series of
cultural promotion projects in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi and Shanxi Province in northwest China, and Henan
Province in central China are home to thousands of historical
relics and each has a long history of culture and art.
</P>
<P>
As part of an effort to enhance the development of cultural
resources and further promote tourism, the three provincial
governments have introduce training programs for local cultural
officials and tour guides who will help tourists from across the
world gain greater insight into Chinese history and tradition.
</P>
<P>
The provincial governments have sponsored a number of
historical relics exhibitions with a variety of themes, including
"Women of the Tang Dynasty (618-907)"; "Collection of Ancient Jade
Ware"; "Bronze Article Display"; and "Reproductions Fair", which
featured 500 varieties of historical relic replica.
</P>
<P>
The provincial tourism bureaus have jointly developed 10
special tourism programs which focus on cultural sites and
historical relics. Five tour itineraries have been selected during
an international trade fair for central and west China.
</P>
<P>
In addition, archeologists in the provinces have conducted
extensive historical research projects and published numerous
academic papers on cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Continuing Violence Hits Kenya's Coast Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The continuing violence in
the coast region of Kenya during the past one month has dealt a
serious blow to the country's tourism sector with massive
cancellations and no new hotel bookings recorded.
</P>
<P>
Today's Sunday Nation said that hotel bookings in the coast
region had dropped by over 50 percent following the recent
violent actions in the tourists' resort of Mombasa and its
environs.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chairman of the Mombasa and Coast Tourist
Association Najib Balala as saying on Friday that there were no
new bookings for the coming season.
</P>
<P>
A hotelier at the north coast of Mombasa said that since the
violence starting with an attack on police stations at Likoni
area on August 13, the tourism sector had suffered a loss of
about 10 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figure is set to increase owing to the continuing
insecurity in the region which had led to a death toll of over 60
in the past one month, he added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Somak Tours Ltd. said that a travel firm with
which they had signed a contract to bring in 300 tourists per
week from Hungary had canceled their bookings.
</P>
<P>
Joash Olum, Managing Director of Somak Tours, noted that "This
is the saddest moment in the tourism sector since independence
and we fear unless the violence is curbed, the tourism sector
will collapse."
</P>
<P>
If more tourists cancel their bookings, while at same time no
new bookings are recorded, all the key players in the tourism
industry would be forced to close down, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Tourism and Wildlife Protas Momanyi is on
a tourism campaign trip to the United Kingdom to reassure British
tourists that Kenya is a safe destination for holiday makers.
</P>
<P>
The minister's promotion campaign in Britain is aimed at
preventing further decline in tourist arrivals following the
recent violence in coast region.
</P>
<P>
Tourism industry is the number one foreign exchange earner for
the east African country which received 770,000 tourists with an
earning of 480 million Dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> China to Host Musical Instrument Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Changsha, capital of central
China's Hunan Province, will host a December exhibition of
traditional Chinese musical instruments dating back some 3,000
years to Shang and Yin Dynasties.
</P>
<P>
The 76 instruments on display will include inverted bronze
bells, small cymbals, and a series of ceremonial musical
paraphernalia, according to Tan Weisi, an archeologist with the
provincial museum.
</P>
<P>
"Archeologists in the province have unearthed numerous ancient
musical instruments in recent years," said Tan. He pointed out
that nine bronze cymbals unearthed in 1993 dated the nation's
history of musical performance to some 3,000 years ago, or 1,000
years earlier than previous records.
</P>
<P>
Experts have engaged in extensive scientific research on relics
discovered in Hunan, said Tan, adding that related studies have
verified that musical instruments played an important role in
ancient Chinese culture and art history.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will feature performances of ancient music by 10
Chinese artists using replicas of ancient musical instruments.

<HEADLINE> Armed forces Cut Wins Support from China's Diplomats (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Jiang Zemin's announcement of
reducing the Chinese armed forces by 500,000 in the next three
years has won universal support from China's diplomat-delegates
and military officers attending the current five-yearly Party
Congress.
</P>
<P>
They held that the decision was made on the basis of the
changes in international situation and on the actual conditions of
the country and the army.
</P>
<P>
It also benefits the country's modernization drive with
economic construction as the center and accords with the global
trend of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan said the cut of armed forces
proved that China follows a defensive and peaceful strategy.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, he said, some countries spread the so-called
"China threat." "The decison on armed forces cut has once again
illustrated China's sincerity and its independent foreign policy
of peace, and smashed the rumors," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Now, people can draw only one conclusion that China is a
peace-loving country viewed either politically, or economically or
diplomatically, or in term of national defense," the vice-minister
said, quoting the relevant statements in Jiang's report.
</P>
<P>
China has always dedicated to world peace and development and
the "China threat" fallacy is not tenable, he added.

<P>
Zhao Taizhong, political commissar of the Nanjing Military Area
Command, said that "the key to improve the army building and the
national defense lies in quality instead of quantity only."
</P>
<P>
The only correct road China should take is to have fewer but
better troops and arm them through science and technology, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"If the reduction of armed forces by one million in the 1980s
was the wise decision of the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping,
the armed forces cut by 500,000 in the next three years is the
wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the Central
Military Commission with Jiang Zemin at the core," said Zhao who
has served in the army for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament this time shows the confidence and
determination of the third generation of China's central leading
collective with Jiang Zemin as the core to promote world peace, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Jing Zhiyuan, an officer of the Second Artillery Corps, said
the purpose of improving the quality of the PLA and taking the
road of fewer but better troops is to raise the defense capability
of China.
</P>
<P>
"Improvement of the army building requires a shift from
expansion of scale to improvement of quality and efficiency and
from a personnel-intensive to technology-intensive development,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old officer stressed that the key to improving
the army building is to raise the combat effectiveness of troops.
</P>
<P>
He believes that the establishment of the army units would
become more rational and their combat effectiveness would be
raised after the disarmament.

<HEADLINE> Congress Delegate on Theoretical Breakthroughs of Jiang's Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Theoretical breakthroughs in
the congress report regarding the issue of ownership will provide
a great impetus to economic restructuring, said Ren Zhongyi, a
delegate from south China's Guangdong Province, here today.
</P>
<P>
Joining other Guangdong delegates to the congress in a panel
discussion, Ren, former secretary of the province's Party
committee, said, "I agree with and support the report" delivered
by Jiang Zemin at the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, which opened on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the new characteristics and major contributions of the
report are mainly reflected in the fact that it declares that Deng
Xiaoping Theory will be written into the Constitution of the
Party.
</P>
<P>
"It has immeasurable significance over various undertakings of
the Party and the socialist cause in the future," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
It is extremely important that the report has reiterated and
emphasized that China remains in the primary stage of socialism,
and that the stage is to last at least a hundred years, said Ren.
</P>
<P>
In the past decades, questions like what socialism is and how
it will be built were not fullly understood, he said. Due to the
lack of experience, it was once widely believed that it needn't
take long to realize communism. And consequently we had done
something against the law of history, he added.
</P>
<P>
"We should draw a lesson from this," said Ren.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the report has pointed out more
connotations of the public sector of the economy and its status,
affirming that public ownership should take diversified forms.
</P>
<P>
The major breakthroughs will give a push to the overall
economic restructuring, economic development and even the
deepening of political restructuring, Ren pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the report has pointed out that the shareholding system
cannot be simply labeled public or private, and that joint stock
partnership can be introduced in socialist countries, and that
remuneration according to work and remuneration according to
factors of production should be combined.
</P>
<P>
The new breakthroughs are resulted from the party's
implementation of the ideological line of emancipating the mind
and seeking truth from facts, said Ren.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lesotho Still Faces Political Crisis (by Liu Yegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Political crisis in
Lesotho, which culminated recently by several political events,
is creating an unstable climate which could damage the kingdom's
struggling economy.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has pervaded Lesotho since Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle decided on July 9 to leave the ruling Basotholand
Congress Party (BCP). He took 40 MPs with him, leaving 24 MPs
with the BCP.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle's move to transfer powers of the ruling party to his
new party, the Lesotho Congress for Democracy, followed a BCP
congress in which Mokhehle was voted out as party leader.
</P>
<P>
Since then mass demonstrations have been organized by the BCP
and other organizations which argue that Mokhehle's move was
unconstitutional as he stripped the ruling party of its
powers before an election had been held.
</P>
<P>
Mokhehle, in turn, argued that his move is legal because he
has the support of the majority of MPs.
</P>
<P>
The situation took a turn for the worse in August when
parliament Speaker, John Kolane, announced that three BCP MPs,
including BCP's chairman, had been suspended from parliament.
</P>
<P>
They were suspended after telling the speaker he had no
business to declare the BCP the official opposition as the party
had won the previous elections.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, the speaker announced that the media and
members of the public could no longer attend parliament debate,
and the police were ordered to escort them out.
</P>
<P>
The ban has not yet been lifted, even though journalists
petitioned the speaker, saying the order violated constitutional
guarantees on freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, the speaker asked the police to eject the
remaining BCP MPs from parliament after they refused to follow
parliamentary procedures as an expression of defiance at his
declaration that the BCP had become the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders in Lesotho said the protracted political
impasse would damage the country's chances of recovery after its
implementing economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the present crisis continued, the economy
would deteriorate to the point that Lesotho would not be able to
service its foreign debt, and unemployment would rocket.
</P>
<P>
The decision to bar BCP MPs from parliament has generated
widespread anger, promoting the senate, which is pro-BCP, and BCP
MPs to write to King Letsie, asking him to intervene in upholding
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The BCP has been supported in opposing Mokhehle's moves by the
senate, traditional chiefs, the organized youth and women's
groups as well as the church.
</P>
<P>
They have all taken part in marches on the Royal Palace to
petition the king to dissolve Mokhehle's government.
</P>
<P>
Since then the king has appointed members of the Electoral
Commission who were sworn in last week.
</P>
<P>
Southern African leaders have called on the king to make more
efforts to stablize the situation through political reform.

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 14) - 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- (At Xinhua's request, some
delegates to the current 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) write what they see, discuss and think during
the congress in diary form, which we think will provide outsiders
with some information about this major event. The following diary,
the fourth of its kind, was written by Professor Ren Yanshen, Party
Secretary of Beijing University. -- Ed.)
</P>
<P>
Along with some of my fellow delegates from the educational
circle, I was invited to give my opinions about the draft report
to the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
We put forward some suggestions on the strategy of developing
the country through science, technology and education, as well as
the policy toward the intellectuals in the new period.
</P>
<P>
I'm glad to hear that the report delivered by Jiang Zemin at
the opening session of the congress has fully incorporated our
opinions, in that the parts concerning science, technology and
education and the intellectuals have been substantiated.
</P>
<P>
A small example as it is, it proves that the report has
pooled the wisdom of the delegates.
</P>
<P>
The issues of science, technology and education have been
fully expounded in the report.
</P>
<P>
Some of its remarks, including "progress of science and
technology is a decisive factor behind the economic development",
"Competent people are the most important resources for scientific
and technological progress and economic and social development",
"We must see to it that education is given a strategic priority",
and that "the whole party must fully understand that cultural
advancement is essential and urgent because it plays a great role
in developing the cause of socialism and rejuvenating the nation",
are essential remarks that I hope could be fully recognized
throughout the Party and the entire society.

<TEXT>
<P>
Universities are confronted with quite a few substantial
problems, yet they enjoy great advantages and potentials, which
lie in their advanced culture, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
We should tap the potentials in these aspects and make them
applicable for the society.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Beijing University boasts a strong teaching
faculty with professors alone numbering over 800. Every year, a
total of 3,000 to 4,000 students graduated from the school.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University ranks the first among the universities
across the country, whether in terms of the number of key
subjects, or the number of key laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The departments of natural science and technology in the
school, for instance, carry out 600 to 700 research projects
annually.
</P>
<P>
Once this vast resource is applied, the modernization drive in
the country will benefit a lot. And in turn, a new situation will
be created in the school.
</P>
<P>
Beijing University is about to celebrate its 100th founding
anniversary around the turn of the century. Once the country's
pioneer to dissemilate Marxism and scientific and democratic
ideas, the university made key contributions to the victory of the
Chinese revolution and the country's socialist construction.
</P>
<P>
In the forthcoming 21st century, Beijing University will
undoubtedly carry forward the tradition, and contribute more to
the cause of building socialism with Chinese characteristics.

<P>
In my opinion, the strategy of developing the country through
science, technology and education can be regarded as a basic
national policy closely related to the overall modernization drive
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the strategy, I think, is not arbitrary
nor dispensable, but a feasible approach fitting the reality of
the country.
</P>
<P>
It is a fundamental strategy to be introduced considering the
the fact that competitions in economic and scientific strength
in the world are becoming acute.
</P>
<P>
For colleges and universities, the introduction of the
strategy is a historical opportunity to be treasured.
</P>
<P>
At present, we should pay attention to two issues in education,
the "orientation" and the "adaptation".
</P>
<P>
The "orientation" means the purpose of education. In the final
analysis, I think that education should serve the modernization
drive in the country.
</P>
<P>
As for "adaptation", I think that everything done, including the
educational setup, content of courses and the cultivation of
competent personnel, should serve the needs in economic
construction and social development.
</P>
<P>
Education should serve the requirements of economic
construction and the modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
Never before have I found that the economic and social
development strongly needs education. Nor have I so clearly seen
the general trend that the values of knowledge and talented people
have risen.

concerning international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China and Ghana have maintained long-term

<HEADLINE> Iran Blames US for EU ban of Pistachios </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iran's agriculture minister
today accused the United States of being behind the imposition
of the temporary ban by the Council of the European Union on the
importation of Iranian pistachio.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, the minister, Issa
Kalantari, once again defended the quality of the Iranian pistachio
banned temporarily in Europe for possible health hazards while
attacking the United States for trying to take over the European
market.
</P>
<P>
He that "Iranian pistachio is not contaminated, but it is the
healthiest type of pistachio. The level of contamination of the
pistachio exported out of Iran is below the standards that the
client recommended to us."
</P>
<P>
Pistachio has turned into another dispute between Iran and
the EU, which recalled its ambassadors from Tehran last April in
the aftermath of the Berlin Court ruling that implicated Iranian
leaders in the killing of four Kurdish opposition leaders in the
Mykonos restaurant five years ago.
</P>
<P>
The EU Council said that it had banned imports of pistachios
from Iran because of fears of contamination by Aflatoxin B1, a
carcinogenic substance produced by molds.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the Americans are behind this (ban). They can
not fully take our place in Europe, but they can lie and make
European people worry that Iranian pistachio is contaminated,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "then the Americans themselves would be able to
sell their pistachio at any rate they please. Already the
pistachio prices have gone up by 20 percent."
</P>
<P>
Kalantari added that Iran had the lion's share of European
market for pistachio because it fulfilled 96 percent of the
European demand for pistachio. Iran exported 90,000 tonnes of
pistachio to Europe last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the contaminated container, which triggered the
EU's decision to impose ban on Iranian pistachio until December
15, had been re-exported by an UAE merchant to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister urged the Europeans to approach the
issue from a more rational, expert-like angle, rather than try
to politicize the matter, saying "independent world bodies such
as World Health Organization or Food and Agriculture Organization
can come to Iran where we grow and package pistachio and test
our pistachio."
</P>
<P>
Pistachio fetches Iran about 400 million U.S. dollars
annually and provides 350,000 jobs. Some 400,000 hectares of
land are allocated for growing pistachio in Iran.

<HEADLINE> Albright: Oslo Accords Must Be Followed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- United States Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright has affirmed that the agreements reached
in Oslo could not be given up as they are the foundations of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Her remarks came in the Egyptian TV program "Good Morning,
Egypt" broadcast today.
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion in the region wants peace, and leaders of the
nations concerned ought to make big decisions to fulfill this
wish," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
The Oslo agreements signed four years ago in Washington started
the Middle East peace process which has been deadlocked due to
Israeli government's policies on issues like Jewish settlement
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the proposal by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to intensify the final-status talks with Palestinians
instead of making further redeployment of Israeli troops in the
West Bank, Albright denied she is for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
She said speeding up the final-status talks and implementing
the existing agreements have to go parallel.
</P>
<P>
On her current trip to the region, Albright said she has managed
to make but minor steps in restoring confidence between the
Palestinians and Israelis, adding major steps are needed "because
both the Israeli and Palestinians peoples want peace."
</P>
<P>
Albright started her trip to Israel on September 10, her first
to the region since taking office early this year. She has also
visited Palestinian-ruled areas, Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Resumes Funding of Nigeria's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has resumed its
funding of Nigeria's 7.5 million U.S. Dollar national population
program, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The program was initiated in 1991 to study the impact of the
Nigerian population, the biggest population in Africa, on the
country's national development.
</P>
<P>
It was then funded by the World Bank under the auspices of the
United Nation's Development and Poverty Alienation Program in the
third world countries.
</P>
<P>
The bank stopped funding the program in 1995 in the crisis
sparked off by Nigeria's annulment of the June 12, 1993
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The decision to restart the program was made in a recent
meeting in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, which were attended by
the World Bank, the Nigerian Ministry of Health and other
agencies involved.
</P>
<P>
The meeting decided that the program will be finished by the
end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Fund Managers Confident of Malaysian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign fund managers
are happy with the Malaysian government's policies taken recently
to tackle its economic woes and are confident of the long-term
prospects of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 fund managers from the United States, the United
Kingdom and Singapore had a 90-minute dialogue here today with
Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad who returned home
earlier this morning from a week-long visit to Mongolia and
Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Expressing their sympathy with Malaysia's recent predicament,
particularly the volatility in the stock and currency markets, the
managers felt that the Malaysian government has put in place the
right policies to tackle some of its economic woes, especially
that of the persistent current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference after the dialogue, James Alexandroff from
the fund management firm of Arisaig Partners from Singapore said,
"Nothing Mahathir said gave us any cause for concern...on the
contrary, we were reassured in many ways and we are more confident
about the economy now that the right policies are being
undertaken."
</P>
<P>
David Roche, from London-based Independent Strategy, said that
to build up foreign direct investor confidence, Malaysia needs to
do three major things including a definite move to run a bigger
fiscal surplus, using the currency decline as an opportunity to
increase exports and improve returns on capital, and making sure
that monetary policy is supportive of the currency and that things
are getting better.
</P>
<P>
"If these three elements fall into place, we can have a very
quick bounce back not only in the ringgit but also in the
financial markets, as well as in confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is able to achieve, as Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim said last week, a growth rate in
excess of eight percent this year and in 1998.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Tourism Makes Huge Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has made
huge profit from tourism in the past nine years, Acting Executive
Director of the Tourism Business Council Colin Walker said at the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tourism had earned 26.8 billion Rand (5.7 billion U.S.Dollars)
in 1996 with domestic tourists spending 14.8 billion (3.1 billion
U.S. Dollars) and foreign tourists 12 billion Rand (2.6 billion
U.S. Dollars), Walker told a seminar in Durban on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Targets set for growth in tourism until 2000 were to increase
froeign exchange earnings from 13 billion Rand (2.8 billion U.S.
Dollars) a year to 23 billion Rand (4.9 billion U.S.Dollars).
</P>
<P>
This meant South African travels services should host 2.2
million overseas visitors and increase the number of domestic
holiday trips to 19,500 a year, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
The tourism target is also aimed to raise employment from
550,000 to 860,000 jobs and double the number of tourism ventures
owned or operated by disadvantaged entrepreneurs and communities,
he added.

digitalization package.
</P>
<P>
The system will be used to create an electronic databank on all
the books, magazines, newspapers and video cassettes in the
library. Readers use the databank to gain access to ancient books
which formerly were off limits to the public because libraries
feared they would be damaged.
</P>
<P>
The system will also link the library with other computer
networks for information sharing.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging's Acronym Awb was spray-painted in
bold, black letters on the plinth of the 2.2 m-high Biko's statue, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa on Friday commemorated the death of Biko, who died 20
years ago while held in police custody as a political detainee.
</P>
<P>
Political leaders across the spectrum have voiced their disgust at
the desecration of the Biko's Statue, noting that the criminal act was
designed to erase Biko's memory in the minds of the black majority.
</P>
<P>
"They (extrimists) can deface Biko's statue but they cannot remove
his memory," Azanian People's Organization President Mosibudi Mangena
said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress spokesperson Ronnie Mamoepa
called the defacing of the statue an affront to the majority of people
in South Africa and said his party condemned the act "as a racist
deed".
</P>
<P>
"We call on law enforcement agencies to do their utmost to track
down the perpetrators of this dastardly deed and to ensure they face
the full might of the law," Mamoepa said.
</P>
<P>
Pan Africanist Congress Secretary-General Mike Muendane said the
"Animal or amimals" who had defaced the state wanted to cause chaos in
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is an obvious act of madness, solely aimed at derailing
progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Party Leader Tony Leon called on the might of the laws
to hunt down the perpetrators and prosecute them as their act is "an
affront to the reconciliation process" in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- India's crude oil imports
are estimated to record an over 66 percent increase in the next
five years, Press Trust of India (PTI) said here today.
</P>
<P>
In the process, India's oil import dependence will go up from
60 percent now to 70 percent in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period

<P>
The oil demand in India in the next five years will shoot up
from 83.9 million tons of oil equivalent to 120 million tons,
whereas domestic production would grow marginally from 33.87
million tons to 37 million tons.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers Killed in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers were
killed in South Lebanon overnight in a roadside bombing launched
by Hezbollah guerrilla fighters, Israeli Army said today.
</P>
<P>
An Army statement said the two killed were among a foot
patrol squad in the central sector of the Israeli self-claimed
South Lebanon Security Zone. One soldier was killed at the
scene, another fatally wounded and died later on the way to the
hospital, a third soldier was lightly injured.
</P>
<P>
It said that the roadside bomb was detonated by Hezbollah
gunmen using remote control device. Army investigators have began
a probe into the incident.
</P>
<P>
The latest deaths brought to 33 the death toll of Israeli
soldiers killed in action in the security zone since the
beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Cabinet, which convened its weekly session this
morning, reviewed the incident and current tension in South
Lebanon that threatens to escalate the confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, an Israeli elite hit squad killed four
Hezbollah gunmen in an operation in the security zone, including
18-year-old Hadi Nasrallah, the son of Hezbollah leader Sheikh
Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers brought back two bodies of Hezbollah gunmen,
including Hadi Nasrallah, which would be buried in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials said that they expected to use the bodies
for an exchange for the body of Itamar Ilya, who was killed with
12 other officers on September 5 in an ambush by Hezbollah
gunmen duing a naval commando raid outside the security zone.
</P>
<P>
But Sheikh Nasrallah has vowed not to let Israel to exploit
the killing of his son, saying "thanks God for making my son a
martyr." He told a rally that Hezbollah fighters were willing to
sacrifice their lives to free their land from Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
The death of Nasrallah's son is expected to spark a new round
of revenge attacks against Israeli targets by Hezbollah gunmen,
which will escalate the high tension in South Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Asked to Drop Dual Fare Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Officials in India's
tourism sector have urged the government to drop the dual fare
structure in the aviation sector for international tourists in
order to give a push to the tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a one-day conference on tourism and travel here
today, they said that the dual fare structure of collecting air
fares from foreign tourists in rupee and US dollars was being
looked upon with suspicion as the US dollar rates are higher than
equivalent rupee structure.
</P>
<P>
They said that foreign tourists coming to India will have to
pay much more than the locals when they travel in the country by
air. Such a dual fare structure does not exist in the railway
sector.
</P>
<P>
A lot of complaints have been heard from foreign tourists and
the dual fare system has hurt India's tourism, they said.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the conference also suggested that immigration
and customs clearance procedure should be made easier and faster
for foreign tourists.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn
Abdul-Aziz has urged the United States to put pressure on Israel
to end its aggression against the Palestinian people and to honor
the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd made the call in his talks with visiting
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Saturday night, during
which both sides discussed means of pushing forward the Middle
East peace process and achieving just and comprehensive peace in
the region, Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Fahd expressed concern over Israel's aggressiveness, as well as
its collective punishment against the Palestinians, said the
agency.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, both sides also dealt with the bilateral
relations and the security of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in the Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah earlier
Saturday after visiting Israel, Palestinian self-ruled areas,
Syria and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
This is her maiden Mideast trip since taking office in January,
which is aimed at reviving the stalled Mideast peace-making. But

Washington in two weeks time.

Albright is due to leave for Saudi southern resort of Abha this

<HEADLINE> Li Ruihuan Emphasizes Need to Study Theory on Primary Stage of Socialism  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan said here today
that the theory on the primary stage of socialism is the
corner stone of Deng Xiaoping Theory.
</P>
<P>
The theory on the primary stage of socialism is the basis of
our Party in formulating policies, he said at a panel discussion
with delegates from the north China port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
"Only when we understand the theory on the primary stage of
socialism, can we know clearly that why our Party pursues this
principle in this stage in stead of practising other policies and
principles, and conscientiously implement Party's basic line," he
said.
</P>
<P>
A full understanding on the theory of primary stage of
socialism will help us to distinguish the right from wrong,
maintain vigilance against the Right tendencies, but first against
the "Left" and take the "three favorables", namely favorable to
promoting the growth of the productive forces in a socialism
society, increasing the overall strength of the socialist state
and raising the people's living standards, as the basic criterion,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The significance of the theory on the primary stage of
socialism lies in a clear understanding about the protracted
nature and arduousness of the cause of socialism, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We admit that the productive forces at present in China is
relatively backward, which can't be compared with that in the
developed countries nor that even in some developing countries,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It requires the efforts of several generations and even dosens
of generations to consolidate and develop socialist system.

</P>
<P>
It is the crystalization of the collective wisdom and a

</P>
<P>
The theme of the congress is to hold the banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory for an all-round advancement of the cause of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics into the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of banner is of the upmost importance. It signalizes

chosen for the crucial stage at the turn of the century," he said.

It has a vital bearing on the fundamental interests of the 1.2

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- China has decided to bring
its import and export tariff rates down from 23 percent to 17
percent on average as of October 1 this year, the Office of the
Customs Tariff Commission of the State Council has announced.
</P>
<P>
The cut, scaling down by 26 percent, will affect more than

tariff-imposed commodities, officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that this is another big cut made by China on its own

important measure adopted by China to deepen the reforms and
increase opening up.
</P>
<P>
"The move fully demonstrates China's determination and
confidence in taking part in international competition and
cooperation in a more open attitude," they said.

<HEADLINE> Employment Issue Not To Cause Social Unrest: Labor Minister (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese official said here
today that although deepening economic reform will cause certain
pressure on employment, it will by no means touch off social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Li Boyong, a delegate to the on-going 15th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China, said deepening reforms in
state-owned enterprises will bring about certain pressure on
employment in urban areas in China, but it is within the handling
capacity of the society, and is far from touching off any social
unrest.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also minister of labor, quoted the report delivered
by Jiang Zemin at the congress as saying, "With the deepening of
enterprise reforms, technological progress and readjustment of the
economic structure, it would be hard to avoid the flow of
personnel and lay-off."
</P>
<P>
"But no such 'disastrous outcome' as predicted by some overseas
figures will go off," Li emphasized.
</P>
<P>
As far as Li was concerned, the employment situation in China
faces both challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Li explained that while the number of laid-off workers is to
increase in the wake of further reforms in state businesses, rapid
development in non-public sectors and joint stock partnership
businesses, on the other hand, will undoubtedly offer more job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The abundant labor resource in China, which totals 834 million
in number, does pose quite a headache to the country's employment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Each year, there are 10 million more people seeking jobs in
towns and cities. Many of them come from surplus factory worker
forces, which stand at a staggering 20 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition, approximately 130 million peasants have become idle
in the rural areas, and may compete with urbanites for jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, the ongoing reemployment project has scored
great achievements. Each year from 1992 to 1996, the newly
employed outnumbered the laid-offs by a margin of eight million,
thus maintaining an annual unemployment rate in urban areas at
about 3 percent throughout.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The Ministry of Labor has adopted a series of measures against
unemployment," said Li.
</P>
<P>
A job preparatory system has been established in cities and
towns demanding that each person receive pre-job trainings that
may last one to three years.
</P>
<P>
As for idle farmers, job opportunities in the vicinity of their
habitats have been offered, while management of the trans-regional
flow of peasant laborers has been strengthened, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The main problem still lies with surplus workers in urban
areas, Li said. It is estimated that a total of 8.14 million
workers were laid off last year.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, assistance with laid-off workers in seeking jobs
has become the key item in the reemployment project.
</P>
<P>
"Over five million laid-off workers have been involved in the
project across the country," said Li. "And half of them have
already found new jobs."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has adopted measures to protect those
workers with unemployment insurance and the lowest living standard
security system, one to prevail in all cities by the end of this
century.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that laid-off workers change their traditional
ideas and be brave enough to seek jobs out of state enterprises,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
In Li's opinion, the country has a lot potential to tap in its
job market. The number of employees engaged in service trade, for
instance, only takes up 26 percent of the total employed in 1996,
while that of developed countries has already topped 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister was confident that the unemployment rate in urban
areas could be controlled within 4 percent by the end of this
century.

prosperous and rich," and wishes the congress a great success.

<HEADLINE> Party's Guiding Ideology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- It is "the aspiration of the
whole Party as well as the 4.2 million people in Deng Xiaoping's
hometown to establish Deng's theory as the guiding ideology of the
Party in its Constitution," a congress delegate said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a panel discussion, Luo Songbai, Party secretary of
the Guang'An Prefecture, the native town of Deng Xiaoping in
southwest China's Sichuan Province, noted that the Party central
committee has proposed that the current Party congress
establishes Deng Xiaoping Theory as the guiding ideology of the
Communist Party of China in its Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Having worked in Guang'An for more than two decades, Luo
witnessed the historic changes in this birthplace of Deng's since
China introduced the policy of reforms and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
"The place used to be very poor due to frequent natural
adversities," Luo said, adding that local people could not have
enough to eat in poor years.
</P>
<P>
"The theory of Deng Xiaoping on building socialism with Chinese
characteristics has worked a miracle in his hometown," Luo told
his fellow delegates.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Guang'An was upgraded from a county to a prefecture
and embarked on a "fast lane" of development guided by Deng's
directive that economic development is the first priority.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the gross domestic product (GDP) of Guang'An
increased by 42 percent compared with the figure in 1993. The per
capita output of grain and annual net income kept going up for
four consecutive years with the 1996 per capita grain out reaching
500 kg and that of net income climbing to 1,800 yuan,respectively,
more than eight times the 1993 figures.
</P>
<P>
"Straw-roofed huts are gone in Guang'an," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
"The fellow villagers of Deng Xiaoping will never forget his
signal contributions," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
"Though the great man has gone, but the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping Theory has already been held high by the Party Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This great banner has taken roots in the hearts of his fellow
villagers, and we would live up to his great expectations and turn
his wish of 'making Guang'An prosperous' into reality," he added.

<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Cambodian People's Party
(CPP) has congratulated the Communist Party of China (CPC) on its
15th National Congress.
</P>
<P>
In a telegram to CPC Central Committee General Secretary Jiang
Zemin, CPP President Chea Sim said his party "has paid close
attention to the continual development of the People's Republic of
China and speaks highly of the great achievements made by the
Chinese people under the wise leadership of the CPC."
</P>
<P>
What China has achieved in its construction has indicated that
the Chinese people have stuck to the CPC's guidance and the theory
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics put forward by
Deng Xiaoping, he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the CPC, focusing on economy, deepened the
reform and opening-up, thus promoting the country's development
and social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim believed "resolutions to be adopted by the congress
will gain extensive support from the Chinese people and the
successful implementation of the resolutions will accelerate
China's development into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He wished that "the relations of solidarity, friendship and
cooperation between the CPC and the CPP will be further
strengthened and developed to benefit the people of the two
countries."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Singapore Continues Suffering From Heavy Haze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Singapore is suffering from
continued heavy haze which has blurred the air quality to an
unhealthy level, as Indonesia is stepping up its efforts to fight
land and forest fires.
</P>
<P>
Neighboring Malaysia, also seriously affected, has turned to
Western countries for help.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, haze worsened to beyond the 100 reading on the
24-hour Pollutant Standards Index (PSI), which is considered
unhealthy. The index reached 106, the worst level so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
The haze, which began appearing four weeks ago, is caused by
winds blowing smoke from large-scale land and forest fires in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports said that doctors here were seeing at least
20 percent more patient with respiratory problems since the haze
started. One doctor was quoted as saying that people were
experiencing runny eyes, more nasal discharge and throat problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that breathing such air with haze can be as bad as
cigarette smoke but the effects are more transient.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said that a few number of flights from
Singapore to Indonesia were canceled on Saturday because of the
heavy hazy weather.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, seriously affected by the worsening haze, has turned
to France and Canada for help to combat the haze hanging over the
country.
</P>
<P>
Science, Technology and Environment Minister Datuk Law Hieng
Ding said officials from the embassies of the two Western
countries were helping the Malaysian government to map out an
action plan to tackle the haze problem nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Datuk Law, who is to travel to Jakarta this week to discuss the
problem, said that France and Canada, due to their well-known
experiences in putting out forest fires, can offer Malaysia the
appropriate solution.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has declared the haze situation, the worst in three
years, as a national disaster, because the air quality has
deteriorated to "very unhealthy" levels in various parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, anticipating that the haze problem will worsen in
the weeks ahead, spelt out on Saturday measures it was taking to
prevent more fires in the forest and plantation areas of Sumatra
and Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
The measures, ranging from cloud-seeding operation in "hot
spot" areas to the setting up of a national coordinating agency
for land fires, underscored the seriousness with which the
government was tackling the problem.
</P>
<P>
The measures are being taken against the backdrop of worsening
climatic conditions in Indonesia, which is experiencing its worst
drought for 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Forest fires in Kalimantan and Sumatra, and the resulting smoke
and haze affecting the region, were the result of land clearing
activities by forestry and plantation firms and, as a senior
Indonesian government official said, had destroyed more than
300,000 hectares of forest as of July this year.
</P>
<P>
The Meteorological Service of Singapore has ruled out
cloud-seeding operation as a way to deal with the haze here. A
statement from the department said Singapore was too small, and
clouds created may be blown away before they can bring rain.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the rain produced by such clouds will provide only
temporary relief as the haze will continue to be blown in by the
prevailing winds, it added.

<HEADLINE> Farmer/Musician's Dreams Come True </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A 78-year-old
farmer/songwriter in north China recently saw his dreams come true
when one of his song collections was published and a music school
named after him set up.
</P>
<P>
Shi Zhangyuan was born in a small village in north China's
Shanxi Province. Throughout his youth, he wrote songs when he
wasn't working in the fields. So far, he's composed more than
2,000 tunes.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of new China in 1949 brought a happy life to our
poor farmers, which inspired me to write songs," said the old man,
who was in his twenties at the time and already an accomplished
musician.
</P>
<P>
In the 50 years since, Shi has devoted his spare time to
writing songs, one after another. His tunes first became favorites
among his fellow villagers, then in the province, and some became
hits nationwide.
</P>
<P>
"Late Premier Zhou Enlai personally conducted one of my songs
titled 'Welcome to Our Village'," Shi said with pride. Another
composition won the top prize in a national competition.
</P>
<P>
"I had two dreams in my life: one to have my song books
published, and another to set up a school in our village to
popularize music education among children," Shi said. But he
lacked the money to do it on his own.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Shanghai Opera and Dance Theater heard about
Shi, and decided to donate their total ticket sales from a
performance of "Romeo and Juliet" to set up a primary school named
after the prolific musician.
</P>
<P>
A year later, a book with 70 of Shi's songs was published in
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Occupancy Rate Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The average occupancy rate of
Chinese hotels has been falling over the past one and a half
years, according to a survey by the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the 1996 occupancy rate for Beijing's
hotels were 50 percent; Harbin's, 37.4 percent; and Jinan's, 58
percent. In the first half of this year, the average hotel
occupancy rate dropped eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Luxury hotels have generally fared better than the inexpensive
accommodations, and non-State-owned hotels did better than
state-owned ones.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts explain that the falling rate was the result
of too many new hotels built, which makes the total number of
hotel rooms exceed the market demand.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Rally Celebrates Fourth Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Over 10,000 Israeli peace
activists gathered in Tel Aviv overnight to celebrate the fourth
anniversary of the signing of Oslo Accords and protest the Likud
government's policies.
</P>
<P>
The rally, held in the Museum Plaza, was organized by
activists of the opposition Labor, Meretz and Hadash parties and
the peace movement Peace Now.
</P>
<P>
It was attended by former Labor's former Prime Minister Shimon
Peres, Labor leader Ehud Barak, Meretz head Yossi Sarid and Leah
Rabin, widow of the slain Labor Premier Yitzhak Rabin, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Bearing banners reading "Returning to Rabin's path" and "Save
the peace," the demonstrators demanded the current Likud
government act to continue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the rally strongly attacked Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu and his government's policies that have put
the peace process in danger. Organizers handed out stickers that
read, "What have you done today to topple the government?"
</P>
<P>
"Peace will overcome the delusions of this regime, Oslo will
not die," Peres said in his speech. "Four years ago peace was born
in Oslo. In the last year and a quarter Netanyahu's government has
tried to break Oslo. Oslo was no mistake, the Netanyahu government
is the big mistake."
</P>
<P>
Barak blasted Netanyahu's policies for "leading us on the path
of Bosnia and Belfast," warning that the next war is already
waiting for the Israeli people behind the door.
</P>
<P>
"The handwriting is on the wall and only the blind or members
of the government are unable to read it," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
A roar of applause rose from the crowd when Sarid said "Bibi,
go home."
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Legislative Council Speaker Ahmed Quria (Abu Ala)
sent a letter to the rally, calling on Israeli peace activists to
join with the Palestinian people in seeking peace.
</P>
<P>
"In this flameless and lightless period, let us join hands and
together firmly grip the torch of peace. Together let us breath
new life into this process and rebuild trust and recreate an
atmosphere where confidence between our peoples prevails so that
we both realize our common dream in this land of peace," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was the historical signing of the Declaration of Principles
in Washington four years ago that formally triggered off the Oslo
peace process, named for the Norwegian capital where peace was
initiated in secret meetings.
</P>
<P>
However, the process, which has borne fruits including the
Palestinian autonomy in Gaza Strip and West Bank, received a
severe blow when the hardline Likud government came to power in
Israel last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continuation of settlement activities, land
confiscation and delay in troop redeployments have virtually
halted the whole process and led to renewed tensions with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Even a much-awaited visit by United States Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright here last week failed to break the deadlock,
that was caused by Israel's building of the Har Homa settlement in
East Jerusalem since March and was aggravated by a recent wave of
suicide bombings launched by Islamic militants in
Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Wuhan Builds Databank on Local Talents Living Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A databank on local people who
have gone abroad for study is being created in this capital city
of central China's Hubei province.
</P>
<P>
The move is to accommodate the needs of local businesses and
institutions seeking to draw in more talents and overseas students
who want to find jobs in their hometown.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1980s, Wuhan has sent more than
10,000 people abroad for study. However, no follow-up record has
been kept on the whereabouts of these overseas students, who can
play an important role in promoting local development.
</P>
<P>
The city science commission started last May to establish a
databank of overseas talent to set up contact with them. The city
also hopes, through them, to introduce more funding and
technology, and launch Sino-foreign cooperative research and
development projects.
</P>
<P>
The commission has issued a registration form, to be completed
by overseas scientific and technological personnel from Wuhan, to
43 higher education institutions and more than 20 research
institutes in the city, and so far 140 of the forms have been
returned.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the commission said they will complete the
initial work on the databank at the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Merger to Foster Petrochemical Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The proposed merger of four
petrochemical companies in east China's Jiangsu Province is
expected to create an internationally competitive conglomerate,
according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The State Council has chosen Li Yizhong, executive
vice-president of China Petrochemical Corporation (Sinopec), as
director of the preparatory committee for the merger.
</P>
<P>
The four companies are: Yizheng Chemical Fiber Group Corp,
Yangzi Petrochemical Corp, Jinling Petrochemical Co. and Nanjing
Chemical Industrial Group. They are located within 30 kilometers
of one another on the banks of the Yangtze River near Nanjing,
capital city of Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
Although the four companies have similar production structures,
they fall under the jurisdiction of different administrative
departments, including Sinopec, the China National Textile Council
and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, which makes co-ordination
and co-operation difficult.
</P>
<P>
the State Council decided to launch the merger after careful
research, Li said.
</P>
<P>
It is a key step in China's strategy of organizing large
industrial groups to revamp State-owned enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The new petrochemical group will be able to sharpen its
competitiveness in the domestic and international market", he
said, it is vital for China's State enterprises to combine their
efforts to compete with foreign giants.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate would become China's largest petrochemical
producer. The aggregate capital of the four companies was 45
billion yuan (5.42 billion US dollars) last year, and their
turnover was 33 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The group will be able to refine and process 10 million tons of
crude oil annually. It will have an annual capacity of one million
tons of chemical fertilizer, 900,000 tons of phthalic acid,
850,000 tons of arene, 800,000 tons of polyester and 400,000 tons
of ethylene.

<HEADLINE> Steps to Avert Congestion at Chittagong Port Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
considering taking immediate steps to avert further congestion at
the Chittagong Port, the much-troubled economic lifeline of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The steps would be giving Inland Container Depot (ICD) in the
private sector the authority to deal with both export and import
business, according to port sources.
</P>
<P>
The port congestion at Chittagong has hit the country's foreign
trade as the feeder vessel operators frequently impose congestion
surcharges on the containers used for import and export business.
</P>
<P>
On September 1, the vessel owners imposed a punitive congestion
surcharge as a result of shortage of space in container yards and
a strike by trade unions in July. The surcharge, however, was
removed five days later following a plea by the port authorities.
</P>
<P>
"If the private sector ICDs are allowed to handle the
containers both for import and export business, the congestion
situation in the Chittagong Port will be improved a lot," said a
port user.
</P>
<P>
The National Board of Revenue (NBR) opposed the idea of giving
private ICDs the power to deal with foreign trade business for
fear of loss of government revenue.
</P>
<P>
But the NBR authority has now accepted the proposal. "We are
now working on the modalities on how the private ICDs can handle
container cargo both for export and import," said a senior officer
of the NBR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the port authority believed that man-made acts,
especially labor troubles, were one of the major causes for the
port congestion.

<HEADLINE> Skiing Star Tomba Allegedly Evades Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian skiing star Alberto
Tomba was to be questioned for his alleged failure to pay taxes
for his advertising and sponsorship contracts.
</P>
<P>
Father manager Franco issued a statement on Saturday, saying
that Tomba's lawyers will reveal the issue to the public on a
propriate day in the near future.
</P>

Local reports said in the past days that Tomba failed to pay
the taxes for his advertising income of 15 billion liras (some 8.5
million U.S. dollars) from 1989 to 1995, which the skiier
allegedly deposited in his overseas accounts.
</P>
<P>
The Italian tax authorities made their raids to Tomba's home in
June, and found some documents and floppy disks which have been
transmitted to the authorities concerned.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Tomba was training in Chile to prepare for the
coming competitions.

<HEADLINE> Battle to Put out Mt Kilimanjaro Fire Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 14 (Xinhua) -- A battle is going on by
about 260 Tanzanian game rangers, civilians and policemen to
contain a fire which erupted at Mt Kilimanjaro, northern
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The fire that started last Friday has sealed off two ascending
routes on the western flank of the mountain, according to reports
available here today.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director General of the Tanzania National Parks, Gerald
Bigumbi said on Saturday that they have succeeded to halt the
fire from spreading to the west-northern side. Efforts are on to
completely put out the blaze.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, despite the temporary closure of the two
routes, tourists are free to use the four other routes for
ascending, which are safe.
</P>
<P>
The chief park warden of the Kilimanjaro National Park, Lorivi
Ole-Moirana also said on Saturday that they have managed to
control the fire in the area where it erupted by creating
firebreakers.
</P>
<P>
The fire is not much devastative compared to another one in
January which lasted for two and half months and destroyed 3,000
hectares, he said, adding, "I'm hopeful we'll put out this fire
soon."
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is not known and still under
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Key State Firms Set to Revive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The painstaking effort to
prune State-owned enterprises will pay off in about 10 years,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Such firms accounted for 80 percent of China's industrial
output in the 1970s, said a senior official of the State
Statistics Bureau (SSB), adding that the the proportion has
plunged to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
In fact, less than 30 percent would be sufficient if the State
has effective control in six or seven key sectors vital to
economic growth, said Li Qiming, director of the bureau's industry
and transportation department.
</P>
<P>
His remarks reflect a growing consensus among Chinese leaders
and economists that socialism does not have to rely solely upon
State ownership.
</P>
<P>
A prevailing State ownership in the 1960s and 1970s spoiled the
Chinese economy, leaving no room for private business.
</P>
<P>
Li ruled out privatization as a panacea for China battling to
bail out its teetering State enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He said the bulk of such firms would become collectively owned
through shareholding, including internal holding of shares by
employees.
</P>
<P>
State and collective firms make up about 80 percent of the
country's industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Li said the private sector would grow, but privatization was
out of the question.
</P>
<P>
"The policy has paid off to support a selected number of large
State enterprises while leaving most smaller ones sink or swim on
their own," Li said.
</P>
<P>
State industrial enterprises posted positive profits in the
first half of this year, an initial recovery from a net deficit in
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
About 36,000 State industrial firms have annual sales income of
more than five million yuan (600,000 US dollars). Although they
account for 41 percent of those firms, their sales income and
industrial output makes up more than 95 percent of the nation's
total respectively, Li said.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the 36,000 enterprises contributed to 113
percent of total profits of State industrial firms, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Calls on Gulf States to Remove </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami has called on Gulf countries to remove all
misunderstanding between them in a bid to enhance Islamic
solidarity, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Khatami stressed that attempts to preserve security and
stability of the Persian Gulf is the common objective of Iran
and other friendly countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Two English dailies Tehran Times and Iran News reported that
Khatami made the remarks while meeting with visiting Qatari
Foreign Minister Sheikh Hamad Ben Jassem Bin Jaber al Thani here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister delivered a message from Qatar
Emir Sheikh Hamad Ben Khalifa Al Thani who confirmed that a high-
ranking Qatari delegation would attend the summit of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) scheduled here in
December.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was quoted as saying that the regional countries
should deal with each other with respect and understanding in
order to remove all misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran supports any activity to promote unity
and understanding among the Persian Gulf countries and preserve
the region's security.
</P>
<P>
"Iran's relations with other countries is only based on
mutual respect," he said, adding that "bilateral relations based
on this principle can be model for other countries."
</P>
<P>
Good-neighborliness is one of the main principles of Iran's
foreign policy, especially in its ties with the regional
countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said undoubtedly there are other common grounds for
cooperation between Iran and other countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed further activation of Iran-Qatar Joint
Commission and said it would pave the way for speedy
implementation of bilateral contracts.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president urged the regional countries to try to
construct an atmosphere of mutual confidence and to remove
misunderstandings in a bid to foil the ploys of some countries
which want the region to remain underdeveloped and exposed to
threats.
</P>
<P>
"Under such pretexts they can increase their illegitimate
military presence in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari foreign minister, who arrived here Friday night,
said that Qatar's ties with its neighbors, Iran in particular,
are solid.
</P>
<P>
He said that in his meetings with Iranian officials he
intended to become familiar with Tehran's views and discuss
further expansion of Tehran-Doha ties.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Hold Peace Talks With Tribal rebels today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will
resume peace talks here today with tribal rebels in a fresh bid to
end the decades-old insurgency in southern Chittagong Hill Tracts
(CHT).
</P>
<P>
Today's talks are seen as crucial as the two sides are likely
to resume deliberations on the repatriation of about 43,000 Chakma
refugees from the Indian state of Tripura and their permanent
settlement in the three hill districts.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation process was stalled after the return of about
7,000 refugees to their homes in the CHT.
</P>
<P>
An official source said that although a peace agreement was not
likely to be reached this time, the meeting would take final
decisions on all unresolved issues including land and the status
of the Muslim settlers.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is likely to fix a date for signing an agreement
resolving all the issues," said an official of the National
Committee on CHT.
</P>
<P>
Committee Chief Whip and Chairman Abul Hasnat Abdullah and
tribal leader Bodipriya Larma will lead their respective teams to
the sixth round of official talks today.
</P>
<P>
The fifth round was held in mid-July in Dhaka without any
tangible outcome.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, It is reported that a tense situation is prevailing
between the supporters of peace negotiators and their rivals, who
have been demanding self-rule in the resource-rich hill districts
since the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
District administration sources said a clash between the
pro-negotiation group and the hard-liner students and youths could
erupt any time. Last week, there were several clashes between the
two sides.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Farmers Spend 25.45 M Dollars for Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Regular pest attacks on
croplands have forced Bangladeshi farmers to spend 1.12 billion
taka (about 25.45 million U.S. dollars) annually for buying
pesticides, mainly in rice farming, local press reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
This is an added burden to the hard-bitten farmers who struggle
every year against the imbalance caused by high prices of
agri-inputs and low prices of produce.
</P>
<P>
The farmers spend on average 775 taka (about 17.60 dollars) per
hectare per crop season for pest control, although they usually
apply less than 50 percent of the prescribed dosage.
</P>
<P>
Rice is the most pest-affected crop in the country and about 20
percent of rice is damaged every year by pests like stem borers,
leaf rollers and rice bugs.
</P>
<P>
These pests are usually controlled by chemical insecticides
which cover only 10-20 percent of the cropland in the country.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is an agriculture-based country with over 80 percent
of its 120 million people living in the rural areas. About 50
percent of the population are living below the poverty line and
the percentage in the rural areas is still higher.
</P>
<P>
The country produced 20.34 million tons of grain during
1996-97.

<HEADLINE> India Starts Work on Space Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- In its bid to bring to
reality the revolutionary aviation concept of a space plane, the
Indian Institute of Science (IIS) would shortly begin experiments
for developing an in-flight oxygen separator for the "hyperplane,"
a local newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
The experiments, on a ground system of vortex tubes set up as a
technology demonstrator by the Central Cryogenic Facility (CCF) at
the IIS, aims to separate liquid oxygen from liquefied air to be
used as fuel for the hyperplane. It is expected to be completed in
time for a meeting on October 9, the Indian Express quoted IIS
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The hyperplane was conceived by the Defense Research and
Development Organization (DRDO), which envisages a high speed
"single-stage to orbit launch vehicle" that will not only leave
the atmosphere, but also be able to come back to the Earth. The
CCF project is a technology demonstrator for the principle behind
an "air-breathing engine," the paper said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Prime ministers of Bulgaria and
Slovenia have agreed to accelerate talks over Bulgaria's entry
into the Central Europe Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Prime Minister Ivan Kostov met with his Slovenian
counterpart Janez Drnovsek when attending a meeting of prime
ministers of CEFTA member countries on September 12-13 in Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed to hold talks later this month
on trade liberalization of farm produce, the avoidance of double
taxation and mutual protection of investment, the Bulgarian
Telegraph Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Similar negotiations between Bulgaria and Romania are expected
to be held here in October, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria applied in April this year for its entry into CEFTA,
which was established in 1992 by Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic, in a bid to build a free trade zone in Central Europe
before the year of 2002. Slovakia, Slovenia and Romania joined the
CEFTA later.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria has signed an agreement on the establishment of a free
trade zone with the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia. It will

<HEADLINE> Mercosur, EU to Sign Free Trade Accord in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A free trade agreement
will be signed by the European Union (EU) and Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) in 1999, the first region-to-region free trade
accord, European Commission (EC) Vice President Manuel Marin said.
</P>
<P>
Marin made the remarks at the end of the Mercosur Economic
Summit in Sao Paulo on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Marin said that the agreement will be signed during the first
Latin American-European Union Summit, expected to be held during
the first half of 1999 in Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
The economic relations between EU and Latin American countries
have been closer and closer. The EC vice president said that the
Mercosur, the South America's largest and most important trade
bloc, has absorbed 70 percent of EU investment in the American
region. Marin said the trade volume between the two organizations
amounted to 50 billion U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will be the last of a two-stage process that
began December 1995 when the two regions signed a political and
economic cooperation accord in Madrid. The two blocs also proposed
to establish a free trade area, the largest one in the world,
before 2005.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur summit, the third of its kind since 1995, was
organized by the Geneva-based World Economic Forum and attended by
some 400 business leaders from five continents.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur groups Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay,
with Chile and Bolivia being its associate members.

<HEADLINE> Delegates of Taiwan Origin Expect Cross-Strait Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Delegates of Taiwan origin
attending the on-going 15th national Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) are confident of realizing peaceful
reunification of the motherland in the near future of the next
century.
</P>
<P>
They were deeply touched by the fact that there is a special
part in Jiang Zemin's report dealing with promoting the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Lin Liyun, an advisor to the All-China Federation of Taiwan
Compatriots (ACFTC), said that she noted the moment when a long
and warm applause punctuated Jiang Zemin's statement while
delivering his report: "With full determination, we are capable of
finding a final solution to the Taiwan question.... the complete
reunification of the motherland and the all-round rejuvenation of
the Chinese nation will certainly come true."
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong and its development after July 1 have
made our Taiwan compatriots to be more confident of the future,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Lee Teng-hui and his like can not turn the general trend of
realizing the reunification, she added. Taiwan will enjoy a
sustainable and stable economic growth so long as it combines its
future development with that in the interior areas, she said.
</P>
<P>
Yang Guoqing, vice president of the ACFTC, said that Hong
Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland has created a
favorable condition for the solution of Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Facts have shown, he added, the principle of "one country, two
systems" is a scientific conclusion and has been proved to be
entirely practicable.
</P>
<P>
The tendency of splittism in the island in recent years has
hindered the progress of the cause of peaceful reunification.
Nevertheless, he said, "we must solve the Taiwan issue in line
with the principle of "one country, two systems," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
China's basic principle on solving the Taiwan issue and the
eight-point proposition on developing the cross-strait relations
will remain unchanged, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to separate Taiwan from the motherland will doom to
failure, Yang said.
</P>
<P>
Being a native of Taiwan of the second generation, Chen Weiwen
expects to contribute to the promotion of bilateral cooperation
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"I have many relatives in Taiwan, and this encourages me to do
something special for promoting the peaceful reunification," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Guifen, a councillor of the ACFTC, said that the statement
of peaceful reunification in Jiang's report respects the history,
reality and the fundamental interests of Taiwan compatriots, who
are the mainstay to promote the peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
Ke Lianmei, vice president of the ACFTC, said the interior
areas of China is the home of 34,000 Taiwan compatriots, 8,000 of
whom live in Fujian, which faces Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,800 Taiwan-funded firms have been built in Fujian,
suggesting the bilateral cooperation is an irreversible trend, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan delegation has eight members, three of whom are
natives of Taiwan with the remainders the descendants of Taiwan
compatriots.

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 14)-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 14 (Xinhua) -- (At Xinhua's request, some
delegates to the ongoing 15th National Congress of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) write what they see, discuss and think
during the congress in the form of diary, which we think will
provide outsiders with some information about this major event.
The following diary, the third of its kind, was written by Xiong
Lei, senior editor of Xinhua News Agency. -- Editor)
</P>
<P>
When I received a copy of the report to be delivered by Comrade
Jiang Zemin minutes before the opening session of the 15th
National Party Congress on September 12, I was anxious to quickly
read it through. My curiosity prompted me to see where the
difference lies between the draft for soliciting opinions which I
read in July and the finalized version.
</P>
<P>
What moved me is that the suggestions by congress delegates
including me have been absorbed in the final version of the
report.
</P>
<P>
When I handed in my suggestions at that time, I guessed the
ideas by a small potato like me at the grassroots level would not
be taken into consideration. However, I was delighted and inspired
by the result.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the report to the 15th National Party
Congress has been revised for many times. Besides soliciting views
within the Party, the CPC Central Committee also held discussions
to listen to views from the non-Communist parties, leaders of the
All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and people with no
party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
All those who were asked for comments on the draft of the
report are of the opinion that the report was clear-cut and
hitting the point with new breakthroughs in theory. Meanwhile,
they also earnestly put forward many suggestions for improvements.
</P>
<P>
Before the congress, I and another congress delegate were
invited to a discussion by some young people from the organization
where I work. At the discussion, the young people expressed their
hope that the Party congress will serve as an example for
democracy. When I was asked for suggestions on the report, I
really felt a high-level inner-Party democracy, and such feeling
has augmented as the congress is proceeding.

<HEADLINE> Diary of Party Congress Delegates (Sept. 14)-2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I have been discussing the report by Jiang Zemin together with
many leading officials from different central government
ministries, renowned scholars and highly acclaimed elder comrades.
Many of them joined the Party when I was a kid.
</P>
<P>
However, we have enjoyed equality in discussions and exchanging
views irrespective of differences in ages and official rankings.
In such atmosphere, one cannot but feel exalted with broadened
vision.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin has expounded socialist democracy in his report. On
improving the system of democracy, Jiang Zemin said,"We shall
gradually establish a mechanism that will help the decision-makers
to go deep among the people to see their condition, adequately
reflect their will and pool their wisdom so that decision-making
will be more scientific, democratic and efficient and will reach a
higher level."
</P>
<P>
The remarks by Jiang mean that the CPC Central Committee has
attached great importance to developing democracy. The process of
preparing the report to the Party congress is a process to "go
deep among the people to see their condition, adequately reflect
their will and pool their wisdom."
</P>
<P>
After so many times of discussion and revision, the draft of
Jiang's report was considered excellent and congress delegates and
non-congress delegates spoke highly of the draft. However, it was
again submitted to congress delegates for comments and suggestions
before the report was finalized. This has reflected the CPC
Central Committee's respect for the democratic rights of Party
members.
</P>
<P>
Now the question for us is what kind of altitude we should take
toward democratic rights. If we are afraid of submitting our
proposals or giving out our suggestions only because we are just
small potatoes, we would give up our democratic rights. On the
other hand, it is misunderstanding of democracy if we hold that
100 percent of our proposals should be accepted and that otherwise
democracy would be "suppressed." It is by no means democratic if we
hold that one person's view can overweight 99 persons' views.
</P>
<P>
However, we must acknowledge that our democratic system is yet
to be improved. And therefore the report by Jiang Zemin to
congress stresses improving democratic system. If we all Party
members treasure our democratic rights while respecting the
majority's views and if each individual Party organization at
various levels can act according to the requirements set in the
report, we are really developing democracy.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Party congress has given me a chance to
experience high-level democratic life in the Party, which will be
unforgetable for me.

<HEADLINE> Pivotals Remain Subdued on BSE Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Pivotals generally remained
subdued on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) market last week mainly
due to the absence of aggressive buying by financial institutions
coupled with lack of local support.
</P>
<P>
The trading for the week began on a better note and share
prices led by Software and Pharma rallied, pushing the sensitive
index to over the 4,100 mark.
</P>
<P>
A few scrips finished with small gains while others closed with
small to modest losses. The volume of business remained below
normal.
</P>
<P>
The sensitive index on the BSE market improved from the
previous week level of 4,032.35 to 4,112.48 but dropped thereafter
to finish at 3,995.94 with the modest loss of 36.41 points. The
national index lost 14.80 points to 1,740.60 from the previous
week level of 1755.40.
</P>
<P>
The trading sentiment was affected considerably during the week
due to the weak trend in rupee against the US dollar. The
unfavorable statement by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram that the
country's fiscal deficit might overshoot the target of 4.5 percent
of the gross domestic product in 1997-98 had an adverse impact on
the market sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Military Seeks Civilian Help in Transport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Air Force is
seeking help from a civilian airline company in transporting
troops and supplies to and from Jaffna peninsula and other war
areas in the north and east of the country, local press reports
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force finds it difficult to meet the transportation
needs on its own, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted reliable sources as saying that there were
only four aircraft for the military to airlift troops and police
between Jaffna and Colombo, the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The military has therefore asked for help from the Lionair
Group, jointly owned by a Tamil businessman and a former air force
commander and which is the only domestic airline service permitted
to operate after the government banned all domestic airlines for
security purposes.
</P>
<P>
The military has to pay up to 3,000 U.S. dollars a day for the
transport service.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Lionair, the government also has to pay shipping
agencies large sums of money for transporting materiel and troops
between the war areas and Colombo.

BONN, September 13 (Xinhua) -- German Steffi Graf said on
Saturday that she would skip the New York Masters because of an

Graf, seven-times Wimbledon champion, said she would not put

In June, Graf had an operation to her injuried knee and had

Graf, currently ranked just seventh in the world, was still

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 14 (Xinhua) -- Chief Executive of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Tung Chee Hwa returned
here this morning after concluding his first official visit to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
During the well-knit visit, Tung met with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, leading political figures, business leaders and prominent
think-tanks.
</P>
<P>
"We talked on a whole range of issues and they all
congratulated us on the return of Hong Kong to China and how
smooth everything has been since," Tung told a press conference at
the airport.
</P>
<P>
On some people's concern about next year's first Legislative
Council election, Tung said: "I assured them that we in Hong Kong
are just as much committed to democracy and that we will have a
very fair and open election next year and that we have mapped out
through the Basic Law the political evolution over the next 10
years."
</P>
<P>
There are people (in the U.S.) who understand and support the
election, Tung said. However, "There are some group of people who
just would not support us."
</P>
<P>
"But the important thing is to remember that I did not go there
to ask for their agreement or approval. This is Hong Kong's own
business. It is our own responsibility... We in Hong Kong and Hong
Kong alone can take this decision."
</P>
<P>
Like his first overseas mission as head of post-handover Hong
Kong, which took him to Malaysia and Singapore earlier this month,
the U.S. tour was aimed at explaining that Hong Kong is in good
shape after July 1, while at the same time enhancing the economic
and trade relations between the two trading partners.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Peace Talks Still in Dark as IRA Refuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 13 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair attempted to bring the loyalist parties back to next week's
all-party peace talks on Northern Ireland's future by pledging to
eject Sinn Fein if the IRA broke its cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The IRA attempted to demolish the foundations of the talk on
Thursday by rejecting the Mitchell principles of democracy and
non-violence and vowing to maintain its arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the eve of today's crucial Ulster Unionist Party's
(UUP) executive meeting, Tony Blair said that Sinn Fein and the
IRA were inextricably linked and that, if the republicans breached
the Mitchell principles, "they will be out of the talks".
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister also declared that "there must be no change
in the constitutional status of Northern Ireland without the
consent of the majority of people in Northern Ireland".
</P>
<P>
Blair said that he desperately wanted the Unionists to join the
talks. It is now widely expected that the UUP executive will opt
to stay, while opposing face-to-face talks with Sinn Fein, and
will give David Trimble, the party leader, flexibility to proceed
as he sees fit.
</P>
<P>
UUP officials said they believed that the IRA interview in An
Phoblacht, Republican News, was a ploy to provoke a Unionist
boycott, but insisted that the party would not fall into that
trap.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein was similarly unimpressed. Michael Brown, its prisons
spokesman, said "Any measures which improve the conditions of
prisoners have to be welcomed." But the measures were extremely
limited.
</P>
<P>
Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, insisted that he wanted
inclusive talks, and urged Unionist leaders to join Sinn Fein at
the talks next week.
</P>
<P>
However, Adams said he signed the Mitchell principles on behalf
of Sinn Fein alone, and again claimed that the IRA was a separate
organization.
</P>
<P>
At this circumstances, some observers here believe that none of
the five Unionist and loyalist parties is likely to be at the
negotiating table next week.
</P>
<P>
After 18 months of division, there are now signs that Unionists
are uniting in opposition to what they see as a process weighted
against the majority population in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> Slovenian, Croatian Premiers Satisfied with Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Both Slovenian Prime Minister
Janez Drnovsek and his Croatian counterpart Zlatko Matesa voiced
satisfaction over their one-hour meeting in Slovenia today.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from the meeting in the Slovenian town of Portoroz
where the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA) member
states are holding a two-day conference, Matesa said they
discussed the Krsko nuclear plant, the establishment of a free
trade zone and the entire border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian premier expressed optimism about the fact that
some of the questions would be very soon solved and the remaining
ones would not hinder the development of overall bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
Drnovsek said he was also optimistic. During the talks he and
Matesa tries to seek rational and pragmatic solutions to the
issues and an agreement on the Krsko power plant could soon be
reached.

<HEADLINE> Good Newspapers Have Bright Future: Media Barons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- Well-written and well-edited
newspapers have a bright future despite a war from Internet,
media barons said.
</P>
<P>
Computer screens are useful, but "reading casually what is
scrolled across a screen for more than a few minutes is
unspeakably irritating", Canada's Conrad Black was quoted as
saying by local media today.
</P>
<P>
"Have any of those who have been most vocal in tolling the
death knell of the printed word ever tried to read lengthily off a
screen? I suspect not," he told a recent meeting in Calgary on the
future of newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Tabloid newspapers, which are read for entertainment more than
news, may be vulnerable to electronic competition, but newspapers
read for information may be treated differently, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the content is good, the means of publication is secondary,
Black stressed.
</P>
<P>
However, Black said, newspaper companies will have to adapt to
changing public tastes.
</P>
<P>
Dean Singleton, president of MediaNews Group of the United
States, noted that despite falling circulation in the 1980s,
newspaper readership remains high and newspapers still have the
lion's share of the advertising budget in most markets.
</P>
<P>
It is still difficult for any industry to make money on the
Internet, Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
Internet advertising will account for about 300 million U.S.
dollars in the United States this year, while newspaper
advertising is expected to approach 45 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: British Monarchy Questioned in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 13 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian cabinet minister
has broken the silence and openly called for an end to the British
queen's role as head of state in the country.
</P>
<P>
Industry Minister John Manley said he favors a radical change
to Canada's constitutional landscape, including abolishing the
senate and ending the monarchy's role in Canadian affairs.
</P>
<P>
"If we don't soon engage the discussion, the British will have
done away with the monarchy before Canadians do," Manley is
reported to have told a Vancouver newspaper this week.
</P>
<P>
"My own personal view is that it's probably time for us to
say,`It's been a great institution.' Perhaps on the death or
demise of the incumbent queen, maybe we should have a new
institution that maybe reflects Canada's priorities."
</P>
<P>
As the new millennium approaches, "surely it's time we took on
some vision of the future," the minister suggested.
</P>
<P>
With the remarks, Manley became the first cabinet minister to
make his personal views known on the future of the royal family in
Canada.
</P>
<P>
Today's local reports suggested that Manley uncorked the
long-bottled debate about the monarchy after he sought and
received approval from Prime Minister Jean Chretien's office.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that the ruling Liberal Party of Canada is
testing the waters, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy told
reporters last week that he would welcome a debate on the
monarchy's role in Canada when he went to London to attend Prince
Diana's funeral.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Prime Minister Chretien office denied that the Liberal
government has any intention of engaging in another constitutional
debate.
</P>
<P>
"We have enough on our plate," said chief spokesman Peter
Donolo. "It's not an issue in Quebec any more. It was an issue
there 30 years ago, but it hasn't really been since then."
</P>
<P>
However, the issue could be in a position to help Canada's
national unity. Ending Canada's ties with the British monarchy
would sell well in Quebec, some argued.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted last year found that 67 percent of Quebecers
favored the abolition of Canada's connection with the British
queen.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, 47 percent wanted the ties ended while 44
percent wanted it preserved.
</P>
<P>
Liberal MP Mick Discepola of Quebec said he would take part in
a debate on the monarchy if there is evidence it could advance the
cause of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Bloc Quebecois MP Claude Bachand, the party's citizenship
critic, said he was "quite delighted" by Manley's comments.
</P>
<P>
The monarchy is "something of the past and it should be
changed," he said. "The powers should be in the hands of the
people who are elected in Canada or in the provinces."
</P>
<P>
Yet, Reform MP Jim Abbott of British Columbia is less
enthusiastic about the debate.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have been far too ready in Canada to throw away our
heritage," he said. "The monarchy, in my judgement, is a very
important part of our Canadian heritage and who we are."
</P>
<P>
Manley's views encountered the strongest criticism from the
Monarchist League of Canada, which claims 17,000 members.
</P>
<P>
"It's not helpful to have ministers of the Crown to suggest
such fundamental change in our constitution when we are not able
to agree on the status of Quebec," said the league's chairman John
Aimers.
</P>
<P>
"To include the monarchy in the national debate at this point
would seem both irresponsible and contrary to the wishes of
Canadians," he argued.
</P>
<P>
Yet, there is an example for Canada to follow. Australia, a
constitutional monarchy like Canada, is now in the midst of its
own monarchy debate.
</P>
<P>
The South Pacific country will hold a convention early next
year to decide whether to drop its association with the British
queen.
</P>
<P>
A slight majority of Australians believe that the country
should become a republic with an Australian head of state.
